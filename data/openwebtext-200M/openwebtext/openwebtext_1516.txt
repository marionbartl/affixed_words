Month of Festivals , Bars and Great Beer – Vegas , Portland , Seattle , Victoria
The last month has been a whirlwind of travel for various reasons , work , research and pleasure with a mixed bag of results for beer related information .
Seattle , Portland , Las Vegas , Seattle , and Victoria BC have been my recent stops , which I have to say I ’m sick of cheap motels for a little while .
First weekend at home in this period , and no 11 am checkouts after drinking till 2 am the night before on 10 - 15 % beer .
Seattle is a city dominated by Boeing and Microsoft , but somehow has a great sub-culture of beer and wine loving palates .
Portland is the home of craft beer without much question due to having some of the top craft brewers in their city limits , and bars that you ’d only wished for .
Las Vegas is not a beer city , but one controlled by the big boys of beer , and it appeared 3/ 4 of the people were holding metallic Bud Light Cans .
Victoria BC is known as a brewpub town as they have several brewpubs within the town itself that is sheltered by public servants and tourists .
Seattle is a great city with lots of people from elsewhere , whether they came for school / work or other things and ended up staying .
The two events recently were the Washington Cask Festival and Brouwers Hard Liver that is a Barley Wine fest .
The major draw is the few bars that serve great beer in this city are hard to beer for any other city in the US .
Brouwers is a 1st class institution that is filled with not only great bar tenders , but great locals that know their beers .
Uber tavern is one of my favorite bars in the world , and must be experienced .
There is also a new bar called Naked City that is a quality beer bar in its own right , and if your after the best Washington Beers in one stop , this is your stop .
Portland is one of the oddest cities in the US , as there are highways that seem to run through the middle of it , and its based on a North , South , East West code of direction in the city .
TO be honest out of my 20 odd trips there I still get confused as to which is South / North , and I consider myself good with directions .
Saravesa and Baileys Taproom , along with Widmer are some of my favorite stops , and I still want to spend a whole evening drinking at each of these bars , but with often little time and many stops its quite hard to do .
I still find it strange with the people in this city , as people move here from across the country for the beer .
No other beer stop in my life has that been the case , but in Portland its all about the beer .
Though there is a wine region at their door step , and traveling through it , I came to the realisation that Locals Drink beer , and Wine Lovers outside of Portland who can afford the Pinot drink Oregon Wine .
No wine bars seemed to have any decent Oregon Pinot by the glass .
Las Vegas was a pleasure trip !!
I cannot honestly tell the tax man that I was there for the Beer .
As much as I love the strip for the Americana of it all , there was nothing there to drink .
Years ago I remembered drinking Sierra Nevada for the first time , but not this time .
There were 3 considered Beer bars on the stip , and unless you live in a swamp in Kentucky , it was pretty forgettable .
Though rated highly on some of the ratings sites , and given rave reviews by some , I guess when you have just come from Portland , it should be missed .
Pour 24 in New York New York was in the middle of the Food Court .
It felt like you were in a nightclub , and every beer off tap that I tasted was stale .
At $ 9 a pop it was pretty poor form but there gimic was that FROZEN area with taps .
The bar in Monte Carlo had about 40 - 60 beers on tap , though the list was wrong , the bartender would n’t tell me what else was on tap .
Bad service in bars in Vegas is not a shock , especially on this trip .
Service was shithouse across the board .
Having settled on a Widmer Deadlift Imperial IPA , it was almost the highlight of the trip , aside from costing $ 11 .
Due to having no service , and no idea what was on tap other than trying to read the tap handles , I give this bar a half a point more than Pour 24 .
The Burger Shack in Mandalay was the only promising bar , with a good list , but when you live on the west coast , it would only be considered not bad if we ’re comparing bars here .
But when your in the middle of the desert with only BUD LIGHT on tap everywhere , its like a mirage .
The time we got into the bar , the bar area was full , and the bartender seemed to be ignoring not just us , but everyone .
Upon coming back from Old Vegas I spotted a liquor store for which I found Goose Island Bourbon County Stout ( 13 % ) and some Stone Ruination IPA in bomber bottles .
These beers helped in a pretty barron wasteland of beer in Vegas .
Victoria BC is the capital of the Province of BC , and is a historic English style town that caters to public servants and cruise ships on their way to Alaska .
This trip was about watching some mates play soccer , so not a beer trip , but a trip in which beer could be tried .
Though the town has Spinnakers , Swans , and Canoe Brewpubs , so there was some selection to try out .
Spinnakers
Pub is one of the first brewpubs in Canada , and is a very common pub for festivals , and has a great reputation amongst the beer crowds .
This was my 1st stop for lunch on day and its a great pub atmosphere , shitty service , and about 10 - 12 taps of their own beer off the top of my head .
There was nothing outstanding about the beer , or food , but I understand why they brew that style , as its quite a tourist destination due to overlooking the water .
To call the beer watered down , without anything that jumped out as outstanding is what I will say .
Swans Brewpub was the highlight with their scotch ale , stout , and raspberry beer .
Canoe Brewpub is a restaurant that produces not bad beer , but the service was like something out of the stone age .
Why employ disgruntled bar staff that do n’t care ?
The beers at the Brouwers Barley Fest are reviewed in an earlier post , with the Washington Cask festival a great festival for new breweries , and the big two from this year were Black Raven in Redmond and Fremont Brewing in Fremont .
Washington is about to pass laws that will increase taxes for Macro Beers , which exclude micros , which is a huge sign of how seriously the state loves their beer .
Low point was the sad beer bars in Vegas , and reminding me that 98 % of the population still drink the big brand box beers .
Craft is growing but the dominant big names are still the big players ..
Seattle Beer Week & Vancouver Beer
Week are both approaching in May .
Great events are penned in for both cities that will highlight craft beer with food , tastings and various events .
It would be great to see some of the Washington Beer crowd north for some good beer events .
Voss is a planet of more questions than answers .
Discovered by accident shortly after the Treaty of Coruscant , its rocky plateaus , unspoiled peaks and verdant forests were at first thought to be inhabited only by Gormak , a tech - savvy but pre-space flight species of extremely hostile natives .
When the second , much less populous species on Voss made itself known , however , the galaxy was thrown into turmoil and the war almost restarted .
Primarily isolated on one tall peak and outnumbered by millions of their enemies , the non-Gormak natives use the same name for themselves as for their world : Voss .
Locked in a losing war with an implacable enemy that sees them as a violation of the natural order , the hard - pressed Voss have survived centuries of Gormak assaults through the disciplined training of their Commandos , the placement and fortifications of their mountain city and the infallible guidance of the Voss Mystics .
The Voss Mystics are Force users of incredible power .
Both the Sith and Jedi agree on this one point .
The Voss do not .
Voss know nothing of the Force and are uninterested in outsider opinions .
Mystics have visions that are never wrong .
The Voss follow these visions and survive .
When the Sith Empire schemed to conquer Voss , the Republic sought to defend the planet -- but the Mystics foresaw both plots and in the end a fleet disappeared , an Empire was humbled and two mighty powers came to Voss peacefully to win favor .

Opera has become Kazakhstan ‘s most popular web browser in the country , because it allows users to bypass internet censorship .
According to Web Analytics firm StatCounter , the browser increased its market share to 32 per cent in March .
Last year , Kazakhstan introduced a law allowing local courts to block access to web sites whose content has been deemed “ illegal ” .
The new edition of Opera introduced last year , Opera 10 , allows users to view otherwise inaccessible web pages using its Opera Turbo feature designed to speed up browsing over slow connections .
Minister 's global warming nursery rhyme adverts banned for overstating the risks
Two government advertisements which use nursery rhymes to warn of the dangers of climate change have been banned for exaggerating the threat .
Commissioned by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband , the adverts are based on children ’s poems Jack and Jill and Rub - A - Dub - Dub and assert that climate change will cause flooding and drought .
The Advertising Standards Agency ( ASA ) ruled the adverts – which attracted 939 complaints - made exaggerated claims which went beyond mainstream scientific consensus .
Banned :
The claims made by the adverts were not supported by science , the ASA ruled
One advert read : ‘ Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water .
There was none as extreme weather due to climate change had caused a drought . ’
Beneath this was written : ‘ Extreme weather conditions such as flooding , heat waves and storms will become more frequent and intense . ’
The other read : ‘ Rub a dub dub , three men in a tub – a necessary course of action due to flash flooding caused by climate change . ’
It added : ‘ Climate change is happening .
Temperature and sea levels are rising .
Extreme weather events such as storms , floods and heat waves will become more frequent and intense .
If we carry on at this rate , life in 25 years could be very different . ’
Embarrassment : Ed Miliband , who commissioned the adverts promised to more accurately reflect scientific uncertainty about global warming in future
The watchdog stated the Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) should not publish the adverts again , ruling that the text accompanying the rhymes should have been phrased more tentatively .
Using reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) as reference , the ASA determined it was not possible to make such definitive statements about Britain ’s future climate , the Times reported .
As a result the adverts were found to have broken the code on substantiation , truthfulness and environmental claims .
The ASA said : ‘ All statements about future climate were modeled on predictions , which the IPCC report itself stated still involved uncertainties in the magnitude and timing , as well as regional details , of predicted climate change . ’
The watchdog found that other elements of the campaign , including a TV and cinema advert in which a father read his daughter a bedtime story about a world affected by climate change , did not breach its guidelines .
Mr Miliband said his department had been ‘ comprehensibly vindicated ’ by the ASA but promised to more accurately reflect scientific uncertainty about global warming in future campaigns .
The ruling comes amidst the fall - out from the leak of more than 1,000 emails and documents from the University of East Anglia ’s controversial Climatic Research Unit .
The emails , which dealt a severe blow to the credibility of environmental science , were seized upon by global warming skeptics as evidence that academics were massaging the figures .
Since the leak , belief in global warming has fallen from 41 per cent to 26 per cent .

Hordes of hired K Street guns are in high demand as President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats seek to implement grand legislative plans .
And a Center for Responsive Politics review of lobbying reports recently filed with the Senate Office of Public Records indicates companies , trade associations , unions and other groups spent nearly $ 1 billion on lobbying during the first three months of 2010 .
That puts the current year on an early pace toward exceeding the record amount of money — about $ 3.47 billion — spent last year on federal lobbying efforts .
The $ 903 million spent between January 1 and March 31 is larger than overall lobbying expenses in three out of four quarters last year , and it represents an 11 percent increase from the $ 811 million spent on lobbying during the first three months of 2009 .
Special interests spent about $ 19 million per day on lobbying efforts , the Center for Responsive Politics estimates , based on the number of calendar days that either the House or Senate was officially in session .
The staggering amount spent between January and March actually represents of about a 7 percent decrease from the nearly $ 970 million spent during the final quarter of 2009 when major legislation on health care , Wall Street reform and other issues experienced votes in either the House or Senate .
Nonetheless , business associations , health interests , energy companies and Wall Street firms all still invested more than $ 123 million a piece on lobbying efforts during the first three months of 2010 .
The miscellaneous business sector , composed of business associations such as the high - spending U.S. Chamber of Commerce , led the way with $ 139 million .
This is about a third more than these groups spent on lobbying during the first three months of 2009 .
As OpenSecrets Blog previously reported , the Chamber was also the top - spending client during the first quarter , dropping $ 30.9 million on its lobbying efforts .
The Chamber ’s lofty numbers are in part attributable to its reporting of federal , state - level and grassroots lobbying activity , whereas some entities only report federal lobbying work .
Next up behind business groups ?
Companies and special interest groups classified by the Center as part of the health sector .
These organizations spent about $ 138 million during the first quarter , when Congress passed and the president signed legislation designed to improve health insurance coverage and cover millions of Americans who are presently without health insurance .
This represents a 7 percent increase in lobbying expenditures from the first quarter of 2009 , and this quarterly sum is larger than the amount this sector spent on lobbying in all but the final quarter of 2009 .
Here are the 10 clients in this sector that spent the most money on lobbying during the first quarter .
( Note : Some lobbying clients may be classified as part of multiple sectors , such as Blue Cross / Blue Shield .
Therefore , money reported here is only money linked to subsidiaries within this sector .

The energy and natural resources sector ranks as the next highest spender , with at least $ 128 million spent on lobbying services between January and March .
This sum represents the highest quarterly expenditures on lobbying during any point during the Obama administration .
This figure amounts to an 18 percent increase from fourth - quarter lobbying expenditures and a 25 percent increase above what these groups spent during the first three months of 2009 .
Major legislation addressing energy and climate change issues passed the House last June but has lagged in the Senate .

( CNN ) --
The former beauty queen stared into the camera , but this was no pageant or performance .
She looked frail and thin , and her hair was rumpled .
But Eva Markvoort smiled weakly .
" Hello to the world at large , " she said in the video .
" To my blog , to my friends , to everyone .
I have some news today .
It 's kinda tough to hear , but I can say it with a smile . "
Propped in a hospital bed , Markvoort sat surrounded by her family .
" My life is ending . "
Markvoort had cystic fibrosis , an incurable disease that causes mucus to accumulate in the lungs .
For nearly four years , she narrated an unvarnished blog about life with a terminal disease .
Even when it appeared unlikely that she would receive a second double lung transplant , the 25 - year - old continued to chronicle life on her blog .
The public sharing of one 's last thoughts is a way to acknowledge that the end is near , but it also destigmatizes death for others , said medical experts who work with terminally ill patients .
In the Internet age , many people reflect on their lives through video , personal blogs and larger websites such as CaringBridge.org , where people who have major health events connect and share online .
" What we 're seeing over the last decade , we are gradually moving from a culture that had become during the 20th century , very closed about death , " said Dr. Chris Feudtner , research director of Palliative Care Services at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania .
A cultural shift has occurred , he said , referring to columnists and Randy Pausch , a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University , who discussed their impending deaths with frankness .
Pausch 's last lecture , urging students to fearlessly pursue their dreams , went viral on YouTube in 2007 , getting more than 11 million views .
Their line of thinking may be , " I 'm still alive .
I do n't want to be closed .
I want connection .
I want to be able to share what I 'm learning on this journey , " Feudtner said .
Bloggers like Miles Levin , an 18 - year - old who had a rare soft - tissue cancer and died in 2007 , and Michelle Lynn Mayer , a 39 - year - old mother who had scleroderma and died in 2008 , shared their thoughts on living and dying , too .
" We all tend to be open via video , blog or Facebook about what we do every day .
It 's hardly surprising that openness extends to people 's last days or weeks , " said Dr. David Cassarett , author of the book " Last Acts , " about end - of - life decisions .
These bloggers , Cassarett said , are helping the rest of us through largely uncharted territory .
He used a sports analogy to explain .
" Hardcore bicycle riders ride in packs , and there 's a tradition , " he said .
" The one in the front points out hazards in the road to those who come behind .
It 's both an opportunity to be helpful , if you 're in front .
You spot sewer grates , so others can avoid accidents . "
Blogs like Markvoort 's could be acting similarly , he said .
They do n't shy away from the ugliness and brutality of the dying process .
" They 're not just about hope but also about despair .
That is , they 're telling us not just what we want to hear but also what we need to hear , " Cassarett wrote .
Markvoort started her blog in 2006 because hospitalized patients with cystic fibrosis were isolated because of infection .
Alone in her hospital room at Vancouver General Hospital after visiting hours , she sought to connect with other patients by finding them online .
The blog 's name 65 _ RedRoses , originated from her childhood inability to pronounce cystic fibrosis ; she , as have many other children with the disease , called it " 65 roses . "
Markvoort added the word red because it was her favorite color .
Markvoort was the subject of a Canadian documentary also called " 65 _RedRoses . "
It showed her harrowing experiences with the disease : violent coughing , vomiting , IVs , the painful procedures that made her scream .
The documentary followed her as she waited for a double lung transplant and as she formed online friendships with two American girls who have cystic fibrosis .
The film ends on a happy note : Markvoort got her lung transplant and appeared to be on the road to recovery .
But less than two years later , her body began rejecting the organs .
Her lung capacity dwindled , and every breath became laborious .
Sometimes , her blog posts were raw , filled with " episodes of projectile vomiting , hours of gasping for breath , waves of nausea lulling out into hours of sleepiness . "
" I 'm drowning in the medications , " she wrote .
" I ca n't breathe . "
Initially , Markvoort 's mother , Janet Brine , said , her daughter 's openness made her feel uncomfortable .
" We connect differently than your generation .
I 'm part of the digital world , " Brine recalled her daughter telling her .
The constant theme in Markvoort 's blog is love .
In a video entry where she talks about her impending death , Markvoort said : " I think I 'm very lucky , because I 've loved more than you could possibly think , could possibly imagine .
So I 'm celebrating that : celebrating my life . "
Markvoort grew up in a suburb of Vancouver , Canada .
Girly to the core , she dyed her hair red and loved outrageous fashion like pink boas , polka dot dresses and striped knee socks .
She was crowned a beauty queen ( of New Westminster , a suburb of Vancouver ) and attended University of Victoria , hoping to become an actress .
But she could n't pursue that career because of her unpredictable health .
" But she has found other ways to have that artistic outlet , and writing the blog is one of them , " her mother said .
She championed cystic fibrosis awareness and organ donations .
From Los Angeles to Poland , letters , stuffed animals and cards poured into her hospital room .
" I felt so selfish when I stumbled across your [ LiveJournal ] on here , because I 've been smoking cigarettes for years , taking my lungs for granted .
You helped me quit the worst habit I 've ever had , " one wrote .
When Markvoort was too frail , she dictated blog posts to her friends and family .
" She had already processed the concept of dying , " her mother said .
" And for her , she came to terms with it quite quickly .
For her it was like , ' Oh , my gosh , I do n't know how much time I have .
I have things to say . '
There was a sense of urgency on her part . "
Sometimes , her posts have no words , just pictures of her and her loved ones , with their eyes crossed , tongues sticking out and comical gestures .
" This is the end of my life , but it 's not the end of my love , " Markvoort said in a video entry .
She died the morning of March 27 .
In the same style that she had allowed her readers ( who were often strangers ) into her life , Markvoort 's family plans to hold a memorial service that will run in a live stream on her blog at 7 p.m. ET Friday .
" She indicated that she thought it would be a cool idea if whatever we did , was made available for her online blogging community , " her mother said .
Twitter has never been overly forthright with their development schedule .
Updates to the platform , be it the web interface , the APIs , or what have you came as they did , and that was that .
No more .
Today at Chirp , Twitter ’s first developer conference the company bucked its old habits , and laid out its best guess technology roadmap .
Where is the company off to in the coming months ?
We now have a rough sketch .
There are a number of major changes and new features , some of which we have already covered , and some that we have n’t .
Hit the jump and let ’s get started .
Proximity
If you were not aware of it , Twitter considers itself to be a largely mobile service .
Sure , during its adolescence it grew mostly on its website , but now with the plethora of smartphones Twitter is focusing on its mobile side .
Today Twitter began to discuss “ points of interest , ” that are going to allow tweets to associate tweets with locations , and not just raw latitude and longitude data .
You can tie a tweet to a place .
Everyone is noticing the similarity of this to what Foursquare and Galla are doing .
Twitter had this to say “ [ points of interest are a ] way to see where a tweet is coming from but also a way to read all the tweets coming from specific nearby landmarks . ”
That is going to make Twitter more personal , and more interesting .
As we will see , more data more relevance , or as @ Rsarver said “ proximity is a proxy for relevancy . ”
User Streams
If you thought that PubSubHubBub was fast , wait until you see User Streams , Twitter ’s upcoming uber - real - time feed .
Imagine no lag whatsoever between when I tweet , and when it shows up in your desktop Tweetdeck .
This is the Google Wave of tweets .
Even better , it is going to come with no rate limits to let everyone use it as they will .
No more running out of API calls , hallelujah .
Assuming that Twitter can handle the load that this will add to their hardware , this is going to make Twitter feel much more like the final version of FriendFeed : information overload .
If you are familiar with Clicky ’s Spy feature , it is like this but for the updates you want .
And is not just for updates , but also for your complete social graph of DMs , @s , Favorite tweets and so forth .
Twitter is only letting developers play with this for a few days as a trial , so we have to wait , but when this does come out it is going to be a massive upgrade to the basic Twitter experience .
Annotations
We covered this in detail here , but the short version is that Twitter is going to let developers and applications tag tweets with metadata .
What type of metadata ?
Any metadata that developers want .
Twitter decided to let developers decide how to handle the next big thing in metadata .
What is even more important is Twitter ’s decision to let developers pull the data back out of Twitter , once it has been sent it .
More or less , this is a read write API for calling and tagging anything .
Twitter is showing its developers love by trusting them completely .
Well done , Twitter .
@ Anywhere
If you missed our coverage , check it out here .
@ Anywhere is live , and out in the wild .
Bringing deep Twitter integration to a plethora of websites , @ Anywhere is going to bring hovercards , tweets , and other Twitter features inside of a publisher ’s website .
If you know Facebook connect , this is Twitter ’s answer .
Communication / Developer Relations
Throughout the conference today , Twitter has stressed communication .
“ Email me , get ahold of me , ” they said from the stage .
Twitter seems to understand that it was built , and will continue to be built by non-corporate developers .
With that in mind , Twitter is launching a developer website , and is working to have more open and active discussions with developers as to what they need , what they want , what they hate , and what needs to change right away .
Twitter could do nothing smarter than this .
If they want to stay ahead of their competition , and continue to be the darling that they are to all of our hearts , this is the golden goose they need to keep fed .
Conclusions
Twitter has had an amazing half day so far .
They are launching and showing previews of amazing new capabilities and features .
The company has been putting its bankroll to good use .
If you had become a cynic on Twitter in the last few months , today should have worked wonders to make you a believer again .
If you feel that we missed anything large enough to mention , let us know in the comments and we ’ll add it in .
As things are announced , we ’ll update this post .

A man has been warned he faces a custodial sentence after pleading guilty to possession of what prosecutors described as " extreme porn " at Mold Crown Court last week .
Campaigners against the extreme porn law are now waiting with some concern to see what the court decides when the accused , Andrew Robert Holland , of Coedpoeth , Wrexham , Clwyd returns for sentencing in April .
The case started out as high farce .
Following a raid by North Wales police last summer , Holland was charged with two offences under ss.63 - 68 of the Criminal Justice Act 2008 .
The first charge centred on an allegation that he had in his possession a clip featuring human - animal sex .
This was dropped after the prosecution discovered that the animal in question – a tiger – was actually a CGI - generated spoof , modelled loosely on Tony the Tiger of Frosties fame , and that the tiger finished off his sex act by turning to camera and saying " That beats doing adverts for a living " .
The second and more serious charge alleged that Holland had downloaded and viewed a six - second clip of human - on - human extreme porn .
According to Holland , this was sent to him as a joke - he viewed it just once , but made the mistake of not getting round to deleting it .
At the Crown Court in Mold , last week , before Mr Justice Medland , Holland pleaded guilty to a charge of possession , in the expectation that this would count as mitigation and lead to a lighter sentence .
Holland told the Register last week that he was therefore shocked in the extreme to be told to return home pending reports – and that a custodial sentence was " likely " .
If this does indeed occur , then the worst fears of campaigners against this law seem set to be realised .
This is a stand - alone charge – almost the first of its kind .
For Consenting Adult Action Network ( CAAN ) , National Convenor Clair Lewis said : " Assuming this involves an image of consenting adults – which we believe it to do – we find the idea of sending someone to prison at all for the mere act of possessing an image to be disgraceful and most likely a breach of Human Rights .
" We will be investigating further and if the authorities are as unreasonable as they appear , we will take further action . " ®

Dem Sen. Rockefeller
On Obama : " He 's Beginning To Be Not Believable To Me "
" He says ' I 'm for clean coal , ' and then he says it in his speeches , but he does n't say it in here , " said Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia .
" And he does n't say it in the minds of my own people .
And he 's beginning to not be believable to me . "
Then she found '' Steve ' ' , a solo operator online .
'' I was very lucky , '' she says , having now a better idea of what is out there ( not much ) .
Steve sent her a picture .
They exchanged texts .
She wanted to ask all sorts of questions about how it would work , but did n't feel confident enough to have those sorts of conversations .
So she leapfrogged her doubts entirely and arranged for him to come to her house .
'' It was nerve - racking but I was also excited .
The anticipation , thinking , ' Oh goodness , what am I doing ? ' '' she says .
'' When I opened the door , I just went ' phew ' .
He was gorgeous , beautifully presented and he made me feel at ease .
He worked very hard to make me feel comfortable . ''
That encounter resulted in Eva and a friend setting up an exclusive escort business , My Male Companion , for professional women like themselves who were well - off , but stressed or time - poor and wanted male company and sex on their own terms .
About 40 per cent of jobs do n't involve sex ; the clients just want the male company .
For Eva , hiring Steve was an overwhelmingly positive experience that she does n't regret .
But she knows that she is totally kicking against societal and possibly biological norms .
Some men pay for sex , always have , probably always will .
But women ?
It 's a fraught issue , especially as prostitution is one of the most divisive issues among feminists .
Dr Lauren Rosewarne , a lecturer in public policy and sex researcher at the University of Melbourne , likes the idea of women taking control of their sexuality , of women owning their desires , but is n't sure that women paying for sex is progress .
'' It still comes back to this idea of commodifying bodies and that 's not gender specific , '' Rosewarne says .
Author Melinda Tankard Reist , an activist who campaigns against abortion , sexual exploitation and the sexualisation of children , says hiring prostitutes is fundamentally a male preserve , which is why we ' ' d o n't see huge line - ups of women wanting to buy the bodies of boys and men ' ' .
Another reason has been that women have n't been in a position to treat men that way .
'' Women generally do n't have the time or money that men have , nor the sense of social entitlement to the bodies of other people , '' Reist says .
She thinks that is changing , but that it is not a positive development .
'' It 's really the democratisation of objectification .
Buying and selling male or female bodies for sex will always be reducing them to a means to an end ; a denial of their full humanity . ''
Eva also believes attitudes are changing , and see Rosewarne and Reist 's misgivings as part of the old - fashioned mindset that restricts women from getting their needs met .
Although Eva was thrilled with her secret adventure with Steve , she was hesitant to tell anyone about it .
Despite Sex and the City capturing some of the Zeitgeist of what being a liberated woman today means - if you 're white , educated , physically attractive and well - off - Eva argues that in reality women tend not to talk about their sexual needs .
Eva finally confessed to her friend '' Julie ' ' , and was more relieved than she expected that her friend did n't recoil in horror .
Julie 's reaction was positive : '' That 's great !
How much better is that ?
You did n't have to go out all night , did n't have guys sleazing on you all night , the whole internet dating . ''
Was it just about the sex ?
Eva said no .
'' We sat on the lounge and he held my hand and stroked my hair and we talked .
I enjoyed that as much as the sex , though the sex was great . ''
Eva and Julie figured that they were pretty normal , intelligent women and if they were interested in being able to have company or sex on their terms , others would , too , and that male escorts for women could be normalised or at least destigmatised .
My Male Companion has up to eight male escorts working in Melbourne , Sydney and Brisbane .
In two years of operation , Eva says hundreds of women have used the service , and they are getting so many men wanting to work for them that they have started charging for a full interview .
Eva agrees to interview only about one in 10 applicants .
Eva says it 's difficult to find a good male escort because it 's not enough to be attractive physically .
'' The perception of a lot of men who come into this work is it 's all about sex , but it 's not .
It 's about making the women feel special , '' Eva says .
She needs more Melbourne - based men and older men , in their late 30s and 40s .
'' The whole cougar thing is making women more sensitive [ saying ] ' I do n't want to be seen with someone who looks significantly younger than me ' . ''
So what kind of woman pays for sex ?
Eva says most clients are in their 30s and 40s though some are older .
Most are attractive , professional , normally confident women who go to water when they contemplate hiring a male escort .
A lot of Eva and Julie 's time is spent reassuring women and answering lots of questions .
She blames this on the fact that women who are very open about their sexual needs or sexuality are '' still labelled and judged ' ' .
'' We help women feel good about their choices , give them confidence that if this is something they want to do , they 're allowed to , '' Eva says .
What she loves about the business is that so many clients who have agonised over it , contact her afterwards to say it was amazing .
'' The feedback I get most is ' that was a whole lot of fun ' . ''
But they 're not about to tell their friends .
'' We 're still very much in the closet .
I think women want to do this , but they 're like me , it might take them six months thinking about it before they do it . ''
Eva and Julie , who live in Sydney , are now thinking of '' coming out ' ' , which they are certain would result in business soaring .
But they are worried about the implications for their children , the fact that both of them are single mothers , and that going public might make it impossible to keep their current professional jobs .
'' Even though what we 're trying to do … is an exciting concept , I am obviously conscious of the reality - society 's situation - that if I do come out there will be some judgments and possible repercussions , '' Eva says .
'' There 's a part of me that would really like to come out because I love the idea and would like to see more women act upon and make choices for themselves … to have the same freedoms that men have . ''
Veteran lobbyist for the sex industry Robbie Swan says there are no brothels for women and few male escorts aimed only at women because '' women do n't buy sex , they do n't need to .
If they want sex , they can just go get it for free wherever they want . ''
He wonders if male escorts for women will ever become common .
He says women tend not to have sex without love or affection , whereas men do all the time .
'' That 's just the difference , biology , and the internet does n't change that , '' he says .
It does seem a contradiction .
Everyone understands why men pay for sex , but women ?
And why is there more stigma for a woman to be paid for sex than for a man ?
Reist says that when women pay men for sex , it does n't have the same social effect because there is no history of women enslaving men , the porn industry ( which she calls the filming of prostitution ) is still primarily driven by men's sexual demands .
'' There 's no social construction of men as sluts who enjoy their own degradation , '' Reist says .
Rosewarne says the number of women who hire male escorts is still so small that it has not been much researched , but women undertaking sex tourism has become a big enough phenomenon to be studied .
Sex tourism for women mainly involves Americans and Europeans travelling to places such as Jamaica and Haiti to purchase sex with local men .
'' I 'm not saying women are n't paying for sex , but the way they do it is different , '' she says .
Men will frequently pay for sex for 20 - 30 minutes and be satisfied .
'' Women are almost buying a boyfriend for a week . ''
But she says it makes sex tourism no more acceptable when it is women doing the buying .
'' It raises a whole lot of power , sex , political issues that I 'm not sure we 've resolved .
It 's not a level playing field …
These men in Haiti , if you ask them if they had access to a university degree and could be a doctor or lawyer , do you reckon you would be a prostitute to a wealthy white woman ? ''
But in Australia , is it a level playing field for male escorts catering for women , and does that make it OK ?
'' Aundre ' ' ( pictured ) , 23 , has been working as a male escort for two years and , like the other escorts The Age interviewed , has a full - time job .
His detailed website offers the ' ' ultimate boyfriend experience '' , from '' an intellectual conversation over dinner ' ' , to '' ground - breaking sex ' ' from $ 170 an hour to $ 1200 for 12 hours .
Aundre says lots of guys talk about becoming male escorts , but most are not focused enough to do it .
'' There is demand out there , but it 's a niche market . ''
MELBOURNE -BASED '' Daniel ' ' has worked on and off in the sex industry for more than a decade , but has been specialising in just women and couples for the past year .
His website states he ' ' practices the arts of intimacy , control , erotica , tantra , massage , bondage , discipline , cross - dressing , role play , sexuality and spanking ' ' .
He also has a full - time day job , partly because there is insufficient demand and partly because he finds the work emotionally draining .
He says there are few male prostitutes for women because '' women would rather go without sex than face the fear of asking for it from a stranger and paying for it . ''
Women '' still think it 's not allowed .
They can't ask for what they want and they do n't get what they want , '' Daniel says .
His clients have ranged from a 19 - year - old who wanted to lose her virginity with someone experienced , to women in their 30s sick of dating '' losers ' ' ; from 40 - plus corporate high - flyers and married women bored with their sex lives , to couples ( husbands do n't see him as a threat ) .
'' Sometimes you open the door and you see a really beautiful woman and I can't believe how lucky I am : this woman is going to pay to have sex with me . ''
Steve , the first male escort Eva hired , ended up working for her .
He is My Male Companion 's most popular escort and will wine and dine a woman for $ 250 an hour - or have sex with them for $ 500 an hour , minimum booking of two hours .
A full day can cost $ 15,000 .
The escort work , which he keeps secret from most of his family , friends and employer , is paying for his higher education and training .
Steve , who moved here from Europe , lives in Sydney but travels , mainly to Melbourne and Brisbane , for one - off and regular clients .
Sometimes he is hired just to spend the day with a woman and her children - '' looking after the children , walking in the park or with the dogs , cooking a meal together .
Sometimes it's to make an ex jealous . ''
He says the income is good but not the primary motivator .
'' In a selfish way I feel pleasure by giving pleasure and by giving I receive , that 's what counts . ''
For '' Jeanette ' ' , hiring a male escort was about safely extending her sexual boundaries , doing '' something for myself ' ' after working full - time and raising two , now adult , children as a single mother .
She found Daniel online and chose him because he was an S&M ( sadomasochism ) master .
She had no shortage of lovers , but hired Daniel regularly over a year because she could be totally upfront with him in a way she could n't with her regular lovers .
The liberating part was that Daniel was never judgmental about her sexual fantasies or responses , but rather patient , supportive and fun to be with .
'' It was a trip to Paris or this , '' Jeanette says with a big smile .
'' My life has gone in a direction I would never have imagined .
I would never have seen myself doing what I have done in the last few years with Daniel but I am really glad I have and I think it 's due to the freedom .
There 's a lot more freedom for women now . ''

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
If you ’re still struggling over your tax return , wondering why you pay so much to finance a dysfunctional and wasteful government , maybe it ’s time you adopted the same rules used by government number crunchers .
The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) and Joint Committee on Taxation ( JCT ) helped push the health bill across the finish line by forecasting that ( do n’t laugh ) a giant new entitlement program for government - run health care would reduce long - run budget deficits .
A closer look at what they did suggests that as we approach April 15 , taxpayers could save a bundle of money if they used the same creative accounting as CBO and JCT .
For example :
When CBO and JCT concoct their official scores about increases or decreases in government spending or revenue , they use “ base - line ” math .
So when CBO said Medicare spending would be cut by several hundred billion dollars over the next 10 years , the first thing you need to understand is that Medicare spending actually will be increasing during that time period from $ 528 billion this year to about $ 1 trillion in 2020 .
But CBO says Medicare spending will be “ cut ” because it is not increasing even faster .
Imagine if you got to do the same thing with your tax return .
Not many of us received raises last year because of an economy weakened by bad government policy .
But let ’s say you were one of the lucky ones ( a government employee , perhaps ? ) and you got a $ 5,000 raise .
Unfortunately , Uncle Sam is going to want a big chunk of that additional money .
Here ’s where CBO accounting would be a big help .
Why do n’t you assume that you were going to get a raise of $ 10,000 .
Because your pay “ only ” went up by $ 5,000 , you can claim your pay was reduced .
The IRS will come down on you like a ton of bricks , but you can tell the agents as they cart you away that you were following official government methodology .
( Maybe they ’ll go easy on you when you tell them that an identical approach helped push the IRS budget up to $ 12 billion . )
If that does n’t work , you can always pretend certain things do n’t exist .
You ’ve probably heard of the infamous “ doc fix ” in the health care bill .
This clever scam assumed Medicare savings based on changes to doctor payments that everyone knows Congress will never pass .
Like a crooked cop who looks the other way while the mob runs a gambling joint , CBO ruled that these imaginary savings could be used to finance more subsidies .
Well , if it ’s good enough for Congress , why ca n’t taxpayers rely on imaginary savings ?
When filing your taxes , you can fantasize that you moved into a much larger house with a higher mortgage .
Then , claim a bigger mortgage interest deduction .
Once again , the IRS may frown upon that approach , but perhaps a judge will sympathize if you say you ’ll pay your full tax bill if and when Congress follows through on the supposed Medicare savings in the Obamacare legislation .
The JCT folks have some helpful accounting ideas as well .
These are the number crunchers famous for assuming that tax changes have zero impact on the economy ’s performance .
So it will come as no surprise that they predicted that a 3.8 percentage - point increase in the capital gains tax ( and a similar tax increase on other forms of savings and investment ) would generate more than $ 200 billion over the next 10 years .
People in the real world , by contrast , understand that reduced economic growth will mean less taxable income and that the actual increase in tax receipts will be lower than the official forecast .
So why not use the same type of make - believe methodology on your tax return ?
Just claim , for instance , that some of your income is actually tax - free interest from municipal bonds .
Granted , those unfriendly folks at the IRS might want proof .
But you can take comfort in the knowledge that many investors and entrepreneurs actually will be shifting some or all of their portfolios into unproductive ( and nontaxable ) municipal bonds to protect themselves against the punitive new tax on productive private - sector investment .
Here ’s one final idea gleaned from the health care debate - and unlike the last few , it ’s actually usable advice .
Many companies likely will dump their health insurance plans for employees because the new legislation probably will make policies more bureaucratic and expensive .
If you ’re in this category or if you work for a small company that does n’t offer health insurance anyhow , the IRS has the power to enforce an individual mandate to buy health insurance .
The propellerheads at CBO seem to think this will reduce the ranks of the uninsured .
But why not tell the IRS to go jump in a lake ?
The worst thing that will happen is that you will get hit with a fine , but that fine almost surely will be a lot less than the cost of buying a health insurance policy even if you mooch from the government .
Best of all , there ’s no downside to this approach :
Thanks to an absurd provision in Obamacare that forces insurance companies to accept people who wait until they get sick to buy a policy , you can sign up whenever you want .
But you ’d better hurry .
Thanks to foolish provisions like that , it probably is just a matter of time before the private insurance market self - destructs .
Then you ’ll have the joy of being forced into a government plan such as Medicaid .
At that point , you can add “ do n’t get sick ” to “ do n’t get wealthy ” as the federal government ’s loud - and - clear message to its citizens .

The glorious medical marijuana card … For those that do n’t have one , getting one seems like a really big step .
For those of us that have a medical card , we simply could n’t imagine life without it .
I get asked at least once a day how I got my medical card , and so I figured I would post the answer on TheWeedBlog .
Com for the masses .
Keep in mind ; this process is for the State of Oregon .
I will explain at the end how it applies to the other 13 medical states in the US .
In no way am I recommending that a person fake a condition , I am simply telling people how I got MY medical card .
However , most people have at least SOME kind of pain , and SOME is all you need !
Day 1 — I went into my personal doctor and said , “ My wrists and hands hurt from overuse .
I do n’t know if it ’s carpal tunnel syndrome , or arthritis , or if I ’m just a hypochondriac , but I really do have pain in my hands and wrists .
I type a lot , write a lot , text message a TON , and generally do a lot of activities with my hands . ”
I could tell that my doctor was suspicious that I wanted painkillers , so I told him , “ I DO NOT want painkillers .
Are there natural ways , such as stretches , that I can do to alleviate my pain ? ”
My doctor told me to take an over the counter painkiller and come back in 30 days if the symptoms did n’t subside .
Considering the pain had been with me for a couple years at that point , I was certain that I would be back .
Especially since I refuse to take painkillers of any kind that are not natural remedies .
Day 31 — I went back to my doctor to inform him that I still had the pain in my hands and wrists , and that I did n’t take the over the counter painkillers for the reasons I stated previously .
I asked him once again , “ Are there any natural things I can do to relieve my pain , such as stretches or changes in my daily activities ? ”
My doctor gave me a couple of wrist braces that I was supposed to wear when I experienced the pain .
I pointed out that I have this pain , at least mildly , at all times .
He instructed me to wear the braces constantly .
This was incredibly unrealistic , as I could n’t even safely wear them when I was driving .
At this point I had two options ; go to expensive physical therapy and wear braces all day , or I could go to another doctor that would prescribe me a medical marijuana card .
*** In order to get a medical marijuana card , you DO NOT have to get your doctor to prescribe it .
What I just did in my two visits to MY OWN DOCTOR was establish a ‘ chronic pain , ’ which is defined in Oregon as ‘ two visits for the same pain in the last 12 month period of time . ’
Check with your state to see what their definition of ‘ chronic pain ’ is , but in all of my research it has always been 2 visits in a 12 month period of time .
You do n’t have to use ‘ chronic pain , ’ you can use any ailment that is approved by your state .
But once again , every state I have researched has chronic pain as an approvable condition , and back spasms , a ‘ bad back , ’ gimp leg , bum arm , wrist pain , frequent headaches , etc , are all ‘ chronic pains ’ as long as you go in 2 times in a 12 month span of time .
I know people that have it for gout , epilepsy , spasms , and a number of other ‘ non-terminal ailments . ’
Of course , if your state only approves terminal conditions such as cancer or AIDS , you are SOL , or if you live in a state that does not have a medical marijuana program you are SOL ***
Once I had two visits on my record , I had my medical records faxed from MY DOCTOR ’S OFFICE to the MEDICAL MARIJUANA CLINIC where a doctor would sign my forms .
Most clinics do not take new patients ; they only take patients with ‘ established conditions . ’
Go to YOUR doctor and ‘ establish it , ’ much like I did on day 1 and 31 .
Then fax your records to the nearest medical marijuana clinic ( note — not all medical clinics are the same , research and find one that has a good reputation ) .
After that fax gets to the clinic , and you come in with the proper fees , CONGRATULATIONS .
The only thing left to do is to get the paperwork to the appropriate state government agency ( in Oregon it is DHS , for instance ) .
You are now in the medical marijuana club , medicate yourself responsibly !!!!
This can be done in CA , CO , MI , MT , etc .
The only trick is finding a doctor / clinic that will sign your forms once you have ‘ established ’ your condition .
Of course , if you could get your regular doctor to sign the damn forms , you can side step this entire process .
Maybe someday medical doctors will do what ’s best for their patients , instead of letting social norms and personal political views dictate how they treat their patients …
Kings Coach Terry Murray acknowledged he probably played goaltender Jonathan Quick “ a little too much down the last month ” but he wanted a potentially favorable playoff matchup against Phoenix and did n’t feel secure starting an out - of - rhythm Erik Ersberg .
Quick appeared in a franchise - record 72 games and played 4,258 minutes and 27 seconds , second in the NHL .
Of the eight goalies who played at least 4,000 minutes only San Jose ’s Evgeni Nabokov reached the second round of the playoffs .
Quick struggled late in the Kings ’ six - game series against Vancouver , compiling a 3.50 goals - against average .
His regular - season average was 2.54 .
Murray also said Quick developed a shoulder issue after a playoff goalmouth collision and defended the 24 - year - old ’s efforts .
Murray also declined to rule out playing Quick in 70 - plus games next season .
“ You never say never , ” Murray said Tuesday as players gathered for final meetings .
“ I think now that he ’s shown his level of play that he is a No. 1 goaltender , first of all , is very important .
Now that that is settled there will be no discussion about it next year coming into the training camp .
He ’s our guy .
He ’s our No. 1 goaltender .
Then we ’ll see where the competition goes from there and who is going to be from that point the No. 2 guy . ”
The Kings ’ failure to protect leads in the third period of Games 4 and 6 remains in Murray ’s mind but he has n’t forgotten the franchise record - tying 46 wins or 101 points .
“ What ’s real important for this group right now is to have a real good grasp on what was done this year , the success , the good feeling and , at the end of the day what we did not accomplish , and how hard it ’s going to get back to getting there again , ” he said .
“ There ’s wonderful experiences there to draw on , and if we understand it as a group of guys I think we can take the next step forward . ”
The bare - faced truth
With no need to obey playoff superstitions anymore , most players shaved their playoff beards .
They also came clean about their injuries .
Murray said defenseman Peter Harrold broke his wrist in Game 3 and defenseman Drew Doughty played with an injured wrist .
Doughty said he “ messed up ” his hand in Game 1 and wo n’t play for Canada in the World Championships in Germany .
Right wing Dustin Brown wo n’t play for the U.S. because he ’s facing facial bone - graft surgery .
He lost his teeth a while ago and the bone has been weakening .
“ Just from a personal standpoint , having teeth would be nice , ” he said .
Encore , encore
How will Doughty top winning an Olympic gold medal , being a finalist for the Norris trophy and leading the Kings in playoff scoring with three goals and seven points ?
“ I do n’t know the answer to that , ” he said .
“ We ’re really excited and proud of the season we had .
Everyone in the whole organization is really proud of what we did . ”
Doughty has a year left on his three - year , entry - level contract .
The Kings can start negotiating an extension with him July 1 .
“ I ’d love to sign a long - term deal , ” he said .
“ I love being in L.A. and I love the group of guys we ’ve got so to be able to stick around here for a long time would be awesome . ”
Center Anze Kopitar , who reached career - highs with 34 goals and 81 points , said he will increase his summer workouts in hopes of becoming stronger and more productive next season .
“ I ’m a pretty ambitious person , ” he said .
“ I do n’t get satisfied when you do n’t reach the top … .
I think there is another level in me and I ’ve got to bring it out . ”
For the Kings to reach the next level they can’t squander leads like they did in Games 4 and 6 .
“ This next step is to close out games and have that killer instinct when you go with the lead into the third period , ” he said .

House Republicans do n’t have an official budget yet .
But they have what amounts to a first draft .
The official budget will be released in March or April and will be authored by Rep. Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) , the ranking member of the House Budget Committee in consultation with the other Republicans on the Committee .
But Ryan has released a budget he ’d like .
And it ’s actually fairly detailed .
And if you read it , which we have , you start to wonder why Democrats are n’t making a bigger deal out of it .
What ’s in it ?
A few interesting things .
First , it calls for big cuts in Social Security benefits for everyone currently under 55 years of age .
On top of the cuts it also calls for privatizing Social Security .
Basically the exact plan President Bush tried in 2005 .
Next , it calls for the full privatization and phasing out of Medicare .
It ’ll be replaced by a system of vouchers in which instead of getting Medicare you get a voucher to buy un-reformed private insurance .
Weirdly , with all that , the draft GOP budget does n’t get the federal budget into surplus until sometime after 2060 , which seems like a pretty long time .
But is n’t this sort of a big deal ?
House Republicans are poised to run in 2010 on slashing or abolishing the two most popular federal government programs — Social Security and Medicare .
Now , Minority Leader Boehner ( R - OH ) and Minority Whip Cantor ( R - VA ) have been sort of dancing around the Ryan draft .
They ’re both saying they ’re putting forward a detailed budget plan and then simultaneously refusing to say Ryan ’s plan is endorsed by the conference .
But Ryan ’s their budget writer .
So this is a bit like Peter Orszag releasing a budget document and having Obama and Rahm saying he ’s just speaking for himself .
Over geologic time , plate movements in concert with other geologic processes , such as glacial and stream erosion , have created some of nature 's most magnificent scenery .
The Himalayas , the Swiss Alps , and the Andes are some spectacular examples .
Yet violent earthquakes related to plate tectonics have caused terrible catastrophes -- such as the magnitude - 7.7 earthquake that struck the Chinese province of Hebei in 1976 and killed as many as 800,000 people .
Natural hazards
Most earthquakes and volcanic eruptions do not strike randomly but occur in specific areas , such as along plate boundaries .
One such area is the circum - Pacific Ring of Fire , where the Pacific Plate meets many surrounding plates .
The Ring of Fire is the most seismically and volcanically active zone in the world .
Earthquakes
Because many major population centers are located near active fault zones , such as the San Andreas , millions of people have suffered personal and economic losses as a result of destructive earthquakes , and even more have experienced earthquake motions .
Not surprisingly , some people believe that , when the " Big One " hits , California will suddenly " break off " and " fall into the Pacific , " or that the Earth will " open up " along the fault and " swallow " people , cars , and houses .
Such beliefs have no scientific basis whatsoever .
Although ground slippage commonly takes place in a large earthquake , the Earth will not open up .
Nor will California fall into the sea , because the fault zone only extends about 15 km deep , which is only about a quarter of the thickness of the continental crust .
Furthermore , California is composed of continental crust , whose relatively low density keeps it riding high , like an iceberg above the ocean .

Like all transform plate boundaries , the San Andreas is a strike - slip fault , movement along which is dominantly horizontal .
Specifically , the San Andreas fault zone separates the Pacific and North American Plates , which are slowly grinding past each other in a roughly north - south direction .
The Pacific Plate ( western side of the fault ) is moving horizontally in a northerly direction relative to the North American Plate ( eastern side of the fault ) .
Evidence of the sideways shift of these two landmasses can be found all along the fault zone , as seen from the differences in topography , geologic structures , and , sometimes , vegetation of the terrain from one side of the fault to the other .
For example , the San Andreas runs directly along Crystal Springs Reservoir on the San Francisco Peninsula .
Topographically , this reservoir fills a long , straight , narrow valley that was formed by erosion of the easily erodible rocks mashed within the fault zone .
Movement along the San Andreas can occur either in sudden jolts or in a slow , steady motion called creep .
Fault segments that are actively creeping experience many small to moderate earthquakes that cause little or no damage .
These creeping segments are separated by segments of infrequent earthquake activity ( called seismic gaps ) , areas that are stuck or locked in place within the fault zone .
Locked segments of the fault store a tremendous amount of energy that can build up for decades , or even centuries , before being unleashed in devastating earthquakes .
For example , the Great San Francisco Earthquake ( 8.3 - magnitude ) in 1906 ruptured along a previously locked 430 km- long segment of the San Andreas , extending from Cape Men-docino south to San Juan Bautista .
Map of the San Andreas and a few of the other faults in California , segments of which display different behavior : locked or creeping ( see text ) .
( Simplified from USGS Professional Paper 1515 . )
The stresses that accumulate along a locked segment of the fault and the sudden release can be visualized by bending a stick until it breaks .
The stick will bend fairly easily , up to a certain point , until the stress becomes too great and it snaps .
The vibrations felt when the stick breaks represent the sudden release of the stored - up energy .
Similarly , the seismic vibrations produced when the ground suddenly ruptures radiate out through the Earth 's interior from the rupture point , called the earthquake focus .
The geographic point directly above the focus is called the earthquake epicenter .
In a major earthquake , the energy released can cause damage hundreds to thousands of kilometers away from the epicenter .

The magnitude - 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake of October 1989 occurred along a segment of the San Andreas Fault which had been locked since the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake .
Even though the earthquake 's focus ( approximately 80 km south of San Francisco ) was centered in a sparsely populated part of the Santa Cruz Mountains , the earthquake still caused 62 deaths and nearly $ 6 billion in damage .
Following the Loma Prieta earthquake , the fault remains locked from Pt. Arena , where it enters California from the ocean , south through San Francisco and the peninsula west of San Francisco Bay , thus posing the threat of a potential destructive earthquake occurring in a much more densely populated area .
The lesser known Hayward Fault running east of San Francisco Bay , however , may pose a potential threat as great as , or perhaps even greater than , the San Andreas .
From the televised scenes of the damage caused by the 7.2 - magnitude earthquake that struck Kobe , Japan , on 16 January 1995 , Bay Area residents saw the possible devastation that could occur if a comparable size earthquake were to strike along the Hayward Fault .
This is because the Hayward and the Nojima fault that produced the Kobe earthquake are quite similar in several ways .
Not only are they of the same type ( strike - slip ) , they are also about the same length ( 60­p ; 80 km ) and both cut through densely populated urban areas , with many buildings , freeways , and other structures built on unstable bay landfill .
On 17 January 1994 , one of the costliest natural disasters in United States history struck southern California .
A magnitude - 6.6 earthquake hit near Northridge , a community located in the populous San Fernando Valley within the City of Los Angeles , California .
This disaster , which killed more than 60 people , caused an estimated $ 30 billion in damage , nearly five times that resulting from the Loma Prieta earthquake .
The Northridge earthquake did not directly involve movement along one of the strands of the San Andreas Fault system .
It instead occurred along the Santa Monica Mountains Thrust Fault , one of several smaller , concealed faults ( called blind thrust faults ) south of the San Andreas Fault zone where it bends to the east , roughly paralleling the Transverse Mountain Range .
With a thrust fault , whose plane is inclined to the Earth 's surface , one side moves upward over the other .
Movement along a blind thrust fault does not break the ground surface , thus making it difficult or impossible to map these hidden but potentially dangerous faults .
Although scientists have found measurable uplift at several places in the Transverse Range , they have not found any conclusive evidence of ground rupture from the 1994 Northridge earthquake .
Similar earthquakes struck the region in 1971 and 1987 ; the San Fernando earthquake ( 1971 ) caused substantial damage , including the collapse of a hospital and several freeway overpasses .
Not all fault movement is as violent and destructive .
Near the city of Hollister in central California , the Calaveras Fault bends toward the San Andreas .
Here , the Calaveras fault creeps at a slow , steady pace , posing little danger .
Much of the Calaveras fault creeps at an average rate of 5 to 6 mm / yr .
On average , Hollister has some 20,000 earthquakes a year , most of which are too small to be felt by residents .
It is rare for an area undergoing creep to experience an earthquake with a magnitude greater than 6.0 because stress is continually being relieved and , therefore , does not accumulate .
Fault - creep movement generally is non-threatening , resulting only in gradual offset of roads , fences , sidewalks , pipelines , and other structures that cross the fault .
However , the persistence of fault creep does pose a costly nuisance in terms of maintenance and repair .
Mid-plate earthquakes -- those occurring in the interiors of plates -- are much less frequent than those along plate boundaries and more difficult to explain .
Earthquakes along the Atlantic seaboard of the United States are most likely related in some way to the westward movement of the North American Plate away from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , a continuing process begun with the break - up of Pangaea .
However , the causes of these infrequent earthquakes are still not understood .
East Coast earthquakes , such as the one that struck Charleston , South Carolina , in 1886 are felt over a much larger area than earthquakes occurring on the West Coast , because the eastern half of the country is mainly composed of older rock that has not been fractured and cracked by frequent earthquake activity in the recent geologic past .
Rock that is highly fractured and crushed absorbs more seismic energy than rock that is less fractured .
The Charleston earthquake , with an estimated magnitude of about 7.0 , was felt as far away as Chicago , more than 1,300 km to the northwest , whereas the 7.1 - magnitude Loma Prieta earthquakes was felt no farther than Los Angeles , about 500 km south .
The most widely felt earthquakes ever to strike the United States were centered near the town of New Madrid , Missouri , in 1811 and 1812 .
Three earthquakes , felt as far away as Washington D.C. , were each estimated to be above 8.0 in magnitude .
Most of us do not associate earthquakes with New York City , but beneath Manhattan is a network of intersecting faults , a few of which are capable of causing earthquakes .
The most recent earthquake to strike New York City occurred in 1985 and measured 4.0 in magnitude , and a pair of earthquakes ( magnitude 4.0 and 4.5 ) shook Reading , Pennsylvania , in January 1994 causing minor damage .

We know in general how most earthquakes occur , but can we predict when they will strike ?
This question has challenged and frustrated scientists studying likely precursors to moderate and large earthquakes .
Since the early 1980s , geologists and seismologists have been intensively studying a segment of the San Andreas near the small town of Parkfield , located about halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles , to try to detect the physical and chemical changes that might take place -- both above and below ground -- before an earthquake strikes .
The USGS and State and local agencies have blanketed Parkfield and the surrounding countryside with seismographs , creep meters , stress meters , and other ground - motion measurement devices .
The Parkfield segment has experienced earthquakes measuring magnitude 6.0 about every 22 years on average since 1881 .
During the most recent two earthquakes ( 1934 , 1966 ) , the same section of the fault slipped and the amount of slippage was about the same .
In 1983 , this evidence , in addition to the earlier recorded history of earthquake activity , led the USGS to predict that there was a 95 percent chance of a 6.0 earthquake striking Parkfield before 1993 .
But the anticipated earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or greater did not materialize .
The Parkfield experiment is continuing , and its primary goals remain unchanged : to issue a short - term prediction ; to monitor and analyze geophysical and geochemical effects before , during , and after the anticipated earthquake ; and to develop effective communications between scientists , emergency - management officials , and the public in responding to earthquake hazards .
While scientists are studying and identifying possible precursors leading to the next Parkfield earthquake , they also are looking at these same precursors to see if they may be occurring along other segments of the fault .
Studies of past earthquakes , together with data and experience gained from the Parkfield experiment , have been used by geoscientists to estimate the probabilities of major earthquakes occurring along the entire San Andreas Fault system .
In 1988 , the USGS identified six segments of the San Andreas as most likely to be hit by a magnitude 6.5 or larger earthquake within the next thirty years ( 1988 -2018 ) .
The Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 occurred along one of these six segments .
The Parkfield experiment and other studies carried out by the USGS as part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program have led to an increased official and public awareness of the inevitability of future earthquake activity in California .
Consequently , residents and State and local officials have become more diligent in planning and preparing for the next big earthquake .
Volcanic eruptions
As with earthquakes , volcanic activity is linked to plate - tectonic processes .
Most of the world 's active above - sea volcanoes are located near convergent plate boundaries where subduction is occurring , particularly around the Pacific basin .
However , much more volcanism -- producing about three quarters of all lava erupted on Earth -- takes place unseen beneath the ocean , mostly along the oceanic spreading centers , such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise .
Subduction - zone volcanoes like Mount St. Helens ( in Washington State ) and Mount Pinatubo ( Luzon , Philippines ) , are called composite cones and typically erupt with explosive force , because the magma is too stiff to allow easy escape of volcanic gases .
As a consequence , tremendous internal pressures mount as the trapped gases expand during ascent , before the pent - up pressure is suddenly released in a violent eruption .
Such an explosive process can be compared to putting your thumb over an opened bottle of a carbonated drink , shaking it vigorously , and then quickly removing the thumb .
The shaking action separates the gases from the liquid to form bubbles , increasing the internal pressure .
Quick release of the thumb allows the gases and liquid to gush out with explosive speed and force .
In 1991 , two volcanoes on the western edge of the Philippine Plate produced major eruptions .
On June 15 , Mount Pinatubo spewed ash 40 km into the air and produced huge ash flows ( also called pyroclastic flows ) and mudflows that devastated a large area around the volcano .
Pinatubo , located 90 km from Manila , had been dormant for 600 years before the 1991 eruption , which ranks as one of the largest eruptions in this century .
Also in 1991 , Japan 's Unzen Volcano , located on the Island of Kyushu about 40 km east of Nagasaki , awakened from its 200 - year slumber to produce a new lava dome at its summit .
Beginning in June , repeated collapses of this active dome generated destructive ash flows that swept down its slopes at speeds as high as 200 km per hour .
Unzen is one of more than 75 active volcanoes in Japan ; its eruption in 1792 killed more than 15,000 people -- the worst volcanic disaster in the country 's history .
While the Unzen eruptions have caused deaths and considerable local damage , the impact of the June 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo was global .
Slightly cooler than usual temperatures recorded worldwide and the brilliant sunsets and sunrises have been attributed to this eruption that sent fine ash and gases high into the stratosphere , forming a large volcanic cloud that drifted around the world .
The sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) in this cloud -- about 22 million tons -- combined with water to form droplets of sulfuric acid , blocking some of the sunlight from reaching the Earth and thereby cooling temperatures in some regions by as much as 0.5 °C .
An eruption the size of Mount Pinatubo could affect the weather for a few years .
A similar phenomenon occurred in April of 1815 with the cataclysmic eruption of Tambora Volcano in Indonesia , the most powerful eruption in recorded history .
Tambora 's volcanic cloud lowered global temperatures by as much as 3 °C .
Even a year after the eruption , most of the northern hemisphere experienced sharply cooler temperatures during the summer months .
In part of Europe and in North America , 1816 was known as " the year without a summer . "
Apart from possibly affecting climate , volcanic clouds from explosive eruptions also pose a hazard to aviation safety .
During the past two decades , more than 60 airplanes , mostly commercial jetliners , have been damaged by in - flight encounters with volcanic ash .
Some of these encounters have resulted in the power loss of all engines , necessitating emergency landings .

Since the year A.D. 1600 , nearly 300,000 people have been killed by volcanic eruptions .
Most deaths were caused by pyroclastic flows and mudflows , deadly hazards which often accompany explosive eruptions of subduction - zone volcanoes .
Pyroclastic flows , also called nuées ardentes ( " glowing clouds " in French ) , are fast - moving , avalanche - like , ground - hugging incandescent mixtures of hot volcanic debris , ash , and gases that can travel at speeds in excess of 150 km per hour .
Approximately 30,000 people were killed by pyroclastic flows during the 1902 eruption of Mont Pelée on the Island of Martinique in the Caribbean .
In March - April 1982 , three explosive eruptions of El Chichón Volcano in the State of Chiapas , southeastern Mexico , caused the worst volcanic disaster in that country 's history .
Villages within 8 km of the volcano were destroyed by pyroclastic flows , killing more than 2,000 people .
Mudflows ( also called debris flows or lahars , an Indonesian term for volcanic mudflows ) are mixtures of volcanic debris and water .
The water usually comes from two sources : rainfall or the melting of snow and ice by hot volcanic debris .
Depending on the proportion of water to volcanic material , mudflows can range from soupy floods to thick flows that have the consistency of wet cement .
As mudflows sweep down the steep sides of composite volcanoes , they have the strength and speed to flatten or bury everything in their paths .
Hot ash and pyroclastic flows from the eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz Volcano in Colombia , South America , melted snow and ice atop the 5,390 - m- high Andean peak ; the ensuing mudflows buried the city of Armero , killing 25,000 people .
Eruptions of Hawaiian and most other mid-plate volcanoes differ greatly from those of composite cones .
Mauna Loa and Kilauea , on the island of Hawaii , are known as shield volcanoes , because they resemble the wide , rounded shape of an ancient warrior 's shield .
Shield volcanoes tend to erupt non-explosively , mainly pouring out huge volumes of fluid lava .
Hawaiian - type eruptions are rarely life threatening because the lava advances slowly enough to allow safe evacuation of people , but large lava flows can cause considerable economic loss by destroying property and agricultural lands .
For example , lava from the ongoing eruption of Kilauea , which began in January 1983 , has destroyed more than 200 structures , buried kilometers of highways , and disrupted the daily lives of local residents .
Because Hawaiian volcanoes erupt frequently and pose little danger to humans , they provide an ideal natural laboratory to safely study volcanic phenomena at close range .
The USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory , on the rim of Kilauea , was among the world 's first modern volcano observatories , established early in this century .
In recorded history , explosive eruptions at subduction - zone ( convergent - boundary ) volcanoes have posed the greatest hazard to civilizations .
Yet scientists have estimated that about three quarters of the material erupted on Earth each year originates at spreading mid-ocean ridges .
However , no deep submarine eruption has yet been observed " live " by scientists .
Because the great water depths preclude easy observation , few detailed studies have been made of the numerous possible eruption sites along the tremendous length ( 50,000 km ) of the global mid-oceanic ridge system .
Recently however , repeated surveys of specific sites along the Juan de Fuca Ridge , off the coast of the Oregon and Washington , have mapped deposits of fresh lava , which must have been erupted sometime between the surveys .
In June 1993 , seismic signals typically associated with submarine eruptions -- called T - phases -- were detected along part of the spreading Juan de Fuca Ridge and interpreted as being caused by eruptive activity .
Iceland , where the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is exposed on land , is a different story .
It is easy to see many Icelandic volcanoes erupt non-explosively from fissure vents , in similar fashion to typical Hawaiian eruptions ; others , like Hekla Volcano , erupt explosively .
( After Hekla 's catastrophic eruption in 1104 , it was thought in the Christian world to be the " Mouth to Hell . " )
The voluminous , but mostly non-explosive , eruption at Lakagígar ( Laki ) , Iceland , in 1783 , resulted in one of the world 's worst volcanic disasters .
About 9,000 people -- almost 20 % of the country 's population at the time -- died of starvation after the eruption , because their livestock had perished from grazing on grass contaminated by fluorine - rich gases emitted during this eight month - long eruption .
Tsunamis
Major earthquakes occurring along subduction zones are especially hazardous , because they can trigger tsunamis ( from the Japanese word tsunami meaning " harbor wave " ) and pose a potential danger to coastal communities and islands that dot the Pacific .
Tsunamis are often mistakenly called " tidal waves " when , in fact , they have nothing to do with tidal action .
Rather , tsunamis are seismic sea waves caused by earthquakes , submarine landslides , and , infrequently , by eruptions of island volcanoes .
During a major earthquake , the seafloor can move by several meters and an enormous amount of water is suddenly set into motion , sloshing back and forth for several hours .
The result is a series of waves that race across the ocean at speeds of more than 800 km per hour , comparable to those of commercial jetliners .
The energy and momentum of these transoceanic waves can take them thousands of kilometers from their origin before slamming into far - distant islands or coastal areas .
A giant wave engulfs the pier at Hilo , Hawaii , during the 1946 tsunami , which killed 159 people .
The arrow points to a man who was swept away seconds later .

To someone on a ship in the open ocean , the passage of a tsunami wave would barely elevate the water surface .
However , when it reaches shallower water near the coastline and " touches bottom , " the tsunami wave increases in height , piling up into an enormous wall of water .
As a tsunami approaches the shore , the water near shore commonly recedes for several minutes -- long enough for someone to be lured out to collect exposed sea shells , fish , etc. -- before suddenly rushing back toward land with frightening speed and height .
The 1883 eruption of Krakatau Volcano , located in the Sunda Straits between the islands of Sumatra and Java , Indonesia , provides an excellent example of an eruption - caused tsunami .
A series of tsunamis washed away 165 coastal villages on Java and Sumatra , killing 36,000 people .
The larger tsunamis were recorded by tide gauges as far away as the southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula - more than 7,000 km from Krakatau !
Because of past killer tsunamis , which have caused hundreds of deaths on the Island of Hawaii and elsewhere , the International Tsunami Information Center was created in 1965 .
This center issues tsunami warnings based on earthquake and wave - height information gathered from seismic and tide - gauge stations located around the Pacific Ocean basin and on Hawaii .
Natural resources
Many of the Earth 's natural resources of energy , minerals , and soil are concentrated near past or present plate boundaries .
The utilization of these readily available resources have sustained human civilizations , both now and in the past .
Fertile soils
Volcanoes can clearly cause much damage and destruction , but in the long term they also have benefited people .
Over thousands to millions of years , the physical breakdown and chemical weathering of volcanic rocks have formed some of the most fertile soils on Earth .
In tropical , rainy regions , such as the windward ( northeastern ) side of the Island of Hawaii , the formation of fertile soil and growth of lush vegetation following an eruption can be as fast as a few hundred years .
Some of the earliest civilizations ( for example , Greek , Etruscan , and Roman ) settled on the rich , fertile volcanic soils in the Mediterranean - Aegean region .
Some of the best rice - growing regions of Indonesia are in the shadow of active volcanoes .
Similarly , many prime agricultural regions in the western United States have fertile soils wholly or largely of volcanic origin .
Ore deposits
Most of the metallic minerals mined in the world , such as copper , gold , silver , lead , and zinc , are associated with magmas found deep within the roots of extinct volcanoes located above subduction zones .
Rising magma does not always reach the surface to erupt ; instead it may slowly cool and harden beneath the volcano to form a wide variety of crystalline rocks ( generally called plutonic or granitic rocks ) .
Some of the best examples of such deep - seated granitic rocks , later exposed by erosion , are magnificently displayed in California 's Yosemite National Park .
Ore deposits commonly form around the magma bodies that feed volcanoes because there is a ready supply of heat , which convectively moves and circulates ore - bearing fluids .
The metals , originally scattered in trace amounts in magma or surrounding solid rocks , become concentrated by circulating hot fluids and can be redeposited , under favorable temperature and pressure conditions , to form rich mineral veins .
The active volcanic vents along the spreading mid-ocean ridges create ideal environments for the circulation of fluids rich in minerals and for ore deposition .
Water as hot as 380 °C gushes out of geothermal springs along the spreading centers .
The water has been heated during circulation by contact with the hot volcanic rocks forming the ridge .
Deep - sea hot springs containing an abundance of dark - colored ore minerals ( sulfides ) of iron , copper , zinc , nickel , and other metals are called " black smokers . "
On rare occasions , such deep - sea ore deposits are later exposed in remnants of ancient oceanic crust that have been scraped off and left ( " beached " ) on top of continental crust during past subduction processes .
The Troodos Massif on the Island of Cyprus is perhaps the best known example of such ancient oceanic crust .
Cyprus was an important source of copper in the ancient world , and Romans called copper the " Cyprian metal " ; the Latin word for copper is cyprium .
Fossil fuels
Oil and natural gas are the products of the deep burial and decomposition of accumulated organic material in geologic basins that flank mountain ranges formed by plate - tectonic processes .
Heat and pressure at depth transform the decomposed organic material into tiny pockets of gas and liquid petroleum , which then migrate through the pore spaces and larger openings in the surrounding rocks and collect in reservoirs , generally within 5 km of the Earth 's surface .
Coal is also a product of accumulated decomposed plant debris , later buried and compacted beneath overlying sediments .
Most coal originated as peat in ancient swamps created many millions of years ago , associated with the draining and flooding of landmasses caused by changes in sea level related to plate tectonics and other geologic processes .
For example , the Appalachian coal deposits formed about 300 million years ago in a low - lying basin that was alternately flooded and drained .
Geothermal energy
Geothermal energy can be harnessed from the Earth 's natural heat associated with active volcanoes or geologically young inactive volcanoes still giving off heat at depth .
Steam from high - temperature geothermal fluids can be used to drive turbines and generate electrical power , while lower temperature fluids provide hot water for space - heating purposes , heat for greenhouses and industrial uses , and hot or warm springs at resort spas .
For example , geothermal heat warms more than 70 percent of the homes in Iceland , and The Geysers geothermal field in Northern California produces enough electricity to meet the power demands of San Francisco .
In addition to being an energy resource , some geo - thermal waters also contain sulfur , gold , silver , and mercury that can be recovered as a byproduct of energy production .
A formidable challenge
As global population increases and more countries become industrialized , the world demand for mineral and energy resources will continue to grow .
Because people have been using natural resources for millennia , most of the easily located mineral , fossil - fuel , and geothermal resources have already been tapped .
By necessity , the world 's focus has turned to the more remote and inaccessible regions of the world , such as the ocean floor , the polar continents , and the resources that lie deeper in the Earth 's crust .
Finding and developing such resources without damage to the environment will present a formidable challenge in the coming decades .
An improved knowledge of the relationship between plate tectonics and natural resources is essential to meeting this challenge .

The long - term benefits of plate tectonics should serve as a constant reminder to us that the planet Earth occupies a unique niche in our solar system .
Appreciation of the concept of plate tectonics and its consequences has reinforced the notion that the Earth is an integrated whole , not a random collection of isolated parts .
The global effort to better understand this revolutionary concept has helped to unite the earth - sciences community and to underscore the linkages between the many different scientific disciplines .
As we enter the 21st century , when the Earth 's finite resources will be further strained by explosive population growth , earth scientists must strive to better understand our dynamic planet .
We must become more resourceful in reaping the long - term benefits of plate tectonics , while coping with its short - term adverse impacts , such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions .
Hi all ,
If you follow my last post you are probably wondering what KPackageKit has to do with print manager !?
Well basically nothing , actually what happened is that while I wait for debconf developers to finish the DBus support , I decided I should work on other things that are not good in KDE 4 to me .
If you do n’t use Debian the printer - applet made in python probably works , but here do n’t , I never saw it in action , it simply crashes both System Settings and the printer - applet .
If the bug is on the deb package or in the application itself I do n’t know but when I let it running during the weekend ( and doing nothing ) it ate 1,5 GB of memory .
This is one of the components that I use a lot and that must work well and be simple , for a simple exercise I looked at cups API and found it was dam simple to create a simple printer queue , If you know me you know I ’m no fan of python ( Aptcc is an example of me trying to get rid of it ) , so improve printer - applet would never be an option , also just to monitor the jobs it eats 19 mb which also makes your startup slower , in Jonathan ’s blog you can see I ’m not the only one thinking this way .
Enough said , in 2 weeks of work I have a print queue that can hold , resume and cancel jobs , pause / resume printer , drag and drop a job from one queue to another and filter the kinds of jobs you ’d like to see in the queue .
While KDE 4.4 is not packaged on Debian ( hopefully next week I ’ll have it 😀 )
I did not work on the systray stuff since I ’m waiting for the new class that KDE 4.4 has , but thankfully Jonathan ( from that post ) is already working on it , besides the queue I created a kded module that when loaded adds ~ 2 mb to the kded4 process and keep an eye on your jobs , when it see on it will show the printer icon on systray .
Now I ’ll finish some small bits ( like getting more status from the printer ) , and I ’ll start the System Setting module .
Hope you like it , and if you see Nuno Pinheiro around ask him for a Resume Job icon 😛
When a wicked man dies , his hope perishes ; all he expected from his power comes to nothing .

UPDATE 02 -18 : A new mockup :
Robert F. Kennedy Junior has learned nothing in the last five years .
Back in June 2005 , Kennedy wrote a scare piece linking Thimerosal to autism , stating that scientists at a CDC meeting had spent days covering up this supposed link .
I blogged then about how Kennedy ’s article was totally dishonest , and followed up with a post about how Kennedy had quote mined the minutes of an Institute of Medicine meeting to make it appear that scientists were trying to cover up this same supposed link , although as I proved at the time , they were doing the opposite .
( If you do n’t want to read that whole post , just scroll down to the “ Walt wants ” section – the sleaziest piece of all of Kennedy ’s sleazy quote mining , and worth a re-read in my totally unbiased opinion . )
Well , he ’s back , and as nuts as ever .
Last week he wrote Central Figure in CDC Vaccine Cover - Up Absconds With $ 2M – a headline that just by itself contains two falsehoods and an unproven assertion .
Here ’s what Kennedy is saying , in summary :
Danish scientist Poul Thorsen was the central scientist behind studies showing that autism is not linked to Thimerosal or MMR
These studies ( by Thorsen ) are the key studies the CDC relies on to disprove a link between vaccines and autism Thorsen has stolen a large amount of money Point 3 above means that the studies referred to in 1 and 2 above , are no longer valid .
Unfortunately for Kennedy , points 1 , 2 and 4 above are demonstrably false :
Thorsen was not a leading figure , but a junior author on the papers in question
There are numerous other studies , apart from the Danish ones , that support there being no link between vaccines and autism .
( In addition , Thimerosal was removed from vaccines in the US in 2002 and yet reported autism continues to rise . )
The alleged fraud has no bearing on the studies anyway .
Even if Thorsen stole money , and even if he were the lead author on the studies ( which he was n’t , but even if he were ) this would not suddenly alter the studies so they now point to a different conclusion .
( It ’s a basic ad hominem fallacy . )
Also , point 3 is just an allegation .
It may be true , but right now we really ca n’t say .
Kennedy is talking nonsense .
It says a lot about the anti-vaccine crowd that when a leading figure in the MMR causes autism world ( Andrew Wakefield ) , whose study really was the only one ( the original , and not replicated ) that supposedly implicated MMR – when that person is actually found guilty of medical misconduct in the actual study they are associated with – in that case the response of the anti-vax nuts is of course to support the proven unethical Wakefield .
In that case , the guy clearly must be innocent and his studies must still be valid and good .
However , when a relatively insignificant junior author of one paper among many replicated studies around the world is accused ( just accused mind you – not proven yet like Wakefield ) of dishonesty in a matter totally unrelated to the study in question – in that case , this puts the conclusions of all such studies into doubt .
You have to wonder at the cognitive dissonance these people must suffer .
Although that would at least explain the hysterical tone of Kennedy ’s latest piece .
While his 2005 article did at least give the impression it was written by an adult ( albeit a dishonest one ) , Kennedy ’s latest offering is astonishing in its lack of any attempt at a measured or even lawyerly tone .
The falsehoods start in Kennedy ’s first sentence :
A central figure behind the Center for Disease Control 's ( CDC ) claims disputing the link between vaccines and autism and other neurological disorders has disappeared after officials discovered massive fraud involving the theft of millions in taxpayer dollars .
Danish police are investigating Dr. Poul Thorsen , who has vanished along with almost $ 2 million that he had supposedly spent on research .
This is , of course , pure hyperbole ( to be polite ) .
The truth is that Aarhus University has recently detected a significant shortfall in their CDC grant money , and Thorsen is suspected of being to blame .
Apparently , authorities are investigating the shortfall , but it ’s a little early to be calling it a “ massive fraud . ”
Right now , we just do n’t know .
And Thorsen has “ disappeared ” ?
Actually , no , he has just been unavailable for comment .
( Hardly surprising . )
But Kennedy wo n’t let this lack of a real scandal prevent his lawyerly mind from making this a prosecution .
Watch how he runs with it :
Thorsen was a leading member of a Danish research group that wrote several key studies supporting CDC 's claims that the MMR vaccine and mercury - laden vaccines were safe for children .
Thorsen 's 2003 Danish study reported a 20 - fold increase in autism in Denmark after that country banned mercury based preservatives in its vaccines .
His study concluded that mercury could therefore not be the culprit behind the autism epidemic .
Er , no , Thorsen was the sixth named author of one study relating to MMR and the fourth named author of a study on Thimerosal .
I ’m not sure what your definition of “ leading ” would be , but for me it would n’t be sixth out of a team of eight .
Also note Kennedy ’s hysterical “ mercury - laden ” wording .
No , they were n’t “ mercury - laden , ” they contained Thimerosal - a preservative that metabolizes to ( amongst other things ) ethyl mercury , an organic derivative of mercury .
Kennedy writes like a 12 year old .
His study has long been criticized as fraudulent since it failed to disclose that the increase was an artifact of new mandates requiring , for the first time , that autism cases be reported on the national registry .
This new law and the opening of a clinic dedicated to autism treatment in Copenhagen accounted for the sudden rise in reported cases rather than , as Thorsen seemed to suggest , the removal of mercury from vaccines .
This is wrong on many levels .
First , “ Thorsen ” did n’t suggest anything – he was a junior author of the paper , remember ?
Funny how , according to Kennedy , “ Thorsen ” is now the author , the one suggesting things .
The others ( including lead author Madsen ) have n’t been accused of a crime , so they do n’t count , I guess .
Second , the authors of the study did not fail to disclose the new way of counting .
What Kennedy is talking about is that in 1995 , the Danish registry added " Outpatient Clinics " to their count of autism cases – and since outpatient cases are supposedly where 93 % of Danish children are diagnosed with autism , that would inflate the reported number of cases after 1995 .
But , the authors wrote in the “ Results ” section of their study ( that I ’ll link to , although Kennedy does n’t ) :
In additional analyses we examined data using inpatients only .
This was done to elucidate the contribution of the outpatient registration to the change in incidence .
So they did n’t fail to disclose this factor ( as Kennedy claims ) , they actually specifically mentioned it .
They also attempted to allow for it by doing a separate analysis that excluded the increase due to the outpatients .
And even with this analysis , they still found an increase in autism .
As it happens , reported autism was increasing before 1995 anyway :
Kennedy just hopes you wo n’t read the study that he did n’t link to ( and see that graph ) , so you wo n’t notice this .
( As an aside , I find it ironic and hypocritical that Kennedy says the Danish increases in autism do n’t count because they ’re the result of diagnostic changes and increased availability of services , and not a real increase in autism .
When skeptics give the same reasons ( increased diagnosis ) for reported autism rising in the US , Kennedy writes ( in his 2005 article ) that this is “ a theory that seems questionable at best . ”
Consistency was never one of Kennedy ’s flaws . )
Third , the authors never suggested that the increase in autism was “ accounted for ” by the removal of Thimerosal , as Kennedy claimed .
What they actually concluded was :
Our ecological data do not support a correlation between thimerosal - containing vaccines and the incidence of autism .
I guess that ’s a bit too “ sciencey ” for Kennedy to understand .
Despite this obvious chicanery , CDC has long touted the study as the principal proof that mercury - laced vaccines are safe for infants and young children .
Again er , no .
The CDC has not “ long touted ” the study ( or even short touted it , for that matter ) as its “ principal proof ” as Kennedy puts it .
The Danish studies are just one of many .
For example , here are some more peer reviewed studies from around the world :
USA
USA
USA
Canada
UK
Australia
USA
And one more from Denmark .
Of course , none of these studies has Thorsen as an author so I suppose they do n’t count either .
Mainstream media , particularly the New York Times , has relied on this study
This is a good one .
Kennedy must hope that his readers wo n’t click that link because it takes you to a New York Times page that does not discuss Thorsen , Denmark , or anything related to that story at all .
The link is actually to a story about Andrew Wakefield and the Lancet ’s retraction of his terrible paper .
Go figure .
as the basis for its public assurances that it is safe to inject young children with mercury -- a potent neurotoxin -- at concentrations hundreds of times over the U.S. safety limits .
Clearly not , or it would n’t be allowed now would it ?
Thorsen , who was a psychiatrist and not a research scientist or toxicologist ,
Unlike Kennedy , who is a fully qualified medical doctor and toxicologist .
Oh wait , no he ’s not .
parlayed that study into a long - term relationship with CDC .
He built a research empire called the North Atlantic Epidemiology Alliances ( NANEA ) that advertised its close association with the CDC autism team , a relationship that had the agency paying Thorsen and his research staff millions of dollars to churn out research papers , many of them assuring the public on the issue of vaccine safety .
Wow , the CDC paid them to do some work for them .
What a scandal .
Of course , we all know that lawyers work for free .
As did Andrew Wakefield .
The discovery of Thorsen 's fraud
Correction : alleged fraud .
Come on Bobby – I know the science is a bit complicated for you to grasp , but you should know the lawyerey bits at least .
And even if the fraud accusation were true , it would still bare no relation to the study Kennedy is talking about .
[ Repetitive accusations snipped ]
Thorsen 's partner Kreesten Madsen recently came under fierce criticism after damning e-mails surfaced showing Madsen in cahoots with CDC officials intent on fraudulently cherry picking facts to prove vaccine safety .
Kennedy gets even more sleazy here .
Note that the lead author on the papers where Thorsen was a junior author , is now “ Thorsen 's partner . ”
From this very thin connection , Kennedy seeks to connect this story to some supposedly damning emails from Madsen .
But even here , Kennedy ca n’t be transparent .
The link Kennedy provides is to an article describing numerous things , the Madsen emails being only one .
You have to read the whole article to find the link to the actual email within the article ( strangely , linked twice , as though there were two sets of emails , not just one ) .
To save you the time , I ’ll link direct to the email in question .
I ’ll also save a copy on this blog too , just in case .
Now , if you read the actual email ( as I encourage you to do ) , you ’ll be hard pressed to find what ’s “ damning ” about them .
As I read it , it ’s just a CDC researcher asking Madsen for data on autism rates in Denmark ( “ did the rates increase dramatically from the late 1980 ’s into the 1990s ” ) , and Madsen replying that no , they did not increase in the 1980s .
Madsen goes on to say that they did increase after 1993 but that the aforementioned change in registration procedures could account for it .
To repeat , this was something they reported on and attempted to control for in their paper anyway so it ’s not at all “ damning ” except in Kennedy ’s fevered imagination .
Leading independent scientists have accused CDC of concealing the clear link between the dramatic increases in mercury - laced child vaccinations beginning in 1989 and the epidemic of autism , neurological disorders and other illnesses affecting every generation of American children since .
Which leading independent scientists and what clear link ?
Surprise - Kennedy does n’t say .
Also , note the pejorative “ mercury - laced ” wording .
This is one of Kennedy ’s favorite phrases .
Of course the word “ laced ” has connotations of adulteration – secretly adding something improper .
I guess it would be too much for Kennedy just to say “ vaccines containing Thimerosal . ”
Questions about Thorsens 's [ sic ] scientific integrity may finally force CDC to rethink the vaccine protocols since most of the other key pro vaccine studies cited by CDC rely on the findings of Thorsen 's research group .
As I showed above , no they do n’t .
These include oft referenced research articles published by the Journal of the American Medical Association , the American Journal of Preventive Medicine , the American Academy of Pediatrics , the New England Journal of Medicine and others .
The validity of all these studies is now in question .
Nonsense .
The validity of these studies is not in question .
There have been numerous other posts from the anti vax world ( eg this post at the crank Age of Autism blog ) crowing about this , but Kennedy ’s piece is the most absurd ( and that ’s saying something ) of them all .
Of course , Orac wrote an excellent post on this yesterday - Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. on Poul Thorsen :
The fine art of distraction from inconvenient facts , that you should read .
Journalist Brian
Deer left a comment that is better than anything I could write to summarize Kennedy ’s juvenile style , so I ’ll just finish with it :
Cities Under Siege [ Image : Stephen Graham's Cities Under Siege ] .
In a 2003 paper for the feral cities .
“ Imagine a great metropolis covering hundreds of square miles , ” Norton begins , as if narrating the start of a film pitch .
“ Once a vital component in a national economy , this sprawling urban environment is now a vast collection of blighted buildings , an immense petri dish of both ancient and new diseases , a territory where the rule of law has long been replaced by near anarchy in which the only security available is that which is attained through brute power . ”
With the city 's infrastructure having collapsed long ago — or perhaps having never been built in the first place — there are no works of public sanitation , no sewers , no licensed doctors , no reliable food supply , no electricity .
The feral city is a kind of return to medievalism , we might say , back to the future of a dark age for anyone but criminals , gangs , and urban warlords .
It is a space of illiterate power — strength unresponsive to rationality or political debate .
From the perspective of a war planner or soldier , the feral city is also spatially impenetrable , a maze resistant to aerial mapping .
Indeed , its “ buildings , other structures , and subterranean spaces , would offer nearly perfect protection from overhead sensors , whether satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles , ” Norton writes .
This is something Russell W. Glenn , formerly of the RAND Corporation — an Air Force think tank based in Southern California — calls “
Add to this the fact that military ground operations of the near future are more likely to unfold in places like Sadr City , Iraq — not in paragons of city planning like Vancouver — and you have an environment in which soldiers are as likely to die from tetanus , rabies , and wild dog attacks , Norton suggests , as from actual armed combat .
Put another way , as Mike Davis wrote in
But feral cities are one thing , cities under siege are something else .
[ Images : The Fires by Joe Flood and Planet of Slums by Mike Davis ] .
In his new book
One particularly fascinating example of this encroachment of " military dreams ... into the governance of urban civil society " is actually the subject of a forthcoming book by Joe Flood .
Over the next decade — a time New York City firefighters would refer to as " The War Years " — a series of fires swept through the South Bronx , the Lower East Side , Harlem , and Brooklyn , gutting whole neighborhoods , killing more than two thousand people and displacing hundreds of thousands .
Conventional wisdom would blame arson , but these fires were the result of something altogether different : the intentional withdrawal of fire protection from the city 's poorest neighborhoods — all based on RAND 's computer modeling systems .
In any case , Graham 's interest is in the city as target , both of military operations and of political demonization .
In other words , cities themselves are portrayed " as intrinsically threatening or problematic places , " Graham writes , and thus feared as sites of economic poverty , moral failure , sexual transgression , rampant criminality , and worse ( something also addressed in detail by Steve Macek 's book
In some of the book 's most interesting sections , Graham tracks the growth of urban surveillance and the global " homeland security market . "
He points out that major urban events — like G8 conferences , the Olympics , and the World Cup , among many others — offer politically unique opportunities for the installation of advanced tracking , surveillance , and facial - recognition technologies .
Deployed in the name of temporary security , however , these technologies are often left in place when the event is over : a kind of permanent crisis , in all but name , takes over the city , with remnant , military - grade surveillance technologies gazing down upon the streets ( and embedded in the city 's telecommunications infrastructure ) .
A moment of exception becomes the norm .
Graham outlines a number of dystopian scenarios here , including one in which " swarms of tiny , armed drones , equipped with advanced sensors and communicating with each other , will thus be deployed to loiter permanently above the streets , deserts , and highways " of cities around the world , moving us toward a future where " militarized techniques of tracking and targeting must permanently colonize the city landscape and the spaces of everyday life . "
In the process , any real distinction between a " homeland " and its " colonies " is irreparably blurred .
Here , he quotes
This is just one of many " boomerang effects " from militarized urban experiments overseas , Graham writes .
[ Images : Blast walls in Iraq ] .
But what does this emerging city — this city under siege — actually look like ?
What is its architecture , its urban design , its local codes ?
What is its infrastructure ?
Graham has many evocative answers for this .
The city under siege is a place in which " hard , military - style borders , fences and checkpoints around defended enclaves and ' security zones , ' superimposed on the wider and more open city , are proliferating . "
Jersey - barrier blast walls , identity checkpoints , computerized CCTV , biometric surveillance and military styles of access control protect archipelagos of fortified social , economic , political or military centers from an outside deemed unruly , impoverished and dangerous .
In the most extreme examples , these encompass green zones , military prisons , ethnic and sectarian neighborhoods and military bases ; they are growing around strategic financial districts , embassies , tourist and consumption spaces , airport and port complexes , sports arenas , gated communities and export processing zones .
Indeed , almost unnoticed within " civil " urban social science , a shadow system of military urban research is rapidly being established , funded by Western military research budgets .
As Keith Dickson , a US military theorist of urban warfare , puts it , the increasing perception within Western militaries is that " for Western military forces , asymmetric warfare in urban areas will be the greatest challenge of this century ...

( Parts of this post , on feral cities , originally appeared in AD : Architectures of the Near Future , edited by Nic Clear ) .
In a 2003 paper for the Naval War College Review , author Richard J. Norton defined the term .
“ Imagine a great metropolis covering hundreds of square miles , ” Norton begins , as if narrating the start of a film pitch .
“ Once a vital component in a national economy , this sprawling urban environment is now a vast collection of blighted buildings , an immense petri dish of both ancient and new diseases , a territory where the rule of law has long been replaced by near anarchy in which the only security available is that which is attained through brute power .
” With the city 's infrastructure having collapsed long ago — or perhaps having never been built in the first place — there are no works of public sanitation , no sewers , no licensed doctors , no reliable food supply , no electricity .
The feral city is a kind of return to medievalism , we might say , back to the future of a dark age for anyone but criminals , gangs , and urban warlords .
It is a space of illiterate power — strength unresponsive to rationality or political debate .
From the perspective of a war planner or soldier , the feral city is also spatially impenetrable , a maze resistant to aerial mapping .
Indeed , its “ buildings , other structures , and subterranean spaces , would offer nearly perfect protection from overhead sensors , whether satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles , ” Norton writes .
This is something Russell W. Glenn , formerly of the RAND Corporation — an Air Force think tank based in Southern California — calls “ combat in Hell . ”
In his 1996 report of that name , Glenn pointed out that “ urban terrain confronts military commanders with a synergism of difficulties rarely found in other environments , ” many of which are technological .
For instance , the effects of radio communications and global positioning systems can be radically limited by dense concentrations of architecture , turning what might otherwise be an exotic experience of pedestrian urbanism into a claustrophobic labyrinth inhabited by unseen enemy combatants .
Add to this the fact that military ground operations of the near future are more likely to unfold in places like Sadr City , Iraq — not in paragons of city planning like Vancouver — and you have an environment in which soldiers are as likely to die from tetanus , rabies , and wild dog attacks , Norton suggests , as from actual armed combat .
Put another way , as Mike Davis wrote in Planet of Slums , “ the cities of the future , rather than being made out of glass and steel as envisioned by earlier generations of urbanists , are instead largely constructed out of crude brick , straw , recycled plastic , cement blocks , and scrap wood .
Instead of cities of light soaring toward heaven , much of the twenty - first - century urban world squats in squalor , surrounded by pollution , excrement , and decay .
” But feral cities are one thing , are something else .
In his new book Cities Under Siege , published just two weeks ago , geographer Stephen Graham explores " the extension of military ideas of tracking , identification and targeting into the quotidian spaces and circulations of everyday life , " including " dramatic attempts to translate long - standing military dreams of high - tech omniscience and rationality into the governance of urban civil society . "
This is just part of a " deepening crossover between urbanism and militarism , " one that will only become more pronounced , Graham fears , over time .
One particularly fascinating example of this encroachment of " military dreams ... into the governance of urban civil society " is actually the subject of a forthcoming book by Joe Flood .
The Fires tells the story of " an alluring proposal " offered by the RAND Corporation , back in 1968 , " to a city on the brink of economic collapse [ New York City ] : using RAND 's computer models , which had been successfully implemented in high - level military operations , the city could save millions of dollars by establishing more efficient public services . "
But all did not go as planned :
In any case , Graham 's interest is in the , both of military operations and of political demonization .
In other words , cities themselves are portrayed " as intrinsically threatening or problematic places , " Graham writes , and thus feared as sites of economic poverty , moral failure , sexual transgression , rampant criminality , and worse ( something also addressed in detail by Steve Macek 's book Urban Nightmares ) .
All cities , we are meant to believe , already exist in a state of marginal ferality .
I 'm reminded here of Frank Lloyd Wright 's oft - repeated remark that " the modern city is a place for banking and prostitution and very little else .
"
In some of the book 's most interesting sections , Graham tracks the growth of urban surveillance and the global " homeland security market . "
He points out that major urban events — like G8 conferences , the Olympics , and the World Cup , among many others — offer politically unique opportunities for the installation of advanced tracking , surveillance , and facial - recognition technologies .
Deployed in the name of temporary security , however , these technologies are often left in place when the event is over : a kind of permanent crisis , in all but name , takes over the city , with remnant , military - grade surveillance technologies gazing down upon the streets ( and embedded in the city 's telecommunications infrastructure ) .
A moment of exception becomes the norm .
Graham outlines a number of dystopian scenarios here , including one in which " swarms of tiny , armed drones , equipped with advanced sensors and communicating with each other , will thus be deployed to loiter permanently above the streets , deserts , and highways " of cities around the world , moving us toward a future where " militarized techniques of tracking and targeting must permanently colonize the city landscape and the spaces of everyday life .
"
In the process , any real distinction between a " homeland " and its " colonies " is irreparably blurred .
Here , he quotes Michel Foucault : " A whole series of colonial models was brought back to the West , and the result was that the West could practice something resembling colonization , or an internal colonialism , on itself . "
If it works in Baghdad , the assumption goes , then let 's try it out in Detroit .
This is just one of many " boomerang effects " from militarized urban experiments overseas , Graham writes .
But what does this emerging city — this — actually look like ?
What is its architecture , its urban design , its local codes ?
What is its infrastructure ?
Graham has many evocative answers for this .
The city under siege is a place in which " hard , military - style borders , fences and checkpoints around defended enclaves and ' security zones , ' superimposed on the wider and more open city , are proliferating . "
Cities Under Siege also extensively covers urban warfare , a topic that intensely interests me .
From Graham 's chapter " War Re- Enters the City " : Ralph Peters phrased this perhaps most dramatically when he wrote , back in 1996 for the U.S. Army War College Quarterly , that " the future of warfare lies in the streets , sewers , high - rise buildings , industrial parks , and the sprawl of houses , shacks , and shelters that form the broken cities of our world . "
The future of warfare , that is , lies in feral cities .
In this context , Graham catalogs the numerous ways in which " aggressive physical restructuring , " as well as " violent reorganization of the city , " is used , and has been used throughout history , as a means of securing and / or controlling a city 's population .
At its most extreme , Graham calls this " place annihilation . "
The architectural redesign of cities can thus be used as a military policing tactic as much as it can be discussed as a topic in academic planning debates .
There are clearly echoes of Eyal Weizman in this .
On one level , these latter points are obvious : small infrastructural gestures , like public lighting , can transform alleyways from zones of impending crime to walkways safe for pedestrian use — and , in the process , expand political control and urban police presence into that terrain .
But , as someone who does not want to be attacked in an alleyway any time soon , I find it very positive indeed when the cityscape around me becomes both safer by design and better policed .
Equally obvious , though , when these sorts of interventions are scaled - up — from public lighting , say , to armed checkpoints in a militarized reorganization of the urban fabric — then something very drastic , and very wrong , is occurring in the city .
Instead of a city simply with more cops ( or fire departments ) , you begin a dark transition toward a " city under siege .
" I could go on at much greater length about all of this — but suffice it to say that Cities Under Siege covers a huge array of material , from the popularity of SUVs in cities to the blast - wall geographies of Baghdad , from ASBOs in London to drone helicopters in the skies above New York .
Raytheon 's e-Borders program opens the book , and Graham closes it all with a discussion of " countergeographies . "

GM 's financing arm , GMAC was the only entity to be bailed out by a full three rounds of aid and the only bank whereby the U.S. government still holds a majority stake .
Heat is picking up in regards to why GMAC received such special attention .
WaPo :
They also questioned whether the rescue of GMAC , achieved in part by making it a bank , had created a long - term situation in which the government guarantee of bank deposits was subsidizing sales at General Motors and Chrysler .
GMAC is the primary source of financing for GM and Chrysler dealers , and a major source of loans for buyers of their vehicles .
Elizabeth Warren , a Harvard law professor who chairs the panel , said she understood GMAC 's utility for GM and Chrysler .
" What I do n't understand , " she said , " is what the justification is for being an independent bank that takes deposits that has a backup from the United States government . "
...
Ron Bloom , a senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner , told the panel that the rescue of GMAC was necessary to save the automakers , and that the $ 17.2 billion price tag was a good deal for taxpayers .
He said that no other lender or combination of lenders could have quickly replaced GMAC 's role in the marketplace .

Sir David said he was " very concerned " that Western governments were not taking the concept of " peak oil " – where demand outstrips production – seriously enough , while China is throwing all its efforts into grabbing as many energy resources as possible .
The world 's oil reserves have been exaggerated by up to a third , according to Sir David King , the Government 's former chief scientist , who has warned of shortages and price spikes within years .
Ovrstated Reserves
According to the article :
The scientist and researchers from Oxford University argue that official figures are inflated because member countries of the oil cartel , OPEC , over - reported reserves in the 1980s when competing for global market share .
Their new research argues that estimates of conventional reserves should be downgraded from 1,150bn to 1,350bn barrels to between 850bn and 900bn barrels and claims that demand may outstrip supply as early as 2014 .
The researchers claim it is an open secret that OPEC is likely to have inflated its reserves , but that the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , BP , the Energy Information Administration and World Oil do not take this into account in their statistics .
The growth in OPEC reserves , without any corresponding discoveries , is an issue The Oil Drum has talked about various times .
I know I talked about the issue about two years ago , in an article called The Disconnect Between Oil Reserves and Production .
This was a graph I showed at that time , of published oil reserves .
Figure 1
The FSU corresponds to the Former Soviet Union .
The OPEC 11 is the 11 countries that were members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at that time .
( Membership changes over the years a bit . )
As one can see , the vast majority of the reserves are those of OPEC -- but these are not audited .
The reserves the Telegraph article is talking about are " conventional reserves " -- that is , reserves of liquid petroleum , not very heavy reserves that need to be melted , so would leave out the " Oil Sands " reserves in Figure 1 .
Figure 2
Based on the 2008 analysis , Figure 2 shows the distribution of oil production is quite different from that of the reserves .
There is virtually no production from the oil sands , compared to their huge reserves .
OPEC - 11 also has much less production in comparison to its reported reserves .
Figure 3
Figure 3 shows that when one calculates the ratio of oil production to oil reserves , one gets very different ratios for the four groups shown above .
The oil sands , because they have to be melted , can only be produced very , very slowly .
OPEC also seems to have low production compared to reported ( unaudited ) reserves .
Figure 4
When one looks at the history of OPEC reserves shown in Figure 4 , one can see they were raised very substantially in the 1980s , without any corresponding reported new fields being found , apparently because countries were at that time vying for production quotas , and higher reserves might have allowed greater production quotas .
The reserves have not been reduced in recent years , even though oil has been extracted from these fields , tending to add further to questions about these reserves .
Some might ask whether higher oil prices could lead to higher reserves .
If we are talking only about conventional ( that is liquid ) oil , located in the Middle East - - not under some deep sea somewhere -- it seems unlikely that higher price would have much impact on reserves .
Pumping these reserves would n't seem all that expensive , so a higher price of oil should n't have too much impact on the amount of reserves .
Academic Paper Supporting Telegraph Article
The UK Telegraph article is related to a peer reviewed article soon to be published in the journal Energy Policy .
The article is titled The status of conventional world oil reserves —
Hype or cause for concern ? by Nick A. Owen , Oliver R. Inderwildi , David A. King .
The abstract of this article reads :
The status of world oil reserves is a contentious issue , polarised between advocates of peak oil who believe production will soon decline , and major oil companies that say there is enough oil to last for decades .
In reality , much of the disagreement can be resolved through clear deﬁnition of the grade , type , and reporting framework used to estimate oil reserve volumes .
While there is certainly vast amounts of fossil fuel resources left in the ground , the volume of oil that can be commercially exploited at prices the global economy has become accustomed to is limited and will soon decline .
The result is that oil may soon shift from a demand - led market to a supply constrained market .
The capacity to meet the services provided by future liquid fuel demand is contingent upon the rapid and immediate diversiﬁcation of the liquid fuel mix , the transition to alternative energy carriers where appropriate , and demand side measures such as behavioural change and adaptation .
The successful transition to a poly - fuel economy will also be judged on the adequate mitigation of environmental and social costs .
The Key conclusions section of the paper reads :
Jerusalem , settlements , and the “ everybody knows ” fallacy
Throughout the past week the world has heard Israeli government officials and their allies in the US –particularly among the pro-settler crowd — defending construction in East Jerusalem settlements on the grounds that " everybody knows " these areas will always be part of Israel .
The " everybody knows " argument is familiar .
Those in the peace camp often say that everybody knows what an Israeli - Palestinian permanent status agreement looks like .
Their point being : all that is needed is the political will of courageous leaders to work out the final , hardest details and sign the treaty .
But today the " everybody knows " meme has been cynically appropriated by Netanyahu and his supporters .
" Everybody knows these areas in East Jerusalem will always be Israel , " they say , " so when the Palestinians ( and the Americans ) make a fuss about new construction plans , it is just for political purposes , not because there is any real issue . "
Those peddling this rubbish are guilty of transparent manipulation .
Those buying it are guilty of having short memories and an excess of credulity .
In 1993 , when the peace process was taking off , the settlement of Ramat Shlomo — which last week caused such a headache for Vice President Biden — did n’t exist .
The site was an empty hill in East Jerusalem ( not " no man ’s land , " as some have asserted ) , home only to dirt , trees and grazing goats .
It was empty because Israel expropriated the land in 1973 from the Palestinian village of Shuafat and made it off - limits to development .
Only later , with the onset of the peace process era , was the land zoned for construction and a brand - new settlement called Rehkes Shuafat ( later renamed Ramat Shlomo ) built .
If in 1993 you had asked what areas " everybody knows " would stay part of Israel under any future agreement , the area that is today Ramat Shlomo — territorially distinct from any other settlement and contiguous with the Palestinian neighborhood of Shuafat — would not have been mentioned .
The same can be said for the massive settlement of Har Homa , for which Israel issued new tenders in the past few days ( sometime after the Ramat Shlomo - Biden fiasco ) .
Here , again , the argument is that " everybody knows " this area will forever be part of Israel .
But here again , we are talking about an area that at the outset of the peace process was empty land — devoid of Israelis , belonging mainly to Palestinians , and contiguous entirely with Palestinian areas — that anybody drawing a logical border would have placed on the Palestinian side .
American pundits and members of Congress may be unfamiliar with or may have forgotten these inconvenient facts , but the Palestinians — who have watched Israel eat away at East Jerusalem at an increasing pace — have not .
Some will argue that these are the facts on the ground today , and the fact is that Israel will never part with the big East Jerusalem settlements .
So regardless of sins of the past , why make a fuss about new construction in them ?
The answer lies in a closer look at what Netanyahu means when he talks about what " everybody knows . "
Because if he meant that everybody understands what will be Israeli and what will be Palestinian in Jerusalem , this would potentially be great news : it could mean an agreement is possible , at least on Jerusalem , tomorrow .
And if that were what he meant , then just as he suggests that Israel can build without restrictions in the areas that " everybody knows " will stay Israeli , he would have no problem with Palestinians building without restrictions in the areas that everyone knows will be Palestinian .
But there ’s the catch : for Netanyahu , there is no place in Jerusalem that " everybody knows " will be Palestinian .
What Netanyahu really means is that East Jerusalem land falls into two categories : areas that " everybody knows " Israel will keep and where it can therefore act with impunity , and areas that Israel hopes it can keep , by dint of changing so many facts on the ground before a peace agreement is reached that they move into the first category .
It is an approach that can be summed up as : " what ’s mine is mine , and what you think is yours will hopefully be mine , too . "
It discloses with stark clarity the underlying principle of Netanyahu ’s Jerusalem policies : the status of Jerusalem and its borders will be determined by Israeli deeds rather than by negotiations .
More bluntly , who needs agreement with Palestinians or recognition of the international community when " everybody knows " ?
And it is an approach that we see today on the ground , where Israel is doing its best — through construction , demolitions , changes in the public domain — to transform areas of East Jerusalem that have always been overwhelmingly Palestinian into areas that everybody will soon recognize as Israeli , now and forever .
This is happening in the area surrounding the Old City , in the heart of Palestinian neighborhoods like Ras al Amud and Jebel Mukabber , and it is now starting to target areas like Shuafat and Beit Hanina .
The notion that a peace process can survive such an Israeli approach in Jerusalem is not rational .
The notion that Israel can be taken seriously as a peace partner while acting this way is farcical .
And the notion that the United States can be a credible steward of peace efforts while tolerating such behavior is laughable .

The Queensland Government is considering lowering the blood alcohol limit for drivers to 0.02 .
It has released a discussion paper on drink driving , which canvasses dropping the blood alcohol limit from its current level of 0.05 .
The 0.02 limit would bring Australia in line with Norway and Sweden , which record the lowest number of deaths on roads in the world .
Premier Anna
Bligh says it would need to be done nationally , but she has asked Queenslanders to comment .
Spokesmen for state governments in New South Wales and Victoria said there were no plans to change the limit .
Other options include the immediate suspension of drink drivers with a blood alcohol level of 0.1 - down from 0.15 - and the compulsory blood testing of drivers who attend hospital as a result of a road crash .
Last year 71 people died on Queensland roads in crashes involving alcohol , which equates to 21 per cent of the state 's road toll .
Album Reviews :
WITR REVIEW : Tokyo Police Club is back with a new self - titled album !
There seems to be a lot of emotion coming through from lead singer Dave Monks .
The album follows the similar sound they have been producing since 2006 , but it follows more of their original sound than it has the last two albums .
Lot 's of 90's influences in songs like ' Daisy Chain ' .
We have to say our favorite track has been ' Simple Dude ' .
It 's been in the WITR Top 20 for a handful of weeks .
Beach House :
7
WITR REVIEW : Beach House released their 7th Album " 7 " this spring , also marking the 77th track in their catalog .
The Album 's original issue number was also 777 .
Baltimore 's duo Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally continued with a dream pop and lo-fi sound .
Many of the tracks feature repetitive lyrics , and almost all of them have their own sound .
There is a difference between each track although they all feature Legrand 's dreamy voice .
" Pay No Mind " the second track on the album has a very calming feel , but then you continue to the third track " Lemon Glow " and you feel a bit more on edge .
This album is definitely worth a full listen through .
The futurist synth sound will take you on a journey .

Hurricane Season 2010 : Tropical Storm 90Q ( Southern Atlantic )
The second–ever known tropical cyclone in the South Atlantic Ocean can't escape satellite eyes , and today , the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite , GOES - 12 captured a visible image of Tropical Storm 90Q now located off the coast of Argentina .
GOES - 12 satellite captured an image of Tropical Storm 90 Q at 1745 UTC ( 12:45 p.m. ET ) today , March 12 , when it was more than 1,350 miles east of Buenos Aires , Argentina , approximately near 36.5 degrees South latitude and 34.8 degrees
West longitude .
At 10 a.m. ET today , Tropical Storm 90Q still had maximum sustained winds near 46 mph ( 40 knots ) .
GOES - 12 is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , and images are created by NASA 's GOES Project , located at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. Tropical Storm 90Q is now moving quickly in a southeasterly direction and is starting to interact with a mid-latitude frontal system .
By the end of the weekend , the Southern Atlantic Ocean 's second tropical storm in recorded history is expected to be merged with a cold front and just remain in the history books .
Rob Gutro , NASA 's Goddard Space Flight CenterTropical Storm 90Q is the second known tropical cyclone to form in the cooler South Atlantic Ocean , and two NASA satellites confirm it is now moving away from Brazil 's coast .
The first tropical cyclone ever seen in recorded history in the Southern Atlantic was called " Catarina " in 2004 .
The Naval Research Laboratory has provided information on the system , although they will not issue a formal tropical cyclone declaration because the Southern Atlantic is not currently covered by a Regional Specialist Meteorological Center ( because tropical cyclones typically do n't appear there ) , however , that may change in the future .
At 0845 UTC ( 3:45 a.m. ET ) today , March 11 , Tropical Storm 90Q had maximum sustained winds near 46 mph ( 40 knots ) .
It was located about 325 miles east of Porto Alegre , Brazil in the waters of the South Atlantic Ocean near 30.0 South latitude and 45.8
West longitude .
On Wednesday , March 10 , the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission , or TRMM satellite had a fairly good pass this over Tropical Storm 90Q in the morning hours and showed some heavy rainfall , falling at a rate as much as 2 inches per hour on the storm 's southeastern side .
TRMM satellite data was used at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. to create a 3 - D image of 90Q .
The image showed some fairly high thunderstorm tops near the center of the storm reaching to heights above 12.5 km ( over 41,010 feet ) , which corresponds with the areas of heavy rain .
The TRMM satellite is managed by both NASA and the Japanese Space Agency , JAXA .
Early today , March 11 , the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder ( AIRS ) instrument that flies aboard NASA 's Aqua satellite captured an infrared image of 90Q .
The infrared image showed some high , cold thunderstorms in the center of the storm , confirming strong convection in the storm .
"
The only other tropical cyclone known to have occurred in the Southern Atlantic Ocean developed in March , 2004 , " said Hal Pierce , meteorologist on the TRMM satellite team at NASA Goddard .
" That 's when a hurricane called " Catarina " made landfall on March 28 , 2004 near the town of Torres in Rio Grande do Sul , near the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina ( thus , the storm 's name ) .
It was the first " hurricane " ever observed by satellite in the south Atlantic . "
One agency in Brazil also issued warnings on the storm calling it " 1 - T Alfa .
" Tropical Storm 90Q will continue moving in a general easterly direction away from the Brazilian coast and weaken before being absorbed by a mid-latitude cold front this weekend .

Rob Gutro , NASA 's Goddard Space Flight CenterTropical cyclones typically do n't form in the Southern Atlantic because the waters are usually too cool .
However , forecasters at the Naval Research Laboratory noted that a low pressure system off the coast of Brazil appeared to have tropical storm - force winds yesterday .
On Wednesday , March 10 at 1400 UTC ( 9:00 a.m. ET ) " System 90Q " was located near 29.8 degrees South latitude and 48.2 degrees
West longitude , about 180 miles east of Porto Alegre , Brazil .
The Naval Research Laboratory said on March 10 the system had maximum sustained winds near 39 mph ( 35 knots ) but has weakened today below the tropical storm - force winds threshold .
The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite , GOES - 12 captured a visible image of System 90 Q at 14:45 UTC ( 9:45 a.m. ET ) on March 11 , and it appeared as a small circular area of clouds off the Brazilian coast .
GOES is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , and NASA 's GOES Project , located at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. creates some of the GOES satellite images .
System 90Q continues to move away from the Brazilian coast and is expected to be absorbed in a mid-latitude cold front in the next couple of days .

Having a rootkit ( virus ) installed on your PC is a bad thing .
That 's because by definition , rootkits are specialized malware programs that are stealthy in nature and are near - impossible to detect and remove .
In searching for a solution , however , it 's understandable that infected PC owners would look to a software company like Microsoft to fix a problem affecting its operating system -- in this case , Windows XP .
Unfortunately , that 's not the case for many users with PCs suffering from the Alureon rootkit virus .
Microsoft Update Causes Infected PCs to Crash
Alureon , or Win32 / Alureon .A , infects Windows XP system software driver files ( such as atapi.sys and iastor.sys ) .
The virus has the ability to hide itself within most systems and thus prevent detection by many antivirus programs .
Earlier this year , a Microsoft issued a security patch which inadvertently caused PCs infected with the Alureon rootkit to crash and experience the dreaded Blue Screen of Death ( BSoD ) .
Users whose machines are infected with the rootkit are subject to identity theft and credit card fraud , since the virus is designed to steal information like user passwords , financial information , and other data that could allow for remote code execution .
( Source : gaj - it.com )
MS Passes Buck , Avoids Blue Screens of Death
Windows XP users infected with the rootkit had hoped that this issue would have been patched by Microsoft .
Unfortunately , that does n't seem to be the case , as the company 's latest slew of patches delivered on April 13th has been designed specifically not to run on machines infected by the Alureon rootkit .
" These abnormal conditions on a system could be the result of an infection with a computer virus that modifies some operating system files , which renders the infected computer incompatible with the kernel update , " Microsoft noted in a recent security bulletin FAQ .
( Source : bbc.co.uk )
At the time of this publishing , this quote appears to have been removed from Microsoft 's website .
So , why is Microsoft not allowing infected systems to be patched ?
Simply put , the wave of Blue Screens and crashes after the last patch was a nasty event for Microsoft .
Obviously , the company does n't want updates to crash systems , and so any computer detected as running the Alureon will not receive the patch .
What to Do If You 're Infected with the Alureon Rootkit
Those XP machines detected by Microsoft to be infected with Alureon will receive a recommendation to run the company 's antivirus tools or those of a third party , including McAfee , Norton , etc .
Once the rootkit infection has been removed , use the Windows Update service to download the latest patches to update your system .
( CNN ) -- Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback
Ben Roethlisberger will not face criminal charges after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a nightspot , a Georgia prosecutor said .
Roethlisberger was accused of attacking a 20 - year - old woman in the bathroom of a Milledgeville , Georgia , bar and restaurant called Capital City .
" The sexual allegation against Mr. Roethlisberger cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt , " Ocmulgee Judicial Circuit District Attorney Fred Bright said .
" Therefore , there will be no arrest made , nor criminal prosecution of Mr. Roethlisberger for his actions here on March 5 , 2010 . "
Police talked to Roethlisberger , 28 , and the woman at the scene immediately after the incident was reported at the nightclub .
The woman alleged that Roethlisberger was the perpetrator .
The woman , however , also made it clear that she did not want to pursue charges , Bright said .
Her desire did not influence his decision not to prosecute , Bright said .
The woman was part of a group mingling at the club with Roethlisberger 's friends , authorities said .
The groups had been bar - hopping separately earlier in the evening , authorities said .
Roethlisberger followed the woman into a bathroom at the club , and " significant questions about what occurred persist , " Bright said , reiterating that he did not have enough evidence to prosecute successfully .
The doctor who examined the woman told investigators that he could not tell whether bruising on her genitals was from sexual assault , Bright said .
A rape - evidence kit found a small amount of male DNA but not enough to create a profile , he said .
Bright said that if there had been enough evidence to prosecute , he would have .
" We are not condoning Mr. Roethlisberger 's actions that night , but we do not prosecute morals , " he said .
" We prosecute crimes . "
Roethlisberger has guided the Steelers to two Super Bowl championships .
Last year , a civil complaint filed against Roethlisberger also alleged sexual assault .
He denied the allegation made by an executive casino host at Harrah 's Lake Tahoe in Nevada , saying , " Her false and vicious accusations are an attack on my family and on me ; I would never , ever force myself on a woman . "
Roethlisberger and eight Harrah 's employees are named in the suit , which seeks at least $ 390,000 , plus unspecified punitive damages , from the defendants .

Overprotective parents inhibit more than their kids ’ freedom : they may also slow brain growth in an area linked to mental illness .
Children whose parents are overprotective or neglectful are believed to be more susceptible to psychiatric disorders – which in turn are associated with defects in part of the prefrontal cortex .
To investigate the link , Kosuke Narita of Gunma University , Japan , scanned the brains of 50 people in their 20s and asked them to fill out a survey about their relationship with their parents during their first 16 years .

The researchers used a survey called the Parental Bonding Instrument ( pdf ) , an internationally recognised way of measuring children ’s relationships with their parents .
It asks participants to rate their parents on statements like “ Did not want me to grow up ” , “ tried to control everything I did ” and “ tried to make me feel dependent on her / him ” .
Neglectful dads
Narita ’s team found that those with overprotective parents had less grey matter in a particular area of the prefrontal cortex than those who had had healthy relationships .
Neglect from fathers , though not mothers , also correlated with less grey matter .
This part of the prefrontal cortex develops during childhood , and abnormalities there are common in people with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses .
Narita and his team propose that the excessive release of the stress hormone cortisol – due either to neglect , or to too much attention – and reduced production of dopamine as a result of poor parenting leads to stunted grey matter growth .
Anthony Harris , director of the Clinical Disorders Unit at Westmead Hospital in Sydney , Australia , says the study is important for highlighting to the wider community that parenting styles can have long - term effects on children .
Parents to blame ?
But he adds that such brain differences are not always permanent .
“ Many individuals show great resilience , ” he says .
Stephen Wood , who studies adolescent development at the Melbourne Neuropsychiatry Centre in Australia , says the brain abnormalities cannot necessarily be blamed on children ’s relationship with their parents .
He points out that the subjects studied may have been born with the abnormalities and as a result did n’t bond well with their parents , rather than vice versa .
Wood also takes issue with the study team ’s decision to exclude individuals with low socioeconomic status and uneducated parents – two factors known to contribute to poor performance in cognitive tests .
“ The effect they found may be real , but why worry about parenting if there are other factors that are so much larger ? ” he says .

10:40 Updated with responses from magazines .
Magazines ’ newsstand sales plummeted in the last six months of 2009 , and subscriptions dropped as well .
Newsstand sales for the 472 consumer titles in the United States measured by the Audit Bureau of Circulations declined 9.1 percent , to 39.3 million , in the last half of 2009 versus the same period a year earlier , the organization reported this morning .
That follows an 11.12 percent decline from July through December 2007 compared to July through December 2008 .
Some of the well - known titles with dramatic single - copy declines included W , down 41.7 percent to about 25,000 for an average issue ; Newsweek , down 41.3 percent to about 62,000 ( Newsweek had decreased the number of copies on sale , noted a spokesman ) ; SmartMoney , down 37 percent to about 26,000 ; Time , down 34.9 percent to about 90,000 ; Good Housekeeping , down 30.7 percent to 395,000 ; and Redbook , down 30.1 percent to 126,000 .
Newsstand sales tend to be driven by the economy and are a more timely indicator of a magazine ’s vitality than subscriptions , which tend to lag and which can be driven by heavy discounting .
While newsstand sales are a small percentage of most magazines ’ circulation , they are a profitable part of it — publishers typically charge only a fraction of the newsstand price for a subscription copy .
Overall circulation , including subscriptions , fell 2.23 percent .
There were some bright spots .
A magazine called Off - Road Adventures had the highest percentage increase , with overall circulation rising 483 percent — however , it was starting from a very low base of a 40,611 circulation .
Other popular titles that saw spikes were Rodale ’s Women ’s Health , which rose 21.5 percent , from 1.2 million to 1.45 million .
The Disney magazine Family Fun rose 16.7 percent , from 1.9 million to 2.2 million circulation .
And Time Inc. ’s People StyleWatch , which had been one of the few titles to post a big ad - page increase , also saw a circulation bump of 8.6 percent , rising to 803,000 circulation .
Among the 25 biggest magazines , the largest circulation drops were at TV Guide Magazine , which was sold for a dollar to a private - equity firm in 2008 .
Circulation there declined more than a quarter , to 2.4 million .
Reader ’s Digest , which is in the midst of a bankruptcy filing and is cutting the circulation it guarantees advertisers to 5.5 million , fell 13.1 percent to 7.1 million .
And Prevention declined 13.2 percent , to 2.9 million .
The filings also provided intriguing figures about magazines that have been in the news recently .
National Geographic Adventure , which announced it was ceasing publication in December , had a rise in newsstand sales of 1.5 percent , although overall circulation fell by 8.9 percent .
Harper ’s Magazine , where the editor Roger Hodge was dismissed a few weeks ago , saw a decline in newsstand sales of 28.5 percent and an overall circulation drop of 7.2 percent .
Bloomberg BusinessWeek , which is undergoing a makeover from new owner Bloomberg L.P. , had a newsstand - sales drop of 26.1 percent along with a slight drop in overall circulation .
And Bon Appetit , which was expected to benefit from sister publication Gourmet ’s closing , declined both on newsstand sales ( down 9.1 percent ) and subscriptions ( down 6 percent ) .
However , Frederika Brookfield , a spokeswoman , said Gourmet was only closed with its November issue .
As of January 2010 , Bon Appetit ’s circulation increased 15.4 percent , to 1.5 million , which will be reflected in the next Audit Bureau period .

One of the more glaringly obvious missing features over Google Wave 's short public life has been the ability to remove participants from waves .
It has several obvious benefits :
Removing someone who you accidentally added
Removing yourself from a wave that 's no longer interesting
Removing someone who 's not participating in good spirit or at all
Removing another person as a courtesy when the wave is no longer relevant to them
It - Never -Happened
Posted by Dhanji R. Prasanna , Software Engineer , Google Wave team
We knew this would not just be as simple as eliminating a user abruptly from a conversation .
For instance , if you removed your friend as a courtesy , she should still be able to access to the content she has already seen .
Furthermore , the interaction between private replies and the larger wave conversation is interesting .
Should you keep participating in a private reply even though you 've been removed from the main conversation ?
How about if you 've never seen the main conversation ?
Answering these questions is a lot tougher than it may seem at first glance -- particularly considering Google Wave 's unique liveness , where every action has an immediate consequence that 's visible to all participants on a wave .
Designing a scalable infrastructure for this proved challenging , at times confounding , and ultimately very rewarding .
Our coolest innovation in my opinion is what we think of as thescenario .
Imagine this : after a rough day at work , you spend the night out with friends and return home to write a less - than - flattering message to , say , your boss .
At 6 am you wake up and realize what you 've done to your implacable horror !
Alas , with email and other forms of communication , you'd be out of luck , and perhaps spend all morning inventing clever excuses about how your computer was taken over by crafty hackers .
With a wave however , you simply remove your boss as a participant , and when she wakes up at 7 am to check her messages , the wave is gone from her inbox .
But what if she had already opened the wave by the time you removed her from it ?
Well , consider a different scenario : someone adds you to a wave promising they 'll fetch the water if you 'll whitewash their fence .
You open the wave , agree to the proposition , and proceed with the whitewashing .
Yards of fence later , that someone removes you from the wave .
You certainly would want to have a record of the deal ( ' Ithappened ' ) !
Since you had opened the wave before you were removed from it , you retain a read - only copy of the wave up to the time you were removed .
You can still play back the wave , but you wo n't see future changes or be able to make further contributions .
We carefully designed the feature so neither the person who removed you , nor others on the wave can see whether or not you have opened the wave .
They can only tell you have been removed and that you no longer see changes to the wave ( unless , of course , someone adds you back ) .
Finally , you also have the option to remove yourself from a wave .
We 've all been added to conversation threads that turned out to be unimportant or uninteresting .
With email you have to ask someone else to take you off the thread , or set up a filter to stop those messages from appearing in your inbox .
Now in Wave , when your friend adds you to a wave about the dinner party he 's having the same weekend that you 're out of town for business , you can simply remove yourself from the wave and you wo n't have a constant reminder of all the fun you 'll be missing .
We hope the considerable amount of effort we 've put into designing and building this feature increases your productivity and ability to organize and share waves the way you want .
Wave on !
Ancient fishing lore and modern marine biology are both unnerved by the number of rare oarfish that have been washing up along the Sea of Japan .
To fishermen , the legendary oarfish , a deep - sea fish that can grow to 15 metres long , heralds either a great catch – or an earthquake , The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported .
Since November , at least 19 have washed up in eight Japanese prefectures .
Most were dead or died shortly after they were found .
It ’s rare to see a http://www.educatedearth.net/video.php?id=3869live oarfish , long believed to be the source of stories about sea serpents and dragons .
Seiji Sasai of the Echizen Matsushima Acquarium in Sakai , Japan , found two in four days .
“ It is baffling why these rare creatures emerged within such a short time , ” he told Ashai Shimbun .
Oarfish normally live at depths of 1,000 metres or more .
“ We have no idea where they spawn or how they grow , ” Masaki Miya , a senior researcher at the Natural History Museum and Institute in Chiba Prefecture , said .
“ With few clues , it is hard to say why oarfish have been found one after another . ”
Japan is the most earthquake - prone country in the world .
“ In ancient times , Japanese people believed that fish warned on coming earthquakes .
There is no scientific relationship between these sightings and an earthquake , ” Hiroshi Tajihi , deputy director of the Kobe Earthquake Centre , told the Daily Telegraph .
The legend is n’t confined to Japan , but extends to other Asian countries .
A 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck southern Taiwan March 4 , following the 8.8 magnitude earthquake last month in Chile and the 7.0 earthquake in Haiti on Jan. 12 .
A 6.0 earthquake hit Turkey on Monday .
The string of earthquakes is probably just a coincidence , seismologists told The Associated Press .
“ I can definitely tell you that the world is not coming to an end , ” Bob Holdsworth , an expert in tectonics at Durham University in northeast England , said Monday .

Crime fighting Good Samaritans can take on all forms , and apparently that includes in the form of a 3,900 pound , rear - drive Cadillac CTS .
FailBlog has stumbled upon a what looks to be a Chinese news program running street camera footage of a petty thief stealing the purse of an unsuspecting woman .
But instead of running off into the night , the robber is instead intercepted by the Caddy driver in rather spectacular fashion .
It 's almost a good enough display to have us wondering about the authenticity of what 's going on ( there are a lot of staged viral videos these days ) , but assuming it 's the real deal , now might be a good time to change Cadillac 's tagline to " Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Bad Guys . "
Hit the jump to watch the Caddy doing Starsky and Hutch proud .

Thousands in El Salvador honored last week the life of Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero , who was assassinated 30 years ago while giving Mass in a hospital chapel in San Salvador .
Romero is revered as a champion of the poor , who spoke out against the brutal repression led by the ruling right - wing government and Salvadoran army during the late 1970s .
Marking the anniversary of Romero ’s death , El Salvador ’s President Mauricio Funes apologized on behalf of the state for the assassination and for the thousands of innocent victims lost in the war that ended in 1992 .
For the first time , the Salvadoran government publicly commemorated Romero ’s life .
“ This is something that should have been done a long time ago , ” Funes said at a ceremony unveiling a colorful mural of Romero in San Salvador ’s international airport last week .
“ It is my greatest wish that this act in the name of Monsignor Romero can serve to bring consolation and that we no longer live with resentments . ”
Funes said that although previous administrations have ignored Romero ’s life and teachings , his would “ correct that historic error ” and put an end to decades of “ silence ” that have enshrouded the killing .
Romero is remembered by many as a national hero for social justice and human rights that called for an end to the growing political violence in El Salvador .
He continues to be admired throughout much of Latin America and the Catholic world .
But he was also despised by the wealthy , hard - line right , which were threatened by his advocacy on behalf of the country ’s poor and painted as a Marxist .
The anti-Communist right regarded him as a Communist sympathizer .
His murder has long been blamed on Major Roberto D’Aubuisson , mastermind of El Salvador ’s notorious death squads that killed dissidents , union activists , priests and rebels with virtual impunity .
D’Aubuisson was also a founder of the Nationalist Republican Alliance Party , called ARENA , which ruled El Salvador for 20 years before Funes and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( FMLN ) won the presidency a year ago .
D’Aubuisson died in 1992 .
Funes said right - wing death squads that killed Romero acted with the protection , collaboration or participation of the state .
“ These illegal armed groups terrorized the civilian population during those dark years , leaving behind thousands of victims , ” he said .
Executions , kidnappings and torture of the country ’s rural poor and activists who opposed El Salvador ’s right - wing government had become commonplace in the late 1970s , all of which were condemned by Romero .
After his death the country plunged into a bloody civil war during the 1980s between FMLN guerillas and the U.S. - backed far right and military forces including ARENA .
Some 75,000 people died in the war .
Peace accords were signed in 1992 and all FMLN units were demobilized and the organization became a legal party .
However , ARENA went on to rule the country election after election from 1989 to 2009 .
Nobody has been convicted for Romero ’s murder .
Thirty years later , justice for Romero and thousands of victims during the civil war remains elusive .
Amnesty International is calling on El Salvador to repeal the 1993 amnesty law that protects former U.S. - backed death squad assassins from trial for human rights abuses .
Funes has said Romero is his “ spiritual guide ” and he has emphasized the importance of justice and human rights in his administration .
But he has also warned against revenge and suggested that repealing the amnesty law would dangerously open up old wounds .
Still after two decades of right - wing governments in El Salvador many say the historic inauguration of Funes last year is a sign that change , hope and justice – everything Romero stood for is finally becoming a reality .

San Francisco officials
Tuesday ordered the shutdown of all drug testing at the police crime lab amid allegations that a former technician stole and used some of the cocaine she was supposed to analyze .
Deborah J. Madden , 60 , of San Mateo officially retired this month .
An investigation linked her to missing drugs in at least six cases in the latter part of 2009 , police said .
She left her job as of Dec. 8 and has recently been in treatment for drugs and alcohol and other unspecified health issues , police said .
Officials discovered that the evidence was missing during a crime lab audit conducted in December , police said .
That review was triggered when other technicians suspected someone had been stealing evidence and a supervisor noticed apparent tampering with the packaging of drug evidence , San Francisco Police Chief George Gascón said at a news conference Tuesday evening .
" We 're being very , very cautious here , " Gascón said , calling the matter " disappointing " but stressing that the department is going out of its way to be transparent and to make sure any improprieties are limited to the one former employee .
" It puts the hard work of every other employee of the crime lab into question , " the chief said , adding that the department will bring in outside agencies to do a thorough review of the drug - testing section of the crime lab , which had two technicians at the time Madden worked there .
She was the supervising criminalist over the testing .
Gascón said that when interviewed as part of the investigation , she had leveled charges of her own about the lack of control over drug evidence .
One official said Madden called the drug - testing process at the lab " sloppy . "
In her job , Madden was supposed to vouch for the weight and purity of seized drugs but instead used the cocaine , authorities say .
While only the six cases have been discovered where she allegedly skimmed the drugs , the investigation is continuing .
When The Chronicle reached her at home , Madden declined to comment .
" I do n't know anything about it , " she said .
San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris could not say how many cases might ultimately be jeopardized by the thefts , but said that at least 20 drug cases could be dismissed immediately as a result of the shutdown of the crime lab 's drug section .
The evidence in the cases will be retested by either the federal Drug Enforcement Administration or labs in Alameda or San Mateo counties , which would do the testing on San Francisco 's behalf .
" We need to regroup and re-evaluate " drug testing by the Police Department , Harris said .
The lab handles as many as 50 drug cases a day .
Police officials said that while the amounts stolen were small , they were in each instance measurable , and involved cases in which suspects were arrested for selling cocaine .
It is unclear what will happen with those six cases , but in some of them Madden might have been summoned to testify and therefore could have perjured herself about the evidence .
Madden had been working as a criminalist for the city for 29 years and earned $ 122,000 last year in salary and overtime .
She is free on $ 40,000 bail in San Mateo County , where she was arrested March 3 on weapons charges as a result of a search of her home .
San Francisco and San Mateo County officers searched her home last month and found a gun , which she is barred from having because of a domestic violence case , and a small amount of cocaine .
Steve Wagstaffe , chief deputy district attorney in San Mateo County , said Madden was not supposed to possess a weapon as she had been convicted by a jury in 2008 in a misdemeanor domestic violence case lodged the year before .
She is due back in court April 5 on the weapons case .
Also on Tuesday , police released an audit by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors that shows the San Francisco lab does not have a secure chain of custody for evidence , fails to keep detailed case records and does not meet standards of cleanliness .
The audit found that the lab is routinely underfunded and understaffed and has to rely on overtime to fulfill its mission .
William Gallas could be on the sidelines for another month after suffering a recurrence of his calf injury .
Key Arsenal defender facing another month on sidelines
Pushed
Arsenal defender William Gallas could be on the sidelines for another month after suffering a recurrence of his calf injury .
The France international has not played since the 1 - 0 victory over Liverpool at Emirates Stadium on 10th February and could now miss another significant chunk of the remainder of the campaign after breaking down in training .
Gunners boss Arsene Wenger admitted the centre - back 's problem had gone back to square one and was unsure when the former Chelsea man would be fit to return .
Sol Campbell has been passed fit for Tuesday night 's meeting with Porto but Wenger has confessed he may have to rotate the ex-England defender with Mikael Silvestre on a match - by - match basis .
Further disruption would be caused by Silvestre 's preference to play on the left of any pairing , meaning that the left - footed Thomas Vermaelen would be required to shift to the right .
" Gallas has been out for a month and now he has had a recurrence of his calf injury , " Wenger said .
" He felt very well on Sunday and went out but he has gone backwards again .
We are at the starting point with Gallas unfortunately .
" At the beginning , it was a minor injury .
We do n't know how long it will be but for Hull , for example , he has no chance .
" We were impatient with him , we pushed him and he wanted to get on as well ; that is why , maybe , it has happened .
" But there is no obvious sign as to why it keeps coming back .
He has no pain at all , then he goes for a little jog and it goes again . "
As well as confirming that Cesc Fabregas would be unable to play against Porto , Wenger also acknowledged that Andrey Arshavin was not yet fit enough to play 90 minutes after his recent hamstring injury .
" I have to find a balance in the team , to be offensively strong without neglecting our defensive side and to think about the players , if they start , who will last the 90 minutes , " Wenger said .
" Arshavin is certainly a player who will not last 90 minutes if he starts . "
WASHINGTON — Brash and young though it is , the Tea Party movement has already added something distinctive to contemporary political discourse .
It has made the Constitution central to the national conversation .
The content of the movement ’s understanding of the Constitution is not always easy to nail down , and it is almost always arguable .
But it certainly includes particular attention to the Constitution ’s constraints on federal power ( as reflected in the limited list of powers granted to Congress in Article I and reserved to the states and the people the 10th Amendment ) and on government power generally ( the Second Amendment ’s protection of gun rights , the Fifth Amendment ’s limits on the government ’s taking of private property ) .
Not a few constitutional scholars say that it is possible to quarrel with the particulars while welcoming the discussion .
And not just because it is nice to know that people read and care about the nation ’s sacred text .
The larger point , these scholars say , is that the Supreme Court should have no more monopoly on the meaning of the Constitution than the pope has on the meaning of the Bible .
“ It really is open to interpretation by anybody , in what I sometimes call the lawyerhood of all citizens , ” said Sanford Levinson , a law professor at the University of Texas .
“ Anybody in a bar can get into a shouting argument over what equal protection means , or the right to free speech . ”

The Growing Movement For Publicly - Owned Banks ANALYSIS : The Growing Movement For Publicly - Owned Banks by Ellen Hodgson Brown , J.D. Earlier published on her website on March 18th , 2010 .
As the states ’ credit crisis deepens , four states have initiated bills for state - owned banks , and candidates in seven states have now included that solution in their platforms .
“ Hundreds of job - creating projects are still on hold because Michigan businesses and entrepreneurs cannot get bank financing .
We can break the credit crunch and beat Wall Street at their own game by keeping our money right here in Michigan and investing it to retool our economy and create jobs . ”
-- Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero in the Detroit News , May 9 , 2010 Struggling with 14 % unemployment , Michigan has been particularly hard hit by the nation ’s economic downturn .
Virg Bernero , mayor of the state ’s capitol and a leading Democratic candidate for governor , proposes that the state relieve its economic ills by opening a state - owned bank .
He says the bank could protect consumers by making low - interest loans to those most in need , including students and small businesses ; and could help community banks by buying mortgages off their books and working with them to fund development projects .
Bernero joins a growing list of candidates proposing this sensible solution to their states ’ fiscal ills .
Local economies have collapsed because of the Wall Street credit freeze .
To reinvigorate local business , Main Street needs a heavy infusion of credit ; and publicly - owned banks could fill that need .
A February posting tracked candidates in five states running on a state - bank platform and one state with a bill pending ( Massachusetts ) .
There are now three more bills on the rolls – in Washington State , Illinois and Michigan – and two more candidates on the list of proponents ( joining Bernero is Gaelan Brown of Vermont ) .
That brings the total to seven candidates in as many states ( Florida , Oregon , Illinois , California , Washington State , Vermont , and Idaho ) , including three Democrats , two Greens , one Republican and one Independent .
The Independent , Vermont ’s Gaelan Brown , says on his website , “ Washington DC has lost all moral authority over Vermont . ”
He maintains that : “ Vermont should explore creating a State - owned bank that would work with private VT - based banks , to insulate VT from Wall Street corruption , and to increase investment capital for VT businesses , modeled after the very successful State - owned Bank of North Dakota . ”
The Bank of North Dakota , currently the nation ’s only state - owned bank , is the model ( with variations ) for all the other proposals on the table .
The Bank of North Dakota acts as a “ bankers ’ bank , ” including doing “ participation loans ” with other banks , allowing them to compete with larger banks .
In a participation loan , the community bank originates the loan and takes responsibility for it , while the participating bank contributes funds and shares in the risk and profits .
The Bank of North Dakota also makes low - interest loans to students , farmers and businesses ; underwrites municipal bonds ; and serves as the state ’s “ Mini Fed , ” providing liquidity and clearing checks for more than 100 banks around the state .
Three New Bills Pending for Publicly - owned Banks Proposals for publicly - owned banks in other states have now gone beyond the campaign talk of political hopefuls to be drafted into several bills .
The Michigan Development Bank The Michigan bill has gotten the most press .
Introduced into the legislature earlier this month , it mirrors Bernero ’s state bank idea .
According to a press release issued by Senate Democrats on March 9 , the bill ’s aim is to “ keep Michigan ’s money in Michigan ” by putting tax dollars into a proposed “ Michigan Development Bank ” .
The Bank would function like a traditional bank but would focus on economic development rather than profit .
The press release quoted Senator Gretchen Whitmer ( D - East Lansing ) : “ Investing in the state ’s economy is the greatest way to create jobs , and this proposal will provide small businesses and entrepreneurs the funding they need to invest and grow .
Our economy has stagnated due in part to stale thinking in Lansing , and this is just the type of innovative idea we need to create real economic change , using our own money to rebuild the state . ”
Senate Democratic Leader Mike Prusi ( D - Ishpeming ) stated : “ Michigan ’s economy has been suffering , and working families in the state have had difficulty keeping up with credit card bills , college tuition prices and mortgage payments .
Establishing the Michigan Development Bank will keep our hard - earned dollars right here in the state to invest in small business , create good - paying jobs to get people back to work , and help protect the middle class . ”
Also quoted was Senator Hansen Clarke ( D - Detroit ) : “ With the current state of our economy , every dollar counts , yet we ’re depositing our money in other people ’s pockets by investing in big corporate banks without seeing much lending in return .
It ’s time for the Mitten State to lend itself a helping hand and establish a bank that is willing to invest in our small businesses and offer the financial support necessary to see job growth . ”
For startup capital , Senate Democrats suggested that Michigan could sell voter - approved bonds .
With an initial capitalization of $ 150 million , they estimated the bank could lend up to $ 1 billion to small businesses , students and farmers , and offer low - interest credit cards to consumers .
For deposits , the bank could follow the model of the Bank of North Dakota and use state revenues .
So says Gene Taliercio , a Republican candidate for the state Senate , who has also put his weight behind the Michigan Development Bank .
In a video clip on the website of the local Oakland Press , he says : “ We ’re talking about restructuring the whole tax system , in the sense that the way its set up is that all taxes are going to go into this central bank .
. . .
Every dollar that the state of Michigan makes goes into this bank . ”
The State Bank of Washington A similar bill , HB 3162 , was introduced to the Washington State Legislature on February 1 .
The bill has generated so much interest that Steve Kirby , chair of the Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee , has scheduled a special work session on it .
According to John Nichols in The Nation , the State Bank of Washington was formally proposed by House finance committee vice chair Bob Hasegawa , a Seattle Democrat .
Nichols quotes Hasegawa : “ Imagine financing student aid , infrastructure , industry and community development .
Imagine providing access to capital for small businesses , or otherwise leveraging our resources instead of having to do it with tax incentives .
Imagine keeping our resources local instead of exporting them as profits , never to be seen again — that ’s what this bank could do . ”
Leveraging rather than taxing is how private banks have been creating “ credit ” for centuries .
States could do the same thing , cutting the middlemen out of the equation , saving significant sums in interest and fees and generating revenue for the state .
A nonpartisan analysis of the Washington bill prepared for the state legislature noted that the bank would be the depository for all state funds and the funds of state institutions , and that these deposits would be guaranteed by the state .
The bank would be run by a board of 11 members and would be chaired by the State Treasurer .
It would have the same rules and privileges as a private bank chartered in the state .
To get the bank off the ground , voters would have to approve amendments to the state Constitution , since current law prohibits the state from lending credit and investing in private firms .
The Community Bank of Illinois A third bill , introduced by Illinois Representative Mary Flowers , is on its way through the legislative process in Illinois .
According to the Illinois General Assembly website , the Community Bank of Illinois
Act would establish a state bank with the express purpose of boosting agriculture , commerce and industry .
State funds and money held by penal , educational , and industrial institutions owned by the state would be deposited in the bank and would serve as reserves for loans .
The bank could also serve as a clearinghouse for other banks , including handling domestic and foreign exchange ; and it could buy property under Eminent Domain .
All deposits would be guaranteed with the assets of the state .
The Bank would be managed and controlled by the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation , with input from an advisory board representing private banking and public interests .
An amendment to the initial bill would enable the Community Bank of Illinois to make loans directly to the state ’s General Revenue Fund , helping the state cope with its current budget challenges .
A Massachusetts - owned Bank On March 12 , the Associated Press reported that a jobs bill sponsored by Massachusetts Senate President Therese Murray also includes a call to study a Massachusetts - owned bank .
She told a business group that a state - owned bank has worked in North Dakota , helping to insulate that state from the worst of the recession while also keeping its foreclosure rate down .
A state - owned bank could spur job creation and free up lending to Massachusetts businesses .
Grandfather of the Concept : The Bank of North Dakota
All of these proposals take their inspiration from the Bank of North Dakota , which was founded in 1919 to resolve a credit crisis like that facing other states today .
Last year , North Dakota had the largest budget surplus it had ever had ; and it was the only state that was actually adding jobs when others were losing them .
In March 2009 , when 46 of 50 states were in fiscal crisis , North Dakota was in the enviable position of discussing tax cuts and looking for ways to spend its surplus .
By January 2010 , according to a National Public Radio news clip , only two states could still meet their budgets – North Dakota and Montana .
On February 8 , however , the Montana paper the Missoulian reported that the Montana State Legislature ’s chief revenue forecaster foresees a budget deficit by mid-2011 , leaving North Dakota the only state still boasting a surplus .
North Dakota ’s riches have been attributed to oil , but many states with oil are floundering .
The sole truly distinguishing feature of North Dakota seems to be that it has managed to avoid the Wall Street credit freeze by owning and operating its own bank .
According to the North Dakota Department of Commerce , the BND turned a profit in 2009 of $ 58.1 million ; and this money goes into the state ’s General Fund .
North Dakota ’s economy is ten times smaller than Michigan ’s , suggesting that Michigan could generate $ 500 million per year in this way ; and Washington State and Illinois present similarly inviting possibilities .
That defuses the objection raised in a March 15 editorial in The Detroit News , arguing that Michigan can ill afford the $ 150 million capital investment to start a bank .
If operated like the BND , the Michigan Development Bank would soon be a net generator of state revenues .
There are other possibilities besides a bond issue for providing the capital to start a bank , but that subject will be reserved for another article .
The BND ’s 90 - year track record of prudent and profitable lending defuses another objection to state - owned banks : that a public agency cannot be trusted to act responsibly in managing public funds .
The Detroit News editorial concluded that Michigan should “ leave banking to the bankers , ” but it is precisely because the bankers have destroyed the economy with their reckless lending practices that the public needs to step in .
We need a “ public option ” in banking to set standards and keep private banks honest .
The True Potential of Publicly - owned Banks North Dakota broke new ground nearly a century ago , but the true potential of publicly - owned banks remains to be explored .
Nearly all of our money today is created by banks when they extend loans .
( See the Chicago Federal Reserve ’s “ Modern Money Mechanics ” , which begins , “ The actual process of money creation takes place primarily in banks . ” )
We the people have given away our sovereign money - creating power to private , for - profit lending institutions , which have used it to siphon wealth from the productive economy .
If we were to take that power back , we could generate the credit we need to underwrite a whole cornucopia of projects that we do n’t even consider because we think we lack the “ money . ”
We have the labor and we have the materials ; we just lack the “ liquidity ” necessary to put them together to create products and services .
Money today is just a ticket , a receipt for work performed and goods delivered .
We can fund the work we need done by creating our own credit .
The real promise of publicly - owned banks is not that they can bail out subprime borrowers but that they can jumpstart the economy by creating real wealth .
They can provide the liquidity to put labor and materials together , allowing the economy to build and grow .
Our private , profit - driven banking sector has been bleeding wealth from the rest of the economy .
Public - interest banks can transfuse the economy with the credit it needs to flourish and be productive once again .

Scuderia Toro Rosso became the latest team to unveil its 2010 challenger on Monday , as the Faenza - based team 's STR5 was shown for the first time .
The new car is the first machine that Toro Rosso has had to produce itself , following the effective ban on customer cars in F1 .
" 2010 is a landmark year for Scuderia Toro Rosso as the new regulations demand that we go it alone in terms of designing and building our car in - house , " said team boss Franz Tost .
" After four years of working in collaboration with Red Bull Technology , the TR5 is the first car that is one hundred percent down to our own endeavours .
" Creating the necessary infrastructure to tackle this task has been our biggest challenge , possibly more difficult than actually producing the car itself .
We have taken on an additional eighty staff and expanded our facility to accommodate them , including a Machine Shop to increase our production capacity .
" In addition , we have commissioned a wind tunnel in Bicester , England , which we bought from Red Bull .
It will take time for the highly skilled team we have assembled to learn to work together as efficiently as possible .
" Making predictions for the coming season is a dangerous trap , but if pushed , I would say we must aim to finish in the top eight in the Constructors '
Championship , while giving our young drivers everything they need to improve , as well as optimising our infrastructure in order to be as competitive as possible in 2010 and beyond . "
Although conservative in its philosophy , the car features a fully - optimised double diffuser - with the team having had to incorporate the concept into last year 's STR4 mid-season following the FIA decision that the designs were legal .
" At the end of last year , we had already increased our staff to around one hundred and fifty and now we have two hundred .
At the end of March ' 09 , we got the green light as to what actually constituted being an F1 Constructor , " added technical director Giorgio Ascanelli .
" That was the starting point for building up our operation in such a way that we could actually design a car that was achievable in engineering terms , working in a different way to the methods we had adopted in the past .
" Being recognised as a Constructor involves owning the intellectual property rights to what are defined as the listed parts : these are effectively the monocoque , the safety structures that are subject to homologation and crash testing , which means the rear and front structures , primary and secondary roll - over structures and the complete aerodynamic package , the suspension , fuel and cooling systems .
" Before even thinking about producing a car , we had to acquire the right tools to carry out these tasks and also hire the people who are to use these structures .
Finding fifty people and putting them in an environment where they can do their job has been a tough task .
" As for the challenge we face this season , to quote Mao Tse- tung , 'we should not be talking about what we will do when we have crossed the river , we must first get the bridges and ships with which to cross the river . '
" We have started by building those bridges and ships .
We are not quite there yet and , at this stage , getting everyone to work together in a productive fashion is our most important task . "
Sebastien Buemi is due to give the new Toro Rosso its first laps today , when the first official pre-season F1 test kicks off at Valencia .
The Swiss driver will again be partnered by Spaniard Jaime Alguersuari .
( CNN ) -- Tropical Cyclone Tomas battered Fiji's northern islands on Monday evening with gusts of up to 275 km/h ( 170 mph ) and heavy rain , but weather officials had not received immediate reports of damage .
The Category 4 storm is the second - most destructive on a five - point scale .
As it heads southeast , it is expected to sideswipe the main island , Viti Levu .
The South Pacific nation 's capital , Suva , is on that island .
" The closest it will come is 200 km ( 124 miles ) to the east of Suva , " said Alipate Waqaicelua , forecaster for the Nadi Tropical Cyclone Center .

Still , the storm inundated the capital with heavy rain and strong winds .
Authorities imposed a nighttime curfew .
Schools have been ordered closed till Thursday , and banks were shuttered till Tuesday , said resident Moses Waqavonovono .
" Squatter houses have been blown away in the gusting winds , " he said .
" The stronger structures will take a hard hitting tomorrow . "

Is US politics nastier than ever ?
US President Barack Obama has given his angriest speech since he was elected while a debate rages over his healthcare reforms .
Mark Mardell considers whether America really is more divided than ever .
Protesters have declared war on Obama 's healthcare policies
When the bearded activist in wraparound sunglasses put his hand on my shoulder , I felt his anger .
Not in an intuitive Californian sense - his jittering arm physically transmitted the motion of a body literally trembling with rage .
He was part of what is known as the Tea Party movement , the conservative opposition to Washington politics .
He had joined a demonstration outside a college in Philadelphia , where President Obama was about to give a speech on his plans for healthcare reform .
Taking his hand off my shoulder , the protester pointed to his placard .
On it was a cartoon of the president as Batman 's arch villain , the Joker , in white make - up with a creepy , clownish , slash of scarlet for a mouth .
He jabbed at one word on the banner : war .
" That is what it means , " he told me .
" War. Civil war . "
There is little doubt American politics is going through a torrid period but is it really nastier than before ?
Every day I am told the frustration with Washington is greater , politics is more vicious , more partisan , America is more divided than ever .
The Washington Post writes of chaos , a political storm , disarray and disorder .
And that is all in just one edition of the paper .
I was chatting with a veteran American cameraman who has covered every presidential election for 30 years .
He believes the poll in 2012 will be the nastiest yet .
Below the belt ?
Certainly the case for the prosecution is strong and healthcare has its fingerprints over most of the exhibits .
One congressman has accused the president 's chief of staff of being the son of the spawn of the devil .
The odd thing is , they are both Democrats .
Obama 's health proposals would be too right - wing for Europe 's conservatives
The congressman claims he was forced to resign , not because he made lascivious remarks to a male staff member after apparently drinking 15 gin and tonics and numerous bottles of champagne , but because he voted the wrong way on healthcare .
Healthcare is also central to a Powerpoint presentation by Republican fundraisers , which features the cartoon I have mentioned before .
Not only is the president depicted as the Joker , but the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is shown as Cruella de Vil , and the Leader of the Senate Harry Reid is pictured as Scooby Doo .
The association with possibly the most irritating cartoon character ever does seem below the belt , and the Republican leadership has distanced itself from the planned campaign and its slogan :
Save the country from trending toward socialism .
While it is clearly too late to stop the US trending toward using nouns as verbs , I can ask : " Is the US trending towards the nastiest set of elections ever ? "
The sharp divisions between parties that are normal in British and European politics have been muddier here
But surely the political atmosphere now is not as sour as it was when I was a teenager , when you could feel the waves of hatred towards Nixon washing across the Atlantic .
Is it worse now than in the era of race riots and Vietnam protests , when students were shot dead on campus ?
Is it worse than when congressmen shared cosy bipartisan drinks on the Hill , but Americans could not share the same drinking fountain ?
Hardly .
But perhaps this is the latest tremor in a decades - long seismic realignment of American politics .
It seems to me the sharp divisions between parties of left and right that are normal in British and European politics have been muddier here .
The broad coalitions often reached deep into each other 's middle ground .
A lot of it is to do with the legacy of their civil war .
Cultural gulf
The Democrats could never become a serious liberal or left - wing party while so many of their members from the South defended white supremacy .
The way forward in healthcare has bitterly divided Americans
Those days may be long gone but there are still social and fiscal conservatives who might be more comfortable as Republicans but are in fact Democrats , because , well , because Grandaddy was .
One British left - winger used to say : " There are two parties in American politics ; one is like our Conservative Party .
So is the other . "
He had a point .
But perhaps not any more .
The people on both sides who paraded their bitter divisions on the streets during the 60s and 70s have been steadily moving indoors , into the Senate , the Congress and the White House .
And America cannot really get used to the fact politics cannot be bipartisan while there is such an ideological gulf between people and parties .
At that Philly rally , I chat to several white - haired ladies who joke that my TV microphone looks just like their feather duster .
There are people in the US who would see David Cameron as a socialist
A retired couple , enjoying one of the first Spring - like days since the snow , placidly share their firm beliefs with me : Obama , they maintain , is a socialist and healthcare is about a government power grab .
This is where there is a cultural gulf .
No Conservative party in Europe would touch Obama 's proposals .
They are far too right - wing .
And there are people in the US who would see David Cameron as a socialist , after all he supports a state - run national health service .
One version of the many Tea Party pledges I have seen has , as point seven : " I work hard for what I have and I will share it with who I want to .
Government cannot force me to be charitable . "
One of the refreshing things about American politics is that it questions what to us has become common place .
While they may argue about the detail , all British political parties support the redistribution of wealth through a progressive tax system .
Many in the Tea Party movement see that as creeping socialism .
This is about what sort of country America becomes - and it is bound to get even angrier .

Rochelle And Marvin Humes Children : How Many Kids Do They
Have And What Are Their Baby Names ?
La Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación dio ayer el primer paso para que detenidos por narcomenudeo obtengan su libertad bajo fianza antes del plazo inicialmente fijado .
Al conceder el primer amparo en contra del artículo tercero transitorio del decreto que modificó diversas disposiciones de la Ley General de Salud , del Código Penal Federal y del Código Federal de Procedimientos Penales , los ministros avalaron la reducción de la pena máxima de 10 a ocho años de prisión , con lo que los quejosos pueden obtener su libertad bajo fianza .
La primera sala del máximo tribunal estableció que la reforma referida –publicada en el Diario Oficial el 27 de agosto de 2009 – viola el principio de retroactividad , previsto en el artículo 14 constitucional .
Esto , porque el texto impugnado señala que a las personas que hayan cometido un delito de los contemplados en el presente decreto con anterioridad a su entrada en vigor , incluidas las procesadas o sentenciadas , les serán aplicables las disposiciones vigentes en el momento en que se haya cometido .
Fuentes judiciales comentaron que la disposición fue aprobada en razón de que las reformas legales aprobadas por el Congreso dejaron un vacío legal , que fue aprovechado por la defensa de un acusado .
En este caso , al sujeto acusado de narcomenudista –delito que consiste en que sin autorización se comercie o suministre , aun gratuitamente , narcóticos– , le fue decretado auto de formal prisión , pero en virtud de las reformas aprobadas en 2009 –que reducen la pena de cárcel de cuatro a ocho años , en lugar de hasta 10 años– , solicitó la traslación de la pena .
Es decir , que le fuera aplicado el nuevo tipo penal previsto en la Ley General de Salud ( narcomenudeo ) , ya que éste le era más favorable que la pena contemplada por la ley antes de la reforma .
On top of the previously announced record delinquency rate for Fannie , here comes some even worse news out of commercial real estate , which together with record high downtown vacancy rates , should be enough to push all REITs to 1052 week highs tomorrow .
RealPoint has just released its March CMBS delinquency data , according to which delinquencies hit an all time high 6 % .
Not to be ignored , according to TREPP this number is even worse , at nearly 8 % , after the single biggest monthly spike in 30 day + delinquencies .
In February 2010 , the delinquent unpaid balance for CMBS increased by another $ 1.87 billion , up to $ 47.82 billion from $ 45.94 billion a month prior .
Aggregate delinquency increased despite a slight decrease in 30 - day delinquency .
The overall delinquent unpaid balance is up almost 300 % from one - year ago ( when only $ 11.98 billion of delinquent unpaid balance was reported for February 2009 ) , and is now over 21 times the low point of $ 2.21 billion in March 2007 .
The distressed 90 +- day , Foreclosure and REO categories grew in aggregate for the 26th straight month – up by $ 2.88 billion ( 9 % ) from the previous month and $ 29.36 billion ( 420 % ) in the past year ( up from only $ 6.98 billion in February 2009 ) .
As Stuy Town is still current on its payment , RealPoint expects an even greater acceleration in CMBS delinquencies over the coming months :
With the $ 4.1 billion delinquency of the Extended Stay Hotel loan , the expected delinquency of the $ 3 billion Peter Cooper Village / Stuyvesant Town loan , and the recently experienced average growth month - over - month , Realpoint now projects the delinquent unpaid CMBS balance to continue along its current trend and grow to between $ 60 and $ 70 billion by mid 2010 .
Based upon an updated trend analysis , we now project the delinquency percentage to grow to between 8 % and 9 % through mid 2010 , potentially approaching and surpassing 11 % to 12 % under more heavily stressed scenarios through the year - end 2010 ) .
This forecast / outlook is driven by the watchlist reporting of several Realpoint identified High Risk Loans from recent vintage transactions that continue to show signs of stress and are on the verge of delinquency , along with continued balloon maturity defaults from more seasoned transactions .
As part of our monthly surveillance efforts of every CMBS transaction , we continue to monitor in detail many large Realpoint Watchlisted loans that have never met their pro-forma underwritten expectations .
This includes a large amount of loans that remain current in payments but have already been transferred into special servicing - many of which may ultimately default based upon a denial of requests for loan modifications or debt restructuring by the special servicers , or a decision by borrowers to surrender the collateral .
And RealPoint is the optimist .
The other commercial real estate expert , TREPP , estimates that the situation is much , much worse , with March 30 +
Days % delinquent CMBS hitting 7.61 % after being just 6.72 % in February .
Then again TREPP already counts Stuy Town as in " foreclosure " , something RealPoint still refuses to do due a technicality .
The delinquency rate for commercial real estate loans in commercial mortgage - backed securities ( CMBS ) stepped up sharply in March .
After February ’s numbers showed delinquencies beginning to moderate , there was some guarded optimism .
February 's increase had been the smallest bump in nine months .
March data threw cold water on any notion that CMBS delinquencies might be nearing their peak .

March data threw cold water on any notion that CMBS delinquencies might be nearing their peak .
According to TREPP the lodging sector is still the worst hit , followed by multifamily , retail , industrial and office .
We anticipate that the strength in Offices is a function of aggressively renegotiated leases , which will impact office REITs most , once the projected cash flow never shows up .
Then again , who needs bad news when you have Atari controlling a now sentient SkyNet .
Kobina Essel stabbed Mr Simpson in the neck A 19 - year - old man who was found guilty of murdering a Matalan shop manager has been sentenced to life with a minimum 20 - year term .
Kobina Essel stabbed Jamie Simpson , 33 , during a botched robbery in March 2008 .
Mr Simpson was stabbed in the neck with a 10 - inch knife during the hold - up at the store in Hackney , east London .
Essel , of Manor Park , east London , was found guilty of the murder by an Old Bailey jury in February .
He had denied the charge .
The knifeman , who told the court he was " panicking " as he stabbed Mr Simpson three times , was also given 11 years ' detention for conspiracy to rob .
' Terrible consequences '
The court heard the gang planned to rob the store over the Easter weekend , hoping to get up to £ 30,000 .
Sentencing Essel , Judge Martin Stephens said : " This case demonstrates in a vivid way the horrors of knife crime and the terrible consequences to the victim , his family and friends and to society as a whole .
" You went into this with your eyes open .
You went in with a knife and you did not hesitate to use it . "
Jamie Simpson had been entrusted by the store to look after the takings and he did so with his life
Aftab Jafferjee QC Essel 's accomplices Anthony Maina , 20 , Randy Osei-Owusu , 17 , and Simeon Jumah , 25 , were convicted of manslaughter .
Following the conviction it emerged that Maina , 20 , of Canning Town , had been on police bail for the murder of a teenager when he took part in the failed robbery .
He was later convicted of the murder of 17 - year - old Rizwan Darbar and jailed for life with a minimum term of 14 years .
Maina has now been given indeterminate sentences over the Matalan killing .
He has been given minimum terms of six years for manslaughter and five years for the robbery , which will be served concurrently with the life sentence .
Judge Stephens said Maina posed a significant risk of serious harm to members of the public .
Three other men were found guilty of conspiracy to rob the store .
Roy Williams , 31 , of Edmonton , north London , a friend of Mr Simpson and a security guard , was the gang 's " inside man " .
The judge described his involvement as " despicable " and jailed him for 10 years .
Jammal Chambers , 18 , of Poplar , east London , was ordered to be detained for seven years .
Duane Owusu , 20 , of Manor Park , east London , was the getaway driver .
He was given eight years ' detention .
Aftab Jafferjee QC , prosecuting , told the trial : " Jamie Simpson had been entrusted by the store to look after the takings and he did so with his life . "

Republican official says she was asked to change party affiliation to serve as ' Democratic ' precinct official ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/2/2010 , 2:56 pm PT
Meanwhile , back in Clay County , Kentucky , where election officials ( including the county clerk , a district court judge , and the school superintendent ) were arrested last year , and are now on trial , accused of having " fix [ed ] elections for decades , " a " precinct worker testified ... that top election officers in the county taught her how to change people 's choices on voting machines to steal votes in the May 2006 primary . "
The vote stealing was accomplished on ES&S touch - screen electronic voting machines , without the knowledge of legitimate voters , after they 'd left the booth thinking they had cast their votes .
The scheme also included Republicans changing their party registration to Democratic in order to serve as Democratic poll judges and officers on Election Day , as has been alleged elsewhere ( for example , in Ohio in 2004 ) ...
As Bill Estep at the Lexington Herald - Leader recently reported :
FRANKFORT ---
A former Clay County precinct worker testified Friday that top election officers in the county taught her how to change people 's choices on voting machines to steal votes in the May 2006 primary .
Wanda
White testified that Clerk Freddy Thompson the county 's chief election officer helped show her how to manipulate voting machines along with Charles Wayne Jones , the Democratic election commissioner .
The scheme involved duping people to walk away from the voting computer before they had finished their selections , then changing their choices , said White , the Democratic judge in a precinct in Manchester .
White said she stole more than 100 votes that election .
" It was easy done , " she said .
...
White , who is in her early 40s , said she agreed to help the FBI in return for not being charged .
That deal requires her to testify truthfully , she said .
...
White said Maricle , then the circuit judge for Clay , Jackson and Leslie counties , asked her to switch her registration from Republican to Democrat and serve as an officer in a Manchester precinct in the 2006 primary .
Maricle 's son- in - law , Phillip Mobley , planned to run for property valuation administrator that year .
Her understanding was that Maricle wanted her to work inside the polling place to help rig the election for Mobley , White said .
The vote - buyers took advantage of some confusion caused by new voting machines the county had that year , White said .
The machines had a " Vote " button that people could push to review their choices , then a second button they had to push to record the choices and finish voting .
...
Thompson and Jones used a voting machine to show her and Charles " Dobber " Weaver how to change votes , White said .
White said they did that at the clerk 's office after legitimate training for all election workers .
She and Weaver stayed late to learn how to manipulate the machines .
Weaver , then the Manchester fire chief , was the Republican judge in the precinct where White was the Democratic judge in May 2006 .
Last year , following the arrest , we explored the issue of whether the conspirators were Republican or Democratic and whether it actually matters here .
It does n't , in truth .
Democrats can as easily game these systems as Republicans .
It is , as we 've always contended , not a partisan matter .
Nonetheless , as we saw in Ohio after the 2004 Presidential Election debacle in that state , Republican officials often cited " bi-partisan " election commissions to support their contentions that any wrong - doing would be discovered by officials , so no oversight or investigation was necessary --- even as there were allegations that some of " Democratic " officials were , in reality , Republicans .
Beyond that , e-voting vendors , apologists , and denialists had long claimed that those , such as The BRAD BLOG and computer science and security experts across the country who had argued such systems were anything but secure , were wrong and that e-voting was perfectly safe .
When they were shown otherwise , time and time and time and time and time again , their fallback position became , essentially , ' while it might be possible to manipulate votes on electronic voting systems , nobody ever had . "
As we also detailed last year after the Clay County arrests , that contention by the denialists in support of e-voting was pure conjecture , as the evidence that might reveal the manipulation of election results by election insiders has been routinely and " legally " withheld from citizens by voting machine companies claiming " proprietary " ownership of data and source code .
But in Kentucky , finally , we see a case of exactly that occurring .
In this case , it was n't a manipulation of the central tabulator --- which can be done by a single person within seconds , as scientists have long shown --- but rather by a cabal of conspirators who did so at the actual voting machines themselves .
The last gasp for the e-voting denialist industry in support of these insane , undemocratic systems , fell in Clay County , Kentucky , as of last year .
And yet , virtually the entirety of the U.S. still uses these unobservable , easily - hacked , unverifiable voting systems made by private , unaccountable companies , using secret software , to count our elections to run " the world 's greatest democracy . "

Is your Rails app under - provisioned ?
You maintain a growing Rails application and you ’re seeing something peculiar .
Sometimes when you use the application , it feels like the performance deteriorates significantly .
However , all of your performance data shows no issues – requests in the Rails log file look speedy , CPU utilization is fine , database performance is solid , etc .
At first , you wave it off as a fluke .
But then a customer reports the same issue .
Now you ’re concerned .
You may be suffering from an under - provisioned Rails application – there are not enough instances of the web application server ( Passenger , in many cases ) to handle the requests .
The requests wait in a queue outside of the Rails application – they wo n’t appear in the log file as slow requests .
A request that waits 15 seconds in the Passenger queue and takes 200ms in the Rails app shows up as a 200 ms request in your Rails log .
The queue time is hidden .
It feels like a doctor appointment – an hour in the waiting room for a 5 minute checkup .
Luckily there is a cure , but it has side effects .
When you have an under - provisioned Rails application you need more Passenger instances .
It ’s like adding more doctors to handle more patients .
However , adding more Passenger instances costs memory .
Absently increasing the maximum number of Passenger processes is n’t recommended .
So , how do you know if throughput is an issue ?
For starters , running passenger - status will give you the number of sessions in each of the instance request queues .
However , you do n’t know how long they have been there .
You may run passenger - status once and see 0 sessions in the queue and 5 seconds later see several sessions in the queue .
In the end , we care about the total response time for users , not the queue length .
Luckily , there is a fairly simple way to track this .
Apache Performance Monitoring
The graph above compares the Apache request duration vs. the Rails request duration .
The Apache duration represents the total time processing the request on the server ( time in queue + Rails processing ) .
From the graph , it ’s possible to see a couple of spikes in the queue time .
Here ’s an example of how the same request looks in a modified Apache access log and in Rails :
Apache ( 250ms )
67.169.79.23 - - [ 05/Apr/2010:17:40:12 -0400 ]
" GET /users / show/50 HTTP /1.1 " 200 2779 250000
Rails ( 200ms )
Completed in 200ms ( View : 25 , DB : 175 ) | 200 OK [ https://yourapp.com/users/show/50]
In order to track the request duration in Apache , the %D directive must be used in the log format .
Here ’s a sample Apache log format that tracks duration in microseconds :
CustomLog logs / access_log " %h %l %u %t \ " %r\ " %>s %b %D "
Take a look at our help entry for tracking Apache request duration .
It ’s pretty straight - forward .
Warning Signs
Now that we ’re tracking Apache request duration along with the Rails request times we can look for a couple of warning signs of an under - provisioned Rails application :

It ’s great to start tracking Apache and Rails performance via log files , but it ’s better when you can view the latest performance data in near real - time and look for the warning signs mentioned above .
If you ’re using Scout , you ’ll get pretty graphs like the one earlier in this post .
Additionally , you ’ll get a nicely - formatted daily summary report for both Apache and Rails .
With Scout , just login to your account and install :
The Rails Monitoring Plugin
The Apache Log Analyzer Plugin

In a heartbreaking admission , Norgen said he was impressed by Final Draft ’s ScriptNotes feature .
AKRON , OH — Saying that he's had a few movie ideas kicking around for a while now , local resident and very depressing man Scott Norgren purchased screenwriting software Tuesday .
Advertisement
" I'm excited , " said the 36 - year - old sad sack , who bought the popular program Final Draft 8 at Best Buy during his work lunch break .
" I figured that if I 'm going to give screenwriting a try , I should have the right software . "
" It 's supposed to make the whole process easier , " the poor sonofabitch added .
" Like the outlining , for example . "
Advertisement
Norgren , who spent several weeks making careful notes on the screenwriting programs currently on the market , finally settled on Final Draft not just because of its formatting capabilities , but also because the software came highly recommended by some of Hollywood 's top screenwriters .
The title of this screenplay alone would make you cringe in embarrassment and feel overwhelming pity for the pathetic man who wrote it .

" The website says James Cameron uses Final Draft , " Norgren said .
" He wrote Avatar with this . "
According to sources close to the HR administrator , the sad man was further impressed by the number of positive quotes and testimonials found on the back of the Final Draft box , including one from critically acclaimed actor and director Tom Hanks , which read , " Final Draft makes it possible to simply imagine the movie in script form . "

" This is what the pros use , " said Norgren , his enthusiasm almost painful in its earnestness .
" And it formats for things other than movies , too , like television sitcoms , British sitcoms , one - hour dramas , and stage plays .
I 'll probably only use it for movies , but you never know when you 'll have a great idea for something else . "
" It writes out the names of your characters for you , " Norgren continued .
" If you type the first letter of the name of a character it automatically knows which one you want to talk . "

The heartbreaking man added that the software does interiors and exteriors , too .
Norgren told increasingly depressed reporters that he 's been thinking about giving screenwriting a try for months .
He purchased Syd Field 's Screenplay : The Foundations Of Screenwriting and recently became a two - year subscriber to Creative Screenwriting magazine .
Last Thursday , Norgren moved the card table from his garage to a spot near his living room window that he said would be " perfect for getting some work done . "

After mentioning that he has posted several movie reviews in the comments section of IMDb , the sad man continued his run of half - smile - half - wince - inducing statements by sharing his plans to install the screenwriting software on his laptop , so that he can spend Saturday afternoons working at a nearby Starbucks .
" I do n't know if they 'll let me , but maybe I can also put it on my work computer , " Norgren added .
" Then I can work on my movies during breaks .
I do n't get to be too creative at work . "
Advertisement
Norgren , whose script ideas were literally too sad to print here , said he likes films with smart dialogue and characters who overcome obstacles , such as Finding Forrester , A Beautiful Mind , and Juno .
" I want to write movies like that , " he said , crushing — just absolutely crushing — the group of assembled reporters .
" And with this software I do n't have to worry about all the little technical stuff and can just focus on the story .
I think my one idea about a guy who [ approx .
30 words omitted because , really , it would ruin your day ] could be pretty good . "
Rockstar progeny and Brit scenester queen Peaches Geldof admits she posed for the " private " photographs posted online , but a rep is denying the cameraman 's tale of heroin use and a morning - after visit to Hollywood 's Celebrity Scientology Center .
In a sternly worded email , Peaches ' lawyer Jonathan Coad admitted that the photographs are of his client , but disputed elements of Reddit commenter Thatcoolben 's story :
The incident and photographs concern private issues and activity ; the photographs were taken for private purposes only
The allegations that our client was carrying and injecting herion [ sic ] are also denied , our client having consumed alcohol with the other individual leading to the ' highs ' described and portrayed in the photographs .
The evident unreliability of the source emerges from the also fictitious description of their trip to a scientology center .
Had you undertaken any checking or research before making this posting you would have learned that nobody who is not a member of that organisiation is permitted into such buildings .
Thatcoolben has since been identified by multiple sources as Williamsburg loft - dweller Ben Mills .
He has a tattoo that says " Big Ben " on his penis .
His contemporary love life includes " on-and - off dating " Drew Grant , a writer who has since blogged about Ben for Nerve and the new blog Crushable .
Ben has yet to respond to our requests for comment , and we 're told his Facebook profile and MySpace accounts have been taken down .

I had coffee today with a writer - director whose acclaimed short film got him many awards and meetings all over town .
And deservedly : it ’s terrific , a labor of love that took several years to make .
He said he was finishing up the screenplay for the feature version .
I told him to focus on something else instead .
You should n’t make the feature version of your short .
This seems like terrible advice .
After all , it ’s easy to think of several acclaimed filmmakers who expanded upon their short films , including Neill Blomkamp and George Lucas .
But having worked with many emerging filmmakers through the Sundance Institute and other programs , I ’ve encountered a lot of silent evidence that suggests it ’s a pretty bad idea .
Great shorts are great and short .
The perfect haiku is n’t improved by rewriting it as a sonnet .
You will burn out on the idea .
Having already made the short , do you want to spend several more years making it again ?
Show what else you can do .
A career is n’t one movie , or one idea .
Even if you make the movie and it turns out great , you ’ve still only told one story so far in your career .
Safety is paralysis .
It ’s less intimidating to expand on something familiar .
But you need to push against your boundaries .
Your first feature project should ideally be in the same class or genre as your acclaimed short , but not a retread .
If you made a charming short about blind leprechauns , write a feature about kleptomaniac crows .
Let the connection between projects be your ambition and sensibility , not a single storyline .
Go was originally written to be a short film — but we never shot it .
Had the short version been made , I ca n’t imagine going back to write the full thing .
I would have been too hamstrung by my original choices , and the scenes that had already been shot .
Worse , I would n’t have felt the same things the second time through .
You do n’t get your first kiss twice .
The second installment of guest posts from Claire E. Smith .
This time asking the question : Was the Ninth Doctor a trend - setter for the series ahead .
Now , being an American Claire is calling trousers ‘ pants . ’
That ’s weird right ?
I decided not to change it so we can embrace another culture on my blog .

There is no doubt that Christopher Eccleston is probably the toughest looking Doctor ever played on BBC ’s brilliant Doctor Who , but could it be argued that he was a trend - setter as well ?
It ’s a fair question to ask , considering he started the new look of Doctor Who , putting it back on the map of fantastic television and delighting a new generation of Who fans across the world .
So is he a trend - setter , or simply the first ?
Exhibit A : The Hair
Actually , I rather like this look .
The hair is flat and smart .
It looks like the Doctor put SOME thought into it when he woke up that morning ( if Timelords sleep ) and looked at himself in the mirror .
He obviously is n’t interested in impressing Rose at this point .
However , as it ’s still rather – to quote Eleven – ‘ raggedy . ’
But it is smart enough to look like the brilliant Doctor he is .
Final Grade B+ on hair .
( I ’m changing grading scales from the decimal point to the letter grade , I ’m a writer , I can do these things . )
And he would have gotten an A if Ten ’s was n’t so sexy .
Exhibit B : The Jacket
A Trend Setter !
I ’m actually a fan of the leather jacket .
It gives him that rough exterior that ’s a bit more threatening than Ten ’s brown coat .
But luckily Christopher ’s soft eyes and loveable smile creates a healthy balance for the Doctor .
Final grade : A on the jacket .
Because leather IS classic !
Exhibit C : The Pants
Eh , sorry , might be just my opinion but they are not doing it for me .
We got the tough guy act with the jacket , the pants with the jacket just scream ‘ Emo ’ to me , and that ’s not really my taste .
I personally would have matched him up with lighter color trousers so he did n’t look like he just helped Lady Christina de Souza rob a museum .
They match the jacket so kudos on that .
I understand the Ninth Doctor is a bit jaded with everything he ’s been through .
But really , let ’s get some style !
Final Grade : C on the pants .
Exhibit D : The Boots
A bit forgettable and I actually had to watch a bit of the show to remember what they were .
Just your basic combat boots .
Great for running from plastic mannequins , strolling comfortably down the bunkers of Utah , and perfect if Rose and the Doctor fancied going camping … but not much else .
They may not be as camera - zooming - worthy as the Converse but they do the job well , great for the arches , and Christopher pulls it off smashingly .
So the final grade is B for the boots .
The Final Grade …
Let ’s face it ; this one was an easy choice !
Christopher Eccleston of course is a trend - setter !
Even an American can see that !
David Tennant and Matt Smith would n’t look so good if they did n’t have something so good looking to set the bar so high .
The hair , the jacket , the boots – even the pants pull off THE Doctor .
He set the tone for the new series , and Who fans everywhere are grateful .
It might be safe to say there wo n’t be a tougher looking Doctor than Eccelston’s .
Final - Final grade : A .
Once again , thank you to the BBC for giving us such a brilliant show .
Of course the BBC owns all these characters , the show and the images .
Love you guys .
There are rumors out there that chefs keep the best cuts of meat or fish for themselves .
While i should really try to extinguish such rumors i’m gonna go ahead and admit my guilt and point my finger at my fellow professionals as well .
Chefs are bastards after all , for the most part .
I ’m guilty my friends , guilty to have used the thicker part of the salmon filet for a business lunch and shamelessly saved for myself the fatty salmon goodness that is the belly .
Since no crime remains unpaid i fully expect the karma police to hit me in the face with a steak tough like a shoe pad in the near future .
A rubber chicken could hit me in the {beeeeep} and i would still think the moment of bliss provided by this salmon ‘ confit ’ was worth it .
I would normally eat salmon belly sashimi style but i thought , hey .. let ’s poach it in olive oil infused with herbs and garlic this time , just to see what happens .
And so i did and it was good .
Very good .
The salmon belly did n’t seem to mind either .
My own belly was happy too .
Two happy bellies .
One innocent and one guilty .
To honor the happy bellies i roasted some beets , fingerling potatoes and onions , soft boiled some quail eggs and made a salad with frisee and red leaf lettuce ( i wanted to use dandelion but could n’t find any ) .
Made a mustard vinaigrette .
Tossed some fines herbs and fleur de sel over the salmon and that ’s about it .
This would make a very nice lunch or a first course for a dinner but it taste better hiding in a dark corner , not sharing with anyone .
Enjoy , while i get my ass kicked by a mob of angry chefs .
Olive Oil - Poached Salmon Belly Salad with Mustard Vinaigrette
Serves 4
For the salmon confit : 1 lb salmon belly 1 1/2 cup olive oil Bouquet garni 1 garlic clove , smashed a few grains of black pepper
For the salad : 4 small beets , roasted in foil and peeled 1 / 2 lb fingerling potatoes , roasted 1 cup cippoline onions , roasted 1 frisee lettuce , cleaned and roughly chopped 1 red leaf lettuce , cleaned and roughly chopped 12 quail eggs 1 tablespoon fresh parsley , chopped 1 tablespoon fresh chervil , chopped 1 tablespoon fresh chives , chopped 2 teaspoons fresh tarragon , chopped fleur de sel and cracked pepper
For the mustard vinaigrette : 1 large egg yolk 1 tablespoon dijon mustard 1 1 / 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon lemon juice 3 / 4 cup extra virgin olive oil ( you could use the oil you used for the salmon ) salt and black pepper to taste
For the salmon confit : Combine the olive oil with the bouquet garni , garlic and black peppercorn in a small , shallow saucepan .
Heat over very low heat until the oil reaches 150 ’F .
Add the salmon and cook for about 5 minutes , or until the salmon just begins to firm up .
Carefully lift the salmon from the pan and place on paper towels to drain .
You could use the oil in the mustard vinaigrette , you can also re-use the flavored oil to make more or in shrimp ceviche , etc …
For the mustard vinaigrette :
Whisk the egg yolk in a small bowl with mustard , vinegar , lemon juice , salt and pepper .
Whisk in the olive oil .
Adjust seasoning .
For the salad :
Mix the parsley , chervil , chives and tarragon and reserve .
Bring a small pot of water to a simmer .
Carefully put the quail eggs inside and boil for 2 minutes .
Run immediately under cold water and peel the shell .
Slice the beets and the potatoes and toss all the ingredients of the salad together with the mustard vinaigrette .
( except the herbs and the quail eggs ) .
Dress the salad , divide the salmon confit among the plates and sprinkle with the fines herbs , some fleur de sel and some cracked pepper , slice and arrange the quail eggs around the salmon .

While the Hamas leader was out , the hit squad busily got to work trying to break into his room .
Four burly men , with caps pulled down over their faces , arrived at 6.32 pm , followed by another woman wearing a floppy hat , who has not been identified , and a man in a straw boater who took over surveillance from the tennis players .
An eerie specter haunts the opening scenes of the new Doors documentary , “ When You ’re Strange : A Film About the Doors . ”
Underneath a foreboding desert sun , a bearded and bedraggled hitchhiker wanders through the desolate Joshua tree expanse .
He gets behind the wheel of a Mustang Cobra and switches on the radio to hear an announcer broadcasting the news of Jim Morrison ’s death .
The scene creates a cognitive dissonance .
Is this man a Jim Morrison doppelgänger , or have the filmmakers unearthed unseen archival footage of the deceased Doors lead singer ?
The images in question , it turns out , were culled from outtakes of Morrison ’s self - financed 1969 film , “ HWY : An American Pastoral . ”
And according to Tom DiCillo , the writer and director of “ When You ’re Strange , ” potential doubters would n’t be the first to question the authenticity of the reel .
“ We were showing it at Sundance and a distributor disgustedly stormed out of a screening , ” DiCillo recounted .
“ I ran down the street to ask why he ’d left and the distributor replied , ‘ I ca n’t believe you ’d use an actor in this movie . ’
I laughed and told him that I ’d never do such a thing . ”
The proof , in fact , is in the mere existence of “ When You ’re Strange . ”
To gain use of the music , DiCillo had to appease the three remaining members of the notoriously fractious band , as well as Morrison ’s estate .
“ It shows the Doors as they were , which is a good thing , ” said Doors guitarist Robbie Krieger .
“ I wish we had gotten more footage , but who knew back then that we should ’ve had a camera truck following us ?
But maybe it ’s good that we did n’t .
It lends an air of mystery to everything .
I still believe that the Doors live -- at their best -- have never been caught on camera , but there ’s some stuff in this movie that comes close . ”
Narrated by Johnny Depp , the first feature documentary about The Doors uncovers rare and never - before - seen footage .
DiCillo obtained the Morrison footage near the end of production , when the filmmakers were preparing to make do with a bleached - out version of the frontman ’s experimental film .
Opting to include only sequences left on the cutting room floor , “ When You ’re Strange ” uses the “ HWY ” material as a recurring motif , repeatedly cutting back to the images that were recorded during one of the singer ’s most tumultuous periods : the aftermath of his 1969 indecent exposure arrest in Miami .
Indeed , one of the film ’s producers , Peter Jankowski , similarly lists the confusion regarding the “ HWY ” material as an obstacle that affected the $ 2 - million production .
“ Because the footage looks like it was shot yesterday , we put a disclaimer on the film for the Berlin Film Festival to let audiences know that there are no actors or re-creations .
People still could n’t believe it , ” said Jankowski , the longtime executive producer of “ Law & Order . ”
The recently excavated 35 mm reels are far from the film ’s only selling point .
The producers also gained access to rare footage captured by Paul Ferrara , an old UCLA film school classmate of Morrison , and organist Ray Manzarek , who documented the band for much of their career .
Before commencing work on the production , DiCillo spent several weeks watching the old films and attempting to get a handle on the vast sums of material that ranged from full scenes to unfocused and soundless shots .
Narrated by Johnny Depp , the 90 - minute film revolves around plot points familiar to Doors disciples : their genesis at UCLA ’s film school and a chance encounter on Venice Beach ; the Whisky a Go Go residency ; Morrison ’s refusal to heed Ed Sullivan ’s request to remove the word “ higher ” from a performance of “ Light My Fire ” on Sullivan ’s variety show ; and the singer ’s frequent scuffles with the law .
It features scenes from the band ’s Miami concert in which Morrison allegedly exposed himself to the crowd , and includes thrilling takes on some of the band ’s most timeless songs , including “ Light My Fire ” and “ The End . ”
From the myriad authorized and unauthorized biographies , countless Rolling Stone covers and the tell - all tomes penned by drummer John Densmore and Manzarek , the story of the Doors has been exhaustively cataloged over the last 40 years .
Yet the only feature - length depiction of the band until now has been Oliver Stone ’s “ The Doors , ” a portrayal that rankled members of the group .
The surviving members of the Doors view “ When You ’re Strange ” as a chance to reveal a more nuanced portrait , and perhaps alter perceptions of the band ’s equally lionized and lambasted lead singer .
“ Oliver Stone made a movie about Oliver Stone in leather pants , ” Manzarek said .
“ That was n’t Jim Morrison .
That was [ Stone ] if he was a rock star . ”
DiCillo , he adds , conveyed the band ’s story , philosophy , outlook and spirituality .
“ It captures what was going on in the 1960s : the assassinations , the war , the madness , the hopes , and , in a way , the destruction of the dreams of an entire generation . ”
Historically opposed to licensing the Doors name , Densmore sued his ex-bandmates in 2003 for breach of contract , trademark infringement and unfair competition , stemming from their plans to tour as the Doors of the 21st Century .
Yet Densmore rhapsodized about the new documentary , particularly DiCillo ’s decision to forgo the use of talking - head interviews from the surviving band members .
“ Watching the old footage reminds me of this crazy dream I had years ago .
There ’s something magic there , ” Densmore said .
“ Maybe it ’s because it does n’t have any old geezers jabbering about their past .
It ’s Johnny Depp taking you on a road movie with the Doors .
You ’re going to live it , sit on the drum stool , and take the ride .
It ’s got Vietnam , the assassinations , the events that affected us all .
Artists do n’t exist in a vacuum .
It ’s everything that happened before the tragedy .
We all know the tragedy . ”

Twilight sparkleboyfriend Robert Pattinson is starring in a new movie , premiering Friday , about a young couple falling in love in New York .
It 's all romantic and silly , until the film 's exploitative gotcha !
ending .
Want to know what it is ?
New York Magazine ran the spoiler a couple of weeks ago , and now the Village Voice , the third " Top Critic " review on RottenTomatoes , just spilled the beans .
Variety and The Hollywood Reporter kept slightly more mum about the ending , alluding only to some grim foreshadowing of Lower Manhattan skylines ...
The end ?
Everything is hunkydory for most of the film .
Two young sexys — Bobby Patentleather , crazy Claire from Lost — meet cute during college in the gray whirlwind of New York .
They battle past sadnesses , mean daddies , and cigarette addictions on their course to true love .
They get married and the Vampyr heads off to his first day of grownup man work .
He goes up and up in an elevator and everyone in the audience is saying " My , that 's an awfully tall building , where does he work exactly ? "
And then , can you guess it ?
9/11 .
Edward Pattinson dies of 9/11 at the very end of Remember Me and all the film 's happiness goes with him .
This is their shocker !
It 's like Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close if Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close had featured just a few more vampire sexpots .
And if Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close had used a national tragedy as an opportunistic , zam - bang !
instant - meaning hook at the end , rather than throughout the whole book .
So well done , filmmakers !
Does n't this oddly make you want to see it ?
And it makes us curious whether more critics will get so upset / annoyed / tickled by the hokum ending of a twinklevampire movie that they too will let the 9/11 cat out of the 9/11 bag .
This is cool :
WASHINGTON — President Obama intends to nominate Massachusetts pediatrician Donald Berwick , known for his work to improve patient care , to oversee Medicare and Medicaid .
…
Berwick is also president and chief executive of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement , a nonprofit organization in Cambridge .
IHI does really interesting work on assessing care quality using a variety of measures and stats .
They 've been theorizing about how to help hospitals deliver better care at lower cost ; presumably now Berwick will get to put those ideas to the test , on a massive scale .
This could be a big deal in ensuring the effectiveness and long - term solvency of Medicare and Medicaid , and therefore the entire federal budget .
Apropos of Massachusetts , here 's some interesting and very succinct testimony from IHI 's Don Goldmann on how we could start to contain health care costs .
Love it or hate it , the iPad is definitely the kind of device that opens up new possibilities , ones you probably did n't think of when it was first launched .
Now that it 's present in several hundred thousand homes , the iPad has reached a new and unexpected userbase : cats .
What , you thought that the iPad 's touchscreen can only be used by humans ?
We 've got not one , but two videos that prove cats can use it just as well .
Now , it 's only a matter of time before we see cat - specialized apps pouring into the App Store .
Oh , and for those who believe that cats are actually planning to eradicate humans and establish world domination , well , maybe we just gave them a tool to do it .
The end is nigh .
MEXICO CITY , Mexico —
The big question for both the United States and Mexico is whether or not to continue with a heavily militarized approach in the fight against drug traffickers .
With U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’s announcement Tuesday , the Obama administration seems to be voting no .
Following her meeting with Mexican officials , Clinton announced a shift in U.S. funding , revealing that more than $ 300 million in American aid to Mexico will go toward non-military assistance .
While the Merida Initiative requires the United States to provide Mexico with more than $ 1.3 billion to help fight the country ’s powerful drug cartels , Clinton ’s announcement marks a first in terms of non-military assistance .
" This new agenda expands our focus beyond disrupting drug trafficking organizations — which will remain a core element of our cooperation — and encompasses challenges such as strengthening institutions , creating a 21st century border , and building strong , resilient communities , " Clinton told reporters during a press conference in Mexico City .
“ The Merida Initiative was originally envisioned as a three - year effort , ” said U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Luoma - Overstreet before the event .
“ Both governments recognize that there is more to be done .
Part of the purpose of this meeting is looking where we can go beyond , what the next steps are on this , whether you want to call that a continuation of the Merida Initiative or , as some people have said , Merida 2.0 . ”
The meeting comes little more than a week after the killings of three people tied to the U.S. consulate in Ciudad Juarez , across the frontier from El Paso , Texas .
Despite nearly 19,000 deaths since President Felipe Calderon began his offensive against the cartels in early 2007 , the consulate killings have given new impetus to rethinking the arrangement .
The importance of the meeting was underscored by its long list of high - level attendees .
Clinton was joined by Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano , Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates , Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair , Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism John O. Brennan and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael G. Mullen , along with top immigration and drug enforcement directors .
“ To have them all in one place is pretty unprecedented in how the U.S. manages its foreign affairs and it ’s definitely unprecedented in Mexican history , ” said John Ackerman , a political scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico .
Despite Clinton ’s focus on new , non-military aid , the presence of defense officials like Gates and Mullen suggests U.S. is ramping up — not scaling down — its military involvement , Ackerman said .
“ This is a military meeting , which is worrisome in so far as it makes one think that perhaps what we ’re going to get is more of the same ” militarized approach , he said .
“ This is Calderon inviting the U.S. military heads of state down to make a show or public display of force , hoping to somehow scare the narcos and show them that he ’s really tough about this stuff .
And the Obama administration is playing into that Calderon approach , ” Ackerman said .
“ Perhaps now the U.S. military is going to offer strategic anti-insurgency support , so search and kill missions as have been happening in Afghanistan and Iraq . ”
Several opposing political parties have recently called for a deadline for troop withdrawal from Juarez , with human rights groups accusing the military of making the situation worse .
Clinton ’s comments seemed to confirm a suspected tactical shift in the U.S. approach to supporting the Calderon administration .
In the past week , some U.S. officials had suggested the secretary of state would push for a more comprehensive , less militarized approach to the conflict .
Shortly after the consulate killings , Secretary Napolitano said the presence of the Mexican army “ has n’t helped anything . ”
And last Friday , Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Arturo Valenzuela said that in addition to disrupting drug cartels and reinforcing the border , the U.S. would help strengthen Mexican institutions and encourage the development of civil society groups along the border .
“ Everything that we ’re doing together is really about empowering local communities on both sides of the border in both of our countries , ” Valenzuela said during a press conference announcing Tuesday ’s meeting .
His statements echoed recent comments by the director of the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) in Mexico , who two weeks ago visited Juárez to meet with civic groups and announced plans to fund community programs in poor neighborhoods .
Up until now , the vast majority of Merida funding has gone toward high - tech military equipment .
Of the roughly $ 77 million delivered by the end of 2009 , most went toward 30 scanners to search for contraband at border crossings and five Bell helicopters for the Mexican Army , according to a Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) report issued in December .
Another $ 135 million worth of equipment will be delivered by June , including the long - delayed shipment of three Black Hawk helicopters .
Both Mexican and American officials have been under pressure to find a new approach to containing violence along the border .
Calderon , in particular , has come under fire for his militarized approach in cities like Juarez , where nearly 10,000 soldiers currently patrol the streets .
Critics argue he has not given enough support to civil society groups in the city , where at least 2,600 people died of drug - related violence in 2009 .
Calderon has only just recently given the U.S. the green light for social development efforts in Juarez and Tijuana , said John Bailey , an expert on U.S. - Mexico relations at Georgetown University .
But Obama is also yet to deliver on some of the promises he made when visiting Mexico City last year , he said .
“ What is really important is the Americans claimed they were going to take co-responsibility for these issues of trafficking , and they have not really lived up to their end of the bargain , which is reducing consumption and dealing with the southward flow of weapons and bulk cash , ” Bailey said .
By announcing an amplification of American involvement in the conflict , Clinton made clear that despite the consulate killings and a rise in drug violence in Mexico , the U.S. is not ready to withdraw their support from Calderon .
President Obama spoke to the Mexican president on Monday , reiterating his commitment to the campaign against drug trafficking .
Calderon is scheduled to visit the White House on May 19 .
Ultimately , however , security experts agree that American aid — military or not — can only go so far .
Disrupting drug trafficking and preventing violence along the border both hinge on rooting out corruption among local police forces and governments : a painful process that Bailey says Calderon has yet to undertake .
“ Try pulling out your teeth one at a time without anesthesia and you will have an idea of the pain that would be , ” he said .
Israeli Demolition Campaign in Three Towns Across the West Bank

In an aggravation of Israeli policy of home demolitions , a house and two shops were razed in the Central West Bank village of Hares this morning .
An additional house was reduced to rubble in the village of alKhadder , west of Bethlehem and a 1,000 square meters factory was demolished in the town Beit Sahour .
In what seems a coordinated move , Israeli forces carried out demolitions in two different areas of the West Bank today , rendering at least 16 people homeless .
In recent months , international pressure has caused a significant decline in the demolition of Palestinian houses in the Israeli - controlled Area C of the West Bank .
Israel uses its statutory authority in Area C , which spans over 60 % of the West Bank , to dramatically limit Palestinian development .
Palestinians fear that today ’s concerted demolitions may be the opening salvo in a provocative change in Israeli policy .
Mahmoud Zwahare a popular committee member from the Bethlehem region said during the demolitions that “ Israel keeps claiming it strives for peace and constantly complains about Palestinian incitement and violence .
It is doing so while carrying out destructive and irreversible steps on the ground against ordinary civilians .
The demolitions today have nothing to do with the security of Israelis and everything to do with provocation and injustice ” .
A convoy of eight armored military jeeps and a D9 bulldozer entered the village of Hares in the early morning today and advanced towards the newly built house of Maher Sultan .
The house , which Sultan had just finished constructing after five years , was to be home for himself , his wife and their five children .
The two story house was quickly demolished by the bulldozer , which left nothing but rubble behind it .
The demolition order was posted on Sultan ’s house a month ago , citing a Mohammed Mansour as the owner of the house , which complicated to procedures to stop the demolition .
At the time of the demonstration , Sultan was actually at the DCO in Tulkarem to try an negotiate an injunction , unaware that his home is being razed .
After completing the demolition of Sultan ’s house , the Israeli forces continued to demolish two stores in the outskirts of the village .
Almost simultaneously , a massive contingent of Israeli forces invaded the town of alKhadder , West of Bethlehem .
The massive Israeli bulldozer demolished the house of Ali Mousa , which was home to nine people , including a one year old baby , as soldiers prevented anyone from nearing the house – including the family ’s lawyer , who showed soldiers a 2006 court - issued injunction on the demolition .
After completing the demolition , an Israeli Civil Administration officer who was present at the scene informed people that more house demolitions will be carried in the near future .
Shortly after the alKhadder demolition , forces lead by the Israeli Civil Administration demolished a factory in the town of Beit Sahour .
Roughly a year ago , Omar Ayyoub , the owner of the factory was served a halt - construction order by the civil administration , which he complied with and have been fighting ever since .
When the bulldozers arrived today he pleaded with the officer in charge to stop the demolition , or at least present him with a valid demolition order .
The officer refused and ordered Ayyoub removed from the scene .
Home destroyed on 14 April 2010 under the pretext it was too close to Israel`s wall .

Over 60 percent of the West Bank is currently classified as Area C , in which , under the Oslo accords , Israel has complete control , over both civil and security issues .
According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) some 70 percent of Area C , or approximately 44 percent of the West Bank , has been largely designated for the use of Israeli settlements or the Israeli military .
The Israeli authorities generally allow Palestinian construction only within the boundaries of an Israeli - approved plan and these cover less than one percent of Area C , much of which is already built - up .
As a result , Palestinians are left with no choice but to build “ illegally ” and risk demolition of their structures and displacement .
According to information released by the Israeli State Attorney ’s Office in early December 2009 , approximately 2,450 Palestinian - owned structures in Area C have been demolished due to lack of permit over the course of the past 12 years .
Al Gore ’s defense of global - warming hysteria in Sunday ’s New York Times has many flaws , but I ’ll focus on just one whopper — where the “ Inconvenient Truth ” man states the opposite of scientific fact .
Gore says , “ The heavy snowfalls this month have been used as fodder for ridicule by those who argue that global warming is a myth , yet scientists have long pointed out that warmer global temperatures have been increasing the rate of evaporation from the oceans , putting significantly more moisture into the atmosphere — thus causing heavier downfalls of both rain and snow in particular regions , including the Northeastern United States . ”
It ’s an interesting theory , but where are the facts ?
According to “ State of the Climate ” from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , “ Global precipitation in 2009 was near the 1961 - 1990 average . ”
And there was certainly no pattern of increasing rain and snow on America ’s East Coast during the post - 1976 years , when NOAA says the globe began to heat up .
So what was it , exactly , that Gore ’s nameless scientists “ have long pointed out ” ?
A 2008 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , “ Climate Change and Water , ” says climate models “ project precipitation increases in high latitudes and part of the tropics . ”
In other areas , the IPCC reports only “ substantial uncertainty in precipitation forecasts . ”
In other words , the IPCC said that its models predicted some increases in rain or snow — not observed them .
And only in high latitudes or the tropics , which hardly describes New York or Washington , DC .
In fact , recent research actually contra dicts Gore ’s claims about “ significantly more water moisture in the atmosphere . ”
In late January , Scientific American reported : “ A mysterious drop in water vapor in the lower stratosphere might be slowing climate change , ” and noted that “ an apparent increase in water vapor in this region in the 1980s and 1990s exacerbated global warming . ”
The new study came from a group of scientists , mainly from the NOAA lab in Boulder .
The scientists found : “ Stratospheric water - vapor concentrations decreased by about 10 percent after the year 2000 . . .
This acted to slow the rate of increase in global surface temperature over 2000 to 2009 by about 25 percent . ”
Specifically , the study found that water vapor rising from the tropics has been re duced , because it has gotten cooler there ( another inconvenient truth ) .
A Wall Street Journal headline summed it up : “ Slowdown in Warming Linked to Water Vapor . ”
Moisture in the lower stratosphere ( about 8 miles above the earth ’s surface ) has been going down , not up .
Aside from clouds , water vapor accounts for as much as two - thirds of the earth ’s greenhouse - gas effect .
Water vapor traps heat from escaping the atmosphere — but clouds have the opposite effect ( called “ albedo ” ) by reflecting the sun ’s energy back into space .
And snow on the ground from the IPCC ’s predicted precipitation in high latitudes would have the same cooling effect as clouds .
What the new research suggests is that changes in water vapor may well trump the ef fect of carbon dioxide ( only a fraction of which is man-made ) and methane ( which has mysteriously slowed since about 1990 ) .
This raises an intriguing question : Since the Environmental Protection Agency declared that it has the authority to regulation carbon emissions because of their presumed effect on the global climate , why has n’t the EPA also attempted to regulate mist and fog ?

Nick Bilton / The New York Times
Andrey Ternovskiy , a polite , excited and eager Russian high school student , scoured the Internet trying to find a Web site that allowed random video chats with strangers .
When he realized a site like that did n’t exist , he decided to build it .
Three months and tens of millions of users later , the 17 - year - old is wandering around New York City and ( soon ) San Francisco talking to investors and programmers about where to take his project next .
David Gallagher , deputy tech editor , and I sat down with Mr. Ternovskiy to hear his captivating story about being too young to receive payment for the Google ads he was running and why so many investors want to be his new best friend .
Here is an edited and condensed version of our chat :
Why did you start Chatroulette ?
I was looking for a site like this , one that would let me chat randomly on webcams , and I could n’t find it , so I thought I would try to build it .
How long did it take to build ?
It took me three days .
I built it on an old computer I had in my bedroom .
Then what happened ?
Well , at first I showed it to my friends and they criticized it ; they asked why anyone would want to use it .
So I went onto a few Web forums and asked people to try the site , and I got 20 people to try it .
How many users do you have now ?
Well , after the initial 20 users the site doubled and it continued to double every day since then .
Last month I saw 30 million unique visitors come to the Web site and one million new people visit each day .
It continues to multiply and I just could n’t stop it from growing .
What were you thinking while this was happening ?
I woke up one morning and checked my computer and saw all of these news articles about Chatroulette .
I yelled to Mom to come and look at my computer .
At first she was very nervous , but she does n’t really understand it very well and asked me why I ’m not going to school .
What do you think about all the press ?
Actually I have n’t read a single article .
I do n’t want to read them .
I see a wall of text and I just look at the picture and click next .
And what did you parents say ?
Well , my mother is a bit conservative about it , and I am still in high school .
Where does the name come from ?
I came up with it after I watched a movie about American soldiers who were fighting in Vietnam and were captured and forced to play Russian roulette .
Are you making money from the advertisements on the site ?
I used to be , but for the last six days I have had no ads .
But you have Google AdWords , right ?
Well , Google never sent me the money .
Huh ?
Why did n’t they send you the money ?
Well , at first it took two months to verify my address in Moscow because I wrote a code down incorrectly .
Then , when that was fixed , and everything should ’ve been fine , I received a letter from Google that said they could not send me the money because I was not 18 years old yet .
What do you plan to do about all the naked people on Chatroulette ?
People that are naked are all over the Internet .
I do n’t like it , because I want a clean site , so I have added a “ Report ” button .
Now if someone is reported three times they are banned from the site .
How do you feel about Chatroulette Map ?
I enjoy it .
I was e-mailing the creator of the site , but he wo n’t tell me who it is .
There is a certain level of anonymity on the Chatroulette that Chatroulette Map takes away , but I plan to add something to my site to allow them to still hide their whereabouts .
So you have been meeting with investors ?
Well , for now , they are more interested in me , than I am in then .
Are people trying to buy the service ?
I get calls all the time where people say they want to buy my site , but I think that some of them are not serious , they are only offering me $ 1 million .
Will you sell it ?
Six months ago I would have said yes , but now I want to keep it , I do n’t want to sell it .
Do you want investors ?
I ’m not sure .
There are a lot of business people that are interested .
I am afraid to take the offers as I do n’t have a business plan .
If I take the money I ’m responsible for delivering on that .
Right now I can survive without investors .
The site uses peer - to - peer technology and my Web site is not the kind of site that needs a lot of money to run .
So if someone came along to you today and said I ’ll give you $ 5 million for the Web site , would you sell it to them ?
I ’m not sure , to be honest .
The thing is , I could take the money , but what if it wo n’t work well in the future ?
I would blame myself .
I do n’t want to disappoint people .
Have you always wanted to be a programmer ?
No , actually I had no interest in being a programmer .
I was always interested in language , I studied English and Chinese and I hoped to be a translator .
Then I got a computer and saw that you could write code , so I decided to try it .
What ’s next for you and Chatroulette ?
I ’m looking for ideas , I personally do n’t know , but I ’m debating changing everything .
I ’m meeting with people in New York and San Francisco to look for ideas and see what to do next .
Who knows what will happen next .
And when do you go back to Moscow ?
I have a ticket to go back in mid-April .
But who knows , maybe I ’ll never go back !
An American Phenomenon
Increased Prescribing to Poor Children
( Natural News ) The United States has become the psychiatric drugging capital of the world for kids with children being medicated at a younger and younger age .
Medicaid records in some states show infants less than a year old on drugs for mental disorders .
The use of powerful antipsychotics with privately insured children , aged 2 through 5 in the US , doubled between 1999 and 2007 , according to a study of data on more than one million children with private health insurance in the January , 2010 , " Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry .
"
The number of children in this age group diagnosed with bipolar disorder also doubled over the last decade , Reuters reported .
Of antipsychotic - treated children in the 2007 study sample , the most common diagnoses were pervasive developmental disorder or mental retardation ( 28.2 % ) , ADHD ( 23.7 % ) , and disruptive behavior disorder ( 12.9 % ) .
The study reported that fewer than half of drug treated children received a mental health assessment ( 40.8 % ) , a psychotherapy visit ( 41.4 % ) , or a visit with a psychiatrist ( 42.6 % ) during the year of antipsychotic use .
" Antipsychotics , which are being widely and irresponsibly prescribed for American children -- mostly as chemical restraints -- are shown to be causing irreparable harm , " warned Vera Hassner Sharav , president of the Alliance for Human Research Protection , in a February 26 , 2010 InfoMail .
" These drugs have measurable severe hazardous effects on vital biological systems , including : cardiovascular adverse effects that result in shortening lives ; metabolic adverse effects that induce diabetes and the metabolic syndrome , " she wrote .
" Long - term use of antipsychotics has been shown to result in metabolic syndrome in 40 % to 50 % of patients .
" The lead researcher on the study above , Columbia University psychiatry professor Mark Olfson , told Reuters that about 1.5 % of all privately insured children between the ages of 2 and 5 , or one in 70 , received some type of psychiatric drug in 2007 , be it an antipsychotic , a mood stabilizer , a stimulant or an antidepressant .
Psychiatric drugs bathe the brains of growing children with agents that threaten the normal development of the brain , according to Dr Peter Breggin , founder of the International Center for the Study of Psychiatry and Psychology ( ICSPP ) , and author of about 20 books , including " Medication Madness .
"
The drugs themselves are causing severe disorders in millions of children in the US , he warns .
" Substances like antidepressants , stimulants , mood stabilizers , and antipsychotic drugs cause severe , and potentially permanent , biochemical imbalances .
" A number of presentations at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in May 2009 , addressed the diagnosis of bipolar disorder , including one titled , " Pediatric Bipolar Disorder : A Critical Look at an American Phenomenon , " at which Dr Peter Parry , a consultant child & adolescent psychiatrist , and senior lecturer at Flinders University in Australia , presented a survey on , " Australian and New Zealand 's Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists '
Views on Bipolar Disorder Prevalence and on Rates of Pediatric Bipolar Disorder in the USA .
" Dr Parry and his colleagues conducted a survey of child and adolescent psychiatrists in Australia and New Zealand .
Of the 199 psychiatrists who responded to the survey , 90.5 % thought pediatric bipolar disorder was overdiagnosed in the US .
In an October 1 , 2009 article titled , " Medicating Our Children , " Dr Parry reports that since " the mid-1990s in the USA , some researchers have claimed that Paediatric Bipolar Disorder ( PBD ) frequently starts prior to puberty .
" One of PBD 's main proponents , Harvard University 's Professor Joseph Biederman , stating onset " is squarely in the preschooler age group , " he notes .
Parry explains that " PBD has been created by moving the diagnostic goalposts away from traditional concepts of bipolar disorder . "
" In children , " he says , " episodes were redefined to last hours instead of days or weeks and , instead of manic elation , severe anger in children sufficed as mania . "
" Unlike diagnoses like ADHD or depression , or simply accepting a child has serious emotional and behavioural problems in reaction to various stressors , PBD implies a lifelong severe mental illness requiring of strong psychiatric medication , " Parry warns .
"
In the USA , " he says , " the public is furthermore exposed to direct pharmaceutical advertising that can feed the natural desire parents of distressed and aggressive children have for a quick solution by suggesting a simple medication fix . "
" The medicating of America 's children has become intensely controversial , highlighted by the tragic case of Rebecca Riley , a four - year - old Boston girl diagnosed at 28 months old with ADHD and PBD , " he points out .
On April 7 , 2009 , the author of the book , " Shyness : How Normal Behavior Became a Sickness , " Christopher Lane , featured an interview on his Psychology Today blog , " Side Effects , " with journalist , Philip Dawdy , the creator of the popular website , Furious Seasons , and discussed the rising number of children being diagnosed with bipolar disorder .
" As for bipolar disorder in kids ( meaning pre-teens and younger ) , it 's simply not an issue in the rest of the world , " Dawdy told Lane .
" The bipolar child is a purely American phenomenon . "
" The pharma companies and the Harvard crew worked hand - in - hand to bring America a generation of ADHD kids and bipolar children , and their profound influence can be seen in the millions of children and teens who now carry lifetime diagnoses and take gobs of psychotropic drugs each day , often to their detriment , " he advised .
Lane asked for Dawdy 's opinion on a recent report in the St Petersburg Times that found 23 infants less than one - year - old had been prescribed antipsychotics in Florida in 2007 , as well as the drug overdose death of 4 - year - old Rebecca Riley in Massachusetts .
" How is it possible for psychiatrists to continue prescribing to infants in such numbers without more oversight ? "
Lane asked .
" What 's gone on with antipsychotics prescribed to infants and toddlers is simply inexplicable to me , " Dawdy said .
" The drugs are known to cause huge problems in adults , so why the heck would a doctor give them to little kids , especially infants ?
It boggles my small mind . "
" I 'm no fan of bans or restrictions , " he told Lane , " but this does strike me as a situation where there needs to be a serious rethinking of what we are doing -- and maybe there should be a ban on the use of these drugs in kids under , say , 6 years of age .
" An October 2007 report by the University of South Florida found the most common diagnosis for antipsychotic use with children in Florida 's Medicaid program , between July and December 2005 , was ADHD .
Roughly 54 % , or 1,372 cases , involved prescriptions for children five and under and the total number of antipsychotic users in this young age group was 2,549 , with all disorders combined , according to the report .
Federally funded research published online in December , 2009 , revealed that children covered by Medicaid were prescribed antipsychotics at a rate four time higher than children with private insurance .
The data showed that more than 4 % of children in Medicaid fee - for - service programs received antipsychotics , compared to less than 1 % of privately insured youth .
The study found Medicaid kids were more likely to receive antipsychotics for unapproved uses such as ADHD and conduct disorders than privately insured children .
The researchers examined records for children in seven states for the years 2001 and 2004 , chosen as representative of the US Medicaid population .
But more recent data through 2007 indicates that the disparity has remained , said Stephen Crystal , a Rutgers professor who led the study , according to the December 11 , 2009 , New York Times .
Antipsychotics were the top selling class of drugs in both 2008 and 2009 .
With sales of $ 14.6 billion in 2009 , they brought in more than the $ 13.6 billion earned by both heart burn and cholesterol medications .
Antidepressants ranked fourth with sales of $ 9.9 billion , according to data by IMS Health .
In 2008 , the drug makers took in $ 11.3 billion from antiseizure drugs and $ 4.8 billion from ADHD drugs .
In a new book titled , " Anatomy of an Epidemic : Magic Bullets , Psychiatric Drugs , and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America , " Robert Whitaker reports that the number of children on government disability rolls due to severe mental illness has increased more than 35 - fold since 1987 .
The book explores the question of whether the epidemic rise in people disabled by mental illness , among all age groups in the US over the past 20 years , could have been fueled by a drug - based paradigm of care .
It also explores what is happening to children over the long - term who are placed on psychiatric drugs .
" Once again , science tells a very clear story , and , as you might imagine , it is one that -- when you think of the millions of children so affected -- makes you want to weep , " Whitaker stated in a March 26 , 2010 , notice for the book 's release on the Beyond Meds Website .
Evelyn Pringle is an investigative journalist focused on exposing corruption in government and corporate America .

I had one favorite thing to eat when I was a kid - mushroom casserole .
It was the one dish I was loyal to above all else .
I would request it when I was recovering from the flu , pneumonia , or strep throat .
I would request it weeknights , weekends , and holidays .
It was a simple dish , and one of four ( maybe five ) recipes my mom had in her culinary arsenal .
She combined rice , mushrooms ( or creamy mushroom soup ) , and cheese in a casserole dish , and baked it until it was creamy , melty , and golden at the edges .
Simple enough .
My Version of Mushroom Casserole
I made a healthier , from - scratch remix of my mom's classic the other night using brown rice , sautéed mushrooms , garlic , and onions - all made creamy with a blend of cottage cheese and a bit of yogurt or sour cream .
Variations on Mushroom Casserole
You can certainly use whatever cooked grains you like .
I suspect this would be delicious with barley , wheat berries , quinoa , whole grain rices - or even a mix of grains .
I love it made with wild rice .
Add-ins :
My mom used to hide all sorts of things in this casserole ( pre-cooked chicken breast or pork chops ) , but because we do n't roll like that anymore ( vegetarian ) , I sometimes play around with other ingredients .
Anything from chopped leafy greens , toasted nuts , sun-dried tomatoes , or pre-cooked lentils are great as add-ins .
But , honestly , the simple version is really good - just like I 've written down below .
A Make Ahead Recipe
This is a great recipe to make ahead of time !
You can prepare the rice and mushroom mixture up to a few days in advance , and then simply bake it off when you 're ready .
SCARBOROUGH TELLS IT LIKE IT IS … .
Credit where credit is due : MSNBC ’s Joe Scarborough criticized Arizona ’s new immigration law this morning , and did so in a compelling , persuasive way .
As the former Republican congressman put it , “ … It does offend me when one out of every three citizens in the state of Arizona are Hispanics , and you have now put a target on the back of one out of three citizens , who , if they ’re walking their dog around a neighborhood , if they ’re walking their child to school , and they ’re an American citizen , or a legal , legal immigrant — to now put a target on their back , and make them think that every time they walk out of their door they may have to prove something .
I will tell you , that is un-American .
It is unacceptable and it is un-American . ”
I ’m not sure if I ’ve ever agreed so strongly with Joe Scarborough .
Atrios added , “ I ’m not usually one to highlight right wingers saying reasonable things , but I think on this issue it ’s a positive sign that even Joe Scarborough is n’t on board with the Arizona horror show . ”
Of course , Scarborough is no longer in Congress , and need not worry about offending the Republican Party ’s far - right base or donors .
What I ’d really like to see is some current GOP officials speak out this forcefully on the issue .
Thus far , according to research from ThinkProgress , only one sitting Republican member of Congress — Rep. Lincoln Diaz - Balart , a Cuban - American lawmaker in Miami — has been willing to speak out strongly against the Arizona measure .
Here ’s hoping he ’s not the only one .

Editor ’s note : Earlier last week , I was contacted by a second grade teacher who ’s students wrote some video game reviews .
They came in the form of drawings , charts , comic strips , and essays .
Most are about either Mario Kart Wii , Indiana Jones ( on the Wii ) or the New Super Mario Bros .
I thought they were pretty fun to look at and more than once made me smile .
So I ’m sharing what was shared with me .
It ’s kind of nice to see video games through the eyes of kids once again !
The names of the students and their teacher have been removed , but the pictures and text remain unaltered .

At a time when county government is tightening its belt , a new Times investigation examined how the five L.A. County supervisors spend $ 3.4 million a year they receive in discretionary funding .
According to records , they use the money in part to pay chauffeurs , hold parties for friends and lobbyists and support pet projects .
They also use it to help bolster programs and services in their districts .
Supervisor Mark Ridley - Thomas gave $ 25,000 last year to throw a reception for a for - profit exhibit on the African American experience organized by TV and radio host Tavis Smiley , a longtime friend .
He also donated $ 25,000 last year to the Diva Foundation , whose mission is to support groups that conduct AIDS research , education and support .
Its president , Tony - nominated Sheryl Lee Ralph , emceed his 2008 campaign kickoff .

Claim : Video clip shows an Australian politician being interviewed about an oil tanker spill .
Status : False .
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , August 2008 ]
THE FRONT FELL OFF
On August 19th 2007 , an oil tanker off the coast of Australia split in two , dumping 20,000 tons of crude oil .
Senator Collins , a member of the Australian Parliament , appeared on a TV news program to reassure the Australian public .
This actual interview is so funny , you ’d swear it was a ‘ Saturday Night Live ’ skit .
It just proves …
Once a politician , always a politician !
Enjoy !
Origins : Even
knowing nothing about the origins of this video clip purportedly showing an Australian MP ’s hilariously inept attempts at reassuring a news interviewer about the safety of tankers in the wake of a large oil spill , attentive viewers should be able to discern that it ’s probably not on the level .
The rhythm and flow of the conversation and camera work is too neat and crisp — unlike typical free - form interviews , the subjects do n’t interrupt or talk over each other , and the director always seems to know exactly when to cut from one speaker to the other , signs that the event was scripted ( or , at the very least , heavily edited ) .
Indeed , this “ interview ” appears very much like a Saturday Night Live skit because it is in fact a comedy sketch from the early 1990s , the parts of the politician and interviewer being played by Australian television comedy duo John Clarke and Brian Dawe as they discuss an oil spill that occurred in 1991 when the Greek tanker Kirki lost its bow off the coast of Western Australia
Clarke and Dawe ’s stock in trade is presenting satirical takes on current events , often in the form of mock interviews in which Clarke assumes the role of a beleaguered politician ( or other prominent public figure ) attempting to explain away some blunder while being grilled by interviewer Dawe .

If a new survey sent out to Netflix subscribers is any indication , the iPhone might be the next device that its streaming service rolls out on in the coming months .
According to a tip sent to Hacking Netflix , the subscription video company is now asking users how likely they would be to use an iPhone app to view movies via its online streaming service .
According to the survey , an iPhone app would give users all the same functionality that they have when streaming on a PC or other device , including all the same movies and TV shows without advertisements or trailers .
If the app is rolled out , the ability to watch on the Apple mobile device would be offered at no additional charge to existing Netflix subscribers .
There is one potential downside to such a release : Based on the survey questions , it appears that the app would require users to be connected to a Wi -Fi network , so they would n’t be able to stream from AT&T ’s wireless network .
This has been a sore point for the wireless carrier , which until recently had restricted video streaming applications from using 3G or EDGE wireless network connections .
That is slowly changing , however , as a rash of live streaming apps from Ustream , Qik and others were released late last year .
Netflix streaming has become nearly ubiquitous on consumer electronics devices in the past few years , and the company expects to have its streaming service on more than 100 different CE devices in 2010 .
But all of its initiatives in that arena have so far been aimed at getting the streaming service to the television through Blu-ray players , gaming consoles or other devices , or embedding the service onto HDTVs themselves .
The release of an iPhone app would mark the first time the company takes aim at the mobile market .
Such a move would also fly in the face of statements made by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings late last year and on the company ’s fourth - quarter earnings call in January .
Last September , Hastings told Reuters that the company did n’t have plans to get onto the iPhone or other mobile devices “ in the short term . ”
Then on Netflix ’s most recent earnings call , Hastings said that iPhone and iPad streaming was “ not a huge priority ” for the company because it is “ focused on the larger screen . ”
Netflix surveys have tipped off the company ’s plans in the past , including one that gauged subscriber interest in streaming on Microsoft ’s Xbox 360 gaming consoles .
But not all surveys end up resulting in new products or features ; take , for instance , one that Netflix conducted last spring asking if consumers would pay to add HBO content to their Netflix streaming options .
That service never went anywhere , possibly due to low subscriber interest .
Full text of the survey is below :
“ Imagine that Netflix offers its subscribers the ability to instantly watch movies & TV episodes on their iPhone .
The selection availability to instantly watch includes some new releases , lots of classics and TV episodes .
There are no advertisements or trailers , and movies start in as little as 30 seconds .
You can fast - forward , rewind , and pause or watch again .
The movies & TV episodes you instantly watch are included in your Netflix membership for no additional fee .
Whenever you want to instantly watch content on your iPhone , your iPhone must be connected to a Wi - Fi network ( such as one you might have at home or at work , or in public places like coffee shops , book stores , hotels , airports , etc . )
If this functionality were available , how likely would you or someone in your household be to instantly watch movies & TV episodes on your iPhone via a Wi -Fi network ? ”

Women have served on surface ships since the mid-1990s Women can now serve on US submarines , after a ban was lifted .
The US defence department had announced the move in February and the deadline for any objection from Congress passed at midnight on Wednesday .
Training women for their new duties and the creation of appropriate quarters mean it could be more than a year before women take up their posts .
The cramped conditions had previously precluded women , despite serving alongside men on surface ships .
About 15 % of US navy personnel are women .
Training course Defence Secretary Robert Gates had given Congress notice that the ban would end unless it objected and that deadline passed at midnight on Wednesday .
ANALYSIS Adam Brookes , BBC News , Washington Admirers of the United States military often describe it as a progressive organisation .
On the gender front , however , submariners have been hold - outs .
Female sailors on submarines , some have argued , will compromise missions when they become pregnant , will complicate the already fragile social ecosystem of the submarine , and will add stress to wives ashore .
Senior military officers seem confident these grumbles will disappear , and soon women will be accepted aboard the way they are on aircraft carriers and in the cockpit of combat aircraft .
This change is one small part of a broader transformation of attitudes in the US military , a transformation which reflects changes in US society as a whole towards race , gender , class and sexuality .
The Navy may find its plan to ban smoking aboard submarines meets tougher resistance than its plan to allow women to serve in the dark , silent depths .
Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said in a statement : " There are extremely capable women in the navy who have the talent and desire to succeed in the submarine force .
" We literally could not run the navy without women today . "
The first women submariners are likely to be aboard ballistic and guided - missile submarines as they have more living space and will not require alterations .
However , there is a 15 - month submarine officer training course .
Chief of Naval Operations , Adm Gary Roughead , said : " It would be foolish to not take the great talent , the great confidence and intellect of the young women who serve in our navy today and bring that into our submarine force . "
The US navy has also announced another key change to service requirements .
As of 31 December , smoking will no longer be allowed on submarines .
There are estimated to be more than 5,000 submariner smokers but they will be expected to fall in line with the general ban on indoor smoking the military imposed in 1993 .

The House has abandoned plans to take up legislation giving residents of the District of Columbia a vote in Congress that has been denied them for over two centuries .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he was " profoundly disappointed " that the House , which had planned to consider the voting rights bill this week , will probably not take it up this year .
The Maryland Democrat said a major problem was the linkage of the D.C. voting rights bill to a provision that would have effectively eliminated the District 's tough gun control laws .
The measure would have given the District 's 600,000 residents a House vote and would have temporarily given Republican - leaning Utah a new at - large seat , expanding the size of the House from 435 to 437 members .

Do not expect Fox Noose to suddenly become credible , however , CBS , NBC , ABC, CNN , NYT , USA Today , WSJ , Bloomberg , Reuters , AP , UPI , McClathchy , Gannett , Hearst , and others need to say how badly they failed in this instance .
They all failed miserably .
And the only people hurt were those served by ACORN .
But who gives a hoot about some poor black people .
To the media who fail to apologize for this simple failure I say bah .
You are the same toadies who cover healthcare reform like a prizefight .
No in depth reporting just repeating the most egregious statements .

Okeefe 's criminal charges ...
( scroll down 1 / 4 of the page ) The complaint reads in part ...
On January 25 , 2010 individuals entered and attempted to gain entrance to the office and telephone system of United States Senator Mary Landrieu , located in the Hale Boggs Federal Building , Room 1005 , 500 Poydras Street , New Orleans , Louisiana 70130 for the pupose of interfering with the telephone system .( emphasis added by myself )
The individuals did so by falsely and fraudulently representing that the ( sp ) were employees of a telephone company .
Witnesses in and around the office identified the individuals as JAMES BASAL and ROBERT FLANAGAN .
Subsequent investigation determined that JAMES O'KEEFE and STAN DAI aided and abetted BASAL ans FLANAGAN in the execution of the plan .
Also ... Affadivait part 6 BASAL requested tobe given access to a telephone in the office , and WITNESS 1 allowed him access to the main telephone at the reception desk .
WITNESS 1 observed BASAL take the handset of the phone and manipulate it ... read the whole affadavit here

Colbert RULES , though he was probably riding Brad 's coat tails a bit on this .
And sorry for the unrelated comment , but was wondering if Brad will be writing about the recent House Foreign Affairs Committee vote regarding the Armenian genocide .
Let 's see who gets damaged by the nasty info that 's about to be leaked !
Here 's a link to the story : http://www.msnbc.msn.com...977/ns/world_news-europe and to the vote : http://foreignaffairs.ho...p?id=1156&show=votes
so you can keep your eye on the likely targets .
Itneresting that Gregory Meeks voted CON ; I 've seen his name over on TPMMuckraker , so he 's probably got some laundry that he'd rather not air !
( Not that I have any idea of what his actual views may or may not be ... just being snarky ) .

Just FYI Cosimo - 60 Minutes did an excellent retrospective piece on the entire Turkey / Armenia Genocide " controversy " on Sunday .
Sadly , of course , they did n't touch any of the related Sibel Edmonds stuff ( even though they covered her story in 2006 and re-ran it several times since ) .
If I remember to grab the segment , however , from Sunday 's show , I 'll try to post it , since it offers a good primer on the entire background of the insane 100 year fight .
Now back to on - topic comments !

HAW HAW HAW - that was fantastic - thanks a million - BTW - the Sibel Edmonds piece in Hustler was also incredible .
It has very disturbing parallels to " The Franklin Scandal " by Nick Bryant , America 's second best investigative reporter .
Using pedophilia as entrapment in bugged DC townhouses .
It 's extremely depressing , but important .
I know I plugged his book before , but it is an eerie coincidence - because I plugged it before the Edmond 's piece came out .
Our legislators are controlled .

These guys like Paul L and Patterico love to come along and play " word games " , do n't they ?
Colbert said " wiretap " so forget about the whole thing !
Not the main point !
The other day Patterico said that O'Keefe did n't ask permission from a parole officer to go to CPAC and I posted where he said it in the Washington Examiner .
Yeah , Paul L , take the advice and read the affidavit .
You 're implying O'Keefe did nothing wrong THERE , too , like Patterico was implying O'Keefe did nothing wrong with ACORN .
You 're trying to get the conversations bogged down in details .
The main point Colbert is making is that even HE could splice / edit up a video to make someone look bad .
He did what O'Keefe does , but to Hannity .
THAT'S THE F*CKING POINT , YOU IDIOT !!!

OK , now that that 's off my chest .... please , Please , PLEASE do something about allowing your Canadian fans to watch and listen to some of your multimedia content .
Whenever there 's any Comedy Central link anywhere on the web , Canadians get the totally uninformative message " In Canada , Comedy Central Videos are available on the Comedy Network " .
So we click on that and get linked to Comedy Central ... and believe me , that 's just not as funny as it sounds .
Plus , most of your radio stuff just wo n't stream to Canada for some reason .
So when you 're replacing an ex-Air American ( sorry his name escapes me ) and announce it on your blog , your Canadian fans are greeted with the web version of static .
I do n't know if it 's a Canadian Government plot , to either keep us from being political , or from getting too funny , but basically what I 'm saying is I 'm pissed off .
There , now I feel better .
Otherwise keep up the GREAT work ... and Breathe , the air 's just fine .

We live in a time where a 25 year old rightwing punk can create a hoax video and the congress rushes through legislation to defund their target based on the video with no trial .
Then when there 's a trial and the results are ACORN is not guilty and the perpetrator is found to have edited the video to suit their agenda , the congress still keeps the legislation and the ( not ) " liberal media " does n't issue retractions .
Then with something important like health care where 45,000 Americans are dying a year , they say they can't rush through legislation , it 's impossible .

THEN ... we have Kellogg , Brown , & Root ( Halliburton ) on real video doing things like electrocuting our soldiers and locking raped women in holding tanks with testimony in front of congress and we keep throwing billions at them .
This government lost its moral compass .
People like Patterico have lost their moral compass .
What say you , Patterico , about defunding KBR / Halliburton ?
NO COMMENT !

And what say you about Blackwater , Patterico ?
NO COMMENT , I 'm sure !
You only pick on ACORN because they registered one million mostly poor blacks who do n't vote Republican .
This is the fact , pure and simple .
Let 's see if Patterico has any comments on KBR / Halliburton or Blackwater .
He wo n't , because those corporations are do things that fall into line with " his side " .
O'Keefe / Breitbart would never do a sting on a white / right filthy rich corporation ripping off the government .
And to defund ACORN , he 'll fabricate and splice a video , though .

KBR gets $ 35 M contract despite electrocutions
http://www.armytimes.com.../ap_kbr_contract_020709/
Patterico , did you report on this on your website ?
And urge defunding of KBR ?
It 's downright unAmerican if you did n't !
It would mean you do n't care if American soldiers die , as long as a company did it that 's " your guys " .

The new $ 35 million KBR contract , Big Dan , is only a part of the linked story which notes : KBR has said it would cost an extra $ 560 million to refurbish buildings in Iraq used by the U.S. military , including Saddam Hussein ’s palaces , which among other problems are based on a 220 - volt standard rather than the American 120 - volt standard .
KBR , of course , is a former division of Halliburton , the company where Dick Cheney was the CEO before the left of the 2000 election made him VP .
Now , KBR , after electrocuting our soldiers , shows its loyalty to Uncle Sam by relocating its HQ to Dubai .
Here we are in 2010 still enmeshed in a war of choice that Joseph Stiglitz estimated in 2008 had already cost $ 3 trillion --- an unprovoked war of aggression to make the world safe for Exxon - Mobil and Chevron profits ; a war initiated on a pack of lies emanating not only from the Bush / Cheney White House but the same Fox Noise crowd that is " appalled " that a few low level workers at a benevolent community organization could be taken in by right wing scam artists like O'Keefe & Giles .
But hey , as Colbert notes , the Fox Noise crowd and their Republican Congressional allies succeeded in cutting off funds to an organization that helps protect people from mortgage scam artists and helps to prevent these defrauded victims from being evicted , so it 's a " win-win . "
( Funny when Colbert said it , but not really funny when you think about it ) .
An academic study long - ago released by the Lancet reveals the war has " liberated " more than one million Iraqis from their obligation [ and ability ] to breathe .
Millions more Iraqis have been sent into exile .
This never needed war in Iraq has costs the lives of thousands of US & UK soldiers ; maimed and crippled for life tens of thousands more .
Three trillion dollars and counting for this endless war and occupation -- and here , at home , our economy is in free fall , unemployment has reached levels not seen since the Great Depression , our schools are underfunded , our infrastructure is collapsing , growing numbers of Americans are left to wonder where they will find their next meal , let alone how they can afford the extortionate cost of health insurance courtesy of a cartel whose CEOs have all the empathy of Mob boss , and the happy bankers and Wall Street tycoons are scheming for their next multi-million dollar bonus checks .
But hey , we 've got our Patterico to focus on the minutia of the doctored ACORN video tapes , while he ignores his legal duty to enforce CA PC 632 against his right - wing soul - mates , the phony pimp and phony hooker , so it 's all good .

Hi , checked in and ( of course ) no comment from Patterico on KBR 's electrocuting American soldiers .
But , what I really wanted to say , is I watched the Colbert video again and you can notice some really funny things like when Colbert splices Hannity saying he needs hooker boots and condoms , the FOX " news " ticker below Colbert instantly ticks : " HANNITY : 'I NEED HOOKER BOOTS AND CONDOMS ' " .
Patterico is an unAmerican coward for not posting about how KBR should be defunded for electrocuting American soldiers .

I see that our local Deputy DA Patrick Frey aka Patterico can come in and continue his nit-picking rants while he continues to ignore just how badly Colbert demolished the entire thrust of the phony ACORN sting .
Frey asserts that since he is not the one who would be called upon the enforce PC 632 in his office ; that the task would be assigned to someone else , it 's perfectly okay for him to not only defend an accused federal felon but to actually rely on the content of audiotapes recorded in violation of a criminal statute ( PC 632 ) that his office is charged with enforcing .
After all what is a little crime that may have been committed by his right - wing soul mate , O'Keefe " when measured against Pat Frey 's need to score political points at his right - wing blog .
This same Deputy DA cries big crocodile tears when , after repeatedly ignoring Brad Friedman 's admonishments as to the need for civility at this blog ( He continued to call anyone and everyone who did not agree with him a liar , and worse ) , Brad simply placed his comments in " moderation . "
At his own Patterico 's Pontifications , fearful that his flimsy arguments would be exposed , he blocked mine .
Whether he subsequently restored my ability to post a comment at his site , I really do n't know as I 've not tried .
What I do know is that this Deputy DA allowed one of his right - wing nut followers to post what bordered on a terrorist threat against me , and yet he failed to so much as admonish that person 's behavior --- this despite the fact that I defended him at this site by noting that I 've not seen evidence that he actually posted comments here during his office hours .
I posted at his site as ruleoflaw .
Here is the comment that was made at Patterico 's Pontifications .
" Rule of law , I enter your office and put a .45 between your eyes .
Am I not a hitman if I do n’t dress in a suit and have the .45 in a shoulder holster ? "
Now I realize that you did not make that statement , Pat .
No doubt within the realm of your razor - thin excuses , you 'd argue that you can't be held responsible for what someone else wrote at your site .
But then , how do you explain your effort to condemn a nationwide organization with over 400,000 member families in 75 cities on the basis of the fact that a few low - level part - time employees were entrapped by the O'Keefe / Giles / Breitbart partisan , deceptive hoax ?
You can't have it both ways , Mr. Frey .
You can't claim responsibility of a nationwide , benevolent organization for actions by a few low level employees , which actions per both the former MA Attorney General and the Brooklyn DA 's office did not amount to a crime , and then tell us that you are free to ignore a criminal violation of PC 632 because someone else in your office is charged with the responsibility for enforcing that particular law .
You can't come in here with your crocodile tears because Brad Friedman placed you in " moderation " for your lack of decorum , yet fail to police your own site against a thinly veiled terrorist threat against me .
You , Emperor Pat , have no clothes .

Description :
Powered by two alkaline AAA batteries , the compact monotron can be held in one hand .
Although small enough to easily carry with you , the monotron is packed with KORGs legendary analog technology , generating thick and powerful sounds .
Concentrating on the most important sound parameters , the controls have been streamlined as much as possible .
The panel contains only five knobs and one switch .
With this level of simplicity , now anyone can easily enjoy the world of analog synthesizers .
Borrowing the enjoyment of performing with a simple touch from Korgs wildly popular KAOSS products , the monotrons ribbon controller keyboard takes this ease of use even farther .
Simple finger gestures can produce expressive effects such as vibrato and glide .
Used in a band , you can expand your possibilities by harmonizing with another instrument ?
or taking center stage for a monotron solo !
The monotrons circuit is radically simple : one voltage - controlled oscillator , one voltage - controlled filter , and one low frequency oscillator .
Since each knob directly applies a specific change to the sound , the process of sound creation is intuitive , and instantly understandable .
Simple is best .
Gone are the deep lists of presetsand parameters typical of todays synthesizers .
Instead , the monotron encourages exploration andexperimentation .
The monotron provides the joy of sonic creativity that ’s at the heart of analog synthesis , making it an ideal choice for someone who is new to synthesizers , or for musicians who wants to expandtheir sonic palette .
The monotron uses the same highly acclaimed VCF circuit as KORGs classic MS - 10 and MS - 20 semi modular synthesizers .
Originally released over 30 years ago , these instruments are still coveted today for their aggressive , dynamic filters .
The VCF Cutoff knob sets the frequency or tone of the filter ; the VCF Peak knob adds emphasis .
A powerful filter is an essential aspect of any analog synthesizer , applying dramatic tonal changes to the sound , and projecting an intense personality that will stand out in any live performance .
Fairfax Naked Guy -- Not Guilty
A Fairfax County Circuit Court jury took less than 20 minutes Wednesday to find Erick Williamson , " The Naked Guy , " not guilty of indecent exposure , for standing nude inside his Springfield house last fall .
" It 's a weight off my shoulders , " Williamson said of the verdict , which was an appeal of his misdemeanor conviction by a judge in Fairfax General District Court .
" I think it sets the record straight .
It was an innocent action . "
EARLIER :
The appeal trial for The Naked Guy , Erick Williamson , got underway in Fairfax County Circuit Court on Wednesday , after Williamson appealed his conviction for indecent exposure while inside his Springfield house last fall .
Though Fairfax prosecutors limited their case strictly to the two women who say they saw Williamson , 29 , standing naked at the door to his carport on Oct. 19 , one new detail did emerge today : Yvette Dean , who testified she was walking her 7 - year - old son to school that fateful morning , said that when she spotted Williamson posing in the doorway , " I flipped him off . "
Dean said Williamson was holding his storm door open with one hand , and making eye contact with her .
She said she moved to cover her son's eyes with her overcoat , then turned the corner and walked past the house .
And there was Williamson again , now standing in the front window , Dean said .
She did not make a second obscene gesture at him .
The concept of obscenity is at the heart of the case , which went to the seven - person jury shortly before 3 p.m.
Did Williamson intentionally display himself , both to Dean and to another woman who drove past the house and saw Williamson at 6:40 a.m. that same morning ?
Or was he simply moving about the house , admittedly unclothed , packing , eating breakfast and getting ready to move , as he testified .
Williamson said he never stood in the carport doorway , and that he never intended to expose himself to anyone .
He said if he had realized anyone was out there , he would have covered up and apologized to the passers - by .
The other major detail to emerge today was that Williamson 's lawyers hired a private investigator to measure the distance from where Dean was standing to the carport door .
Investigator John Hickey said it was 83 feet .
A photo taken by the police , of the view from the path that Dean was on looking toward the house on Arley Drive , made it seem like quite a distance , and Dean said the photo was " closer than I was . "
Defense lawyer Dickson
Young presented another photo taken from the path , and the carport door seemed very distant .
Young ridiculed the notion that Dean made eye contact with the naked man .
If a woman is " walking along and sees someone naked , " Young told the jury in his closing argument , " the last thing they 're going to be looking at is his eyes . "
Fairfax Assistant Commonwealthl 's Attorney Marc J. Birnbaum told the jury that two episodes of exposure in one morning , about two hours apart , was not inadvertent .
" This is n't a case about being naked in your own home , " Birnbaum said .
" This is a case of intentional exposure , and that is a violation of law . "
The jury began its deliberations at 2:55 p.m .
Though they were available to be called as witnesses , the police officers who responded to the two exposure reports , and who entered Williamson 's rented house without a warrant , did not testify and those issues were not raised .
After Williamson had a misdemeanor trial in general district court in December , he appealed his guilty verdict to circuit court .
There were then three pre-trial hearings on motions filed by the defense .
Young said Williamson 's legal bills would probably wind up being between $ 10,000 and $ 15,000 .

In Mexico , visual artists can pay their taxes with art works .
That 's the deal Mexico has offered to artists since 1957 , quietly amassing a modern art collection that would make most museum curators swoon .
As the 2009 tax deadline approaches , tax collectors are getting ready to receive a whole new crop of masterworks …
There 's a sliding scale :
If you sell five artworks in a year , you must give the government one .
Sell 21 pieces , the government gets six .
A 10 - member jury of artists ensures that no one tries to unload junk .
Under the program , the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit now owns 4,248 paintings , sculptures , engravings and photographs by Diego Rivera , Rufino Tamayo , Leonora Carrington and other masters .
Shelly Galli , the mother of Camille , is used to dismissive attitudes from doctors .
There was a time when medical specialists told her to all but give up hope that Camille would ever be able to communicate .
“ When my daughter was diagnosed , they told me , if she does n’t talk by 5 or 6 , she probably won’t , ” she recalls .
Camille did n’t .
But Galli refused to give up .
Camille spent years in applied behavior analysis , the intensive one - on - one behavior training technique recommended by the National Institute of Mental Health as a therapy of proven value in helping autistic children .
She did speech therapy , occupational therapy , physical therapy — plus a host of scientifically unproven , even highly controversial treatments , like chelation ( intravenous infusions aimed at removing mercury and other heavy metals from her body ) .
She now eats a special organic diet and every afternoon drinks small cups of acidophilus and vinegar to counter internal yeast .
She spends 35 hours a week in a one - girl schoolroom that her parents have created for her in an unused portion of a local religious school , working with a former preschool teacher with expertise in special education .
She works with an art teacher and does speech therapy twice a week , works out at a gym with trainers every day and goes to vision therapy twice a week at the Vision and Conceptual Development Center , where she does jumping jacks on a trampoline and animal walks , throws and catches a beanbag and “ fixates ” on pictures .
All this costs well over $ 100,000 a year .
But now , at age 11 , Camille is talking .
“ Talking more every day , ” Galli says .
And Camille is reading .
“ And I ’m glad we did n’t listen to those people , ” Galli adds .
In addition to twice - weekly sessions at the vision center , Camille does follow - up exercises at home or in school .
She also does additional computer exercises , which help her with “ tracking ” skills , according to her teacher , Colleen Bane , and also — according to the computer program ’s Web site — help her develop eye - muscle strength and letter recognition and activate the visual processing center of her brain .
On the day I came to see her in her classroom , she was doing a set of those exercises on her laptop computer .
She kept looking away from the screen , where words flashed quickly , requiring her to track with her eyes and point with her finger .
As the exercise changed to one that required her to quickly memorize a short stream of letters and type them on the keyboard , she closed her eyes entirely .
She twisted around constantly , trying to get a good look at the wall clock , where the minute hand was ticking , ever so slowly , toward 3 o’clock and the release for home .
This was new .
In recent months , her teacher , Colleen Bane said proudly , Camille has made great progress in telling time .
Though Camille has been taking part in many types of therapy , Galli attributes much of Camille ’s progress in reading , and conducting herself in the world generally , to vision therapy .
The same is true for Francesca Dennis , Brian ’s mother , even though during the time her son was doing vision therapy he also switched schools , a change that , Dennis told me , vastly improved his life .
And Jack , the boy from Atlanta with the language disorder , began for the first time to receive speech therapy while he was doing vision therapy .
When I asked Allred whether Jack ’s progress might just as well have been because of his speech therapy , she said : “ To be honest with you , I do n’t think you can tell .
From my perspective , I do n’t care .
Are you going to deny your kid a therapy just to see if another therapy works ?
I ’m mostly going on my gut . ”
Galli also said it was possible that Camille ’s progress might be a result of her other , more proven therapies , but she added that it did n’t really matter :
“ We never know what it is that ’s really helping .
But we ’re not going to take any chances .
You just do n’t want to lose time . ”
MOBILE , Ala . -- Preacher Anthony Hopkins ' stepdaughter has said she was sexually abused by Hopkins starting when she was 11 , but Hopkins testified today that they did not have their first sexual encounter until March 2008 .
It was then , Hopkins testified in his rape and murder case , that his eldest stepdaughter , who was 19 at the time , approached him in the living room wearing a " chocolate negligee . "
" From that point , I was tempted and I yielded to the temptation , " Hopkins testified .
" As a result , she got pregnant . "
Hopkins is accused of murdering his wife and storing her body in a freezer for 4 years , even hooking up a generator to make sure the freezer never lost power in a hurricane or other storm .
The 39 - year - old began testifying in his own defense this morning as he faces charges of murder , second - degree rape , second - degree sodomy , second - degree sex abuse and incest .
Prosecutors say he killed 36 - year - old Arletha Hopkins in December 2004 after she learned that her husband had sexually abused the stepdaughter .
Hopkins has denied killing her , saying he does not know how she died , but that he tried to keep her body preserved because he could not stand the thought of her decomposing .
He said his family continued to live their life together , preaching and going to work , after his wife 's death .
While the stepdaughter told jurors that Hopkins jumped up and down on the body to make it fit in the freezer , Hopkins denied doing that .
He said his wife 's body " fit snuggly , " though " I did press the freezer down . "
Japan 's whaling ships have returned from the Southern Ocean with their smallest catch in years , prompting the fleet 's leader to blame harassment by the Sea Shepherd marine conservation group for the shortfall .
The Nisshin Maru , the fleet 's mother ship , returned to Tokyo harbour yesterday with just 507 whales , a little over half the target catch of 935 , according to the fisheries agency .
The haul of minke whales and a single finback was well down on last year 's catch of 680 .
The fleet said Sea Shepherd 's attempts to sabotage the hunt had deprived it of 31 days ' whaling .
The annual confrontation between the two groups reached its height in January with the sinking of Sea Shepherd 's high - tech powerboat , the Ady Gil , after a collision with the Shonan Maru 2 harpoon boat .
The speedboat 's skipper , Peter Bethune , later boarded the Shonan Maru 2 to carry out a citizen 's arrest of the captain and hand over a £ 2 m bill for the destruction of the Ady Gil .
The 45 - year - old New Zealander could face a lengthy prison term after being indicted by Japanese authorities on five charges , including trespassing and assault .
The whalers used water canon and a sonic crowd control device to deter Sea Shepherd , whose crew responded by hurling rancid - butter bombs .
The whaling fleet 's leader , Shigetoshi Nishiwaki , said he was " furious " with Sea Shepherd for preventing it from reaching its quota during the five - month season .
" They say they protect the sea , but they do n't care about leaking oil or leaving pieces of a boat behind , " he said , in a reference to the stricken Ady Gil .
This winter 's catch fell one short of the total for 2006 - 7 season , when the fleet returned home early after a fire broke out aboard the Nissin Maru .
Japan is permitted to slaughter the whales for " scientific research " thanks to a clause in the International Whaling Commission 's 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling .
As the commission prepares to meet in Morocco in June , Japan has proposed scaling back its Antarctic hunts in return for permission to step up its coastal whaling activities .
Australia , which opposes the move , has threatened to take Japan to the international court of justice unless its ends its annual hunts in the Southern Ocean , in the Antarcatic region .
The whale wars will continue in Japan with the resumption of the trial of two Greenpeace activists charged with theft and trespassing while investigating alleged embezzlement by the whaling fleet .
Toru Suzuki and Junichi Sato could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison if found guilty .
A ruling is expected in June .
Greenpeace said yesterday it had called on Japanese authorities to reopen an investigation into its allegations of widespread corruption in the programme .
" Our initial allegations have been repeatedly upheld by industry insiders , " Sato said .
" It is time for the cover-ups , the lies , the corruption and the squandering of taxpayers ' money to end . "
The group said negligible demand for whale meat in Japan had created a 4,455 - ton stockpile , adding that this year 's catch would send another 1,800 tons into frozen storage .

Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney blocked any reference to gay rights in a new study guide for immigrants applying for Canadian citizenship , the Canadian Press has learned .
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney says his department tried to make an ' inclusive ' immigration study guide , but could n't fit in every government policy and legal decision .
( ( CBC ) )
Internal documents show an early draft of the guide contained sections noting that homosexuality was decriminalized in 1969 ; that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation ; and that same - sex marriage was legalized nationally in 2005 .
But Kenney , who fought same - sex marriage when it was debated in Parliament , ordered those key sections removed when his office sent its comments to the department last June .
Senior department officials duly cut out the material — but made a last - ditch plea with Kenney in early August to have it reinstated .
" Recommend the re-insertion of the text boxes related to … the decriminalization of homosexual sex / recognition of same - sex marriage , " says a memorandum to Kenney from deputy minister Neil Yeates .
" Recommend the addition of ' equality rights ' under list of rights .
Had noted earlier that this bullet should be reinserted into the list as a means of noting the equality of all based on race , gender , sexual orientation etc . "
In the end , however , Kenney 's view trumped that of the bureaucrats .
The 63 - page guide , titled Discover Canada : The Rights and Responsibilities of Citizenship , was released with fanfare last November and contains no mention of gay and lesbian rights .
About 500,000 copies were printed and citizenship applicants will start being tested on its contents March 15 .
The $ 400,000 project substantially updated an earlier edition of the guide created in 1995 .
The new version significantly expands sections on Canada 's military past and on aboriginal people , drawing on the views of a panel of prominent Canadians .
The new guide got generally positive reviews when it was launched , though some immediately noted the absence of gay rights , including same - sex marriage .
The publication does include a picture of Olympic gold medal swimmer Mark Tewksbury , however , with a caption saying he is a " prominent activist for gay and lesbian Canadians . "
Minister steadfastly opposed same - sex marriage
Drafts and other internal documents related to the guide were obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act .
" Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1969 and more recently , civil marriage rights to same - sex couples was legalized nationwide in 2005 , " the earliest draft of the guide says under the section Towards a Modern Canada .
And in the section on citizenship rights , the early draft said : " Equality Rights — Canadians are protected against discrimination based on race , gender , national origin , religion , sexual orientation or age . "
Neither sentence survived the minister 's red marker .
Kenney has steadfastly opposed same - sex marriage since his time as an opposition MP in the House of Commons .
He spoke against the Civil Marriage Act , or Bill C - 38 , when it was debated in the Commons in February 2005 .
And days earlier , Kenney told a session with Toronto - area Punjabi journalists that gays had every right to marry — as long as it was n't someone of the same sex .
' Choices had to be made about content ' : Kenney spokesman
He reaffirmed his stand in 2006 when the newly elected Conservative government attempted without success to revoke the legislation .
And last year , Kenney appointed a longtime Conservative who opposes same - sex marriage to the Immigration and Refugee Board , which among other things makes decisions about whether gays can be given refugee status in Canada .
When the new guide was released Nov. 12 , Kenney brushed off a reporter 's question about why it lacked any reference to same - sex marriage .
" We can't mention every legal decision , every policy of the government of Canada , " he said .
" We try to be inclusive and include a summary .
I can tell you that if you were to read the old book , you would n't even know that there are gay and lesbian Canadians . "
He then noted the caption under Tewksbury 's photo .
Kenney 's spokesman reiterated that the 1995 guide " produced by the Liberals " did not mention gays and lesbians .
" We can endlessly debate what was included or not included , " Alykhan Velshi said in an email last week .
" Unavoidably , choices had to be made about content because we had to ensure the guide did not become encyclopedic . "
Velshi also noted the new guide does not refer to marriage at all , whether opposite sex or same sex .
The gay - rights group Egale Canada met with the minister in early December after learning the booklet made no reference to gay and lesbian rights , and is negotiating with the department to have them included in the next printing , about a year away .
Kenney told the group that gay rights had been " overlooked " when the guide was being prepared , executive director Helen Kennedy said in an interview from Toronto .
" I 'm hopeful and optimistic that we 're going to get it fixed because we 're not happy with it . "
Kennedy expressed surprise when told draft versions of the guide did , in fact , contain references to gay rights and that they were ordered removed .
The Canadian Press previously reported that other sections of the draft version of the guide were excised at the suggestion of the panel of prominent Canadians .
The deleted sections included one reference that said Canadian churches ran Indian residential schools , where aboriginal children were abused .
A strange piece , not because his basic idea is wrongheaded but because the advisor he singles out for immediate termination is Tim Kaine .
Of all the satellites in orbit around The One — Rahm , Axelrod , Jarrett , Geithner and the economic team — the guy who needs to be liquidated post haste for losing Virginia , New Jersey , and Massachusetts is … the chairman of the DNC ?
Memo to Wilder :
It ai n’t Tim Kaine who saddled national Democrats with double - digit unemployment and a health - care initiative that ’s now almost - 13 in net approval .
He actually goes so far as to lament that Kaine ’s record as Virginia ’s governor will be a national issue for Republicans in November , which is so far removed from reality that I have to wonder what his real agenda is .
My guess ?
He wants to blame Rahm and the rest of the inner circle by name but does n’t quite have the stones to do it , so we get this weak tea instead :
The need is becoming more obvious by the day :
He must overhaul his own team , replacing the admittedly brilliant advisers who helped elect him with others more capable of helping him govern .
Getting elected and getting things done for the people are two different jobs …
The changes must go much deeper .
Obama ’s West Wing is filled with people who are in their jobs because of their Chicago connections or because they signed on with Obama early during his presidential campaign .
One problem is that they do not have sufficient experience at governing at the executive branch level .
The deeper problem is that they are not listening to the people .
Hearing is one thing ; listening is another …
It would be a grave mistake for the president and those around him to misread the current polls and analyses .
They suggest that 1 ) the American people do not like the direction in which the country is heading ; 2 ) they do not believe that either Democrats or Republicans are showing that they get the message and are doing the business of the people ; 3 ) they hold Congress in very low regard ; but 4 ) they really like the president .
Yet , they keep going to the polls to rebuke him resoundingly every chance it is presented .
For a more proper treatment of how Obama ’s core team is ruining his presidency , read this zesty Steve Clemons piece or Andrew Malcolm ’s roundup of newfound naysaying about the Chicago squad at the LA Times .
The fingerpointing at Rahm , in particular , for having mismanaged the ObamaCare process in the Senate is growing too .
Exit question :
Time to start a pool on when Emanuel is forced out in favor of , oh , say , Tom Daschle ?
I ’ll take May 15th , just because .

[ on Pulp Fiction ( 1994 ) ]
I put aside an hour every day to go over that monologue again and again for months , and every time I got to the end of it , I would crack up .
I was already 35 years old , and I 'd been in show business for 30 - plus years , and suddenly there was this big movie and I was getting an Oscar , and this enormous thing happened .
In Der Stadtneurotiker ( 1977 ) , I played the strange brother who wanted to drive into oncoming cars .
Immediately after that was Die durch die Hölle gehen ( 1978 ) , where I played this nice guy who shoots himself in the head .
Something happened there .
The fact that they came so close together , and they were both important movies , two big public things where I was simultaneously . . . " disturbed " .
That got the ball rolling for me in terms of being an actor .
I wo n't do commercials , either .
I do n't want to sell anything .
As an actor , it 's tricky .
You have this platform and it has to do with your face , your charisma .
It 's tricky when you endorse something because people are liable to believe you .
Be careful .
I would like to be a very old man and still be acting .
So I feel lucky to have stuck around for this long .
You have to be good and all that , but you also have to be lucky .
I guess in everything .
But especially if you 're an actor .
So I got no complaints .
I 'm serious .
I do not like the unknown or the unexpected .
I cannot stand being surprised , yet as an actor I like surprise .
I get very upset if my bills are n't paid immediately .
I 've always been a character actor , although I 'm not quite sure what that means .
All my scripts are absolutely covered in notes , so any time I say anything -- even " pass the salt " -- I have six subtexts , comments on what I really mean when I 'm saying that .
Maybe that 's what gives the impression that I 'm saying one thing and thinking something else .
[ on what makes him choose parts ]
Lots of things .
The script , the directors , the location , the actors , how much are they going to pay me ?
How long is it going to take ?
[ on if he does research to prepare for a role ]
No .
The soul is in the words , comes from the words , not research .
[ Research is ] useless , waste of time .
And exhausting .
I just do n't know how to do it .
I only know my own experiences .
People are completely mysterious to me .
Even in my own family I have no idea what any of them are thinking .
People always comment about my hair .
It is unusual for a man my age to have so much .
There were years when I did n't do anything but collect unemployment .
I worked a lot , but I worked for nothing .
I worked for 15 years as a kind of janitor at the Actors Studio .
I would do manual things .
I did lots of plays , theater workshops , for nothing .
[ on how he memorizes lines and prepares for a role ]
What I do has a lot to do with the words .
My favorite thing is to have two scripts at the same time , and study them simultaneously in the kitchen .
Go over the words , over and over , do them different ways , different inflections and rhythms .
For me , rhythm is very important .
I think we express ourselves as much with rhythm as with the words .
It 's not what you say , it 's how you say it .
I think it 's very true .
If you start to say your lines and it sounds right , usually I stick with that .
If it sounds right , it probably is right .
It 's curious , how you 're not collaborating with anyone at that point , and by the time you get there with other actors on the set , usually what you 've done at home makes sense , and it 's acceptable to everybody .
The thing I have trouble with , because I 'm so dependent on knowing my lines , is that if suddenly somebody says , " Here 's a big speech .
You 're going to do that instead , " I get lost .
At that point , I understand why Marlon Brando loves cue cards .
What I used to do was , I 'd get the script and see who the character was - - a spy , a lumberjack , whatever -- then I 'd try to dress the part for the audition , to give the impression that I was tough or funny or whatever the part seemed to call for .
That was always a disaster .
I would never get the job .
If I learned anything it 's not to do anything like that .
Now if they want to look at me , I go in and let them look at me .
Let them figure out their own reasons for why they 'd want to hire me .
[ on why he hates not to be working ]
When I do n't have any work sometimes , a kind of thing sets in where my mind shuts down .
It 's almost like hibernation .
It 's not that I 'm unhappy , but I 'm not thinking anything .
Then I 'll go and watch television .
And after an hour or two , I 'll think , " You 're just sitting there watching television and it's not even interesting " .
And there 's nothing to do .
Life becomes meaningless .
With stage fright you keep on doing it and eventually the fear goes away .
If you stick around long enough you become very hard to intimidate .
It is very difficult to make me nervous about working these days .
There have been so many times when I thought I was finished , but it was not true - you just keep going .
I am scared of sickness , pollution and crazy people but , work - wise , there is nothing to frighten me .
[ on his process of acting ]
You know .
it 's really tricky .
People have no idea .
How do you do it ?
Most of the time I do n't .
I mean , I can't .
You just do it as well as you can .
And , hopefully , you did some good stuff here and some good stuff there .
The best part is going home in the car at the end of the day , and thinking , " I was good " .
I think that movie sets when they 're good , are a lot like sandboxes .
People think that my favorite roles to do are villains , but I find comedy to be the most challenging and rewarding .
I would make a very bad killer in real life because I do n't think I could even pick up a gun , much less actually shoot one .
Guns make me very nervous .
They 're dangerous .
I 'm more of a pacifist than anyone could imagine .
[ on Quentin Tarantino ]
Movie scripts are usually pretty loose -- things usually change a lot .
But not with [ Quentin Tarantino ] .
His scripts are absolutely huge .
All dialogue .
It 's all written down .
You just learn the lines .
It 's more like a play .
Me and Dennis Hopper , when we were doing that scene in True Romance ( 1993 ) , it was hilarious .
It really was -- including shooting him .
All that laughing was real .
He was killing me .
And all the guys around us -- that was a very cracking - up day .
Golf .
My God , that 's a mysterious occupation .
I know people who are -- good friends -- who are absolutely smitten , practicing their swing and talking about it .
I can understand some sort of sport where your body got a benefit , like marathon running or bicycle racing .
That 's not golf .
And not only that , but the whole business of standing in the sun--my God .
That 's like torture .
Professional dancers do n't go dancing .
I do n't like zoos .
Awful .
When I was a kid , there was someone in my family , an adult , and whenever I saw them , they would say , " You got a lotta nerve . "
From the time I was a little kid , it was always like , " Heh , heh , heh - - you got a lotta nerve . "
I always thought , " What does that mean ? "
But then when I got older , I thought that it was an instruction .
If you tell a kid something , it sticks .
I think I do have a lot of nerve .
But , I mean , I think I maybe got it from that person who said it to me .
There 's something dangerous about what 's funny .
Jarring and disconcerting .
There is a connection between funny and scary .
They say that the human smile is in fact one of those primordial things -- that in fact it 's a showing of teeth , that it 's a warning .
That when we smile , in a primeval way it has to do with fear .
Sometimes I look at this watch and I think , " There 's some guy that puts these little screws in there ? "
There is something about it .
I 'm not into cars , either , but there is something about a really magnificent car .
It all happened when I did Die durch die Hölle gehen ( 1978 ) ] .
Suddenly -- I 'd already been in show business for 30 years , and nothing much had happened .
I mean , I really was laboring in obscurity , and then suddenly this movie .
It was kind of infectious , and I really did become rather social .
Gregarious .
And that lasted , I do n't know , ten years .
I had an agent when I first got into the movies who said to me , " You 're gonna be in Los Angeles now once in a while .
If somebody invites you to a party , do n't go .
Stay in your room , go to the movies . "
And I have a feeling I know sort of what he meant :
Do n't show your face around too much .
Let 'em be a little glad to see you .
When you 're onstage and you know you 're bombing , that 's very , very scary .
Because you know you gotta keep going -- you 're bombing , but you can't stop .
And you know that half an hour from now , you 're still gonna be bombing .
It takes a thick skin .
I love spaghetti .
And I like to cook spaghetti .
And I used to eat it every day .
I weighed 30 pounds more than I do now .
You ca n't . . . you can't do that .
Ice cream -- I love to watch television and eat ice cream .
But that 's like a ten - year - old .
I can't do that anymore .
Beer .
Beer , spaghetti , ice cream .
I always figured that if I 'm gonna be playing these people , that there should be this relationship to the audience that is very clear .
" That 's Chris , and look at Chris having a good time , wanting to take over the world and sink California and shoot everybody in the room " -- just so long as they understand that that 's Chris on the set having fun .
And that Chris would n't really do anything like that .
Most of the jobs I get are basically very unwholesome people .
There 's always something wrong with the guy , and sometimes something deeply wrong .
I 'm tired of that .
I tell my agent I want a Fred MacMurray part .
I want a part where I have a wife and kids and a dog and a house , and my kids say to me , " What do you think I should do , Dad ? " and I say , " Be careful . "
I used to love Danish .
My father used to make a Boston cream pie .
You never see that anymore .
Very good .
My father was a lesson .
He had his own bakery , and it was closed one day a week , but he would go anyway .
He did it because he really loved his bakery .
It was n't a job .
That 's supposed to be a fact , that the question mark is originally from an Egyptian hieroglyph that signified a cat walking away .
You know , it 's the tail .
And that symbol meant -- well , whatever it is when they 're ignoring you .
I remember once , years ago , I was walking out a door -- I 'd been having a conversation and I was walking out the door , and this guy said to me , " Chris , " and I stopped and I turned , and he said , " Be careful . "
And I never forgot that .
And it comes back to me often :
Be careful .
That was good advice .
Morning is the best time to see movies .
Well , I missed the boat on computers .
I think I was really just on the cusp .
If I had been a little bit younger , I probably would have a computer .
But when they came along , it looked so boring to me that I just never bothered .
But also when something is ubiquitous , it 's almost redundant .
I do n't have a wristwatch either because if I need to know what time it is , I ask somebody .
I got stuck in an airport a while ago , and I always carry quarters so that I can use the payphone , and I tried all these payphones and they just did n't work .
I guess nobody uses them anymore .
And somebody asked , " Would you like to use my cell phone ? "
There are enough of them around .
If I need to know something about something , I say to my wife , " Can you check this out on your computer " , and she comes back within ten minutes with the information .
I use it , I just do n't have it .

For example , [ Batmans Rückkehr ( 1992 ) ] , when I was shooting it I got very interesting clothes and accessories .
On my last day of shooting I had already thought a long time about what I would like to take with me .
I had some beautiful cuff links .
When I had finished my last scene and went back to my dressing room , everything was already gone .
Everything !
My weakness as a director was if somebody would ask me something I 'd say , " Just do whatever you want " .
My impression is that a director must be a little like a general .
You'd hate me to be running a war because I would n't know what anybody is doing .
There are just certain roles -- well , they never ask me to play the guy that gets the girl , even though I 've been married for 41 years now , so I DID get the girl .

At night I have possums , skunks , lots of raccoons .
They come right in the house , through the cat door , and they bring their babies in .
I get up at night and they 're in the kitchen , eating all the cat food .
[ In 1993 ] I never was a big fan of school , to tell you the truth .
I never had kids , but I suspect if I did , I would n't encourage them to go to school .
I never liked it myself .
I was always grateful for being taught to read .
I figured that once that had been done for me , that 's the big thing .
A little bit of adding , subtracting , multiplying , that sort of thing .
And you have to learn to write , at least a letter .
But beyond that , I think people are over - educated .
I think education will come if you want it .
I read what I want to read , so that 's what I know about .
You can't know everything , so you should concentrate on what you 're interested in .
The whole concept of general education - I think it makes for vague minds .
I use punctuation , but I finish the sentence and put [ in ] a period but it 's not necessarily where somebody else would .
I think everybody should talk the way they want .
You go to school and you all sit there and all learn to do the same thing .
I guess it 's necessary but it 's too bad also , in a way .
Kids , you know , get kind of restrained in a lot of ways .
I probably would n't get a job as an English teacher .
[ about his hair ]
When it's wet , I stick it up with some gunk and walk around and let the air dry it and then it stays there .
I have good hair .
I have a lot of hair .
Whatever I do must be good for it , because I 've still got so much .
Every time I meet guys I went to school with , they 've got no hair .
If somebody were to do the story of my life , not that anybody would , it would be about my wife and me around the house .
It would be like watching paint dry .
[ on his style ] Garish .
Especially when I was younger -- I was always a bit exotic .
Never wore a hat because the hair was more important .
I know what I 'm doing onstage .
But in films I have to depend on the kindness of strangers .
I asked this girl to go to the prom and she said she would but that she had a boyfriend , an older guy .
Then she took out her wallet and showed me a picture of this handsome guy with the hair , the teeth , who looked like a Greek statue .
I thought , " All right " , and then I asked to see it again and said , " This is not a photograph .
You cut this out of a magazine . "
She got farmisht and said , " Yes , you 're right , I did .
I 'm so madly in love with him .

She went with me to the prom .

There 's a playpen aspect .
When it 's good , it 's always there .
You 're a bit like kids , and you 're in a sandbox , and you 're making it up - - or you think you are .
A good director really is like a lifeguard .
He sits on a big chair and he's got all these crazy kids in the sandbox and they 're playing .
Every once in a while , one of them slips or falls out of the sandbox or whatever , and a good director just picks him up and puts him back inside and proceeds .
My life is anything but eccentric .
I 've been married for 46 years and I pay all my bills , and I live in a house where the lawn is always cut and I 'm nice to my cat .
Somebody once said that 80 $ of directing actors is casting them in the first place .
So you hope that they hired you because you have some particular quality that is going to be useful to them in the movie .
Good directors usually hire you and then they kind of leave you alone .

Salary ( 1 )
John Bellamy Foster is editor of Monthly Review and professor of sociology at the University of Oregon .
He is coauthor , with Fred Magdoff , of The Great Financial Crisis : Causes and Consequences ( Monthly Review Press , January 2009 ) among numerous other works .
This article was originally a presentation delivered to the International Conference on the Critique of Capital in the Era of Globalization , Suzhou University , Suzhou , China , January 11 , 2009 .
In referring in my title here to “ A Failed System ” I do not of course mean that capitalism as a system is in any sense at an end .
Rather I mean by “ failed system ” a global economic and social order that increasingly exhibits a fatal contradiction between reality and reason — to the point , in our time , where it threatens not only human welfare but also the continuation of most sentient forms of life on the planet .
Three critical contradictions make up the contemporary world crisis emanating from capitalist development : ( 1 ) the current Great Financial Crisis and stagnation / depression ; ( 2 ) the growing threat of planetary ecological collapse ; and ( 3 ) the emergence of global imperial instability associated with shifting world hegemony and the struggle for resources .
Such structural weaknesses of the system , as Joseph Schumpeter might have said , are the product of capitalism ’s past successes , but they raise catastrophic problems and failures in the present nonetheless .
How we choose to act today in response to this failed system is therefore the most critical question that humanity has ever faced .
The Great Financial Crisis and Stagnation / Depression
The world economy centered in the advanced capitalist states is experiencing by far its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression .
A Great Financial Crisis on a scale not seen in the United States and the other advanced capitalist states since the 1930s is leading to a major decline in world economic growth , and is pointing to a possible world depression .
So severe is the current situation that even U.S. President George W. Bush , in prepared remarks for a November 2008 summit of the central bank governors and finance ministers of the G - 20 economies , stated that what threatened , if decisive governmental action were not taken , could be a “ depression greater than the Great Depression ’s . ”
One way to understand the enormity of the world financial and economic crisis is in terms of what has been called The Return of Depression Economics .
This was the title of a book that Paul Krugman , the most recent winner of the Bank of Sweden ’s Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics , first wrote in response to the Asian crisis of 1997 – 98 .
That book has now been released in a new edition , entitled The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008 .
What Krugman means by this phrase is of course the return of the economics of John Maynard Keynes ’s The General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money , published in 1936 in the midst of the Great Depression .
Everyone would agree that Keynes and his “ depression economics ” are in some sense back .
But which Keynes ?
And if we take Keynes seriously as a critic of capitalism ( although a limited one ) , is it not necessary to go back even further to the greatest critic of all : Karl Marx ?
In The General Theory Keynes famously pointed to what he called the “ outstanding faults ” of the capitalist economy : its enormously unequal division of income and its inability to maintain a full - employment equilibrium .
These outstanding faults produced instability in the investment process of capitalism , the engine of accumulation .
Capitalism , according to Keynes , was a system characterized by uncertainty .
Investment lost its dynamism when expected profits on new investment were depressed , due primarily to present and anticipated demand constraints .
As investment outlets vanished , capital turned to speculation , giving rise to asset bubbles that generated financial instability and the prospect of more serious crises in the future .
The principal doctrine that Keynes challenged was Say ’s Law that supply creates its own demand .
Orthodox economics , he argued , had never freed itself from this error and implicitly assumed in its basic analyses that “ the economic system was always operating up to its full capacity . ”
This meant that the orthodox view was “ incompetent to tackle the problems of unemployment and of the trade cycle . ”
The dominant tendency in modern capitalism , he believed , was the veering toward unemployment equilibrium and substantial excess capacity .
Keynes , who was a defender of the system , but who advocated policies that went beyond what the capitalist class itself was willing to accept , proposed as solutions to these problems : the “ euthanasia of the rentier , ” a substantial decrease in capital ’s share of income , and “ a somewhat comprehensive socialisation of investment . ”
He also pointed to the need for enhanced civilian government spending to fill the gap in effective demand and move the economy toward a full - employment equilibrium .
And he argued for limited controls on international movements of capital .
In referring to his analysis as “ the general theory ” Keynes distinguished this from orthodox neoclassical theory , which he referred to as a “ special case , ” the characteristics of which “ happen not to be those of the economic society in which we actually live , ” and which therefore led to results which were “ misleading and disastrous . ”
The reality of the Great Depression convinced many economists and business observers in the late 1930s that Keynes was right , and led to widespread references to the “ Keynesian revolution . ”
Keynes ’s proposals related to stimulating effective demand through civilian government spending were not directly applied in the 1930s , however , and it was the Second World War that lifted the United States and other advanced capitalist economies out of the Great Depression .
After the war , Keynes ’s analysis was debased by such figures as Paul Samuelson at MIT , leading to what was sometimes called the “ neoclassical - Keynesian synthesis , ” or more frequently the “ neoclassical synthesis . ”
In what Keynes ’s younger colleague , Joan Robinson , famously dubbed “ bastard Keynesianism , ” Keynes ’s more revolutionary insights were all excluded and his analysis was reincorporated with the neoclassical theory in a subordinate form .
Mainstream economists came to the conclusion that the capitalist economy could be effectively managed by monetary and fiscal policy fine tuning , with an emphasis on the former .
This was because the economy was once again implicitly assumed to act in accordance with Say ’s Law , moving naturally toward a full - employment equilibrium , now redefined as a “ natural rate of unemployment . ”
Neoliberal globalization , deregulation , the removal of all restrictions on the movement of capital , the creation of sophisticated new financial architectures , were seen as constituting the essence of all economic logic on a world scale .
Hence , by the 1970s ( and even more so after the stagflation crisis of that decade ) Keynes had been relegated to a “ special case theory of Depression economics , ” applicable only when monetary policy could no longer be effectively used to boost the economy .
But such a condition was no longer believed to be relevant , since , as University of Chicago economist Robert Lucas declared in 2003 in his presidential address to the American Economic Association , the problem of depression and even of the business cycle had essentially been solved .
This view was reiterated in 2004 by Ben Bernanke , then a Federal Reserve Board governor , now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board .
For Bernanke the Great Depression was no longer of theoretical interest ; rather the problem to solve was the “ Great Moderation , ” i.e. , the reduced volatility of the capitalist economy in the 1980s and ’90s .
What needed investigating , he argued , were the reasons for the effective end of the business cycle , which he attributed to more sophisticated monetary policy , arising initially out of the insights of Milton Friedman ’s monetarism .
Today figures like Krugman are seen as partly challenging these conclusions , and as representing the return of Keynesian economics .
But this is not a return to Keynes in the sense of his general theoretical critique of capitalism ’s fundamental flaws .
Rather it is a return to Keynesianism as a “ special case ” of “ depression economics , ” where monetary policy is ineffective and expansive fiscal policy needs to be given priority .
The ascendancy of neoclassical economics , which bastardized and subordinated Keynes ’s mildly critical view of capitalism , is not itself challenged .
Nor is capitalism questioned .
Rather it is assumed that mistakes were made in monetary policy and in regulatory systems that have pulled the economy back down into the “ special case ” of Keynesian “ depression economics . ”
Hence , what Keynes called the “ outstanding faults ” of the capitalist economy are hardly addressed as such .
Keynes , is presented , by his most publicized ( and reactionary ) biographer , as the great “ remedist ” and little else .
The resulting policy emphasis is on fiscal stimulus , a mild redistribution of income , renewed financial regulations , and international reforms in currency trading .
The crisis is treated as a kind of external shock ( or , as Krugman says , the spread of an unknown virus ) .
The severity of the downturn would suggest that long - term forces ( more than the normal business cycle factors ) are concerned .
Yet , the fact that capitalism is an inherently contradictory historical system , which displays increasing irrationality in its later stages is off limits within the economics mainstream , even among its supposedly left of center theorists , such as Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz .
Part of the problem is that although Keynes ’s thinking was too radical for the system he was trying to defend , it was at the same time not radical enough .
It did not fully explain the core contradictions of capitalism .
For a truly general theory of accumulation and crisis under capitalism Marx together with later Marxian political economy remain critical .
For Marx the essence of capitalism lay , according to his famous shorthand , in the relation M - C - M ’ .
Capitalism was a system in which money capital ( M ) was exchanged for commodities ( C ) that were transformed into new commodities through production , which were then sold again for more money M’ ( or M + ∆m , i.e. , surplus value ) .
The nature of this process was such that it was unending .
The M ’ was then reinvested in the next period of production , with the object of getting M’’ at the end , and so on , ad infinitum .
Any interruption in the unending accumulation of capital in this sense pointed to a crisis .
Moreover , the very existence of a system organized in this way made it possible for a crisis to occur through a shortage of effective demand .
For Marx , there was never any doubt about the root cause of capitalist economic crises .
“ The ultimate reason for all real crises always remains the poverty and restricted consumption of the masses as opposed to the drive of capitalist production to develop the productive forces as though only the absolute consuming power of society constituted their limit . ”
With respect to financial expansion and crisis , Marx wrote in volume 3 of Capital that the whole “ sphere of production may be saturated with capital , ” with the result that profits increasingly enter into the sphere of speculation .
“ If…new accumulation , ” he wrote ,
meets with difficulties in its employment , through a lack of spheres for investment , i.e. , due to a surplus in the branches of production and an over - supply of loan capital , this plethora of loanable money - capital merely shows the limitations of capitalist production .
The subsequent credit swindle proves that no real obstacle stands in the way of the employment of this surplus - capital .
However , an obstacle is indeed immanent in its laws of expansion , i.e. , in the limits in which capital can realise itself as capital .
The “ credit swindle , ” arising with the turn to money capital ( represented by Marx as M to M’ ) as the basis of the amassing of wealth , inevitably precedes a bust .
“ Business always appears excessively sound right on the eve of a crash . ”
For Marx nothing was more natural than a liquidity crisis in an economic slowdown , where capital hungered insatiably for cash .
Mimicking the 42nd Psalm , he wrote that the capitalist desires and hordes money in every form :
“ As the hart pants after fresh water , so pants his soul after money , the only wealth . ”
Yet , if Marx constitutes the starting point for a general theory of capitalism and crises , his analysis does n’t encompass many of the specific problems of today , given the historical evolution of the system since his time .
For Marxists , beginning with Hilferding , Lenin , and Luxemburg , the historical evolution of the system in the early twentieth century was understood primarily in terms of the development of a new stage of capitalism , often referred to as monopoly capitalism .
This reflected the fact that the most significant change in the structure of capitalism in the twentieth century arose out of what Marx called the concentration and centralization of production , resulting in the rise of the giant firm and the modern credit system .
The most ambitious and sustained attempt to develop an analysis of how capital accumulation was altered in the economy of the giant firm was developed by Michael Kalecki , Josef Steindl , Paul Baran , Paul Sweezy , and Harry Magdoff .
Kalecki was a Polish Marxist economist who also played a major role in the Keynesian Revolution , having introduced most of the fundamental innovations associated with Keynes ’s general theory before Keynes himself .
Steindl was an Austrian economist who worked with Kalecki at the Oxford Institute of Statistics during the Second World War .
Their work was extended into an analysis of the role of the state and popularized in Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy ’s Monopoly Capital : An Essay on the American Economic Order ( 1966 ) .
This theoretical perspective was later applied to the world economy and the creeping stagnation of the 1970s , ’80s and ’90s , in a series of works by Sweezy and Magdoff .
These thinkers argued that the capitalist economy did not naturally tend toward rapid growth .
Rather specific historical “ developmental factors ” were necessary for strong growth to appear for any length of time .
This was particularly the case for a system dominated by monopoly capital , in which monopolistic price formation and profits were associated with certain restraints on accumulation .
The main problem of accumulation for monopolistic corporations was to find sufficient investment outlets for the enormous and rising surplus at their disposal .
Short of new historical factors that increased investment outlets , absorbing surplus capital , the accumulation system tended to sputter out .
Hence , “ the normal state of the monopoly capitalist economy , ” Baran and Sweezy argued , was “ stagnation . ”
In the decades immediately after the Second World War the United States and the other advanced capitalist economies experienced a period of prosperity , subsequently described as the “ Golden Age . ”
This was based on the stimulus from special historical factors such as ( 1 ) a high level of consumer liquidity immediately after the war ; ( 2 ) the rebuilding of the war - devastated European and Japanese economies ; ( 3 ) a second great wave of automobilization ( which included the impetus to the rubber , steel , and glass industries , the building of the interstate highway system , and the suburbanization of the country ) ; ( 4 ) the growth of the sales effort in the form of the expansion of advertising and other forms of sales - related waste ; and ( 5 ) high military spending associated with two regional wars in Asia .
But by the 1970s these countervailing factors to the tendency to stagnation were mostly on the wane .
The result was a rapid slowing down of the economy .
Net investment in the United States declined , with the investment that was taking place being fed largely out of corporate depreciation funds .
In this situation , a new outlet for the surplus ( profits ) of corporations was needed .
This arose in the 1970s , and even more in the 1980s and ’90s primarily through the development of the financial system , on a scale and with a duration that had no historical precedent .
Capital , lacking investment outlets , increasingly flowed into financial speculation , while the financial services industry , so - called , was able to come up with more and more new instruments to absorb this capital .
Hyman Minsky , a socialist - oriented economist inspired by Keynes , and influenced by Kalecki and Hansen , observing the new developments , formulated his now famous thesis that financial instability is an “ inescapable part ” of developed capitalism .
Minsky ’s analysis was based on Keynes ’s notion that there was a flaw in the accumulation process of capitalism associated with speculative bubbles in asset price increases on top of a sluggish “ real economy . ”
For Keynes and Minsky , however , this was understood as a phenomenon that largely occurred at the peak of a boom .
In contrast , Magdoff and Sweezy argued , as early as 1970 , that there was a “ long - run decline in liquidity ” arising from the putative “ ‘ success ’ in controlling the business cycle . ”
The result was that the U.S. economy was faced with the growing problem of a major “ debt - squeeze out , ” requiring that real and paper values be brought back into accord , sometime in the future .
The longer that debt ballooned without a major contraction the bigger the problem would become .
Incredibly , this process of financial expansion continued over the decades , with only relatively minor credit adjustments or “ credit crunches , ” until the Great Financial Crisis of 2007–09 .
Magdoff and Sweezy labeled this long - term contradiction ( in the title of one of their books ) Stagnation and the Financial Explosion , arguing that there was a kind of “ symbiotic embrace ” between the two .
Eventually , this long - run process of financial explosion was to be characterized as the “ financialization ” of the capitalist economy , and monopoly capital was seen as having transformed into “ monopoly - finance capital . ”
The economy became increasingly dependent on the inflation of one financial bubble after another .
Total debt in relation to GDP in the U.S. economy rose from 151 percent in 1959 to 373 percent in 2007 , with the quality of debt decreasing as its quantity expanded .
But the real economy showed an increasing addictive toleration — the need for more to get even a decreasing effect — to the expansion of debt .
In the 1970s the increase in U.S. GDP was about sixty cents for ever dollar of new debt , by the early 2000s this had decreased to around twenty cents for every dollar of new debt .
A critical element in the development of the United States as the center of what became a worldwide financialization of capitalism was the role of the dollar as the hegemonic world currency , allowing the U.S. economy essentially to print dollars as needed and to borrow on an unprecedented scale from the rest of the world .
This turned the U.S. economy into both the consumer of last resort and the center of debt buildup for the world economy as a whole .
The vast and growing U.S. current account deficit has meant that the United States has had to impose ( or “ attract ” ) hundreds of billions of dollars a year in investments in paper — and increasingly fictitious — dollar assets on its trading partners .
The process is coming to an end with the previously unimaginable extent of the new debt that must issue from the U.S. government in the coming year , as all previous bubbles are folded into a “ Treasury bubble . ”
Jim Reid , a perceptive analyst at Deutsche Bank , wrote in mid-December 2008 that “ if 2009 goes horribly wrong it ’s probably because there ’s a run on a major currency or a Government bond market ” and suggests that “ the UK remains the lowest hanging developed market fruit . ”
Given the weakened role of the pound such a prospect can still be imagined as a normal economic event .
Yet , although the U.S. dollar is subject to identical strains on an even greater scale , its role as the global settlement and reserve currency means that a run on it cannot be imagined as a normal economic event , but only as a sea change in the global political economy .
In 1997 , Paul Sweezy declared that globalization was a very long - term trend of capitalism , traceable to its very origins in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries .
This globalizing trend had major effects in some periods such as the rise of China as a major force in the world economy .
Nevertheless , the dominant phenomena governing world accumulation at the end of the twentieth century , he argued , were the trio of “ ( 1 ) the slowing down of the overall rate of growth , ( 2 ) the worldwide proliferation of monopolistic ( or oligopolistic ) multinational corporations , and ( 3 ) what may be called the financialization of the capital accumulation process . ”
It was clearly financialization that was the most startling and unstable development .
If the financialization process were to go into reverse or even to slow , Sweezy suggested , the result would be a deep stagnation .
There was no telling when this would happen .
Financialization , Magdoff and Sweezy argued , could continue for some time .
Still , at some point the rising mountain of debt would grow beyond the capacity of capitalist governments to intervene effectively as the lender of last resort , and a financial avalanche would result in an unprecedented crisis .
Such a major , historic crisis of capitalism , arising out of conditions that were equally unprecedented , would pose not merely the “ return of depression economics ” as this was understood , in a very limited fashion , by orthodox economists , but would mean the collapse of an entire financialized regime of accumulation with lasting real world repercussions .
The most likely long - term result was a deep slowdown in the trend - rate of growth .
With the Great Financial Crisis of 2007–09 and the advent of the most serious economic downturn since the Great Depression these expectations based on an understanding of the historical development of the system have come true .
In terms of the conditions that are to be experienced by working populations around the globe as a result of this unprecedented downturn ( comparable only to the 1930s ) the worst is clearly still to come .
Already , emerging economies , where the crisis may turn out to be most wrenching , are finding their export markets drying up .
For China , with exports in 2001 – 06 amounting to over 30 percent of GDP , and net exports close to 4 percent of GDP , the shrinking of markets in the United States , Europe , and Japan constitutes a serious threat .
China currently is experiencing the sharpest deceleration in economic growth in thirty years .
Chinese exports have dropped , auto sales have plummeted , and jobs are shrinking in the cities .
House prices are now falling in major urban areas and there is a drastic decline in real estate investment , which spells a much bigger financial crisis .
Millions of China ’s “ floating population ” of migrant workers who fueled industrialization are unemployed and are returning to rural areas .
The sharp drop in economic growth and looming signs of deflation in China , it is feared , will pull world economic growth down to close to zero .
To the not inconsiderable extent that the U.S. generated global financial explosion has contributed to the growth in the Chinese real economy the U.S. generated global financial implosion shall contribute to its contraction .
Economic crises are endemic to capitalism , but the level of economic disaster affecting the system , as shown by conditions in the United States , on the one hand , and China , on the other , is now without precedent in the post - Second World War period , and the end is not yet in sight .
The Growing Threat of Planetary Ecological Collapse
In addressing capitalism as a failed system I have focused first on the deepening economic crisis .
But this is not the worst of the world ’s problems .
The greatest peril is the growing threat of planetary ecological collapse .
Here the danger is much greater than in the case of the world economy but the sense of alarm and the call for immediate and massive action is less widespread .
As the Swedish Tällberg Foundation stated in its 2008 report , Grasping the Climate Crisis : A Provocation ,
The world [ at present ] faces a breakdown of the global financial system .
The consequences are staggering , with ripple effects the world over that deliver the severest blows to the poor .
Fear is rising .
One would have expected somewhat of the same level of anxiety with regard to the looming breakdown of major parts of the Earth system — rapid deforestation , overfishing , freshwater scarcity and the disappearing Arctic sea ice .
Reports of such events and processes are abundant , but the level of concern is still conspicuously low .
The most serious ecological threat is of course global warming , which is inducing widespread , multi- faceted climate change , with disastrous implications for life on earth .
But in a wider sense , the global environmental crisis involves manifold problems and cannot be reduced to global warming alone .
These multiple hazards have a common source in the world economy , including : the extinction of species , loss of tropical forests ( as well as forest ecosystems generally ) , contamination of and destruction of ocean ecology , loss of coral reefs , overfishing , disappearing supplies of fresh water resources , the despoliation of lakes and rivers , desertification , toxic wastes , pollution , acid rain , the approaching exhaustion of easily available crude oil resources , urban congestion , the detrimental effects of large dams , world hunger , overpopulation , etc .
Together these threats constitute the greatest challenge to the survival of humanity since its prehistory .
The global warming threat is rapidly closing in .
The melting of sea ice in the Arctic , which some scientists believe could be ice free in the summer in less than a decade , is seen as threatening an “ albedo flip , ” a drastic reduction in the reflectivity of solar radiation and an acceleration of climate change .
Meanwhile , the melting of the ice sheets in West Antarctica and Greenland points to an irreversible “ tipping point ” within a decade that portends rising world sea levels that will eventually engulf major population centers in low - lying areas .
The combination of momentous environmental tipping points and positive feedback mechanisms accelerating climate change have convinced a growing number of climatologists that irrevocable and catastrophic climate change is inevitable unless actions are taken in the next decade or so drastically to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
The atmosphere is near the ceiling of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases that will produce the 2 °C increase in average global temperatures that the United Nations ’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has sought to avoid .
Moreover , the world is on a course under business as usual that could well lead to average global temperature increases two or even three times as high during this century , spelling an inferno for life on the planet .
Indeed , new scientific data suggests that a 2 °C increase would itself be disastrous , in terms of rising sea levels and the setting off of various self - reinforcing feedback mechanisms that could accelerate climate change throughout the earth system .
This means that allowing for a stabilization of greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere at 550 parts per million ( ppm ) , as envisioned in the Stern Review — characterized by most mainstream economists as a “ radical ” response to controlling carbon emissions — or even a buildup of carbon to 450 ppm ( seen as consistent with a 2 °C ceiling in average global temperature rise ) are now viewed by many leading scientists as running the risk of catastrophic change .
James Hansen , director of NASA ’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies , and other climatologists , now claim that the goal must be to reduce the atmospheric carbon level below the present 387 ppm , to 350 ppm or less .
This means that net CO 2 emissions must “ approach zero . ”
It also necessitates major changes in energy and land use , requiring massive social reorganization .
According to Hansen and his colleagues , “ if the present overshoot of this [ 350 ppm ] target CO 2 is not brief , there is the possibility of seeding irreversible catastrophic effects . ”
Indeed , “ continued growth of greenhouse gas emissions , for just another decade , practically eliminates the possibility of near - term return of atmospheric composition beneath the tipping level for catastrophic effects . ”
The world is now facing the prospect of irrevocably leaving the mild , protective climate of the Holocene , which has defined the environmental conditions for the entire duration of human civilization .
These new dire warnings by leading climatologists are based on a perception of the weaknesses of most earlier computer climate models , which do not account fully for “ slow ” climate feedback processes , such as “ ice sheet disintegration , vegetation migration , and GHG [ greenhouse gas ] release from soils , tundra or ocean sediments . ”
Hence , it is now recognized that climate change can accelerate out of control at lower levels of greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere than previously supposed .
In arriving at such conclusions Hansen and his colleagues themselves “ do not rely on climate models , but rather …on empirical evidence from past and ongoing climate change , ” utilizing paleoclimatic data .
If scientists are telling us that ecological time is running out if we wish to avoid catastrophic global effects , mainstream economists addressing the climate issue claim that we still have plenty of room in which to maneuver .
William Nordhaus , the leading orthodox economic analyst of global warming in the United States , argues for a “ climate - policy ramp , ” in which modest reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the near - term would be followed by more ambitious reductions in the long term .
Yet , Nordhaus envisions that under “ optimal ” conditions atmospheric CO 2 concentration will increase to about 480 ppm in 2050 , 586 ppm in 2100 , peaking at 700 ppm in 2175 .
Indeed , Nordhaus and other orthodox economists claim that the risks to the world of an average temperature of 5 °C or more warmer than preindustrial times , which such atmospheric CO 2 concentrations would induce , can be offset by investments in other welfare - enhancing areas of the economy .
But in reality , as opposed to bourgeois economics , this flies in the face of all scientific - ecological assessments , threatening absolute catastrophe to human civilization and the planet as we know it .
Indeed , there is only one way of accounting for the fact that orthodox economists constitute the leading ideological opponents of aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , even at the risk of a planetary inferno — and that is their primary role as ideological defenders of the capitalist system and promoters of its drive for profits and accumulation at any cost .
Nothing so clearly demonstrates what John Kenneth Galbraith characterized ( in the title to his last book ) as The Economics of Innocent Fraud .
“ Capitalism , as we know it today , ” James Gustave Speth , former head of the United Nations Development Programme , has written , “ is incapable of sustaining the environment . ”
To turn to mainstream economics for answers is therefore a serious , perhaps fatal , error of current policy .
The fundamental ecological flaws of the capitalist system have been emphasized primarily by critical political - economic thinkers coming out of or deeply influenced by the Marxist tradition .
In the United States environmental sociology has been deeply affected by two critical concepts arising out of Marx , the “ treadmill of production , ” and the “ metabolic rift . ”
The treadmill of production concept is the notion that capitalism is geared above all to exponential growth , as suggested by Marx ’s M - C - M ’ shorthand .
The level of economic activity in each period starts with the end point of the previous period , leading to a doubling of economic output in , say , a quarter - century at a 3 percent annual rate of growth — a process which is interrupted , but not brought to an end , by business cycle downturns .
The driving force of this expansion is capital accumulation and the search for ever expanding profits .
The country that has experienced the fastest rate of growth over a sustained period of time is of course China where the economy , according to the rather fantastic ( and somewhat suspect ) claim by Bloomberg.com , “ has increased by 69 - fold ” since 1978 .
But exponential growth , if at lower levels than in China , is characteristic of capitalism in general , even where the economy , is experiencing only slow growth or stagnation , as has typified the advanced capitalist economies in recent decades .
Under capitalism , Marx argued ,
We see how … the mode of production and the means of production are continually transformed , revolutionised , how the division of labour is necessarily followed by greater division of labor , the application of machinery by still greater application of machinery , work on a large scale by work on a still larger scale .
That is the law which again and again throws bourgeois production out of its old course and which compels capital to intensify the productive forces of labour , because it has intensified them , it , the law which gives capital no rest and continually whispers in its ear : “ Go on !
Go on ! ”
For Marx workers too were chained to the treadmill of production since their conditions were made tolerable for short periods only by rapid economic growth — even though this reduced their relative condition within the system , and hence made them ever more dependent on their capitalist overlords .
From an ecological perspective , of course , this system of growth at any cost , synonymous with capitalism , places the world economy in direct conflict with environmental sustainability .
China ’s rapid growth in recent decades has also led to record rates of environmental degradation on its part .
China is now close to the United States in annual carbon dioxide emissions , though far below the latter in emissions per capita .
Yet , despite the seriousness of this contradiction between the capitalist economy and the planet , establishment economists generally argue against any major attempt to avert climate change , i.e. , to bailout nature .
At the same time they do not hesitate to advocate spending trillions of dollars to bailout banks .
President - elect Obama ’s chief economic advisor , Larry Summers , is notorious for his anti-environmental diatribes .
He has said , on more than one occasion , that it makes as much economic sense in terms of future welfare to spend on various non-environmental factors — for example , to rebuild infrastructure ( roads , bridges , etc. ) —as to seek to preserve the environment , say , tropical forests .
In addressing the global warming problem , Summers naively stated in 1992 , that under “ the most pessimistic estimates yet prepared … global warming reduces growth over the next two centuries by less than 0.1 percent a year . ”
Yet , under the most pessimistic estimates of climatologists at that time — now proving accurate — global warming under business as usual threatened both life on the planet and human civilization itself .
Indeed , nothing is more deranged than the notion of Summers and other orthodox economists that the planet as we know it can be destroyed , while the capitalist economy can continue as before .
Ironically , the current slowdown of the capitalist economy may help temporarily to check some of the increasing burden on the biosphere , by reducing the rate of growth of the overall consumption of energy and materials .
However , the usual response to economic crisis within capitalism is to remove protections previously applied to workers and the environment .
Hence , the economic decline is likely to result in more intensive forms of ecological exploitation .
The growing scale of the capitalist economy and the weight that it is imposing on a limited biosphere are not everything .
More important , ultimately , is the actual integrity of ecosystems and the basic biogeochemical processes of the earth system .
Here Marx ’s theory of the metabolic rift helps us understand capitalism ’s intensive , not merely extensive , destruction of the environment .
Marx ’s vision had included an ecological element from the beginning .
In his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 he wrote of the environmental damage wrought by industrial capitalism , in the form of the “ universal pollution to be found in large towns . ”
For Marx , “ Man lives from nature , i.e. nature is his body , and he must maintain a continuing dialogue with it if he is not to die . ”
But Marx ’s ecological critique of capitalism crystallized only with the publication of Capital , volume 1 in 1867 .
He was influenced by the critique of British industrial agriculture developed by Justus von Liebig , the leading German chemist of the day .
Building on Liebig , Marx pointed to the fact that by shipping food and fiber hundreds and even thousands of miles to new urban centers ( a reflection of the growing division between town and country ) industrialized capitalist agriculture was in fact depleting the soil of basic nutrients ( such as nitrogen , potassium , and phosphorus ) , which were no longer recirculated to the earth .
This created a major crisis of the soil in Europe and the United States in the nineteenth century .
Marx described this as an “ irreparable rift in the interdependent process of social metabolism , a metabolism prescribed by the natural laws of life itself . ”
He argued that society demanded the “ restoration ” of a sustainable human metabolism with nature , which however could only be accomplished under a society of associated producers .
In the most radical conception of sustainability ever developed , Marx wrote :
From the standpoint of a higher socio-economic formation , the private property of individuals in the earth will appear just as absurd as the private property of one man in other men .
Even an entire society , a nation , or all simultaneously existing societies taken together , are not owners of the earth .
They are simply its possessors , its beneficiaries , and have to bequeath it in an improved state to succeeding generations , as boni patres familias [ good heads of the household ] .
During the present decade there has been a great deal of research applying Marx ’s overall concept of the metabolic rift to explain different disjunctures in the global ecology related to capitalism ’s exploitation of soils , forests , oceans , and the carbon cycle .
This has led to the conclusion , in the words of environmental sociologists Brett Clark and Richard York , that “ Capitalism is incapable of regulating its social metabolism with nature in an environmentally sustainable manner .
Its very operations violate the laws of restitution and metabolic restoration .
The constant drive to renew the capital accumulation process intensifies its destructive social metabolism , imposing the needs of capital on nature , regardless of the consequences to natural systems . ”
Confronted with ecological crises , no attempt is made by the system to go to the root of the problem in the social relations that are undermining what Marx called “ the vital conditions of existence . ”
Rather the problem is shifted around , with capitalism continuing “ to play out the same failed strategy again and again . ”
The result is a compounding of ecological disaster .
The solution that capitalism provided to the nineteenth century soil crisis that Liebig and Marx addressed was not to restore the human metabolism with the soil , but rather to develop synthetic , particularly nitrogen - based , fertilizers , which marked the beginning of modern agribusiness , and which ( because of the high petroleum use ) is a major source of global warming , as well as contributing to ocean dead zones .
Capitalism ’s solution to world agricultural production in the form of modern agribusiness has resulted in a further polarization of wealth and hunger .
Of the more than six billion people in the world today , the United Nation indicates that around one billion are hungry , and their numbers ( both relative and absolute ) are growing .
In the United States itself over 36 million people , about 12 percent of the population , were “ food insecure ” in 2007 .
Capitalism ’s ultimate solution to ecological problems — since fundamental changes in the system itself are off limits — is technological .
But any technological gains in efficiency in the use of natural resources are overwhelmed by the extensive and ecologically disruptive pattern of growth that characterizes this rapacious system .
Hence , capitalism is a failed system where ecological sustainability is concerned .
Global Imperial Instability
All of the foregoing has to be seen in terms of capitalism as a world system .
Capitalism came into being in the fifteenth and sixteenth century , spreading out from a little corner of Europe , and was from its inception a globalizing economy .
But its globalization took the form of a division , from the start , between center and periphery , and thus was imperial in nature .
The system was geared from the first to the needs of accumulation in the center , or the top of the world - hierarchy .
As time has gone by more and more external areas have been incorporated into the world - capitalist economy so that globalization , in the sense of the global ascendancy of capital , is now more or less complete .
The most dramatic case in recent decades has been China ’s rapid integration into the world economy ( and the breakdown of the Soviet bloc and subsequent integration of most of these states as dependent satellites of Western capitalism ) .
Yet , globalization taken in itself is not a very useful way of understanding the accumulation dynamic of the system at this specific stage of its development , which is better characterized , as Sweezy argued , in terms of the three elements of slow growth ( in the center and in the world economy as a whole ) , monopolization via multinational corporations , and financialization .
Continuing globalization , coupled with financialization , has created the illusion , propagated by some ideologues of the system , that “ the world is flat . ”
Yet , capitalism remains a world economic system divided into separate nation states with differing power resources — a contradiction that is impossible to transcend within the system .
Meanwhile , the growth of multinational corporations based in the center countries has served historically to channel global surpluses away from the peripheries toward the centers .
The concentration of power ( economic , military , financial , communications ) at the center is intrinsic to capitalism as a world system , although the specific nations that constitute the center and periphery ( and semi- periphery ) may change .
The world economy is therefore disproportionately focused on the needs of accumulation at the core .
The capitalist world system is most stable when governed by a single hegemonic power , such as Britain for most of the nineteenth century , and the United States for most of the twentieth .
In periods of hegemonic instability and world economic crisis the system approaches conditions of total crisis , as witnessed by the First and Second World Wars .
The worldwide economic and planetary ecological disasters , already discussed , are occurring at a time when there is a tectonic geopolitical shift occurring within capitalism .
The United States is continuing to decline in relative power , while no single power or group of powers can directly challenge it at present , particularly with the downfall of the Soviet Union .
Under these circumstances , the U.S. state has sought to gain control of those strategic resources and geopolitical positioning that will generate a “ new American century ” in what is clearly an era of “ naked imperialism . ”
This has resulted in a new official doctrine of preemptive war , and the launching of such wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
At the same time , Washington has been the leading force in promoting neoliberal policies , imposing a Hayekian capitalism on the world — not in order to create a flatter world , but in order to consolidate the power of those states already at the top .
Such global ambitions of a single state , however , inevitably transmute from a source of hegemonic stability into a source of hegemonic instability for the world system .
Despite its globalizing tendencies capitalism is unable to integrate politically to form a truly global governance .
Instead the attempts of Washington to restore and expand its global hegemony , using its military power to enhance its economic position , are creating what is potentially the deadliest period in the history of imperialism .
The United States has recently expanded its bases around the world to as many as seventy countries and territories , while U.S. troops are operating on an even wider field .
U.S. military spending in 2007 , according to acknowledged figures , is $ 552 billion , approximately equal to the estimated military spending of all the other nations in the world put together , while actual U.S. military spending in 2007 was $ 1 trillion .
Amiya Kumar Bagchi , one of India ’s most distinguished economists , has called this a “ third axial age , ” in which “ the United States has emerged as the superimperialist ,
and its government has claimed that no international law or organization can deter it from any material action it considers to be in the national interest ( meaning , of course , the interest of big U.S. capital ) .
At the same time that big capital , backed by the military might of the superimperialist , pursues its murderous course , the bargaining power of workers all over the world is pushed down to low levels through a combination of measures — totally deregulating finance , enfeebling the state , and depriving workers of all rights vis -à - vis capital through legislation .
There is no doubt that the national security apparatus in the United States , in this period , sees China , as the great Marxist philosopher István Mészáros has said , as its “ ultimate target . ”
This has been most evident in the last few years in : ( 1 ) report after report by the U.S. national security establishment warning of China ’s growing influence in Africa and access to African petroleum reserves , control of which are seen as vital to U.S. “ national security ” ( 2 ) continual fears within the U.S. intelligence community of a Chinese - Iranian or Chinese - Russian - Iranian alliance ; ( 3 ) U.S. efforts to form a military pact with India ; ( 4 ) concerns raised about Chinese advances in space ; and ( 5 ) conflict regarding Tibet , Taiwan , North Korea , and the China Sea .
Although the United States is economically bound to China at present through the production of multinational corporations and intensive trade and currency exchanges — so much so that the two economies appear to be in a kind of symbiotic embrace — increased geopolitical rivalry associated with declining U.S. hegemony and the rise of China as a world power create the possibility of a more explosive relationship arising .
At present there are very palpable fears in Washington ’s higher circles regarding the continuing — and from their perspective necessary and non-negotiable — role of the dollar as trade settlement and reserve currency , even in the face of current Chinese support for the dollar system .
Washington understands that China ’s blind support for the dollar is problematic , especially in the event of a rapid devaluation of all existing dollar obligations resulting from Federal Reserve policy .
China holds $ 652 billion in U.S. Treasury debt ( an increase from $ 459 billion at the end of 2007 ) .
Altogether it owns 10 percent of the U.S. public debt .
A rapid devaluation of the dollar would only be seen in China as an expropriation .
An ensuing movement of China away from the dollar , however limited — and none but limited moves are immediately possible — could drastically destabilize the entire U.S. dominated world economic order .
At the same time as Washington is concerned about the increased potential threat to its hegemony posed by the rise of China , it is also striving to contain or weaken other states as well , such as Russia , Iran , and Venezuela .
There is no doubt that the economic and ecological crises , to the extent that they worsen , will tend to destabilize the system , intensifying these and other imperial tensions .
Classic geopolitical theory suggests that only by containing the rimlands of Eurasia can a single power control the globe .
U.S. strategy at present centers on the Middle East , as the strategic petroleum underbelly of Eurasia .
But its primary goal is to defend and even expand its own weakening global ascendancy vis-á - vis potential economic and military rivals .
With the spread of weapons of mass destruction — which U.S. attempts at consolidating global military and economic dominance actually encourage — it is not difficult to imagine a situation in which matters will get out of control .
The terror of a global holocaust emerging from such economic , ecological , and geopolitical instability — threatened in the first instance by the refusal of the United States and its Israeli ally to accept the failure of their policies in the Middle East and the related mismanagement of world energy resources — is a danger that can not be ignored .
This grim reality marks the failed peace —
Pox Americana rather than Pax Americana — of a failed system .
Beyond a Failed System
As the foregoing indicates , the world is currently facing the threat of a new world deflation - depression , worse than anything seen since the 1930s .
The ecological problem has reached a level that the entire planet as we know it is now threatened .
Neoliberal capitalism appears to be at an end , along with what some have called “ neoliberalism ‘ with Chinese characteristics . ’ ”
Declining U.S. hegemony , coupled with current U.S. attempts militarily to restore its global hegemony through the so - called War on Terror , threaten wider wars and nuclear holocausts .
The one common denominator accounting for all of these crises is the current phase of global monopoly - finance capital .
The fault lines are most obvious in terms of the peril to the planet .
As Evo Morales , president of Bolivia , has recently stated : “ Under capitalism we are not human beings but consumers .
Under capitalism mother earth does not exist , instead there are raw materials . ”
In reality , “ the earth is much more important than [ the ] stock exchanges of Wall Street and the world .
[ Yet , ] while the United States and the European Union allocate 4,100 billion dollars to save the bankers from a financial crisis that they themselves have caused , programs on climate change get 313 times less , that is to say , only 13 billion dollars . ”
The world economic crisis is now so severe that a figure like Martin Wolf , chief economic commentator for the Financial Times and longtime “ Atlanticist ” and apologist for U.S. policies , warns that the entire system of world trade could break down as in the 1930s .
It comes as no surprise that Wolf lays the blame on “ mercantilist countries ” with large external surpluses and insufficient internal demand , such as China , Germany , and Japan .
He singles out China as the main culprit .
The so - called “ mercantilist ” countries are accused of carrying out beggar - thy - neighbor policies at the expense of the deficit countries ( that is , above all , the United States ) and the entire world .
We have now reached the point where it is possible to ask what the consequences would be of the collapse of the dollar as unilateral global trade settlement and reserve currency , and this has thrown Wolf and the other Atlanticists into something approaching hysteria .
It is just these same “ mercantilist ” states that are the plausible core of a new global multilateral currency , a prospect of unspeakable fear and horror to the Atlanticists , raising geopolitical tensions that obstruct any such project .
It is clear that neoliberal globalization has come to an end , and that capitalism is in a long - term crisis .
We are now faced with “ depression economics , ” not as a special case , but as a general one .
As world - system theorist , Immanuel Wallerstein , has suggested for some time , what was called “ globalization ” in the last couple of decades was really at the global level an “ age of transition ” away from the current capitalist world - system towards something else .
What exactly this something else is we do not know , and cannot know at this point : because it depends on the responses not just of states and corporations , but more importantly the response of the world ’s populations .
On top of the intense class alienation , exploitation , and inequality endemic to capitalism at every level , we are now faced with widening global fractures .
So far , on a continental level , leadership in recognizing that the only answer is the revolutionary one — a new socialism for the twenty - first century — has been taken by the peoples of Latin America , in Cuba , Venezuela , Bolivia , Ecuador , and is also manifest in struggles taking place in Brazil , Mexico , Nicaragua , and elsewhere .
Latin America , which was the first continent to feel the full brunt of neoliberal globalization , the hardest hit region outside of the Middle East in terms military interventions in the last quarter - century , and the region that was the initial basis of U.S. international hegemony , is now showing the way to the world — not only in relation to the struggle for substantive equality , which is essential , but also in relation to saving the planet from capitalism .
As Morales has stated , “ Humankind is capable of saving the earth if we recover the principles of solidarity , complementarity , and harmony with nature , in contraposition to the reign of competition , profits , and rampant consumption of natural resources ” that distinguishes the failed system of capitalism .
Notes
HARRISONBURG , Va. , April 7 ( UPI ) --
Given a choice , men prefer " hooking up " to dating , while women prefer dating with the prospect of a relationship to causal sex , U.S. researchers said .
Carolyn Bradshaw of James Madison University in Harrisonburg , Va. , and colleagues exposed 150 female and 71 male college students to a variety of situations involving dating -- when the man asks a women on a date and the woman accepts or rejects any sexual overtures and there is the prospect of a relationship -- and / or hooking up -- a casual sexual encounter between strangers or brief acquaintances .

The study , published in the journal Sex Roles , found women seemed to want a relationship more than men , but women fear , whether dating or in hooking up , they will become emotionally attached to a partner not interested in them .
The study also found men seemed to value independence and they feared that even in hooking up , a woman might want to have a relationship .
In addition the study found , 41 percent of the women strongly preferred traditional dating to hooking up , 20 percent of the men strongly preferred dating , while 2 percent of the women strongly preferred hooking up and 17 percent of the men strongly preferred hooking up .

THE announcement on Monday March 8th that Northrop Grumman and its European partner EADS were pulling out of a bid for a $ 35 billion contract to build air - refuelling tankers for the United States Air Force was no surprise .
Northrop had said that it would not contest the terms of the latest contract proposal , even though it thought they had been drawn up to favour the rival Boeing bid .
The British and German governments , along with the European Commission , expressed concern at what they see as the Pentagon rejecting open competition in order to bolster Boeing .
Lord Mandelson , the British business secretary , said it was “ very disappointing ” that the Ameircan - European bidders felt the procurement process was so biased against them that it was not even worth making a bid .
The outcome is a blow to EADS , which on Tuesday announced a loss for 2009 caused by the need to post a € 1.8 billion ( $ 2.5 billion ) charge because of cost over - runs on another military project , the A400 M military troop carrier , and further charges caused by delays to its A380 super - jumbo passenger aircraft .
The tanker development is but the latest twist in a plot that goes back nearly ten years .
In 2002 the defence department wanted to lease tanker aircraft based on Boeing 's ageing 767 passenger jet , but Senator John McCain led a noisy campaign against what he called corporate welfare for Boeing .
The 767 was seen as coming to the end of its commercial life and the leasing deal would have helped to keep a production line open .
The Congressional Budget Office agreed with the senator that America 's air force could do better .
After a scandal involving conflicts of interest and the hiring of a Pentagon procurement official by Boeing , the original lease deal was dropped by congress in 2004 .
Two Boeing executives were jailed and its chief executive , Phil Condit , resigned .
In 2006 the Pentagon restarted the process , and in February 2008 the Northrop - EADS bid was named the winner .
Its tanker , based on the Airbus A330 jet , offered greater range and load - carrying capability than the Boeing design .
Boeing immediately launched a campaign attacking the award ; the Government Accountability Office found fault with the Air Force 's procurement process and the contract was cancelled .
When the Pentagon asked for renewed bids last year it was obvious that the new terms favoured Boeing .
Whereas the original contract had to be judged on mission capability as well as price , the latest version laid more emphasis on the unit cost of each tanker plane , thus favouring the cheaper and more modest product offered by Boeing .
After scrutinising the details , Northrop and EADS came to the conclusion it was no longer worth their while going through the motions of submitting a formal bid .
So Boeing is left as the only bidder for a defence contract second only to the enormous Joint Strike Fighter contract won by Lockheed Martin in 2001 .
The repercussions of this affair are likely to poison European - American trade relations and expose the administration to accusations of corporate welfare for America 's aerospace national champion .
EADS was prepared to invest in an American factory to build the tankers and saw the contract as a foothold in the biggest defence market .
The importance of the tanker deal and the A400M was that together they would help make EADS a more balanced aerospace company , less reliant on the performance of its Airbus subsidiary in the very cyclical civil aviation market .
Now both these ventures are in trouble , while EADS 's rival , Boeing , is sitting more comfortably on a fat cushion of defence work .
So much for Senator McCain 's original complaints about corporate welfare for Boeing .
In 1955 Mr. Graves began his career as a television series regular as the star of “ Fury , ” a western family adventure series about a rancher named Jim Newton , his orphaned ward and the boy ’s black stallion .
It ran until 1960 on NBC , helped pioneer television adventure series and solidified Mr. Graves ’s TV credentials .
Some of his hundreds of television credits include “ Alfred Hitchcock Presents , ” “ Whiplash ” ( 1961 ) , “ The Dean Martin Show ” ( 1970 ) , the Herman Wouk mini-series “ The Winds of War ” ( 1983 ) and “ War and Remembrance ” ( 1988 ) , “ Fantasy Island ” ( 1978 - 83 ) and “ 7th Heaven ” ( 1999 -2005 ) .
He served as the host or narrator for numerous television specials and performed in television movies of the week like “ The President ’s Plane Is Missing ” ( 1973 ) , “ Where Have All the People Gone ” ( 1974 ) and “ Death Car on the Freeway ” ( 1979 ) .
Mr. Graves played his most famous television character from 1967 to 1973 in “ Mission : Impossible , ” reprising it from 1988 to 1990 .
He was Jim Phelps , the leader of the Impossible Missions Force , a super - secret government organization that conducted dangerous undercover assignments ( which he always chose to accept ) .
After the tape summarizing the objective self - destructed , the team would use not violence , but elaborate con games to trap the villains .
In his role , Mr. Graves was a model of cool , deadpan efficiency .

But he was appalled when his agent sent him the script for the role of a pedophile pilot in “ Airplane ! ” ( 1980 ) .
“ I tore my hair and ranted and raved and said , ‘ This is insane , ’ he recalled on “ Biography ” in 1997 .
Some of the role ’s lines ( “ Have you ever been in a Turkish prison ? ” ) looked at first as if they could get him thrown in jail , never mind ruining his career .
He told his agent to tell David and Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams , the director - producers , to find themselves a comedian .
He relented when the Zucker brothers explained that the secret of their spoof would be the deadpan behavior of the cast ; they did n’t want a comedian , they wanted the Peter Graves of “ Fury ” and “ Mission : Impossible . ”
Mr. Graves used his familiar earnest , all - American demeanor in service of some of the comic movie ’s most outrageous moments .
He reprised the role of Captain Oveur in “ Airplane II ” in 1982 .

Freddy's in Brooklyn is a happening place that has been named one of the city 's best bars by the Village Voice , Esquire , and The New York Times .
Unfortunately , Freddy 's — and the surrounding neighborhood — is smack - dab in the footprint of the Atlantic Yards project , a multi-million - dollar , 22 - acre development that is intended to create " an urban utopia " in the language of developer Bruce Ratner , and a new , publicly subsidized home to Ratner 's Nets , who currently play NBA basketball ( if you can call it that ) in New Jersey .
But do n't mistake Atlantic Yards as one more instance of the market - driven transformations for which New York is rightly famous .
It 's actually the latest case of eminent domain abuse , where private property is seized by the state on dubious grounds and then immediately handed over to private interests for private gain .
In this case , the Empire State Development Corporation has designated the thriving area as blighted to facilitate the taking of privately owned houses and businesses without having to pay full market value .
Ratner , whose partners in the venture include rapper Jay Z and the Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov , stands to pocket hundreds of millions of dollars on the deal , all thanks to the brute force of the state .
This week , a Brooklyn Supreme Court ruling tossed out the eminent domain objections of residents and property owners who had held out for six years and Ratner plans to break ground on the site on March 11 , if not before .
The workers and patrons of Freddy 's , however , are not going gentle into that good night .
They 've pledged to engage in civil disobedience and chain themselves to the bar when the bulldozers and wrecking balls come for their favorite haunt .
A state sentator has even declared that she 'll lay down in front of the demolition machinery .
The awful 2005 Supreme Court decision in Kelo , which held that governments can seize property to increase potential tax revenues , may have paved the way for Atlantic Yards , but Freddy 's is the next last stand in an ongoing battle against eminent domain abuse .

In the 1960s , Italian physicist Gabriele Veneziano developed a theory to explain the inner workings of the atom and failed — at first .
Now many scientists believe an improved version of his conjecture , known as string theory , may do more than merely explain the atom .
It could be the elusive theory of everything , a set of universal laws governing everything from the smallest quark within the atom to the largest cluster of galaxies , from the Big Bang to this moment .
String theory explains what you might see if you zoomed in without limit , past the cells that constitute your body , past the atoms that make up those cells , past even the electrons and gluons that those atoms are made of , all the way to the scale of a billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a centimeter .
At that level , according to the theory , lies the foundation of all the particles and forces in the universe : one - dimensional strands of energy , or “ strings , ” vibrating in nine dimensions .
That may seem wildly counterintuitive , but many scientists agree it is the most promising approach to explain the laws of physics .
Columbia University physicist Brian Greene has become the public face of string theory .
He has provided insight into the topology of those additional dimensions , and in 1999 he introduced the theory to nonscientists in a best - selling book ,
The Elegant Universe
.
In 2008 he cofounded the World Science Festival , an annual event that brings together scientists , artists , and ordinary people who are simply interested in the great questions of the universe .
Greene talked to DISCOVER about how string theory has evolved , the attempts to find supporting evidence through new experiments , and the challenges of making science exciting to the general public .
What is the major problem string theory attempts to solve ?
Our current theory of gravity — Einstein ’s general theory of relativity — and our current theory of the behavior of atoms and subatomic particles — quantum mechanics — both work fantastically well in their respective domains : general relativity for big things , quantum mechanics for small things .
But when you try to meld the two , there is an incompatibility , a hostility .
It ’s uncomfortable to have two laws of physics , each claiming that the other somehow does n’t work .
In reality , both sets of laws are meant to work everywhere .
How does string theory create a single worldview that applies everywhere — and what exactly is a string , anyway ?
The fundamental idea is that the elementary constituents of matter — electrons , quarks , and so forth — might not be dots of no size , which is the traditional image , but rather little filaments .
They could exist in either little loops of filament — tiny loops of energy — or little snippets of energy , open strings as we call them .
When people stared at the mathematics governing the motion of these little filaments , they found , remarkably , that the math did n’t work in a universe that has only three dimensions of space .
It required nine dimensions , and when you add in time it gives you 10 dimensions , which is an astoundingly bizarre idea .
Nevertheless , it ’s an idea that string theorists take seriously , because that ’s where the math leads , and math has proved itself to be a very sure - footed guide to how the universe works .
How can we envision these extra dimensions , and how would they manifest themselves in our seemingly three - dimensional world ?
The shape and size of the extra dimensions would affect the properties of particles .
So if you asked me , “ Why does the electron have its charge or its particular mass ? ” the answer in string theory would be because the extra dimensions have the shape that they do .
An electron weighs what it does because it has a certain internal energy , and that energy , according to Einstein , equals mc² .
The energy depends on how its little string can vibrate , and the string vibrates in a manner that depends on its environment , so it depends on the shape of the extra dimensions .
The dream in the 1990s was to find the shape of the extra dimensions and then calculate the values of all those properties that experimenters have found .
What is the current status of string theory research ?
We have a range of possibilities for the shape of the extra dimensions .
We have , in fact , catalogs of shapes .
Literally , I could write out a book and turn page by page and show you different shapes for the extra dimensions that people have mathematically determined as being possible .
The problem is we do n’t know which page is the right one , and the number of pages has grown fantastically in the last few years .
There are on the order of at least 10 ^500 different pages now [ a number that dwarfs the number of particles in the universe ] , and when you ’re faced with a book of that many pages , some people throw up their hands in disgust .
Others say that maybe all those shapes are out there in different universes .
That ’s the most recent and controversial approach that people have been following .
So there could be a multitude of other universes , each corresponding to a different solution or “ page ” of string theory ?
As scientists we track down all promising leads , and there ’s reason to suspect that our universe may be one of many — a single bubble in a huge bubble bath of other universes .
And you can then imagine that maybe these different bubbles all have different shapes for their extra dimensions .
This suggests a landscape of different universes with different forms of extra dimensions and therefore different properties within those universes .
If that is true , our universe would be one of many , and then the question becomes why are we in this one and not in some other one .
One of your findings is helping scientists make sense of those extra dimensions and other universes , right ?
We found that classical geometry , the kind you learn in elementary school , breaks down at extremely small scales .
Instead , quantum geometry takes over , in which , for example , there can be two very different shapes in the extra dimensions that nevertheless yield exactly the same physics .
In other words , there can be two different shapes from the perspective of a classical mathematician , but when dressed up with their quantum properties they become identical .
What got us really excited was that horrendously complicated calculations framed in the language relevant to one shape became simple when reframed using the other shape .
People like to talk about the Eskimos ’ having 20 terms for snow and ice .
It might take us a paragraph or a book to try to describe those distinctions , because our language is not set up to describe them .
Similarly , with these shapes we ’re basically rephrasing things from one language to another , and suddenly some very clunky and cumbersome descriptions become sleek , elegant , and completely solvable .
Critics of string theory have called it unscientific because it is not falsifiable .
How can we evaluate string theory ?
Falsifiability for a theory is great , but a theory can still be respectable even if it is not falsifiable , as long as it is verifiable .
There are aspects of a theory that you can go out and look for and confirm , and that ’s another way to gain confidence in it .
For instance , it ’s really hard to falsify the statement that there is life on another planet , but you can verify it by finding one example .
We ’re hoping that certain features of string theory are confirmable .
What kind of things are you looking for ?
At the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva , there are features of string theory that may result in data that have no other natural explanation .
For instance , string theory suggests that there should be a class of particles called supersymmetric particles [ that every particle should have a partner particle ] , and we ’ve never seen them before .
If we see them , it wo n’t prove string theory right , but it would be a strong piece of circumstantial evidence , because their most natural home is in string theory .
There ’s also a long - shot chance that scientists will find evidence for extra dimensions at the LHC .
String theory is not the only theory that can accommodate extra dimensions , but it certainly is the one that really demands and requires it .
How are physicists trying to find extra dimensions ?
When two protons collide , as they will be doing quite frequently in the LHC , some of the debris created from the collision might be ejected out of our familiar dimensions and crammed into the others .
We could notice that by detecting missing energy in our dimensions .
The energy would seemingly disappear , but in reality it would just go to a place that our detectors do n’t have direct access to .
If today you somehow found out that string theory is wrong , how would you feel about all your work of the past 25 years ?
If it was false by virtue of an actual error that we all overlooked for 25 years , I ’d feel pretty bad .
But that ’s so unlikely — nearly impossible , I ’d say .
The more likely thing is that we ’ll learn that the theory is perhaps incapable of describing physics as we know it .
The bottom line is progress , and if we can understand why it is that string theory failed , that will be progress .
It wo n’t be the progress that we had hoped for , but it will be progress nevertheless , and that ’s how science works .
How confident are you that string theory is correct ?
One time I was listening to a radio program and I was described as a believer in string theory .
I almost hit the roof because I do n’t “ believe ” in string theory .
I do n’t believe in anything until it ’s experimentally proven .
I do feel strongly that string theory is our best hope for making progress at unifying gravity and quantum mechanics .
Moreover , I ’ve been spectacularly impressed over the past 20 years with the progress that string theory has made .
But that ’s not proof , and therefore I do n’t believe it .
There are a lot of very interesting ideas that are worthy of attention , and sometimes worthy of decades of attention , because they have such capacity to make progress on deep , unsolved questions .
But that does n’t mean that you believe the ideas are right .
If you want to use the word belief , I simply believe that this is the best approach that we have .
You are the author of a best - selling book and the cofounder of a popular science festival .
How do you go about getting people interested in something as esoteric as string theory ?
I think many people had experiences in school where science was about learning details or completing rigorous calculations that may not have aligned with their personality .
What gets missed is that those details are ultimately used by science to address big questions that we all care about :
Where did the universe come from ?
Where did life come from ?
Will it all eventually come to an end ?
I think students often , by virtue of the way we teach , miss the big story and are led through the gritty details , leaving a bad taste in the mouth .
Tracy Day and I created the World Science Festival to go around existing structures and create a place where people , led by real scientists , could immerse themselves in science ’s great stories and big ideas .
Do n’t get me wrong , the details are important , but people will never want to know the details unless they can focus on the big ideas .

Here 's another disconnect between Republican rhetoric and reality .
Just ahead of Tax Day , a new New York Times / CBS
News poll finds that most Americans regard the income taxes that they will have to pay this year as fair , regardless of political partisanship , ideology or income level .
Sixty - two percent of all respondents in the poll said the income tax they have to pay is fair , while 30 percent called it unfair .
That includes six in 10 Republicans and independents and just over two - thirds of Democrats – a display of cross - party agreement rarely seen on any topic .
It also includes most liberals , moderates and conservatives .
Majorities across all income groups , moreover , called their income tax fair .
Sixty - two percent of Americans in households earning $ 50,000 or less said so , as did the same percentage of people in households earning more .
Rousseau , Hobbes , and Locke all meditated on the development of social contracts that they considered necessary for people to operate in large societies .
Game theory gives scientists a chance to test some of these ideas with hard data .
By having people play anonymous games with money , researchers found that people from larger societies , ones that are more integrated into the market , are more likely to be fair in anonymous dealings ; these same people are more willing to punish others when they are unfair .
These findings suggest that fairness and punishment in dealings with strangers are largely learned behaviors , and that we need these norms and institutions to prevent our communities from fragmenting .
Before ten thousand years ago , localized groups probably had fairly limited contact with more distant human populations .
Fast forward a few thousand years , and large , complex , and cooperative societies had become prevalent .
Scientists have long been uncertain what facilitated the social changes that allowed people to feel comfortable trading with others they hardly knew .
Why should I be nice to you ?
Some psychologists thought large societies are natural outgrowth of the sort of behavior people apply to kin and close friends .
Extending this comfort to new acquaintances , adding them to a roster of trusted business partners , could help establish large , loosely connected networks .
Another theory was that humans slowly established societal norms and agreements under which they could feel comfortable dealing with strangers — less natural to their psychology , but necessary .
The notion of fairness between two strangers is an interesting behavioral question — what motivates someone to be fair to someone they do n't know ?
Small groups that know each other , like families , are motivated to be fair because they expect fairness in return .
But in large scale groups , there are no reputation or reciprocation obligations between strangers .
Punishment can act as a means of enforcing fair behavior .
While reputation damage is considered generally a serious enough punishment to keep people from exploiting others in small societies , it does n't work fast enough in large ones .
So , it can be equally important to know how we started punishing each other , and how it correlated with society size .
Hating the player : fairness and punishment in money games
To study these things , researchers sampled the attitudes of people from many different societies .
Some were hunter - gatherers and foragers from less - developed regions that represent the small - tribe mentality , and others were from highly developed and industrialized countries .
Researchers gathered data on the community size , the religion of each person ( Islam , Christianity , tribal / none , etc. ) , and their level of market integration , in this case a measure of how much food was obtained through the market versus what obtained by the person 's own means , such as through farming or fishing .
They also took data on wealth , education , and so on to groom out spurious variables .
Participants were tested with three games , all involving divisions of money via anonymous dealings that tested fairness and punishment .
The first was the Dictator Game , which measures fairness .
One player has to divide a sum of money between himself and another player — the more money he gave the other player , the fairer he was .
The second was the Ultimatum game , which added a small element of punishment .
Again , the first player had a sum of money to divide between himself and another , but the second player could choose to reject the offer , causing both players to receive no money at all .
The third game , the Third - Party Punishment Game , involves three players .
Again , the first player is dividing money between himself and second player , but this time a third player is getting a separate payment of half the total sum .
The third player gets to see how much the first player offers the second , and can choose to spend some of his money to punish the first player by making him receive less money .
Loving the game : how society affects us
From the game data , scientists found that the type of community a person came from had a large influence on their behavior in these anonymous dealings .
A person who was more integrated in a market community offered more money to others , showing that people more familiar with conduct in a large market are more likely to be fair to people they do n't know .
Participation in religion also corresponded with an increase in fairness .
On the punishment side , scientists measured the data in minimum acceptable offers , or how low an offer could get before a player would decide to punish the person making it .
They found that the minimum acceptable offer increased with the size of the community that the punishing player belongs to ( it eventually tapered off as in a natural logarithm plot ) .
They found no relationship between market integration and punishment , although religious people were much more likely to punish other players .
Researchers think this data supports the notion that , as societies grow , more and more costly punishments are necessary to sustain them in order to prevent the group from breaking into smaller populations again .
They also point out that that people from small , less integrated , and less religious societies are good analogs of our pre-large - society - forming selves , and that they are relatively unconcerned with either being fair to strangers or punishing them .
This calls into question the idea that social interactions in large societies stem entirely from an innate willingness to build up our Rolodexes and treat new strangers like old friends .
According to this data , that willingness is heavily mediated by the establishment and internalizing of institutions and norms that handle rules of trade for us .
While social contracts are , to a degree , natural ( we did come up with them , after all ) they are not habitual .
The researchers caution that future behavioral studies should be careful about attributing these apparently learned behaviors to human nature .
Science , 2010 .
DOI : 10.1126/science.1182238 ( About DOIs ) .
The numbers are in , and they 've been certified by the feds , so it 's official : The 2011 Mustang V - 6 puts down 305 horsepower and gets 31 mpg on the highway .
The Environmental Protection Agency completed testing the V - 6 Mustang this week , and Ford said Thursday it 's the first time a production car has made more than 300 horsepower while returning more than 30 mpg .
We could n't come up with a car to refute that claim – if you can , let us know – but even if Ford 's blowing smoke , it 's still an impressive accomplishment .
It one - ups the Chevrolet Camaro , suggesting we 're on the cusp of a new kind of muscle - car war , and it highlights the gains yet to be made in internal combustion engines even as the industry flirts with hybrids and EVs .
" This is a milestone for Ford and for the auto industry , " said Ron Cogan , editor of Green Car Journal .
" This is a big statement . "
It 's nothing for a hybrid like the 2010 Toyota Prius to hit 50 mpg or more , and even a rolling bank vault like the Cadillac Escalade Hybrid can get 22 combined .
But we 're talking about a muscle car that can smoke the tires and get Honda Civic–like fuel economy on the highway .
" When you 've got a mainstream car like the Mustang that can give you 31 mpg and the performance car enthusiasts expect , it 's just short of amazing , " Cogan said .
The figures apply to the V - 6 with a six - speed automatic gearbox .
It 's good for 19 city / 31 highway .
Choose the standard six - speed manual and you 'll get 19 /29 .
Obviously these figures depend upon the force with which you 're depressing the gas pedal , but they 're the official EPA figures you 'll see on the window sticker .
To put those figures in perspective , the new V - 6 Mustang has 95 more ponies than the dog car it replaces and improves the outgoing model 's fuel economy by 4 mpg .
The highway fuel economy is 1 mpg more than Ford expected .
" The Mustang engineering team aimed high and , through hard work , achieved fuel - economy numbers that elevate Mustang into a class by itself , " Derrick Kuzak , Ford group VP , said in a statement .
So how'd they do it ?
The 3.7 - liter engine is made of aluminum to reduce weight .
It 's got cold - air induction and variable cam timing to optimize efficiency .
Ford tweaked the gear ratios and shift program in the transmission to maximize fuel economy .
The hydraulic power - steering pump was ditched in favor of an electric unit to cut parasitic drag on the engine .
And the aerodynamics were improved with a new front fascia , a taller air dam and tighter seals on the trunk , among other things .
Together the modifications " speak to the future of Mustang , " said Barb Samardzich , Ford 's VP of global powertrain engineering .
" We 've proven that , using technology , Ford can deliver both power and fuel economy . "
Ford is hardly alone in doing this .
Everyone is using direct injection , turbocharging and other tricks to maximize performance and efficiency , and we 're seeing these mods in muscle cars as well as compacts .
Order a 2010 Camaro with a V - 6 and an automatic , and you 'll get 22 city / 29 highway in a car putting down 304 horsepower .
" GM surprised people , and I ’m sure Ford used that as a target to beat , " said Mike Omotoso , an industry analyst with J.D. Power & Associates .
" I suspect that Chrysler will try to get 30 mpg highway with the V - 6 Challenger if or when they put the Pentastar V - 6 engine in it . "
Ford did n't use direct injection in the V - 6 , and Omotoso says adding that would probably boost fuel economy another 10 percent .
Give it a smaller engine with a turbocharger – in other words , one of the Ecoboost engines – and it will will climb higher , still without sacrificing performance .
Hybrids and EVs might be the hot trend in the auto biz , but no one expects internal combustion to go away anytime soon .
Automakers are doing everything they can to squeeze more efficiency and performance from their engines , and Cogan says there 's still a lot of improvements to be made .
Diesels can routinely break into the 40s , and Cogan 's confident gasoline engines will join them before long .
" I do n't see any reason why an internal combustion engine could n't get 50 mpg , " he said .
" But it takes new thought and a new approach that maximizes efficiency while balancing the need for performance . "
Omotoso , who follows powertrain development specifically , is even more optimistic .
Automakers will continue squeezing more efficiency from their engines for a long time to come , as government regulations and consumer demands force them to .
" I ’m not sure if there is an upper limit in terms of efficiency , but if there is , we are not close to it yet , " he said .
" Less than 30 percent of the energy in gasoline is converted to power in the vehicle , so we have a long way to go . "

Despite its flaws , ‘ I ’d hold my nose and vote for ’ reform , scholar tells Raw Story
He ’s a hero of many progressives , but his enthusiasm for the passage of health care reform legislation this weekend was fairly muted .
In an interview with Raw Story , world - renowned scholar and political critic Noam Chomsky reluctantly called the bill a mildly positive step , but cautioned that it would n’t fix the fundamental problems with the nation ’s troubled system .

“ The United States ’ health care system is so dysfunctional it has about twice the costs of comparable countries and some of the worst outcomes , ” Chomsky told Raw Story .
“ This bill continues with that . ”
The decades - long critic of corporate power alleged that premiums wo n’t stop rising as the package is designed in no small part to funnel money into the pockets of the health care industry .
“ The bill gives away a lot to insurance companies and big pharmaceutical corporations , ” he said .
The legislation forbids government from negotiating prices with pharmaceutical companies or permitting the importation of drugs .
Nor does it provide competition to private insurers , an oligopolistic industry that will maintain its impunity from antitrust laws .
But despite this , Chomsky , an advocate for a single - payer system , said killing the bill was n’t a better solution .
“ If I were in Congress , ” he said , “ I ’d probably hold my nose and vote for it , because the alternative of not passing it is worse , bad as this bill is .
Unfortunately , that ’s the reality . ”
“ If it fails , it would n’t put even limited constraints on insurance companies , ” he explained , noting that the bill “ at least has some steps towards barring the withholding of policies from people with prior disabilities . ”
The consumer protections from dodgy insurance practices are among the bill ’s most popular components .

The mandate to purchase insurance has been a central qualm of progressives and conservatives opposed to the effort .
Chomsky , while admitting it ’s a boon to insurance companies , called it a “ step toward universality , ” asserting that “ without some kind of mandatory coverage , nothing is going to work at all . ”
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor added that it ’s a damning referendum on American democracy that one of the most highly supported components of the effort nationally , the public insurance option , was jettisoned .
He partly blamed the media for refusing to stress how favorably it ’s viewed by the populace .
“ It did n’t have ‘ political support , ’ just the support of the majority of the population , ” Chomsky quipped , “ which apparently is not political support in our dysfunctional democracy . ”

The provision has consistently polled well , garnering the support of sixty percent of Americans across the nation in a CBS / New York Times poll released in December , days after it was eliminated from the reform package .
Democratic leaders deemed it politically untenable .
“ There should be headlines explaining why , for decades , what ’s been called politically impossible is what most of the public has wanted , ” Chomsky said .
“ There should be headlines explaining what that means about the political system and the media . ”

I have to admit that when it comes to Vodka I do n’t often get all that excited .
The notion of brands competing against each other to see which one can make a neutral grain spirit so tasteless and undetectable that it ’s nearly invisible really is n’t all that appealing to me .
That ’s why I was so excited to give Bakon a try , a breath of fresh air in a marketplace that seems to take its self far too seriously .
Bakon Vodka is a bacon - flavored vodka from Black Rock Spirits in Washington .
It ’s something different and unique in the world of spirits , and honestly something that sounded like fun .
From a marketing perspective , Black Rock Spirits has hit an absolute home run .
Piggy backing on the bacon craze , Bakon is the kind of spirit that gets attention simply for the fact that it exists .
Cleverly branded and in an eye - catching bottle , Bakon is sure to do swift business with their spirit .
Bakon Vodka is an Idaho potato - based vodka , column distilled , brought down to 80 proof and flavored .
Black Rock Spirits seems to want to push the benefits of a column distillation over pot distillation , which is honestly odd to me .
They claim :
“ Our vodka is column - distilled using a single heating process that does n’t “ bruise ” the alcohol like the multiple heating cycles needed to make a typical pot -still vodka . ”
It ’s an odd claim and one which shows the acute marketing acumen behind the spirit ( who would have thought someone would try to exalt the column still ?! ) .
I tasted Bakon straight up and indeed it does taste like bacon , but for me the taste is artificial and chemically .
The nose is smokey , sweet , fatty bacon , but there is an artificialness to it .
It ’s like a strawberry candy smells in relation to a strawberry – sure , you can identify it as strawberry , but it ’s just not the same .
The taste of Bakon is smokey and bacon - like , but again , there ’s a fairly strong artificial feeling to the taste .
The vodka finishes with some edges that are not all that pleasant .
I also noticed some debris in the bottle , not sure what the origin of it is , but it was unwelcome .
I made two drinks with Bakon , a bacon martini and bacon bloody mary .
Both were interesting with the bacon tones in them especially the bloody mary , but I still could n’t get past the chemical feel of the flavoring .
That was n’t a problem with some of my fellow tasters who really enjoyed both drinks .
From my perspective , I ’d rate this vodka as a not recommend / skip it .
I found it to be too rough , too chemically and unenjoyable .
However , all that did n’t seem to matter for some of the people on our tasting team who proclaimed , “ It ’s BACON ! ” .
It ’s hard to argue with that and honestly for most people seeking out bacon vodka , they ’ll be happy to get something in their glass that does indeed resemble bacon .
So I ’m splitting the difference with out rating :
Bakon Vodka Rating :
Mildly Rcommended – this is a love it or hate it spirit .
It ’s not all that well crafted , but yeah , it ’s bacon .
Bakon vodka is currently in 750 ml sells for $ 35.99 and can be found at DrinkUpNY.com .
It ’s manufactured in Forest Grove , Oregon of all places .
Wonder how this would play nationally :
“ These ballot propositions are Texas Republicans ’ chance to be heard on issues facing our state , ” said Republican Party of Texas Chairman Cathie Adams .
“ All five of the propositions came up from the grassroots through the SREC to address serious concerns .
Voters should study the questions and then use their vote to speak directly to their elected officials . ”
Noting that the Democrats have no propositions on their primary ballot , Republican Party spokesman Bryan Preston added : “ Apparently the Democrats do n’t want to know what their primary voters think about , say , ObamaCare or the cap and tax bill .
If they put those questions on the ballot , they might find out that their own primary voters are just as disenchanted with Washington Democrats as the rest of us .
Or , that they ’re still on the big government bandwagon — and therefore out of touch with the rest of Texas .
So in their case , apparently it ’s best just not to ask . ”
The five ballot propositions are as follows :

WASHINGTON —
In proposing a major expansion of offshore oil and gas development , President Obama set out to fashion a carefully balanced plan that would attract bipartisan support for climate and energy legislation while increasing production of domestic oil .
It is not clear that the plan announced Wednesday will do either .
While the oil industry , business groups and some Republicans offered muted support for the proposal , most environmental groups denounced it .
And the senators whose support Mr. Obama is courting for highly contentious climate and energy legislation to be introduced in the coming weeks gave decidedly mixed reactions :
For every senator who praised it as at least a partial answer to the nation ’s energy needs , another raised alarms about befouled beaches and continued dependence on fossil fuels .
Even Mr. Obama sounded somewhat torn in announcing a drilling plan that would open large tracts of the Atlantic coast , the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Arctic waters off Alaska to oil exploration and eventual drilling .
“ This is not a decision I ’ve made lightly , ” he said as he stood at Andrews Air Force base in Maryland on Wednesday near an Air Force fighter converted to burn renewable biofuels .

How will we ever get a leg up on hackers who are infecting computers worldwide ?
Microsoft 's security chief laid out several suggestions Tuesday , including a possible Internet usage tax to pay for the inspection and quarantine of machines .
Today most hacked PCs run Microsoft 's Windows operating system , and the company has invested millions in trying to fight the problem .
Microsoft recently used the U.S. court system to shut down the Waledac botnet , introducing a new tactic in the battle against hackers .
Speaking at the RSA security conference in San Francisco , Microsoft Corporate Vice President for Trustworthy Computing Scott Charney said that the technology industry needs to think about more " social solutions . "
That means fighting the bad guys at several levels , he said .
" Just like we do defense in depth in IT , we have to do defense in depth in [ hacking ] response . "
" I actually think the health care model ... might be an interesting way to think about the problem , " Charney said .
With medical diseases , there are education programs , but there are also social programs to inspect people and quarantine the sick .
This model could work to fight computer viruses too , he said .
When a computer user allows malware to run on his computer , " you 're not just accepting it for yourself , you 're contaminating everyone around you , " he said .
The idea that Internet service providers might somehow step up in the fight against malware is not new .
The problem , however , is cost .
Customer calls already eat into service provider profits .
Adding quarantine and malware - fixing costs to that would be prohibitive , said Danny McPherson , chief research officer with Arbor Networks , via instant message .
" They have no incentive to do anything today . "
So who would foot the bill ?
" Maybe markets will make it work , " Charney said .
But an Internet usage tax might be the way to go .
" You could say it 's a public safety issue and do it with general taxation , " he said .
According to Microsoft , there are 3.8 million infected botnet computers worldwide , 1 million of which are in the U.S.
They are used to steal sensitive information and send spam , and were a launching point for 190,000 distributed denial - of - service attacks in 2008 .

Utah food culture , for the most part , can be dubbed Mormon cuisine .
The state was settled in 1847 by Brigham Young , the leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints following the assassination of founder Joseph Smith , and as the community fled religious persecution it spread into southern Idaho , California , Wyoming , and Nevada , popularly called the " Mormon Corridor " or the " Jell - O Belt . "
A mix of convenience foods and Southwestern ingenuity , Mormon cuisine is built around feeding dozens of mouths from pantry stores and prudent seasoning .
Notably , many iconic Mormon foods are enjoyed throughout the Southwest by Mormons and non-Mormons alike .
Because Utah is the most homogenously religious state in the nation , social life tends to revolve around LDS church functions , church potlucks being the nucleus of Mormon cuisine .
Any budding culinary anthropologist can touch down at the Salt Lake City International Airport , shout " Take me to a ward potluck ! " , and discover the bedrock of Mormon food .
At most social functions , there will be funeral potatoes .
Not just for post - burial buffets , the dish is comforting at any social gathering .
Calorically astronomical and dense with melted cheese , funeral potatoes are a casserole of shredded cooked frozen potatoes , canned cream of chicken soup , and sour cream , topped with crumbled cornflakes and baked until molten .
This food , along with green Jell - O , was immortalized in a set of collectible pins from the 2002 Winter Olympics .
There will also be frog 's eye salad , an ambrosial addition to any potluck .
This is made from small pasta balls called acini de pepe — Italian for peppercorns ( fregola or orzo can be substituted ) — that have been cooked , drained , and cooled , then mixed with a tub of whipped topping , canned crushed pineapple , and canned mandarin orange segments .
There might be Hawaiian haystacks , an economical and engaging dish made from a pot of white rice and refrigerator scraps .
Boiled chicken , Tuesday 's ham , microwaved corn niblets , and shredded lettuce are set out in little bowls .
Gravy , fried wontons , and pineapple rings are essential .
Guests pile their plates with a heap of rice and add toppings as they please into a loaded stack .
These dishes are composed of ingredients easily found in any Mormon fridge or pantry .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , the Mormon pantry is unique in its depth .
The 30 - page Essentials of Home Production and Storage booklet published by the LDS church states that a larder should contain up to a year of family sustenance .
Both a go - to for quick family meals and a supply of beans , grains , dry milk powder , and canned peaches for surviving a The Road - style apocalypse , the pantry promotes an overall attitude of preparedness and self - sustainability that Mormons hold dear .
Mormon food can sometimes seem like an afterthought — packaged and processed foods cobbled together into bland dishes and stretched to feed piles of kids .
One Mormon friend of mine , who grew up in a household of nine , mentioned the functional aspect of meals .
" Food was supplied , eaten , and then moved on " ; food was sustenance , not sensual pleasure .
I ’m going to try and keep this short : if you ’re writing Rails applications and are not writing integration tests , you need to start .
Today .
At thoughtbot , we write integration tests with RSpec and Capybara although you could use Cucumber , or any other tool .
Most developers know that achieving 100 % C0 code coverage is n’t a worthwhile goal in the grand scheme of things .
You can use coverage reports to help guide you in what you may want to write tests for , but the law of diminishing returns becomes a factor in attempting to achieve 100 % coverage .
Without integration tests , an awesome test suite does n’t really mean much .
I could test each individual method on every model I write , cover every response for every controller , and even go so far as to testing all my views , but in the end , something is missing .
I ’m not testing how my application behaves .
So , just as 100 % coverage does n’t really mean much , the same goes for an app that ’s tested well but lacks integration tests .
Any amount of testing is better than nothing ; I ’m not advocating that everyone stops writing unit or functional tests .
If you ’re writing a Rails app , you ’re not writing just an API to your models .
You ’re providing users an experience , and that experience should be tested !
Unit and functional tests do not have the scope to test your full application ( they were never meant to . )
That ’s where acceptance tests enter the picture .
For example , let ’s say I have these controller tests from the Clearance gem :
# spec/controllers/sessions_controller_spec.rb describe Clearance :: SessionsController do describe ' on GET to / sessions / new ' do before { get : new } it { should respond_with ( : success ) } it { should render_template ( : new ) } it { should_not set_the_flash } end describe ' on POST to # create with good credentials ' do before do @user = create ( : user ) @user .
update_attribute : remember_token , ' old - token ' post : create , : session => { : email => @user .
email , : password => @user .
password } end it { should redirect_to_url_after_create } it ' sets the user in the clearance session ' do controller .
current_user .
should == @user end it ' should not change the remember token ' do @user .
reload .
remember_token .
should == ' old - token ' end end # ... end
By themselves , what do these test ?
They test that I have a controller that responds to the HTTP verb POST and will set the flash and sign me into the application , and that I can call #authenticate on a User with an email and password and get a boolean response .
Great .
That does n’t mean I can sign into the application from a browser .
I could throw an assert_select or two in there , but where ’s the overall behavior of going to the homepage , clicking “ Login ” , filling in the form , and hitting the “ Sign In ” button ?
Let ’s use Capybara to drive a headless web browser in an extended example from :
# spec/integration/visitor_signs_in_spec.rb feature ' Visitor signs in ' do scenario ' with valid email and password ' do create_user 'user@example.com ' , ' password ' sign_in_with 'user@example.com ' , ' password ' user_should_be_signed_in end scenario ' tries with invalid password ' do create_user 'user@example.com ' , ' password ' sign_in_with 'user@example.com ' , ' wrong_password ' page_should_display_sign_in_error user_should_be_signed_out end private def create_user ( email , password ) FactoryGirl .
create ( :user , : email => email , : password => password ) end def sign_in_with ( email , password ) visit sign_in_path fill_in ' session_email ' , : with => email fill_in ' session_password ' , : with => password click_button " Sign in " end def user_should_be_signed_in visit root_path page .
should have_content ( ' Sign out ' ) end def user_should_be_signed_out page .
should have_content ( ' Sign in ' ) end def page_should_display_sign_in_error page .
should have_css ( ' div.error ' , ' Incorrect email or password ' ) end end
Between both of these , which do you think describes the ability for a user to sign in successfully ?
End - to - end testing with RSpec integration tests and Capybara
The Quest Continues : Introducing capybara - webkit
Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens announced last week he was retiring after 35 years on the bench .
The cable news networks immediately began to promote the nomination fight that ’s sure to take place in the coming months .
But Jon Stewart says the hype has just begun .
“ The media is gearing up for their summertime erection , ” he predicted .
“ Mother f**ker ! ” Stewart exclaimed at the news that Stevens was retiring from the Supreme Court , saying the media had just gotten through covering health care reform .
“ We could n’t have two weeks .
You could n’t give us two weeks , Stevens , to relax and take a breath . ”

Cable news pundits were quick to state the obvious .
“ The question is how ugly will it get , ” CNN ’s legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin remarked .
“ Considering last week we were fight[ ing over ] whether slavery was part of the civil war , I think the Supreme Court thing could get pretty f**king ugly .
I ’m sick of it , ” lamented Stewart .
The Comedy Central host then produced an bottle of liquid labeled “ poisonous concoction ” and threatened to gulp as news clips predicted the fight to come .
Fox ’s Malini Wilkes called the process an “ ugly partisan nomination fight . ”
Another Fox News anchor called it “ the showdown of the summer . ”
A third Fox anchor referred to it as a “ bloody fight . ”
Stewart invited The Daily Show‘s Senior Supreme Court Correspondent , Dash Worthington , to provide some analysis on Stevens ’ retirement .

“ Dash , what do you make of Justice Stevens ’ decision to step down ? ” asked Stewart .
“ He ’s a quitter , ” observed Worthington .
The Justice is 90 and has served for 35 years but that did n’t seem to matter to Worthington .
“ This guy is a p*ssy .
A quitter p*ssy — a p*ssy . ”

PICTURE a habitat atop a hill in warm sunlight on the edge of a crater near the south pole of the Moon .
There are metal ores in the rocks nearby and ice in the shadows of the crater below .
Solar arrays are set up on the regolith that covers the Moon ’s surface .
Humans live in sealed , cave - like lava tubes , protected from solar flares and sustained by large surface greenhouses .
Imagine the Moon as the first self - sustainable human settlement away from Earth and a high - speed transportation hub for the solar system .
We can finally begin to think seriously about establishing such a self - sufficient home on the Moon because last week , NASA announced that it had discovered large quantities of water there .
While we have known for decades that the Moon had all the raw chemicals necessary for sustaining life , we believed they were trapped in rocks and thus difficult to extract .
The discovery of plentiful lunar water is of tremendous importance to humanity and our long - term survival .
There have been 73 missions , manned and unmanned , to the Moon , and understanding its chemical composition , particularly finding water , has always been a priority .
So why have n’t we seen significant amounts of water until now ?

Work with Userbase is progressing nicely .
I wrote some suggestions based on user feedback and my own opinions , and a few days ago there was a small discussion about the future of Userbase on IRC .
However , this post is n’t about Userbase – I hope I ’ll find some time to summarize the plans for the wiki here in a few days .
Today I want to share another tip that I ’ve found and need to remember to add to Userbase : Borderless Maximized Windows .
This option is very useful for devices with small screens , such as netbooks , to give slightly more space to your applications .
If enabled , the window border will hide automatically when you maximize a window ( and vice versa when unmaximized ) .
If I remember correctly , this feature was introduced in KDE Software Compilation 4.5 for the Plasma Netbook workspace , where it ’s enabled by default .
Here ’s a short screencast demonstration ( what , not an animated GIF ! ? ) :
Note that I used double click to maximize the windows .
This is configurable in System Settings → Window Behavior → Window Behavior → Titlebar Actions .
Previously I used some window - specific settings to get a similar setup , but it only did it according to some pre-defined rules – the borders were n’t automatically hidden / shown when a window was maximized / restored .
So how do I enable this in Plasma Desktop ?
Use you favorite text editor to edit the file
~/.kde4/share/config/kwinrc
In some distributions the . kde4 directory is called . kde ( or something else like .kdemod4 )
Add the line
BorderlessMaximizedWindows=true under the section [ Windows ]
It should look something like this : [ Windows ]
ActiveMouseScreen=true
AltTabStyle=KDE
AutoRaise=false
AutoRaiseInterval=750
BorderSnapZone=10
BorderlessMaximizedWindows=true
CenterSnapZone=0 Launch KRunner ( Alt +F2 ) and run the command
kwin -- replace to restart KWin
Go crazy and maximize every window in sight !
Remember that you can unmaximize them from the window menu ( Alt + F3 ) or from the task manager in your panel .
If quick tiling is enabled ( System Settings → Desktop → Screen Edges → Window Management ) , you can also use Alt + Left mouse button to unmaximize windows by dragging them
Credits this time go to Christian who wrote about this feature in a comment in this blog post .
The post also links to a neat widget that ’s useful for a setup with borderless windows .
As the climate - change summit begins in Copenhagen , I find that I cannot hope for the results that many environmental activists might hope for and call “ success ” .
I sense an extremism in their hopes that is unbalanced by other human considerations and an excessive stridency .
I do not lack green credentials .
I was one of the four people who took the initiative to plan and organise the first Earth Day in history in Pittsburgh , working with Pennsylvania Environmental Action / Zero Population Growth .
During my labours for that organisation , of which I later became Acting Coördinator , I lobbied in Congress and the State legislature , spoke before civic groups and in schools , and went on radio and television to present the environmentalists ’ point of view .
I also worked to co-found Ralph Nader ’s Western Pennsylvania Public Interest Research Group ( PIRG ) , arranging a dinner with Nader when he came to Pittsburgh , and eventually becoming Acting Coördinator there as well .
Later I moved to Colorado to continue my studies , and became active in the Colorado PIRG .
During the time of my environmental work it might seem fair to call myself a fanatic , a person who saw most of life through the filtre of environmentalist goals and values , so that they became important to the extent that I simply dismissed out of hand problems with environmental protection such as expense , the impact on human lives , and the ways in which human beings would be discommoded , limited and rendered unfree .
I am not at all sure that in a quasi- professional environmentalist this fanaticism is a bad thing , for in a social context I was fulfilling a certain function as an advocate , and others could be trusted to provide opposition and the other side of the story .
My point of view prevailed , however , and from the early seventies , when I did most of my active work , environmentalism or “ ecology ” has become an obvious human concern , taught in schools and learned from youth upwards .
No matter how much people may oppose some particular environmental initiative , everyone has a vague idea of environmental issues and recognises that saving the ecosystems of the Earth is important .
The issue has even been taken up by religious groups and is becoming an ethico - spiritual imperative for many .
The trouble is that my own opposition to all of this as manifested in methods of dealing with global warming in Copenhagen is also spiritually based , and ethical in aim .
My Environmentalist Motivations
I became an ardent environmental activist for some years of my life because I was raised in nature , in the countryside three miles from little Mars , Pa. and twenty - five miles from Pittsburgh .
It has much changed since due to population influx , but in the fifties through the seventies my parents had four acres there , comprising lawns , meadows and woods .
And it was surrounded by other people ’s forests , fields , pastures , and meadows , all on the rolling hills of Western Pennsylvania .
Wildlife was abundant , such as deer , rabbits , squirrels , groundhogs , foxes , and racoons , and I delighted in studying the flora and fauna around me .
In such an environment I felt close to nature and became something of a nature mystic under the influence of Taoism .
Perhaps I would have become a en-pagan then if the movement had been active around us then .
Certainly my natural environment gave me that tendency .
This is a normal way for people to live , and civilisations and cultures around the world until relatively recently had the majority of their populations living on the land in individual homes or in villages with direct access to nature .
But today environmentalists compel us to remember its price : it took our three - person family two ( used ) cars most of the time to carry out our work and shopping , and I had to ride a school bus for the better part of an hour to and from school each day .
Although we did some of our family business in nearby Mars , our main shopping expeditions took twenty miles of driving to the local malls and shopping centres .
( For the most part , however , we did not enter the central city and get involved in traffic jams in those dense urban areas where mass transit makes sense . )
Our life style was typically American .
Americans live in diverse ways , but a typical American lifestyle requires the automobile .
Sometimes Americans may use the automobile when a well - designed public transportation system would serve them better ( if one existed ) , but in cases like my family ’s only automobiles make real sense .
And I would very much like to see such modes of life preserved and expanded to the blessing of more people .
I firmly believe that real environmental sensibility and spirituality are best nurtured in communities of low housing density where people can grow up and live with a clear visual image that human beings live within non-human nature .
A city street or even dense suburbs where the pavements and houses dominate the landscape simply cannot fulfil this requirement .
I have observed that BBC news reporters in interviewing environmental activists and experts love to press them asking “ But is n’t it necessary for us to change our lifestyles ? ”
They seem to find virtue in getting people to give up things which are a normal part of our civilisation , our freedom and our abundance of life .
I find this perverse ; there are better ways , and they begin with a more critical view of the whole issue .
I believe in a philosophy of abundance and progress , not one of limitation and sacrifice .
This is a spiritually - rooted attitude .
Some abundance - oriented Christians and New - Agers with such an orientation may go to extremes of materialism that cast doubt on their spirituality altogether and would offend any Quaker ’s notion of Simplicity .
But I think there does exist a wholesome sort of spiritually - based abundance - thinking , where one simply has faith that the divine order of things has all that we will ever need , and that we have been given the capability as a species to learn over time how to access that plenty .
To a large extent the most civilised nations have done so , at least for their large middle classes .
We must remember that to be a human being is by current definition to be unnatural .
By the conventions of our thought and language , when termites build a tower that in terms of their size surely rates as a skyscraper , that is “ natural ” .
When human beings create a Taipei Tower , that is a “ human artefact ” and by no means to be confused with a natural object .
Environmentalists often try to make us feel guilty about our using our naturally human species preservation adaptation : artificiality .
But that is simply a misguided denial of the fact that we are a part of nature .
Our skyscrapers are as natural as those of termites , our dams as natural as those of beavers , our flight as natural as that of birds ( and , yes , we have our own way of procuring the ability – growing wings and feathers is just one possibility , and not evidently the best ) .
We should recognise this so that by acting as the environment - changing species that we are we do not have to count our actions or our creations as unnatural or morally suspect .
All species interact with their environments according to their specific characteristics and their measure .
Human beings to continue with the advantages and achievements of our modern civilisations require cheap , sure and abundant energy sources , affordable automotive transportation for non-urban dwellers , and affordable long - distance aviation to bind our world together .
And all of these things can be provided in an environmentally - friendly manner if we do not panic and overreact now .
We know how to build safe and tested atomic reactors , as well as solar , wind , geothermal , hydroelectric , osmotic , marine temperature differential , and tidal power installations and the smart grids to distribute the resultant energy to where it is needed .
We already have commercially available battery - powered cars quite good enough to meet all of my former family ’s rural needs – it remains simply for economies of scale and further technological advancement to bring the price down somewhat .
And we already have airliners far more fuel efficient than most of today ’s , and the possibility of using biofuels in them is already being successfully tested with normal passengers .
I would like to see all of these approaches emphasised in Copenhagen – a technological fix worthy of human ingenuity , not a crippling of our hard - won technological and economic achievements , not a limitation of individual choice .
But often environmentalists seem to me to wish to make human beings huddle together in cities where they can be near mass transit , and only see non -human nature on television and the rare trip to a national park , where they can look but are not integrated into the landscape and local ecology .
I do not want to see that as our future .
Furthermore , the technological advantages of modern civilisation must be spread to the underdeveloped nations of the world .
I see no reason why every human family should not deserve a house on land of their own in close proximity to non-human nature , and an automobile to get to and from it .
The point is not simply to preserve a privileged lifestyle for the relatively well - off , but to make everyone well - off .
Doubts and Policies
About the global warming summit other things could , of course , be said .
The recently - leaked e-mails from scientists of the majority ( “ Climategate ” ) attempting to get doubters to modify the presentation of their scientific findings has cast considerable doubt on how far this whole supposed crisis has been collectively manufactured by the interaction of scientists , politicians and environmentalists ( presumably without malice ) .
It is suspicious that the peak of apparent temperature rise was in 1998 , and although the first decade of this century has been warm , this does not seem to directly reflect the increases in carbon dioxide since 98 by producing a new record year or a series of them .
It could be a statistical “ fluke ” - or maybe not .
And what about the relatively far greater effects of volcanic CO2 emissions and solar radiation fluctuations on global temperature ?
And what about what scientists told us just before the idea of global warming became popular , that we were heading for an ice age ?
I am not a climatologist , but my own belief as a simple world citizen trying to make sense of the evidence is that probably there is a warming trend over a period that is unclear , possibly nested within other longer - term climate trends , that these may be partly influenced by human activity , and that over a sufficient quantity of time we might by reduced emissions of greenhouse gases modify warming to some extent if we wished .
I also believe that temperature changes , solar radiation , and atmospheric gas contents have changed over the history of the earth , and that we do not have to panic if we observe through superior scientific observation techniques that it is happening now .
I also believe that the Earth has more self - stabilising mechanisms than we have yet discovered , and that we ourselves have great adaptive powers to live in a warming world .
I am haunted by the fact that when I was lecturing on environmental and population problems in the early seventies , I as well as many other environmentalists at that time were relying on the predictions of the Club of Rome published in the book The Limits to Growth .
It was very scientific and presented various serious - lookomg flowcharts detailing positive and negative feedback loops to show that resources would soon run out if we did not change our ways .
In those days we were appalled that global population might soon reach 3.6 billion people .
Now we have almost twice that and we have not utterly run out of food , water or petroleum .
We will eventually if we do not take action , but the Club of Rome was obviously and dramatically wrong in its time scales .
Could not modern climate scientists and the politicians and current environmentalists who believe them be in the same boat ?
Climatology is by its nature an unusually complicated science in which much remains obscure to the very best scientists .
More worrying , perhaps , should be that many scientists who believe in anthropogenic global warming theory are saying that it is already too late by perhaps one to four decades to take effective action on greenhouse gases in time .
And British engineers as a body doubt that Britain can physically be converted to nuclear and renewable energy sources in time to meet the politicians ’ targets in the time frame given .
And for rich nations being asked immediately after the height of the financial crisis to give , say , 100 billion dollars annually to poor nations to help them overcome their climatic problems is not a good prescription for global recovery or prosperity .
Especially if the same rich nations have their own climate problems and are handicapped in their productivity by environmental legislation and carbon caps .
What is to be Done ?
Despite my misgivings about the Copenhagen Climate Conference and all its potential works , I do basically agree that , if shorn of exaggerated and problematic time frames , what it will wish to do is perfectly reasonable .
We will have oil for longer than many suppose , as we always seem to find more deposits and to learn how to access fields that it had previously been impractical to exploit .
But why burn up such a wonderful feedstock for organic synthesis , making pollution in the process ?
And the same goes for coal .
And there are other methods of dealing with the problem .
There are various forms of carbon capture available to scrub the atmosphere itself of greenhouse gasses , as well as methods for increasing the Earth ’s albedo or screening the Earth from the full force of solar radiation .
These would be faster and could at the least buy a few decades of time to do things at a deliberate pace .
And some of them are elegantly simple and relatively cheap by orders of magnitude than aiming exclusively at greenhouse gasses .
The underlying problem , of course , is overpopulation .
What level of population constitutes overpopulation is a matter of judgement .
To me it is any level of population where the environment cannot tolerate the impact of everyone ’s having the lifestyle of an upper middle - class American or European ( after environmentally - friendly improvements in energy sources ) .
We should all be approximately equal , and we should equalise outselves up , certainly not down .
Lowering population does not require drastic measures .
Experience has shown that if women are given access to contraceptives and abortion , if they are given the power to decide ( in consultation with their mates ) when to bear children , and if they are given access to worthwhile and interesting careers out of the home , birth - rates will drop rapidly .
Also helpful are the reduction of infant mortality so that families know that almost all their offspring will live to adulthood , equality of the sexes so that girls will be regarded as being as satisfactory as boys , and good social security and pension systems so that the old will not have to depend on their own young for survival in old age .
These basics plus a bit of education as to the importance of population restraint should prove quite enough , with no coercion being necessary .
Population restraint and environmentally - intelligent technology are the solutions to our problems .
We must not let a misguided sense of urgency or even panic based on weather - men ’s predictions , notoriously inaccurate , cause us to overreact or react in haste .
We must not destroy the already fragile global economy that will be needed to deal with any problems which may really arise .
We must not hinder the free and speedy development of the less rich countries of the world .
And we must not imperil the mobility of human beings whether by automobile or air , but must solve the environmental problems associated with these modes of transportation in a manner which will not price them and their customary use out of the purchasing power of the ordinary person .
And we then must free up our thinking and concern to deal with much more pressing affairs such as human rights and improving our global education and social services .
There is a lot to do , there are many challenges facing Mankind , and global warming must be made to take its place in the queue , not hog all the financial resources and attention .
I therefore would urge the delegates in Copenhagen : avoid overambitious targets .
Be moderate and realistic .
Avoid punitive taxes and driving up prices for ordinary consumers .
Pursue technological means of addressing problems , not changing people ’s ways of life or limiting their effective freedoms .
And remember that there are other social and economic challenges that require resources and attention too .
Keep this in proportion .
Set general policies to move the global community in the right direction over time , and do n’t buy into environmentalists ’ sense of crisis .
Seeing urgency here is their task as advocates of a special point of view , but statesmanship involves regarding all public affairs with a measured and unhurried gaze and keeping everything in perspective .

ICSP does not require a different programming protocol .
A socket - based programmer already produces the required signaling , but sends it to the socket rather than through wires .
Most socket programmers can be used as an ICSP by rigging wires from the socket to the application circuit .
For example , the original JDM2 programmer ( here : http://www.jdm.homepage.dk/newpic.htm ) can be used to do ICSP programming by bringing the 5 required signals to a header .
This can be seen in the programmer here : http://www.belza.cz/digital/jdm.htm .
To keep things handy , I remade this design in Eagle Cad and attached it to this instructable .
Watch the transistor orientation , one of the footprints may be incorrect ( I made this more than a year ago , I do n't remember anymore ) .
Similarly , my updated JDM2 programmer ( here : https://www.instructables.com/id/EN28KZDDYVEP286GRI/ ) can be used for ICSP by sticking wires into the DIP sockets and connecting them to the target PIC .
***** JDM2s use funky voltages ... connect it to the circuit WITHOUT external power ( or even ground ) connected to the application circuit .
Remove the ICSP connections before applying power .
Failure to do this is not destructive , but will result in failed programming *******
Another option is a ( semi - ) proper ICD programmer .
ICD allows you to control firmware execution on your PIC by setting break points in the code or reading out memory and port values .
An ICD can also animate the execution of code , power the application circuit , and program the PIC .
It does all this through the same 5 pin ICSP connection we have discussed .
Several ICSP clones that you can make yourself can be seen here : http://www.icd2clone.com/wiki/Main_Page .
I built the PiCS ( rev B ) a few months ago and love it .
US troops attack Afghan bus , killing four and wounding 18
By Keith Jones
13 April 2010
US troops opened fire on a passenger bus travelling on a highway in the Zhari District of Afghanistan ’s Kandahar Province early Monday morning , killing at least four people , including a woman and a child .
Eighteen other passengers were wounded .
This latest shooting of civilians by US occupation forces sparked an angry protest .
According to Western news sources , some 200 people blocked the highway near where the shooting occurred .
They burned tires , fired guns in the air , and chanted slogans denouncing the US occupation and the US - installed government of Hamid Karzai .
“ The Americans are constantly killing our civilians and the government is not demanding an explanation , ” protester Mohammad Razaq told the Associated Press .
“ We demand justice from the Karzai government and the punishment of those soldiers responsible . ”
The AP report went on to quote residents of nearby Kandahar City voicing their anger at US and NATO forces ’ disregard for civilian life and demanding that they leave Afghanistan .
“ They say they want to bring security , ” said Haji Zahir .
“ It is all lies , lies .
They kill Afghans .
That is not the way to bring security . ”
NATO , which refused to identify the nationality of the troops that attacked the bus , issued a statement saying it regretted the deaths , but then went on to justify them .
It said that shortly before dawn Monday its troops had opened fire on a “ large vehicle ” as it approached a “ slow - moving ” multi-vehicle “ ISAF route - clearance patrol . ”
NATO forces , the statement asserted , had tried to warn off the approaching vehicle “ once with a flashlight , ” “ three times with flares , ” and finally with hand signals , but “ these were not heeded . ”
Only after bringing the bus to a halt with one or more volleys of gunfire — a BBC video shows the bus ’ windows riddled with bullet holes — did the NATO forces discover that the “ large vehicle ” was a bus .
Eyewitnesses denied this account , saying the bus was trying to stop when it was raked with gunfire .
NATO forces in the Kandahar region , both US and Canadian , have a long and bloody record of opening fire on any vehicle ( truck , car , bus or motorbike ) that they deem has come too close for their safety to be guaranteed .
This practice , which simultaneously expresses the arrogance , fear and colonialist character of the occupation force , has resulted in a mounting toll of civilian deaths .
Interviewed from his hospital bed , the driver of the bus , Esmate , told Agence France Presse that his vehicle was between 70 and 100 meters from the NATO convoy when it came under attack .
“ They opened fire at us , ” he said “ and I fell unconscious .
The people who were killed were sitting in the seats just behind me . ”
Karzai issued a statement that denounced NATO ’s attack on the bus .
“ This shooting , ” said the Afghan president , “ involving a civilian bus violates NATO ’s commitment to safeguard life . ”
In recent weeks , the Afghan president has repeatedly criticized NATO forces in an attempt to placate mounting popular anger against the US - led occupation forces .
He has also been trying to push back at Washington ’s attempts to limit his power and lay the groundwork , by suggesting his regime is unstable , undemocratic and unreliable , for his possible replacement in a US - orchestrated coup .
Earlier this month , NATO conceded that its forces killed five Afghan civilians in a night raid in Gardez in Paktia Province on February 12 .
The five dead included three women , one a pregnant mother of 10 children , and another a pregnant mother of six children .
NATO initially claimed its forces had found the five bound , gagged and already dead , but now admits this was a lie .
An Afghan government investigation found that US Special Forces personnel removed bullets from the bodies of the five in an attempt to cover up that they had murdered them .
NATO is reportedly now investigating this finding .
The night raids mounted by US Special Forces , frequently in conjunction with Afghan security forces , have become infamous in Afghanistan .
A recent report from George Soros ’ Open Society , titled “ Strangers at the Door : Night Raids by International Forces Lose Hearts and Minds of Afghans , ” warned that their barbarity is fueling support for the insurgency .
Afghan compounds are stormed in the middle of the night and their occupants physically abused and their property vandalized .
According to a United Nations report , at least 98 civilians were killed in such raids in 2009 .
The Kandahar bus atrocity comes as US , Canadian and other NATO forces prepare for a major military offensive in the Kandahar region , long a center of the anti-US insurgency and the birthplace of the Taliban .
At present , much of the province , including the environs of Kandahar City , are effectively under Taliban control , especially when night falls .
Speaking at the end of last month , the head of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , declared the impending Kandahar offensive to be the cornerstone of the US - NATO effort to reverse the growing strength of the insurgency , and thus pivotal for the Obama administration ’s entire Afghanistan “ surge ” strategy .
When the current redeployment of US forces to Afghanistan is complete , the US will have almost 100,000 troops in Afghanistan , and the total number of NATO and allied foreign forces will surpass 150,000 , a total significantly greater than the number of Red Army personnel deployed to Afghanistan at the height of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in the 1980s .
Until recently , the counter - insurgency fighting in Kandahar was led by a 3,000 - strong Canadian Armed Forces ( CAF ) contingent .
The Canadian troops remain and are expected to play a major role in the coming Kandahar offensive , but they have been joined by many more thousands of US personnel .
For months , Canada ’s Conservative government has been mounting a campaign of lies and intimidation to cover up its and the CAF ’s complicity in the torture of alleged insurgents by Afghan security forces .
As part of this campaign , the government prorogued parliament for two months earlier this year .
It also sought to tar as a Taliban dupe a Canadian diplomat who testified that the government and military ignored and suppressed his warnings that detainees were being abused .
Richard Colvin further testified that most of those the Canadian military handed over to Afghan security forces for almost certain torture were n’t even insurgents , but poor peasants and other toilers who got caught up in CAF sweeps .
An exposé published in Saturday ’s Globe and Mail has yet again given the lie to the government ’s claims that it long had no reason to believe that Afghan authorities sanctioned torture , and that when it did , it acted to prevent such abuse .
The report reveals that CAF personnel worked hand - in - glove with Brigade 888 , a brutal security force under the command of Asadullah Khalid , who was governor of Kandahar Province from 2005 to 2008 .
The report notes that Canadian soldiers “ lived beside ” Brigade 888 personnel in the Kandahar governor ’s palace and “ helped to train Afghans who routinely committed torture . ”
The report says a “ Canadian official shrugged off a question ” about whether the CAF should have intervened to prevent Brigade 888 from brutalizing prisoners .
But the article makes clear that the CAF leadership knew what Brigade 888 was up to , since the Canadian military was bugging Khalid ’s phone .
“ The [ Canadian ] generals knew exactly what was going on , ” a source told the Globe .
Fact is never as sexy as fiction .
That 's painfully obvious when comparing the in - game looks of some of Japan 's most famous samurai to their real world appearance .

In reality , Ieyasu was a feared and cunning general and adept swordsman who fought in 90 battles .
He became the founder and first shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate .
He was into falconry and had 19 wives and concubines , one of which he had executed .
Quote : " Life is like unto a long journey with a heavy burden .
Let thy step be slow and steady , that thou stumble not .
Persuade thyself that imperfection and inconvenience are the natural lot of mortals , and there will be no room for discontent , neither for despair .
When ambitious desires arise in thy heart , recall the days of extremity thou has past through .
Forbearance is the root of quietness and assurance forever .
Look upon the wrath of the enemy .
If thou knowest only what it is to conquer , and knowest not what it is like to be defeated , woe unto thee ; it will fare ill with thee .
Find fault with thyself rather than with others . "

In reality , Yukimura was a brave and respected warrior known as the " crimson demon of war . "

" First they took the word ' Nueces ' out and began calling it the ' Downtown Bike Boule­vard Project , ' and now with this plan , they 've essentially removed the word ' bike ' as well . "
That was the reaction of Rob D'Amico , president of the League of Bicycling Voters , when the city of Austin 's Public Works Department released its draft plan for a bicycle boulevard through the western side of Downtown on Tuesday .
The first half of his statement is true ­– in the draft , much of the traffic calming and other devices intended to benefit bicyclists have been moved from Nueces Street , as originally proposed late last year , and over to Rio Grande Street .
The second half is up for debate – city bicycle program coordinator Annick Beaudet defended the plan vigorously , and the bicycling community is not necessarily of one voice on the matter .
As for the business owners who opposed the project altogether , their representative did not return phone calls as of press time .
The plan will now work its way through the city 's boards and commissions process and is currently scheduled to go to City Council on May 13 .
Quite different from the plan LOBV offered – which would have removed four - way stops on Nueces and implemented a number of devices including " partial diverters " to discourage through traffic – city staff is recommending the addition of " enhanced " bicycle lanes ( possibly marked with different colors ) along Nueces , from 13th to MLK and Third to Seventh , with " sharrows " ( lanes marked for shared use by cyclists and autos ) between Seventh and 13th .
Also , staff wants the speed limit reduced from 30 mph to 25 mph .
Meanwhile , Rio Grande would see drop - off / pick - up insets for Austin Community College and Pease Elementary , back - in angle parking , a new traffic signal at Fifth , plus speed cushions and other traffic - calming devices .
And there are other elements of the plan that D'Amico does like , such as a new bridge connecting Fourth and Rio Grande to the Shoal Creek Trail and Lance Armstrong Bikeway .
The battle over the boulevard has been intense in recent months , with business owners along Nueces insisting that reducing traffic would harm them , as well as kill off future redevelopment of the area .
The LOBV pointed out that most of the businesses are appointment - oriented and that autos would not actually be banned from the street .
" What once was a vision for defining a key corridor to move Austinites in and out of Downtown by bicycles has turned into a plan for pushing bikes to the side to make sure cars are n't burdened , " D'Amico said .
He said LOBV will now work to get the draft amended in the boards and commissions .
" That could n't be further from the truth , " said Beaudet in response .
" This staff recommendation is responsive to stakeholder input while still creating an amazing bicycle boulevard , an amazing bicycle facility , to preserve and enhance bicycle mobility .
... I am so proud of this recommendation . "
The cycling community was never monolithic in its opinion ; some had touted Rio Grande as the better option all along .
But D'Amico had begun attacking the plan before it was released ( he participated in negotiations over its design ) and was rebuked by Hill Abell , owner of Bicycle Sport Shop .
" After having read it , unlike somebody else that 's been commenting on it for the last couple of days , I 'm in full support of it , " Abell said .
" If you ... read [ in the staff report ] all the reasons that Nueces simply cannot support what would be considered a true bicycle boulevard , it makes perfect sense , because you can't have a bicycle boulevard with traffic levels truly over 3,000 " cars per day .
Abell said that the Austin Cycling Association is reserving judgment on the plan until they 've read it .
The city expects traffic count might increase when Nueces is extended to connect with Cesar Chavez Street as part of the Seaholm project .
Another major factor is that a water line replacement for Nueces is scheduled for 2011 , " making any significant surface infrastructure improvements to Nueces not as attractive as Rio Grande , " according to the report .
" One of the frustrations that I feel and some within the cycling community feel with the LOBV is that they 're simply looking at what 's the very best for bicyclists .
I appreciate that .
That 's where we have to start .
But then we have to be willing to take in input from all the people in our community that will be impacted , " Abell said .
" We started with a concept , and we went through this process , and we came out the other end with a better project , " Beaudet said .
" I stand behind it .
...
We 've done our job as a bike program to provide good bicycle facilities in this area , and we 've also done our job as planners to serve the public interest in listening to all the other stakeholder issues and concerns and other things going on in that area related to development , related to economic growth , related to a lot of things .
I hate to use this analogy , but there 's a lot of spokes in this wheel . "
What kind of reception might the project get at council ?
Council Member Chris Riley – who does n't own a car and cycles to City Hall – has a mixed but generally supportive view of the draft .
He said he supports the Rio Grande improvements , but " I 'd like to see similar improvements on Nueces as well . "
He disagreed with D'Amico , saying , " The recommendations would make the area significantly more bikeable and would go a long way toward achieving the signature facility envisioned in the bike plan . "
The staff 's recommendation and supporting documents can be downloaded at www.cityofaustin.org/publicworks/bicycle-public-input.htm.
It goes before the Urban Transportation Com­mission on Tuesday , April 13 .
The city has shifted bike boulevard plans from Nueces to Rio Grande , with features to include speed cushions and traffic circles .

In this leaked , six - page email , Richard Mollet , the Director of Public Affairs for the British Phonographic Institute ( the UK's record - industry lobbyists ) , sets out the BPI 's strategy for ramming through the Digital Economy Bill , a sweeping , backwards reform to UK copyright law that will further sacrifice privacy and due process in the name of preserving copyright , without actually preserving copyright .
Mollet 's memo , entitled " Digital Economy Bill weekly update 11 March 2010 , " appears to be a weekly status report on the DEB 's progress .
On the CC list are executives from major record labels , staff at IFPI ( the international record industry lobby ) , PR agents from The Open Road , and others I do n't recognise ( if you can identify others on the CC list , please post to the comments ) .
In the memo , Mollet identifies Britain 's top spies as being a stumbling block to the bill 's passage — worried , apparently , that creating a Great Firewall of Britain will make it harder for spies to spy on naughty sites ( someone should tell MI5 about Ipredator , the excellent proxy service from the Pirate Bay ; after all , that 's the same proxy that everyone else in Britain is likely to use to get at the blocked sites if the BPI gets its way ) .
Mollet also implies that Britain 's spy agencies might have paid for a Talk Talk survey in which 71 % of 18 - 34 year olds said that they would simply evade the DEB and go on infringing .
Mollet claims that Britain 's ISPs have already caved into their duties to spy on and censor network connections , claiming that there is a sense of " settled will " in the " ISP community . "
On the other hand , he identifies Members of Parliament as being " resigned " to the fact that they will not be allowed to debate the bill or give it " detailed scrutiny " ( heck of a job , MPs ! ) .
He cites an expert on legislation as saying that the bill will likely die if MPs insist on their right and responsibility to examine this legislation in detail before voting on it .

Contest # 727
A smile etched on his face on a brilliantly sunny day , Toronto FC coach Preki looked as if he did n't have a care in the world as he put his players through their paces during an intense training session .
Yes , TFC have lost their opening two games of the Major League Soccer season by a combined score of 6 - 1 .
Yes , the team committed grievous defensive errors in both contests .
And yes , the club looked positively horrible during the second half of Saturday 's 4 - 1 loss to the New England Revolution .
But there 's no cause for concern , cautioned the Reds coach .
Preki remains optimistic that better results are ahead , starting with Thursday 's home opener against the expansion Philadelphia Union .
The key to turning things around will be for the team to maintain its work ethic , he says .
" I see , day in and day out , that these guys are putting a lot of hard work in here .
They want to be successful .
If I was seeing a different attitude and a different mentality , then certainly I would be worried , " Preki told reporters Wednesday .
Galaxy fought back
He concedes that the club has n't started well , but he also points out that neither did Los Angeles last season — the Galaxy won only two of their first 14 games but ended up finishing first in the Western Conference and reaching the MLS Cup final .
" Let 's not put our heads down because we have two bad results , " Preki said .
" Let 's build on the things that were positive and let 's make sure that , instead of 45 [ minutes ] , we play 90 minutes with the proper attitude and commitment . "
Against the Revolution , TFC dominated and dictated the pace of the game for the opening 45 minutes before captain Dwayne De Rosario scored early in the second half to give the Reds a 1 - 0 lead .
But it went all downhill from there .
Zack Schilawski scored a hat trick in 13 minutes and Sainey Nyassi notched his first goal of the season as the Revolution embarrassed the Toronto squad .
Still , the game was n't a complete writeoff , according to Preki .
" We have to take a lot of positives from the first half of the game and forget about the 15 minutes of nightmare from the second half .
If we can build on the first half , we 're on the right track , " Preki said .
The team 's opening 2 - 0 loss to the Columbus Crew and last week 's game were marred by defensive errors .
Silly mistakes by veteran Nick Garcia and rookie Nane Joseph led directly to goals by the Revolution and killed any momentum TFC had .
What does the team have to do to make sure similar goofs do n't happen against the Union ?
" It 's [ about ] individual responsibility .
You can't cut those things out unless every individual takes that responsibility and says , ' Look , I have cut these mistakes out . '
And if they do n't , then we have to move things around , " the coach explained .
Defenders Adrian Cann and Maksim Usanov , signed by the club earlier this week , could see action Thursday , as could Jacob Peterson .
Acquired in an off - season - trade with the Colorado Rapids , Peterson has been sidelined with a knee injury since September .
But Preki said the young winger is on the mend and could be on the bench for Thursday 's game , depending on whether he is cleared to play by the team trainer .
Collaborative Bike Routes
Have you heard about any good bike routes lately ?
Would you prefer to have things planned out in detail as you ride the City ?
Or do you prefer finding your bearings from a map and / or exploring your way around by the seat of your pants like you did as a Kid ?
Do you prefer navigating by street signs , by the Sun , or some instinctive combination of the two ?
Do you ever get abit ‘ lost ‘ to discover something unexpected !
If you ’re looking for inspiring new reasons to ride your bike , then Network technology is already available to help re-create the kind of social intelligence that we just shared socially and incidentally as kids when it came to finding our way around !
Nowadays we almost take for granted the tools that would have seemed almost space - aged years ago , even compared to the occasional appearance of bulky walkie - talkies , or the first digital speedometers , otherwise there were always a few quarters for payphones and videogames to fill teh ‘ technology gap ’ .
What would we have thought then of the greatly extended reach that we know now with our mobile devices , the added and shared value of Social Network tools , and of course the superb mapping that ’s now available online .
In fact , here in the Future ( arriving as recently as this past month ) Toronto is now ‘ on the map ’ at Ride the City and we can now consider how to re-socialize bike riding in a significant way .
What ’s more , is that by using the Community feedback methods and social interactions that are available on this site to suggest ideal paths and warn against riskier routes , we might also be reminded all over again of how effectively we managed to get around as fun-loving and free - spirited kids , and regain abit of that joie de vie that came with our freedom to ride .
Often armed with nothing more than some small change for snacks , and a general sense of direction passed on from someone who ’d been there before !
As urban Cyclists nowadays , we still enjoy a level of flexibility and freedom to travel like no other mode of transport , and now thanks to social media tools like cellphones ( ‘ smart ’ or otherwise ) and online maps we can also share our collective knowledge about routes , roadways , ( and shortcuts ! ) like never before as well .
So let ’s consider where we came from , and learn about what we might have forgotten since we were kids , and perhaps even discover some exciting new possibilities along the way .
Since we ’re already doing this unconsciously whenever we set on on a ride , let ’s first consider how we derive a travel plan for ourselves .
Even if the plan get ’s thrown out , forgotten , or dynamically re-mapped en route , a good place to start is to at least consider a final destination , with a few fun stops along the way .
Just as when we were kids , we often learn about new destinations or routes from others who ’ve been there first .
So when it comes to making up a riding plan , there ’s alot of value in being able to compare ideas and suggestions with others , to determine their relative merits .
This is especially true for a collective repository of information that can grow and adapt according to the shared experiences of like - minded individuals .
At one time you had to depend on word of mouth to collectively share info , but with an increasingly well - socialised Internet , we ’re starting to see some great new ways to share information on any subject , with larger groups than ever before .
Take for example the growing network of info available at Ride the City , or in the newly released Google Bike Maps ( if you live in the Bay Area ) .
One of the primary functions of Ride the City is to offer alternate routes according to your level of comfort and safety that ’s required , so it ’s a great tool for new cyclists who are still getting comfortable with urban riding , and would like to trade speed / time for security and comfort .
This is done by punching in your starting and destination points , and then selecting one of three route - types for yourself ( Direct , Safe and Safer ) according to your preference for riding on quieter streets and designated bike paths .
As co-founder Jordan Anderson explains , “ the main difference between these three categories involves how far someone ’s willing to go out of his way for safety . ”
The system allows for “ custom directions ” pages that you can share , and is open to feedback by offering “ ratings ” on routes , and accepting suggested alternate routes if the rating is negative , thus allowing the routes to incrementally ( and hopefully ) improve themselves over time , This is where we hope to slowly see technology imitate real life , as we collectively share our real world experience with each other , and collectively optimize these routes for best results .
Just as we did anecdotaly with each other as kids .
Although this looks like a pretty cool adaptation of the static Google Maps approach to planning a route ( and it includes Bike Repair / Rental Shops along the way , for an added commercial value ! ) , there are still lots of areas of improvement of course .
For example , the ‘ route rating ’ mechanism is n’t terribly visible , and is nowhere near as socially interactive as ( let ’s say ) a group of Riders standing around discussing their best options before setting out .
Although Ride the City is certainly still much more graphically useful than finding / sharing a paper map , or just naming streets and turns .
So far though it still looks rather difficult to suggest alternate routes or shortcuts that involve laneways , railway lines , field crossings , and other little semi-legal little ‘ tricks ’ from our childhood rides , but at least it ’s a great start !
So whether you grew up in the alleyways of a big city , or the sleepy backroads of a small town , your bike can still be a passport to adventure and exploration that will always offer you chances to discover new places if you ’re able to tap into a shared store of information , and take a few chances along the way .
Why not try a new route today !
WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT ABOUT socialism lately , particularly from the right .
If we believed for one moment anything we heard from Fox News or Rush Limbaugh or the average Republican politician , we would think that the country had ceased to be a democracy because health care reform was in danger of passing Congress by a majority vote .
I wo n't quibble about definitions — the word " socialism " has been used in such a wide variety of ways by such a wide variety of people that it 's obvious fodder for the usual right - wing conflations .
But I do think that it 's important to think about some of the basic assumptions behind the rhetoric — assumptions about what it means to be ordinary decent human beings .
We humans are a social species .
We are no more designed to live as islands unto ourselves than ants or bees .
We have always lived in communities .
In prehistoric times we were hunter gatherers ; we lived together in groups , and we survived by protecting each other , by sharing food , and by sharing work .
We took care of each other .
We also guarded our freedom within the group .
While our fellow primates were developing hierarchical social structures — where one dominant ape , for example , would hog most of the mates and a lion 's share of the resources — humans were developing structures that spread resources around the group , while preserving individual freedom .
When a group needed to make a community decision , it was made by the group as a whole .
Different groups managed this in different ways , but in general the big decisions were made by a process that involved everyone .
It was a nice balance — a society that provided a good amount of security , a good amount of liberty , and kept a few freeloaders from impoverishing everyone else .
And it 's important to note what our ancestors knew : the potential freeloaders you have to worry about are n't the lazy hunter , or the shirking gatherer .
The damage they do is limited , they are n't all that common , and they eventually get their comeuppance in the normal course of human interactions .
They are n't respected , and they do n't do all that well in the end .
No — the freeloader you need to worry about is the one who manages to consolidate his power , to create a situation where really unfair proportions of the society 's resources land on his plate as a matter of course , and to convince everyone to simply take that for granted , as though it were his due .
The freeloader you need to worry about is the king ape — and human societies guarded against him with a special fervor .
This kind of society — the natural society of human beings — was a form of socialism and a form of democracy .
It was a way to guarantee political equality , a way to nurture prosperity , a way to guard individual freedom .
And it 's an innate part of our make - up as human beings .
But around the time of the agricultural revolution something got out of balance .
But more about that next time ...
Virginia consumer - protection officials have warned the wife of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas that her advocacy group is improperly soliciting contributions in the state .
In a letter to Virginia Thomas on Thursday , the state Office of Consumer Affairs directed Liberty Central Inc. to the Virginia law that requires groups to register with the office or request an exemption before seeking donations for a charitable purpose .
Liberty Central is a Virginia - based group soliciting contributions online and is not registered or exempt , said Michael Wright , the manager of regulatory programs at the Office of Consumer Affairs , a branch of the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services .
Under state law , political advocacy is considered a charitable purpose .
“ They should be filed with us , ” he said .
Thomas is the president and chief executive of Liberty Central , a nonprofit group hoping to mobilize conservatives online .
The group , which is aiming to appeal to small - government “ tea party ” activists , was incorporated in Delaware in January and is registered with the Virginia State Corporation Commission .
Thomas has said the group intends to seek donations from individuals and corporations .
It also plans to issue score cards for members of Congress and be involved in the November election , although Thomas has not specified how .
Liberty Central national coordinator Sue Hamblen said Thursday she was not aware of the registration issue and would be looking into it .
Soliciting donations for a charitable purpose without registering with the Office of Consumers Affairs could result in fines of up to $ 5,000 for each violation , the letter said .
Wright said it was not unusual for a group to be unaware of the Virginia law .

‘ Act of God ’ will not wash with the European Commission .
Even though the volcanic ash eruption over much of Europe was the work of nature , Brussels has warned companies forced to ground planes that air passenger rights must be respected .
Consumer rights groups said compliance with the rules has been low , and even urged government sanctions against shirkers .
Jilted travellers have the right to a ticket refund with all taxes or rerouted alternative transport , the right to accommodation and to be fed if they are delayed .
A European Commission spokeswoman said : “ They are not negotiable , and we expect airlines to enforce them , and we expect national authorities to do their job and watch to make sure the situation — that the laws are enforced … and we at the European level are watching the situation very carefully . ”
The airlines ’ association IATA complain they ’re enough out of pocket already : more than 1.2 billion euros .
The International Air Transport Association said :
“ We estimated the airlines were losing 200 million dollars a day in revenues .
And that was a conservative number because it was related to a limited number of hubs . ”
IATA acknowledged that , even under extraordinary circumstances , the EU holds airlines responsible for paying for hotels , meals and telephoning .
Many passengers are still stuck .

SCO could appeal and may continue to pursue its case against IBM
On Tuesday , a jury in Utah sided with Novell in its long - running legal dispute with SCO .
" This decision is good news for Novell , for Linux , and for the open source community , " Novell wrote on its Web site .
The jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah ruled that Novell owns Unix copyrights that SCO has tried to assert as its own .
Pamela Jones , a paralegal who has closely followed the SCO v. Novell case since its beginning on her Groklaw blog , initially deemed this the end of the line .
" It 's over , " she wrote on her site .
However , SCO could appeal the ruling .
Also , as Jones noted later on her blog , a SCO spokesman told The Salt Lake Tribune that the company would continue its related lawsuit against IBM .
SCO may drop the copyright infringement charges regarding Unix in the IBM case , but SCO has other claims related to contracts that it can assert against IBM , the spokesman is quoted as saying .
SCO 's main telephone line went unanswered on Tuesday afternoon and the company had not posted a statement on its Web site .
SCO has lost many rulings in the dispute over the past couple of years .
Linux users closely watch the case because they worry that if SCO prevails , they could face legal action too .
The battle dates back to 2003 when SCO sued IBM , claiming that it had violated SCO 's rights by contributing Unix code to Linux .
The following year , SCO sued Novell , saying that it falsely claimed rights to Unix .
EIA Washington produces a ton of energy data that ’s very current and detailed on global energy production .
But what ’s harder to come by is Non-OECD oil and oil product consumption .
As the calendar turns to March , alot of the annual data starts to complete for the prior years , and I found my way deep into some EIA caverns tonight , and drew up the following chart :
The chart shows total oil product use for Brazil , India , and California in quadrillion BTU .
Oil products are best measured in BTU –not barrels–as it strips out the vagaries of different products like Jet Fuel , Gasoline , Diesel , and Heating Oil .
Also , BTU can be a better way to compare countries that import barrels , with states that generally import oil products .
Here , I wanted to compare California with fast growing Brazil and India over a twenty year period .
The trajectories are fairly unsurprising .
Fuel efficiency standards have helped to keep California consumption relatively in check , in its path from 3.543 quadrillion BTU in 1988 to 2007 ’s 3.946 quadrillion BTU .
With regards to Brazil and India , a friend chatting to me from China tonight remarked that Brazil ’s consumption growth might have been somewhat restrained by its ethanol program .
If that ’s true , it ’s intriguing to conjecture what Brazil ’s demand would look like without ethanol ’s roughly 17 % contribution to total Brazilian liquid fuel use .
And in regards to India , one can’t help but note the big spike from 2004 - 2007 as demand moved from 4.950 to 5.869 quadrillion BTU and not recall India ’s push to complete their Quadrilateral Highway .
An ongoing project of mine relates to per capita consumption of energy in the developing world –yet another difficult area where data can be hard to secure on a current basis .
There are a number of issues at play on that topic .
Not least of which is the very different marginal utility of liquid energy in the developing world , compared to the developed world .
As I look at today ’s chart , however , I am struck by something simpler : the differences in population .
India ’s population is 1.139 billion , and Brazil ’s 191.9 million .
California is lilliputian by comparison , at 36 million .
But it ’s oil consumption is not .
This only confirms my view that we ( continue to ) underestimate the demand reduction for oil that ’s inevitable in the developed world , and the awesome potential for further demand increases in the developing world .

KENK : Our Property Is n’t Protected
Back in the Summer of 2008 the world changed in a big way for alot of people , but most especially for the infamous Igor Kenk .
For years , this ill - reputed merchant and bike - mechanic had been notorious not just for his rumored deeds and corrosively incisive views on Society , but also as a magnetic force for street urchins and anyone else who felt disenfranchised in a world driven by the pursuit of happiness through possessions and consumption .
In his visible role as a raving misfit on the edge of a bustling Queen West scene in Toronto , and a sneering purveyor of cheap transportation to anyone who would doubt his wisdom , Kenk became personified as twisted street prophet .
Foretelling doom for Western Culture with its unbridled growth through the exploitation of resources , and the fallacies of credit / debt fueled economic expansion at all costs .
Then , just as the markets were starting their tumble , Kenk was finally arrested …
After years of apparent apathy by the Toronto Police Service , the law finally cracked down on him with a single sting operation .
This raid not only served notice to Toronto ’s Citizens ( and bike thieves ) that the police were suddenly eager to make a big public splash with their newfound interest in bike theft , but the raid also set off a legal chain of events that would make a very critical point of Canadian Law more obvious to anyone who was interested in why Kenk actually forfeited his stash of bikes .
Namely , that the Civil Remediation Act ( CRA ) shows us that none of us actually hold any inalienable rights to own or posses our property .
Although the seizure of Kenks own “ property ” was widely supported by a Public thirst for blood and retribution , since it was all presumed to be stolen anyhow , this case also demonstrated that the Canadian Constitution does NOT make direct provisions for ANYBODY to have any rights to the property that most people pursue in the course of their lives !
As Igor Kenk soon found out , what almost all Canadians still presume to be their defensible right to own property is in fact a legally supported illusion .
Ownership of belongings is a virtual / legal relationship between you and your possessions that the law supports only indirectly , and which it can revoke at any time under many open - ended provisions .
In this case , under a piece of provincial civil law called the Civil Remediation Act ( CRA ) … A law meant to seize assets from criminals , but which does n’t even require a conviction , or even a preliminary hearing in order to be enacted upon !
This legal brainchild is modeled in principal on the Proceeds of Crime
Act that was originally conceived to serve in the War on Drugs south of the border , and meant to recover legal costs for victims .
That this concept was invented in the same country that gave the world over - leveraged credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations , should be of no immediate concern , but rest assured that more research will be come to light as we look to the Land of the Free for any fallout from such legal strategies .
in the meantime , let ’s see how this card plays itself in Ontario
Here in Canada , to circumvent the Federal mandate over Criminal Law , this little known legal maneuver is actually enacted at he Provincial level under Civil Law .
This powerful legal playing card might have become more obvious to the Public during the lengthy Kenk Saga , however the criminal drama being played out upstaged this Civil technicality , and the results were just perceived to be a thief losing his stolen property .
Realistically , at that point most people were also too busy staying afloat after the financial world nearly capsized under the weight of poorly secured credit , which was exacerbated by the derivative driven greed of bankers , financiers , and property managers .
While most people watched value evaporate off of their own bank statements , and debated liquidating their remaining assets , nobody was actually taking much notice of any subtle details of what the word “ property ” actually meant in teh eyes of the Law … Especially in a highly leveraged world where ‘ book value ’ could be erased overnight anyhow .
Some Sociopaths will bank on the gradual collapse of civilization by investing in Petrochemical Giants , and the security / military suppliers that support those interests .
Other degenerates will hoard bikes , and trade in scrap metal .
While others will simply presume that cash is a worthless symbol , and count on the collapse of monetary systems through the accumulation of gold , to assure their survival against the end of life as we know it .
Meanwhile , the CFO ’s of Auto - Giants , Banks , and Utility companies were content to simply wrap themselves in TARP funds , or cash in on the Publicly funded bailouts or blue - collar incentives in order to suddenly start scrapping old cars and fridges , digging up our roadways , and upgrading privately held Public infrastructure via the Public Purse , in order to stimulate the purchase of new cars or “ energy saving ” appliances with the proceeds .
Through this almost religious re-affirmation of the need to purchase and posses ( for the good of the economy no less ! ) there was one important fact about our basic property rights that almost everybody ( but Igor Kenk and a handful of legal professionals ) have remained entirely oblivious to …
Would you like to learn about why the Government can seize your property even if you have n’t been convicted of a crime ?
Or do you think that this provision in the law can only impact a criminal ?

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN Friday that Israel 's announcement of new settlement construction in disputed territory in East Jerusalem was " insulting " to the United States .
The Israeli announcement came during Vice President Joe Biden 's visit this week to Israel .
It complicated U.S. efforts to set up so - called proximity talks between the Israelis and Palestinians , the latest attempt to nudge the two sides back toward talking directly .

However , in recent years , there has been a large number of designers and developers who have begun to offer a more interactive way to teach design and development … enter the screencast .
Screencasts , in the design and development industry , are primarily focus on tutorials and methodology used in designing , coding , or organizing a website ( or element of a website ) .¬†
They offer an alternative to those pages and pages of steps and diagrams found in your typical print tutorial .
It is one thing to follow these steps but watching someone else create and teach takes learning about design to another level .
You can pick up on many of the intricacies of a designer ’s process by watching them design via a screencast .
Little workflow secrets are lurking everywhere and just seeing someone work through a design task can open up the door to tools and techniques that you may not experiment with by just reading it on a blog .
Screencasts also allow the producer to connect with the audience on another level .
You feel more engaged by watching a screencast and hearing the designer explain why they do this versus why they do that .

Sarah Palin Has Earned an Estimated $ 12 Million Since July
The ex-governor 's haul from TV , books and speaking gigs may be even bigger .
Apr. 13 , 2010  --
Pundits can debate the political costs and benefits of Sarah Palin 's decision to step down as Alaska governor , but the monetary advantages of leaving her $ 125,000 - a- year public service post are beyond dispute .
Since leaving office at the end of July 2009 , the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee has brought in at least 100 times her old salary – a haul now estimated at more than $ 12 million -- through television and book deals and a heavy schedule of speaking appearances worth five and six figures .
That conservative estimate is based on publicly available records and news accounts .
The actual number is probably much higher , but is hard to quantify because Palin does not publicize her earnings .
She reputedly got a $ 7 million deal for her first book , with the bulk of that money due after her resignation as governor , and will earn about $ 250,000 per episode , according to the web site The Daily Beast , for each of eight episodes of a reality show about Alaska for the The Learning Channel .
She has managed to keep a lid on reliable figures for her earnings from a multi- year contract with Fox News and a second book deal with HarperCollins .
A Palin aide responding to questions from ABC News said the governor " is now a private citizen .
As a result , her fees and earnings are private . "
While book and television royalties are huge earners , Palin , 46 , has taken on a breakneck schedule of public speaking engagements , booked through the Washington Speakers Bureau .
Her typical fee is $ 100,000 , according to a January report in Politico , though she accepts a somewhat smaller fee for events on the West Coast because they are easier to get to from Alaska .
Speakers Bureau officials did not respond to emailed questions .
Speaking fees have long provided a steady income to big - name elected officials who have left the political main stage .
President Reagan once got $ 2 million from a Japanese manufacturing company for two 20 - minute speeches .
Bill Clinton collected some $ 40 million in speaking fees during the six years following his presidency .
And George W. Bush told reporters he expected to make a " ridiculous " amount of money on the speaker 's circuit when he left office .
But for Palin , who by some accounts is still nurturing a political career and possible 2012 presidential bid , the decision of when to charge for her appearances and when to headline an event for free is proving nettlesome .
And it has turned into grist for controversy .
She did not charge fellow Tea Party favorite Michele Bachmann for an appearance at a fundraiser in Minnesota last week , for instance .
And she has indicated that she will not collect fees for speeches at certain charitable functions .
At the same time , a report in the Hamilton Spectator quoted organizers who said she would be paid " in the ballpark " of $ 200,000 to speak at a fundraising dinner for the Juravinski Cancer Center and St. Peter 's Hospital outside of Toronto .
One of the event organizers , Gabe Macaluso , told the Spectator that landing Palin was " quite the coup . "
The appearance brought a local backlash – the newspaper conducted a non-scientific online survey asking readers if they would pay to see her ?
More than 1,600 voted and 90 per cent said no .
But the charity event , with tickets running $ 200 , sold out .
Palin's $ 100,000 tab for a Nashville speech to Tea Party activists in February was cited in a lawsuit against organizers by the man who provided a $ 50,000 down payment for the expense , but who then was not permitted to attend .
Bill Hemrick , a wealthy conservative and founder of the Upper - Deck baseball trading card company , told ABC News the suit against Tea Party Nation founder Judson Phillips is still awaiting a response .
Palin later said her fee would go to charity .
In California , state lawmakers have criticized officials at California State University , Stanislaus , for agreeing to pay an estimated $ 75,000 to Palin so she can keynote a fundraiser for the school .
And when they asked the university to provide the details of the contract with Palin , university officials refused because they said the contract included a confidentiality provision .
" Money that is spent on bringing an out - of - touch former politician to campus could be spent on scholarships and other financial assistance during these challenging budget times , " said state Sen.
Leland Yee , a San Francisco Democrat .
Yee 's chief of staff , Adam Keigwin , told ABC News that the senator has called on the state attorney general 's office to force the university to disclose how much is being spent to bring Palin to the school .
University officials have remained defiant .
University Vice President Susana Gajic - Bruyea sent an email March 29 to students defending the choice .
" The board wanted to bring a keynote speaker who would attract significant interest and , therefore , drive ticket sales , " she wrote .
" Sarah Palin is that type of speaker , whether or not people agree with her politics , and we expect this event to be a tremendous fund - raising success . "

Hepatotoxicity associated with the use of Herbalife Lifrarskaði tengdur notkun á Herbalife
: Many herbal products are known to be hepatotoxic .
In a recent survey in Iceland concerning adverse reactions related to herbal medicines , Herbalife products were implicated in the majority of the reported cases of hepatotoxicity .
Methods :
The clinical presentations of five cases of Herbalife related liver injury during the period of 1999 - 2008 are analysed .
Causality was assessed by using the WHO - UMC system for causality assessment and the RUCAM method .
Results :
Of the five cases there were four females and one male ; median age was 46 years ( range 29 - 78 ) .
Herbalife had been used for 1 to 7 months prior to presentation .
Four patients presented with a hepatocellular and one with a cholestatic reaction .
Median values were for bilirubin 190 mmol / L ( range : 26-311 ; ref. < 20 mmol/L ) , ALP 407 U/L ( range : 149-712 ; ref. 35-105 U/L ) and ALT 24 87 U/L ( range : 456-2637 ; ref. 70 and 45 U/L for males and females , respectively ) .
Liver biopsy was performed in 2 patients and was consistent with toxic hepatitis in both cases .
Other causes of hepatitis were excluded by appropriate serological testing and ultrasound .
Causality assessment according to RUCAM was probable in three cases and possible in two .
Using the WHO - UMC criteria causality was certain in one case , probable in two and possible in two cases .
Conclusions : Hepatotoxicity is probably associated with the use of Herbalife products .
Hepatotoxicity due to herbal remedies is an important differential diagnosis in the diagnostic work - up of liver injury .

An excellent point from an unusual source :
Those who form the majority population of a territory will rule that territory , no matter how powerful a ruling elite may be .
They will determine its culture and society .
A majority - European population will create a society that reflects European values and norms .
A majority - African population will create a society that reflects African norms .
If the Boers had inhabited and worked their own land rather than rely on black labor , the states they created might still be strong and independent today .
Their decision to use non-white labor was a critical error that undid all of the sacrifices of the early pioneers .
The only way to maintain a civilization is for the majority to occupy its own land with its own people , and to do its own manual labor .
American Renaissance
Racism is the belief that some people should be your servants because of their race .
It leads to slavery , or a kind of outcaste serfdom , and eventually , demographic ruin .
Nationalism is the belief that each nation needs its own ethnicity , bonded to its own culture , to resist capitalism and communism and other “ hands free ” methods of self - regulation .
Even more than nationalism is the knowledge that among an ethnic group , people need to be roughly equal in ability — or class war breaks out .
People who have radically lower ability will be unable to compete , and they ’ll counterattack with charges of oppression , whether true or not .
An ideal nation would consist of people of roughly similar ability and health and beauty , thus eliminating the strain of those with less being irate at those gifted by nature with more .
That would be the realistic version of the “ equality ” liberals like to talk about ; you ca n’t apply reality after the fact , or you end up hobbling the strong to preserve the weak .
That does n’t sound bad until you think about society as an organism which must thrive or machine which must keep going .
If you have a fleet of one thousand cars , you do n’t sell off the new flawless ones and keep the junkers .
If you have a field of trees , you do n’t kill the healthy ones so you can nourish the runts .
You pick the best and make more of them .
That is how societies rise .
Against that idea , there are many dumb ideas which have a common root : wanting to deny reality .
One of the dumbest of these ideas is that you can find nearby humans , discover they ’re dumb , and use them as disposable labor , and not have it come back to bite you in the hindquarters .

With all the services that are being transferred overseas , should we be surprised that an enterprising company has sought to tantalize university professors with the prospect of having the grading of their students ’ term papers outsourced ?
An article on the Web site of The Chronicle of Higher Education opens with the story of Lori Whisenant , a business professor at the University of Houston .
The article says that Ms. Whisenant ’s seven teaching assistants can’t process the hundreds of thousands of words being churned out each semester by her students .
And so , the reporter , Audrey Williams June , goes on to write , Ms. Whisenant “ outsourced assignment grading to a company whose employees are mostly in Asia . ”
The story continues :
Virtual - T.A. , a service of a company called EduMetry Inc. , took over .
The goal of the service is to relieve professors and teaching assistants of a traditional and sometimes tiresome task — and even , the company says , to do it better than T.A. ’s can .
The graders working for EduMetry , based in a Virginia suburb of Washington , are concentrated in India , Singapore and Malaysia , along with some in the United States and elsewhere .
They do their work online and communicate with professors via e-mail .
The company advertises that its graders hold advanced degrees and can quickly turn around assignments with sophisticated commentary , because they are not juggling their own course work , too .
The company argues that professors freed from grading papers can spend more time teaching and doing research .
One obvious question : what did the professor think of the graders ’ comments on those papers ?
The reporter writes :
Sometimes professors want changes in the nature of the comments .
Ms. Whisenant found those on her students ’ papers initially ‘ way too formal , ’ she says .
‘ We wanted our feedback to be conversational and more direct .
So we sent them examples of how we wanted it done , and they did it . ’
Professors give final grades to assignments , but the assessors score the papers based on the elements in the rubric and ‘ help students understand where their strengths and weaknesses are , ’ says Tara Sherman , vice president of client services at EduMetry .
‘ Then the professors can give the students the help they need based on the feedback . ’
The Choice regularly gets comments from professors , and so we ask the academics among our readers — as well as students and parents , for that matter — what do you think of this idea ?

A likely interest rate hike in July by the Bank of Canada and growing demand for Canadian investments will propel the loonie past the U.S. dollar by the summer , according to a growing chorus of economists predicting parity .
Luckily for investors , the recent rise of currency - hedged ETFs will make it much easier to maintain foreign positions in 2010 while navigating through volatile exchange rates .
Avery Shenfeld , chief economist with CIBC World Markets , was the latest economist to weigh in , saying in a report the Canadian dollar will reach US $ 1.02 by September , before dropping to US97 ¢ by year ’s end .
“ If as we expect , the Bank is out in front of the U.S. Federal Reserve by a couple of quarters , a higher Canadian dollar will help tighten monetary conditions , ” Mr. Shenfeld said in a new strategy report .
“ It ’s easy to see the Canadian dollar running a few cents through parity after the first hike , ” Mr. Shenfeld said .
Currency strategists such as Camilla Sutton with Scotia Capital have also been vocal in their bullishness , forecasting parity for the loonie in recent months .
And considering the loonie has been on a surge lately , it could reach parity before summer .
Since a low of US94.29 ¢ on Feb. 25 the loonie has roared back for a gain of more than 3 ¢ in the past two weeks , reaching as high as US97.86 ¢ on Wednesday .
Terry Shaunessy , president of Calgary - based Shaunessy Investment Counsel Inc. , said he recommends clients take a 100 % hedged position through ETFs when it comes to foreign investments , especially in this atmosphere .
“ Really , why take the risk if you do n’t have to ? ” he said .
“ In my 30 years as a portfolio manager , I ’ve never seen such incredible volatility in the Canadian - U.S. dollar exchange rate that I can’t explain , so forget it .
I do n’t need that headache . ”
He suggests ETFs such as the iShares Canadian Russell 2000 Index ( TSX : XSU ) or the iShares Canadian S&P 500 ( XSP ) , both hedged under the Canadian dollar .
Another option is the BMO Nasdaq 100 Equity Hedged to CAD Index ETF .
Meanwhile Barry Schwartz , a partner at Baskin Financial Services Inc. , said his firm is betting on the loonie to soar beyond parity as the United States will likely maintain a weak greenback .
“ We have essentially no foreign holdings for our clients right now , ” he said .
“ Right now if you ’re going to buy a foreign stock you have to be 10 % or 15 % smarter because if the Canadian dollar does go up you ’re in the hole . ”
Baskin Financial deals only with specific equities , so Mr. Schwartz advises investors looking to protect themselves to avoid companies that have more than about 75 % of their operations outside Canada .
For example , convenience store and gas - bar chain Alimentation Couche - Tard Inc. gets 78 % of its revenues from the United States , he said .
Mr. Schwartz added that he would begin to consider U.S. investments if the loonie moved past 10 % above parity .
On the other hand , Adrian Mastracci , president with KCM Wealth Management Inc. , called hedging a double - edged sword .
“ It ’s the risk that brings the return , ” he said .
“ The only time you get hit is maybe in the short term .
But if you leave it , you can let it ride and take the ups and downs . ”

BELLEVILLE , Ont. — Col. Russell Williams allegedly broke into multiple homes in Eastern Ontario , including that of a women he is charged with later killing and the residence of another women he allegedly sexually assaulted .
Some of the homes in the region were broken into repeatedly over a number of days , others over a period of a few months , with all the break ins happening over a three - year period .
They happened in Ottawa , Belleville , Brighton and Tweed — places located within a few kilometres of where Williams , the former top commander at Canadian Forces Base Trenton , had lived or worked .
These new details emerged Thursday after the Ontario Provincial Police charged the 47 - year - old air force colonel with 82 new break - and - enter , theft or attempted break - and - enter charges .
In all , there are 46 counts in Tweed , 34 counts in Ottawa and two counts in Belleville .
These charges are in addition to the two counts of first - degree murder Williams is facing in connection to the deaths of Cpl. Marie - France Comeau , 37 , a military flight attendant from Brighton , Ont. , and Jessica Lloyd , 27 , of Belleville and two counts of sexual assault charges linked to two home invasions in Tweed .
In those cases , Williams is accused of blindfolding the women , tying them naked to their chairs , photographing and sexually assaulting them .
Police on Thursday would not confirm what was taken during these burglaries , but earlier reports said the break - ins targeted women 's lingerie , revealing a possible stalking pattern in the once - celebrated military officer .
One woman in Ottawa told Global News that her lingerie was stolen during a break - in last November , when her daughter was house - sitting .
By the time police arrived , they found a smashed side door but no sign of a suspect .
Another woman in Tweed , a heavily wooded town where Williams owned a cottage , said her house had been burglarized a number of times in the last few years .
And even though she never figured out what was stolen , the experiences shook her up enough to buy a large guard dog .
On Thursday , Williams made his third court appearance in Belleville , Ont .
A packed courtroom , with some observers forced to stand , watched as the colonel , dressed in an orange jumpsuit , appeared on a TV screen from the Quinte Detention Centre where he has been in custody since his arrest on Feb .
7 .
He stood straight , appeared serious and replied clearly that his name was " David Russell Williams " when asked to do so by the judge .
Through his legal counsel , he requested that the new charges against him not be read aloud in court but did not give a reason why .
The judge complied with the request .
Williams , who appeared thinner but still healthy , looked sullen as he thanked the judge once the brief proceedings were over .
He has not entered a plea on any of the charges and the case has been adjourned until June 24 .
Lt. -Col .
Tony O'Keeffe attended the proceedings Thursday , representing the Canadian Forces .
O'Keeffe , who has known Williams for years , had visited him 10 days ago but did not ask him about the hunger strike or reported suicide attempt he had made during the Easter weekend .
UPDATE : 19 MAR 2010 : Given the debate on China and its currency peg , I thought this post from November 2008 would be relevant .
It called for a new world order centered around a new monetary system .
This idea has gained some currency as it is a chief aim of the Chinese going forward .
One big problem with the present set up is the Triffin Dilemma .
The dollar ’s role as a national currency with any domestic agenda of a balanced current account is fundamentally at odds with its role as the world ’s reserve currency .
Especially post - Asian crisis , the desire by many was to accumulate US dollar reserves and that means running a capital account deficit / current account surplus with the US .
The current account imbalances become problematic during downturns and lead to protectionism , as I argued in my third post at Credit Writedowns just over two years ago .
Below , I argue that only true economic turmoil and depression will bring people to the table .
The original article is below , posted on 12 Nov 2008 at 11:00 .
A good related article is The ultimate G - 20 plan for a new monetary system : Paul Davidson
This Friday and Saturday , the leaders of the world ’s largest nations are to meet in Washington at a summit of the G - 20 members in order to develop a framework for extricating us from the worst financial crisis in 75 years .
Expectations are not high .
Although the crisis threatens to deepen , most pundits do not believe the G - 20 can agree because their national agendas are so different .
Right now , we are presented with an historic opportunity to create a new economic world order .
However , it is unlikely that this opportunity will be seized .
Failure could mean a more severe crisis and economic chaos of the most severe kind .
In this post , I will explain what sort of an agreement could work to restore some semblance of order and whether we may ultimately get to this framework .
Much of what I write here regarding fiat currencies , gold and inflation is unknown to the public at large even though the information is freely available .
If more people informed themselves about economic history , we would be much better off economically .
Who are the G - 20 ?
The G - 20 is generally used as a proxy to represent the most inclusive list of the world ’s economic leaders .
It is not all encompassing — large , rich countries like Spain are not represented .
However , it does bring together most of the major players .
Below is a description of the organization from its own website .
The members of the G - 20 are the finance ministers and central bank governors of 19 countries : Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Mexico , Russia , Saudi Arabia , South Africa , South Korea , Turkey , the United Kingdom and the United States of America .
The European Union is also a member , represented by the rotating Council presidency and the European Central Bank .
To ensure global economic fora and institutions work together , the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the President of the World Bank , plus the chairs of the International Monetary and Financial Committee and Development Committee of the IMF and World Bank , also participate in G - 20 meetings on an ex-officio basis .
Therefore , a meeting of this group should be of great significance and lead to major outcomes to set us on the right path to dealing with the credit crisis .
However , I am less optimistic about the prospect of a meaningful agreement toward eliminating global structural imbalances .
Many nations have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo – the United States principal amongst them .
Moreover , the U.S. is led by an administration that is just 2 months from its end .
And , we probably have not seen enough carnage to force the relevant parties into developing a new framework .
This will only happen at a figurative economic gunpoint .
The existing global economic framework
The existing economic structure came into being as a result of a 1971 decision by the Nixon administration to close the gold window ending the Bretton Woods framework that had lasted from 1944 .
This framework is based on floating exchange rates with the U.S. Dollar acting as the system ’s effective anchor and world ’s reserve currency .
What the U.S. dollar as the world ’s reserve currency has meant is that the United States Government effectively sets the standard on monetary policy .
Other nations , holding most of their reserves in dollars , must follow the U.S. if they want to maintain a relatively stable currency peg to the U.S. dollar .
And , that gives the U.S. government a license to print money and inflate .
Therefore , the United States benefits the most from the current global system .
Before 1971 , the United States Government was constrained by a fixed peg to Gold .
In fact , this peg was set at $ 35 per ounce and the United States pledged to redeem any dollars presented to it by foreign central banks for gold .
This effectively meant that an arbitrage situation existed where foreigners could hold the U.S. dollars in reserve if they felt those dollars were worth $ 35 an ounce .
Or they could exchange their U.S. dollars for gold .
If the United States ran an inflationary monetary policy , foreign central banks would lose confidence in the dollar and redeem their dollars for gold , stripping the U.S. coffers of all its money .
The problem for the United States was that it wanted to spend more money than it had .
All governments , left unchecked , will spend to their hearts content .
In the 1960s , the U.S. government ran a " Guns and Butter " policy of increasing spending domestically while increasing military spending to fund the war in Vietnam .
The Johnson administration did not want to increase taxes , so the U.S. inflated the money supply by printing more dollars .
Foreign central banks started to become suspicious and eventually the French under the often anti-Anglo - American Charles de Gaulle started to redeem its dollars for gold .
However , excess U.S. Government spending and the Vietnam War continued into the Nixon Administration and on August 15 , 1971 , Richard Nixon closed the gold window .
The U.S. went off the gold peg and a floating currency regime came into existence .
The current regime has meant inflation
After the U.S. de -linked from Gold , it was free to inflate as it pleased .
However , there were nasty consequences : oil prices rose , commodity prices rose , gold rose , inflation rose , and the dollar fell .
During the 1970s , the new economic regime meant a period of severe weakness for the U.S. dollar and the U.S. economy .
This period ended when Paul Volcker became the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 1979 and proceeded to hike interest rates to unseen levels above 15 % — which is unimaginable when compared to the 1 % we see today .
The result was a severe double - dip economic recession and stock market crash .
But , the most important result was Volcker crushed inflation , setting the stage for an historic bull market during the 1980s and 1990s .
While Volcker ’s drastic actions were laudable , it did not stop the U.S. Government ’s urge to inflate .
We were living in a world of fiat currencies .
With the U.S. dollar still the world ’s reserve currency , the U.S. was free to run budget deficits , trade imbalances , and inflate .
So it did .
Unfortunately this inflation was not the consumer price variety that we had seen in the 1970s .
As the United States deregulated , as the U.S. government privatized and as U.S. industry moved overseas , inflation was seen mainly in asset prices .
Moreover , when the stock market crashed in 1987 , the Federal Reserve learned that monetary easing can work wonders in helping ease crisis .
As a result , the Federal Reserve under Alan Greenspan developed an asymmetric monetary policy that flooded the economy with money whenever crisis or recession became a threat .
So , as the 1990s took shape , the world was awash in dollars .
These dollars funded severe asset price inflation , not only in the U.S. but abroad , leading to severe boom bust cycles in Mexico in 1994 - 1995 , Emerging Asia in 1997 - 1998 , Russia and Brazil in 1998 .
And Argentina at the beginning of this decade .
The emergence of China as a deflationary counterweight to the United States was also helpful in maintaining consumer price inflation at low levels as China used a beggar thy neighbor currency policy which allowed it to become the producer of choice and export low cost goods to the rest of the world .

The end of the super bubble
All of this produced a certain sense of Nirvana for many for a very long time .
However , underlying this were massive trade , currency and fiscal imbalances and a shed load of debt .
It is the debt that tells one we have been experiencing inflation .
All measures of debt and deficit in the United States have been rising for nearly a quarter century to levels never witnessed in history .
Only recently have we again started to witness consumer price inflation from this underlying monetary inflation .
However , the credit crisis has interrupted this whole process .
We are witnessing the most severe financial and economic crisis in three - quarters of a century .
This in large part because the financial system had become so unstable that more debt and leverage just was not possible .
In essence , the subprime housing crisis was a trigger for massive deleveraging globally .
Nevertheless , monetary authorities are doing their level best to save this fiat currency monetary system by flooding the world with money – so much so that they must hide the mechanism behind this reflationary effort .
I am skeptical as to whether they will succeed .
What the world needs now
We need an end to fiat money .
Fiat money is what has caused the U.S. to inflate .
And it is what has caused a massive super bubble and build up in debt .
If you go back in economic history , there have been numerous attempts to issue fiat money — money based only on the promises of the issuer .
Every single time , these monetary regimes have failed .
In the United States , many states issued their own money in the 18th and 19th centuries .
But , the temptation to inflate was too great and these regimes failed too .
In order to promote stability , money must be backed by something of value like gold .
Gold is a valuable commodity in limited supply .
Because the supply cannot be increased , money supply cannot be increased excessively when the currency is backed by gold .
Otherwise one runs into the problem that the U.S. ran into when it closed the gold window in 1971 .
It also must be noted that the limited supply of gold is critical .
If you look back in time to the 16th century , the Spanish economy went off the rails after it started to import lots of gold from the new world .
The Spanish were the world ’s superpower at the time .
They found lots of treasure in the new world , particularly gold in the Incan empire .
While stealing gold from the Incas seemed a blessing , it was a curse in disguise for Spain because it inflated the money supply , resulting in severe inflation in the Spanish economy and eventually economic collapse and ruin .
However , there is one problem with the gold standard right now : prices .
The Federal Reserve has gold holdings of about 286 million ounces .
However , the Fed has been inflating their balance sheet at an unprecedented rate to deal with this crisis .
The Fed ’s balance sheet liabilities were $ 900 billion in August .
They are now approximately $ 2 trillion and well on their way to $ 3 trillion by the end of the year .
Therefore , the U.S. dollar would have to be pegged to gold at over $ 7,000 an ounce and as high as $ 10,000 an ounce .
Gold trades around $ 700 an ounce in the open market .
In a recent paper , QB Partners has also done the math for other currencies as well .
Aggregating the gold holdings of the ECB and the legacy central banks that comprise the Eurozone would imply a $ 6,300 gold price .
Again using the Bretton Woods system as a model , the U.S. dollar and Euro might be designated as “ global reserve currencies ” because they could most easily be converted to gold .
The remainder of participating global currencies could then be made exchangeable into U.S. Dollars / Euros at fixed , but amendable rates ( floating foreign exchange rates ) .
The trickier part of converting paper currencies to a global gold standard would be persuading economies with high paper currency - to - gold ratios .
Their paper currencies would suffer devaluations versus currencies with higher gold reserves .
For example , the Japanese Yen ’s gold price equilibrium would equate to nearly $ 40,000 / ounce when calculated against the Bank of Japan ’s gold holdings and the Chinese Renminbi ’s gold price equilibrium would equate to about $ 117,000 / ounce when calculated against the People ’s Bank of China ’s published gold holdings .
This makes a gold standard rather untenable .
Moreover , the U.S. and the U.K. , with high debt levels , are two economies that want to inflate in order to reduce the burden of their debt loads as everyone de-leverages .
China , Russia , Brazil and the Middle East , with massive dollar reserves , have zero interest in going to gold because it would mean an enormous economic loss for these countries holding dollars .
So , my conclusion is that there can be no agreement to solve this crisis until we have a global economic shakeout , forcing the various interested parties to the table .
In all likelihood this would mean severe economic turmoil and depression unless the monetary authorities can successfully reflate our way out of crisis .
So , we will get a new world order only by plumbing the depths of a depressionary crisis or through the successful efforts of central banks to inflate their way out of trouble .
And , if we want a new world order , it likely will need to be based on another tradeable asset in limited supply besides gold .
Whether we experience depression or see a successful reflation effort , the future after the crisis looks to be one predicated on much debt .
De -leveraging will continue apace for some time and that is a very good thing .

Good intentions are no excuse to continue a failed policy .
Many bad policies in history were surely paved with good intentions .
For instance , President Lyndon Johnson 's " Great Society " was intended to dramatically reduce poverty and , in Johnson 's words , " elevate hope . " [ 1 ]
Those who support the so - called " War on Drugs " may have some good intentions , but their program has turned into a nightmare more properly referred to as a " War on ( Certain ) Drugs " or a " War on Liberty " specifically aimed at minorities .
[ 2 ]
The same applies to the No Child Left Behind Act. According to President George W. Bush , he wanted to " enact a plan to improve all of America 's public schools , so that no child is left behind . " [ 3 ]
Even the late senator from Massachusetts Ted Kennedy praised the intent , " ' President Bush has made education one of his top priorities . "
Kennedy expressed his support for the program . [ 4 ]
The results of this disastrous agenda , however , not only contradict the very name of the program , but trump whatever alleged " good intention " was behind it .
On January 8th , 2002 , President Bush signed into law the No Child Left Behind Act ( NCLB ) , intended to improve proficiency in math and reading .
It sets the expectation of 100 % compliance among Title One public schools by 2013 or 2014 .
It passed in the House on 13 May 2001 by 384–45 , and it passed in the Senate on 14 June 2001 by 91–8 .
According to the bill , students in the schools must pass standardized tests .
If an insufficient number pass the first year , there are no sanctions .
[ 1 ]
If the school 's students fail a second year , then " technical assistance " is provided , whereby parents can send their children to different schools .
If the parents decide to do so , then the transportation is provided by the school district of where the child lives .
If the school fails a third year , then the school must pay for supplemental educational services for the students .
If they fail a fourth year , then management restructuring takes place .
On the fifth year of failure , all staff are replaced , and the school could turn into a charter or private school .
There are rare instances where extreme advocates on both the Left and Right agree on public policy and are opposed to a specific program .
This is one of those instances , and for good reason .
Notable and respected conservative George Will claims that the program " spawned lowered standards . " [ 5 ]
Walter E. Williams , another respected conservative and a professor of economics at George Mason University , condemned the program " that billions of dollars are spent on . "
He argues that " without a civilized learning environment , academic excellence is impossible no matter how much money is spent . " [ 6 ]
Former Republican presidential nominee Pat Buchanan denounced the program as part of Bush 's " big government , " rhetorically asking " what Republican ran last time for cutting back George Bush 's big government ? …
Who stood up and said no to No Child Left Behind ? " [ 7 ]
Noted economist Milton Friedman said , shortly before his death , regarding the program , " Recent federal legislation in the No Child Left Behind Act requires all states to develop regular performance measures of student learning and to make these measures publicly available .
As for the typical parent who still believes his or her child attends an above - average school , what will happen when many of them learn they are wrong ? "
Libertarian Charles Murray said that the program " set a goal that was devoid of any contact with reality . " [
8 ]
Of course , many left - liberals are opposed to the program as well .
Al Franken , for instance , in his book Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell
Them criticized the NCLB program , saying that since " Congress authorized a $ 5.6 billion increase in Title One spending for low income children , " and " President Bush budgeted only $ 1 billion for Title One … if Title One calls for $ 2,800 per poverty - level student , " then " 1,643,857 " children will be " left behind " ( pp. 349–351 ) .
Prominent socialist James Flynn , in his debate with Charles Murray in 2006 , also criticized the Act .
Barack Obama said of the act , " do n't come up with this law called No Child Left Behind and then leave the money behind . …
Do n't tell us that you 'll put high - quality teachers in every classroom and then leave the support and the pay for those teachers behind .…
Do n't label a school as failing one day and then throw your hands up and walk away from it the next . "
The reasons for opposing the program are manifold , and they are largely dependent upon whom the criticism comes from .
I am opposed to the program from a libertarian , government - reduction perspective .
The No Child Left Behind legislation has vastly increased standardized tests and created a muddle of federal regulations with results opposite from their intentions .
At first glance , the concept of standardized tests seems reasonable .
Children should be tested , and the tests are clear indicators either of how intelligent they are or of how much the school is teaching them .
But what is the school " teaching " them , exactly ?
The answer is simple but unfortunate : they 're teaching them how to take the test .
Linda Valli , Maryland associate professor of education , conducted a long study on the federal program and determined that standardized testing " actually undermined the quality of teaching in reading and math " and that the decline in teacher quality and tangible information being taught to the students is because of " the pressure teachers were feeling to ' teach to the test . ' "
Alfie Kohn , author of over a dozen books on education , parenting , and anthropology , decries NCLB 's " overemphasis on standardized testing and punitive sanctions . "
He generally disparages the program , saying that the " law is not about narrowing the achievement gap ; its main effect has been to sentence poor children to an endless regimen of test - preparation drills . "
And furthermore , " even if the scores do rise , it 's at the expense of a quality education . " [ 9 ]
According to a 50 - state survey by Teachers Network , a nonprofit education organization , only 3 % of teachers think No Child Left Behind helps them teach more efficiently .
One infamous criticism that English teachers gave concerned the time spent on the proper use of a comma as opposed to on developmental writing skills .
As Richard and JoAnne Vacca noted in their book , Content Area Reading , " good readers are often good writers , " and " wide reading improves writing . "
However , since the federal , standardized tests place more emphasis on grammatical correctness than on reading comprehension , in the class , reading is sacrificed to punctuation precision .
Virtually no person , however , would seriously argue that in the real world , reading comprehension is less important than knowing where to put a comma or knowing what verbs and nouns are .
This is especially true in the real world of contracts , newspapers , etc .
NCLB is simply a way for the federal government to tighten its grip on schools by threatening them with punishment .
Those who control the schools control the future .
The tests and regulations indirectly control what children learn in school ( and what they do not learn in school ) .
" Those who control the schools control the future . "
More importantly , what are the results of the program ?
One should keep in mind , however , what Kohn said regarding the scores : the higher test scores may come at the cost of learning .
However , in 2006 , for example , math and reading test scores dropped significantly , showing that only 32 % of high - school students were proficient in math . [ 10 ]
What about high - school graduation rates ?
Surely the rate of graduations is reflective of school quality and efficiency , which No Child Left Behind was supposed to improve .
In 2008 , a report sponsored by America 's Promise Alliance , which was prepared by the Editorial Projects in Education Research Center , showed that schools in major cities in the United States had a horrible 52 % graduation rate after four years ; the national average is 70 % , which still is n't good .
In areas like Baltimore , with a graduation rate of 34 % , Columbus , with a graduation rate of 41 % , and Detroit , with an awful rate of 25 % , their suburbs are at 80 % or higher . [ 11 ]
These urban areas were supposed to be the ones No Child Left Behind would target .
Roughly 1.2 million students drop out every year , according to researchers . [ 12 ]
Thus , any test - score improvement is itself only representative of those who are still in school .
It 's similar to a charlatan like Pat Robertson bragging that the divorce rate is down and not bothering to mention that marriage rates are down even further .
Most important , perhaps , is the fact that the No Child Left Behind Act is completely unconstitutional .
There 's nothing in the Constitution that permits the federal government getting involved in education .
This fact was ignored by President George W. Bush , who , in November 2005 , infamously referred to the US Constitution as " just a goddamned piece of paper . " [ 13 ]
In February 2005 , a bipartisan panel of state lawmakers concluded that the program is unconstitutional since it trumps state and local control over schools . [ 14 ]
They claim that " This assertion of federal authority into an area historically reserved to the states has had the effect of curtailing additional state innovations and undermining many that had occurred during the past three decades . "
Some claim that , since participation in NCLB is optional at the state level , it 's not coercive at the federal level .
This excuse is ridiculous , and the same federal / state policies apply with highway funds if BAC is n't lowered to .08 , for instance .
Opting out does n't mean they do n't get taxed ( via their citizens ) in proportion to the money not spent by the feds on education , so it 's really not much of an option .
Tax money is extracted out of the state , and then states are given the " option " to participate in the program in order to get some of that money back .
It 's passive - aggressive coercion .
Optional or not , the federal government has no authority to be involved in education .
Many people who support the program applaud the vast sums of money that are sunk into it .
Is money the answer ?
The author of Savage Inequalities , Jonathan Kozol , thinks so .
According to him , " grossly insufficient funding " is to blame for poor results in Chicago .
Kozol claims that the children 's " problems stem from short funding , " and that the " low funding of the schools that they attend confirm the wisdom " that more funding is necessary .
Kozol does , however , concede that " it is obvious that urban schools have other problems in addition to their insufficient funding . "
In 1984 , a federal judge in Missouri ordered that the property tax in Kansas City be doubled , the income tax be increased , and other state funds be redirected in order to give Kansas City schools an extra $ 2 billion ( $ 4.1 billion in 2008 ) .
In 1991 , Kansas City was spending $ 9,412 per student , compared with $ 2,854 to $ 5,956 in the suburbs .
Kansas
City schools were furnished with brand new textbooks , state of the art computers , an Olympic - sized swimming pool , television studios , and even funding for taxi drivers to drive children to school if there were any problems with bus fare !
According to those who believe money is the answer , this would be the place to see success .
Did the test scores of students increase ?
Not even a little . [ 15 ]
In the year 2009 , in Washington , DC , funding was about $ 15,000 per student , and the student - to - teacher ratio was 15.2 to 1 , yet the students ' achievement rate was one of the nation 's lowest .
Perhaps the most ironic part is that parents are sending their children to other districts , which receive as little as $ 7,500 per student annually , in order to escape the highly - funded school district ! [ 16 ]
That flatly undercuts the entire argument of those who claim that more funding of public schools is the answer to most , if not all , problems .
In conclusion , it 's apparent that government intervention in schools is an utter failure .
The notions that standardized tests will fix the problem and that pouring money into a government project will churn out superior results are likewise absurd .
Educators pouring money into a failed school are like farmers pouring expensive fertilizer onto a concrete sidewalk : the only thing you 're going to promote the growth of are undesirable weeds .
Even left - liberal Juan Williams , in his book Enough , acknowledged that the poor , namely the poor black , " in defiance of black politicians , have told pollsters they favored vouchers , charter schools and magnet schools to give them some chance to get their children out of those bad public schools . "
Why would anyone be opposed to this ?
Teaching to the test , increasing government centralization , and forcing teachers to turn into robots by mandating nearly everything they teach has been shown to be a failure .
Schools operate as a taxpayer - funded monopoly , answering unconstitutionally to the federal government and the teacher 's union .
Further , since it is a monopoly run by a coercive monopoly , it has all the attendant problems , i.e. , it has no profit - loss mechanism .
This monopoly is also subject to the whims of politicians , who can mandate that something either be taught or not taught as dictated by their beliefs .
These beliefs are thus foisted upon the kids , who are required by law to study the given material or else .

Twitter has a lot of celebrities on it , basking in additional attention paid to them from the masses while reporting mundane things in their lives .
Fans hang on their words and their news about every minor or major happening , helped along by the link of said celebrity to the medium in which they work : movies , politics , television , and sports .
Of course , with all of these real celebrities on Twitter , there are plenty of imposters as well , who try to accomplish one of several things :
To pay homage to the person , to satirize them / mock them , or to capitalize off of the famous name and promote themselves a little more .
Members of the Tampa Bay Lightning are not exempt from this .
While team executives such as former owner Oren Koules , Angelina Lawton , and former team captain Dave Andreychuk have official Twitter accounts , there are imposters that have popped up during the course of the season under different player and staff names .
This faking - it epidemic goes much further than just the Tampa Bay Lightning .
You can find fake player accounts devoted to members of any team in the league and with most any sport for that matter .
Even prospects that have yet to turn pro can be subjected to this .
John Tavares , last year 's # 1 overall draft selection , was victim of an imitator during the lead up to the 2009 NHL entry draft .
The fake Tavares kept reporting about the whirlwind leading up to the June 26th draft event , including the false announcement he would nto be the # 1 selection overall .
You have to wonder just how players combat this .
What can be done ?
Who is going to protect them when something like this is going on ?
They 're busy enough with their own lives and seldom have little interest in actually using Twitter , or Facebook , or any other social application that is not direct contact with people .
Lightning communications director Bill Wickett admitted that the Bolts do n't have a policy in place at this time , " We do acknowledge that there may be a need to start looking out for our players and staff in the future . "
Wickett also pointed out that , " NHL Security department gets involved if needed to help protect all of our players as necessary . "
Ultimately , legal responsibility for protecting a player 's name and reputation falls to their agent or personal management , t he guys who represent them in contract negotiations with teams or in other business facets .
Sure , a team could step up to protect the identity of one of its stars - but an agent worth his salt is going to protect the identity and reputation of his client if and when a line is crossed or a potential opportunity is robbed by an impostor .
But how many agents actually make it a point to be proactive about this ?
Jim DeLorenzo , Vice President of Octagon Sports Agency 's Digital Division , explained that Octagon has no official policy regarding social media .
" However , my advice to athletes is that one of the best ways to combat impersonation is to join the service where there is an issue and announce your presence , " DeLorenzo wrote in an email .
" Also , both Facebook and Twitter have impersonation policies in place that allow athletes to have the fake profiles removed .
In my experience , Facebook and Twitter have been very responsive when contacted on impersonation issues . "
What 's the big deal anyway , though ?
Besides hijacking a famous person 's identity online and treating it as just all in good fun , it 's a business hazard for the player / person - of - note that is being imitated .
In January 2010 , comScore reported that Twitter brought in 75 million unique visitors ( per this TechCrunch article with graph ) .
With that many eyes reading 140 - character messages , it has the strength to take a message and spread it with speed among a massive audience .
While a lot of people only see Twitter as someone spreading mundane things to entertain the masses , it does have its viral uses in reporting things as they happen , earning attention to situations of note , and can be a means of promoting an event or a cause that a person with a direct audience ( or following ) holds dear to them .
All this Twitter talk does not even address the 300 + million worldwide users on Facebook and the potential reach that it provides .
Some personalities are more involved with the more established social networks than with Twitter .
Current Lightning captain Vincent Lecavalier already has a profile with the network ( as well as on MySpace ) , and the foundation that shares his name is active in promoting his causes .
On the other hand , there are six different personal profiles that claim to be Steven Stamkos .
We 're not talking about " fan pages " , which are designed for fans of a person or product , but presenting themselves as Stamkos himself .
Martin St. Louis has five .
Back to Twitter , they 're very forthcoming with this and make it clear that " name squatting " is against Twitter 's terms of use .
Impersonation , however ...:
Twitter users are allowed to create parody , commentary , or fan accounts .
Please refer to Twitter 's Parody Policy for more information about these accounts .
Accounts with the clear intent to confuse or mislead may be permanently suspended .
That parody policy gives clear rules on how to operate and put you in the clear .
As for what players and agents can do to secure their identity on Twitter , there are clear rules on how to stop impersonation accounts .
Twitter is also now implementing a verification policy , which makes it clear how you can tell if an account is that of the famous person it claims to be ( and steps a player or celebrity can take to become verified ) .
As a fan on the Internet , you 're free to follow the name of someone famous , as well as whomever you want to on any social network site .
But to follow someone real is better than to follow an opportunist trying to capitalize off a famous person 's reputation .
You 're empowering an impostor when you follow the fake .
Make sure you do your homework and research just who you are adding .
After you verify , then you can trust .
Players and teams can do only so much to deal with impostors .
It 's ultimately up to you and your judgment .
For the record , we checked in with Lightning media relations manager Brian Breseman and asked him for the verified accounts for players and staff with the Tampa Bay Lightning .
He stressed the one official account with the team as the verified source for the Lightning on Twitter : @tblightning .
A middle school teacher in Montgomery County , Maryland , will have to apologize to a 13 - year - old student after yelling at her and having her escorted out of class by school police when the student refused to recite the Pledge of Allegiance .
According to the ACLU of Maryland , a 13 - year - old female student at Roberto Clemente Middle School in Germantown refused to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance on Jan. 27 .
The teacher reportedly ordered the girl out into the hallway , where he threatened the girl with detention and then sent her to the school counselor ’s office .

The next day , when the student again refused to stand for the pledge , the teacher called school officers to remove her from the classroom and take her to the counselor ’s office once again .
“ When the student ’s mother reached out to an assistant principal for help in dealing with the teacher ’s abusive and improper actions , the official said her daughter should instead apologize for her ‘ defiance . ’
The student did apologize , twice , ” the ACLU states .
The right to sit silently during the Pledge of Allegiance has been held up by the US Supreme Court , and is enshrined in Maryland state law and Mongtomery County Public Schools ’ own policies , reports the Washington Post .
“ No one will be permitted to intentionally embarrass you if you choose not to participate , ” says the school district ’s handbook , according to TheGazette.net in Maryland .
The ACLU and the girl ’s mother declined to identify the girl .
They say the student , now 14 , has been “ traumatized ” by the experience , including taunting from fellow students , and has not returned to the school since the incident .
ADVERTISEMENT
Neither the ACLU nor the school district would identify the teacher involved .
The girl ’s mother says the way the teacher “ bellowed ” at her daughter was inappropriate and the school should take disciplinary action against the teacher , reports TheGazette.net .
“ It ’s an even bigger problem because he did it to a child in front of a group of other children , ” the mother said .
“ On top of that , the school did n’t protect her .
I thought they would protect her , and that ’s why I let her go to that school .
I was disappointed . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The turning point evidently came when the ACLU of Maryland sent a letter ( PDF ) to the school district asking for an apology .
“ Expression of patriotism in unsettling times certainly is a worthy and understandable emotion , ” the letter stated .
“ But , as the Supreme Court recognizes , that expression is best honored by venerating the civil liberties and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution and not by losing patience with those whose views or actions do not conform to those of the majority . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The teacher ’s actions were “ a violation of our regulations , and we ’re in the process of rectifying the situation , ” Montgomery Public Schools spokesperson Dana Tofig told TheGazette.net .
Tofig said the teacher would apologize to the student , but would not say if any disciplinary action would be taken against the teacher .
The president of the county ’s teachers ’ union , Doug Prouty , told the Washington Examiner that he supports the move to have the teacher apologize .
“ My initial thought is yes , but we would need to know all of the details , ” Prouty said .

School officials say several conflicts involving the Pledge of Allegiance arise every year in Maryland , but most are resolved quietly .
Con más de una década de retraso , llegó la disculpa de la orden de los Legionarios de Cristo a los mexicanos , tras admitir que su fundador Marcial Maciel sí era lo que por años se denunció - un pederasta ?
y , todavía peor , que vivió una triple vida como sacerdote católico y polígamo .
" Estamos profundamente consternados y tenemos que reconocer que son ciertas las acusaciones contra el padre Maciel " , dijeron en un comunicado hace unos días , " por lo que no podemos mirar a su persona como modelo de vida cristiana sacerdotal " .
Ya .
La orden cremó su memoria en leña verde y , ¿todo se acabó ?
No es fácil borrar un largo túnel negro donde la defensa de Maciel tomó formas amenazantes , atacó los principios de libertad y provocó la furia de las clases más poderosas del país para defender a un sujeto del cual , ahora , se defienden con el silencio .
Durante lustros , el padre Maciel fue construyendo un imperio y un escudo protector .
La clase más rica del país le entregó a sus hijos para que los educara y formara ; algunos de ellos tomaron el camino del celibato , hubo familias que vieron con dolor cómo sus hijos e hijas se iban con Maciel al seminario , y políticos que lo buscaban por favores .
Maciel no disponía de la gracia de Dios , pero sí la de su representante en la Tierra , el papa Juan Pablo II , que al darle acceso privilegiado a El Vaticano le entregó un poder que usó muy bien en México .
Maciel tenía defensores de varios calibres , algunos más belicosos que otros , que lo veían como su guía moral y salvador .
No había lugar para detractores , a quienes trataban con peroratas y sobre quienes movilizaban todas las fuerzas del poder a su alcance para acallarlos .
Así lo hicieron , en el caso más célebre , con un novel canal de televisión que difundió los testimonios de personas que en su niñez dijeron haber sido abusados sexualmente por Maciel .
Buscaron desacreditarlos y al canal lo asesinaron con un boicot publicitario .
Los Legionarios de Cristo movieron a miembros del gabinete del entonces presidente Ernesto Zedillo para amenazar al dueño del canal , y varias de las empresas más grandes de México dijeron que si había programa habría represalias , que cumplieron .
Hoy , los protagonistas de aquella demostración de fuerza en 1997 , de censura y represión , están callados , como si buscaran que el tiempo borre la memoria .
Quienes agredían en correos electrónicos cada vez que el prestigio de Maciel quedaba en entredicho , también están en silencio .
Los políticos que lo procuraban , que se desvivían para que Maciel les abriera las puertas de El Vaticano para sus fines terrenales , como sucedió con la esposa del ex presidente Vicente Fox , Marta Sahagún , que lo cultivó para que le anularan su matrimonio y pudiera casarse por la Iglesia , tocaron la retirada .
¿ Hipocresía ? ¿ Vergüenza ?
¿ Indignación ?
¿ O , simplemente , control de daños ?
Maciel era de los suyos .
El padre defenestrado nunca tuvo prurito en estirar la mano y pedir dinero .
Lo hizo durante décadas en el mejor espíritu de la escuela de un sistema político que operaba con trueques y privilegios .
Maciel era un hombre muy poderoso .
Fundó los Legionarios de Cristo en el sótano de su casa en la ciudad de México en 1941 , desde donde empezó a construir un imperio .
Desde la Vía Aurelia , una de las calles más viejas de Roma , levantó una orden que hoy tiene 800 sacerdotes en 18 países , 145 colegios , 21 institutos superiores y nueve universidades .
Con una membresía calculada en 70 mil personas .
Sus bienes se estiman en 28,000 millones de dólares , y tiene un movimiento laico , Regnum Christi , con más de 70 mil afiliados en el mundo .
El principio del largo fin comenzó cuando en New Haven , Connecticut , los grupos económicos dominantes en la región , molestos porque los Legionarios de Cristo compraron las publicaciones católicas The National Catholic Reporter y Twin Circle en 1995 , estimularon la circulación de rumores de antiguos alumnos del noviciado sobre la pederastia de su fundador .
Esos murmullos terminaron como reportaje en febrero de 1997 en la primera plana del periódico Hartford Courant .
Meses después , un periódico mexicano , La Jornada , publicó los testimonios de los sacerdotes y ex religiosos que habían denunciado al diario estadounidense los abusos sexuales contra ellos cometidos por el padre Maciel , y poco después aparecieron en la televisión mexicana , en CNI Canal 40 .
Maciel denunció que los " conspiradores " querían minar su liderazgo , y durante un largo tiempo consiguió neutralizar las denuncias , ayudado por la negación de las élites - que le habían dado todo - de una realidad que cada día era más evidente .
Las luchas políticas dentro de la Iglesia católica en Estados Unidos hicieron estallar los escándalos de pedofilia entre sacerdotes norteamericanos , con lo cual se fue abriendo brecha allá , y en México con Maciel .
Su protector , Juan Pablo II ya no pudo seguir defendiéndolo , y el cardenal Joseph Ratzinger lo investigó .
Al asumir el papado como Benedicto XVI , lo forzó a retirarse del ministerio .
Maciel murió a principios de 2008 a los 87 años , pero no fue sino hasta la semana pasada , en medio de toda una crisis de la Iglesia católica por sus sacerdotes pedófilos y llamados por la renuncia de Benedicto XVI , que los Legionarios de Cristo decidieron cortar con su fundador .
Se dicen sorprendidos por lo que encontró la investigación vaticana sobre él , pero en realidad sus directores sabían cuando menos hace un año que Maciel no era la persona que la mayoría creía , sino un pecador obsesivo .
¿ Por qué callaron durante este tiempo ?
También ellos han traicionado a los miles que les siguieron .
Quizás , como Maciel en su momento y las élites ahora , porque creían que el silencio los salvaría .
Apostaron mucho y han perdido mucho .
El pago que tienen que hacer a los mexicanos , hasta ahora , no alcanza para saldar la deuda .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - A diet rich in olive oil , nuts , fish , poultry and certain fruits and vegetables may have a powerful effect at staving off Alzheimer ’s disease , researchers reported on Monday .
A vendor sprays water on vegetables to keep them fresh at a market in the eastern Indian city of Siliguri July 6 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Rupak De Chowdhuri
People who ate nutrients specifically selected for brain health had a 40 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer ’s disease compared with others , Yian Gu , an Alzheimer ’s disease researcher at Columbia University in New York and colleagues found .
“ Diet is probably the easiest way to modify disease risk , ” said Gu , whose study appears in Archives of Neurology .
She said because there are no cures for Alzheimer ’s , prevention is key , especially as the population ages .
“ If we follow this diet , that means the risk of getting the disease will be lowered for the population , ” Gu said in a telephone interview .
While other studies have looked at individual nutrients , Gu’s team studied groups of foods high in nutrients that have been shown to be associated with Alzheimer ’s disease risk .
Some , such as saturated fatty acids in red meat and butter , need to be avoided .
Others , such as omega - 3 fatty acids , omega - 6 fatty acids , vitamin E , vitamin B12 and folate , benefit the brain .
To study this , the team collected information on the diets of 2,148 healthy people over 65 for an average of 4 years .
They were checked for Alzheimer ’s disease every 18 months .
Of these , 253 developed Alzheimer ’s , which has no cure .
Those least likely to develop the disease ate more olive oil - based salad dressing , nuts , fish , tomatoes , poultry , cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli , fruits , and dark and green leafy vegetables and ate less red meat , organ meat or high - fat dairy products .
“ People who adhered mostly to this dietary pattern compared to others have about a 40 percent reduction in the risk of developing Alzheimer ’s disease , ” Gu said .
She said the diet likely works in two ways .
Because it is rich in heart - healthy foods , it may be protecting the brain from strokes that could make it more vulnerable to Alzheimer ’s disease .
But it also may be that the nutrients -- such as omega - 3 fatty acids , antioxidants and folate -- directly protect the brain .
Current treatments helps with some symptoms , but cannot reverse the course of Alzheimer ’s , a mind - robbing form of dementia that affects more than 26 million people globally .

President ’s powerful right hand man drops bombshell on 17th anniversary of Siege
Steve Watson
Prisonplanet.com
Friday , April 23rd , 2010
A close advisor to Bill Clinton during his White House tenure dropped a bombshell this week on the seventeenth anniversary of the Waco siege .
Dick Morris , a longtime friend of Clinton and political advisor during his first term in office , told Sean Hannity that the President was not going to appoint Attorney General Janet Reno to a second term in office following the federal barrage on the Branch Davidian ranch at Mount Carmel .
“ Bill Clinton orchestrated that takeover and in fact was so ashamed of what he did in Waco that he was not going to appoint Janet Reno to a second four year term ” Morris stated .
“ She told him in a meeting right before the inauguration day for his new term , that ‘ if you do n’t appoint me , I ’m gonna tell the truth about Waco ’ and that forced Clinton ’s hand in reappointing her . ”
Morris continued .
Rather taken aback Hannity responded “ I do n’t remember you telling this story before . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ No , it ’s never been said before . ” Morris answered .
The comments stemmed from a discussion regarding Clinton ’s recent remarks that the Tea Party could “ breed a new Timothy McVeigh ” , with Morris explaining that McVeigh had stated that the BATF ’s armed assault in 1993 had contributed to his violent mindset .
“ I think that President Clinton might want to examine his own connection with the Oklahoma City bombing in terms of Waco , before he starts accusing people in walkers and wheelchairs who are trying to keep their medicare of being provocateurs ” Morris asserted .
Before moving on Hannity said “ Wait a minute , so what was the truth about Waco that Reno threatened to use against him ? ”
“ I have no idea , ” replied Morris , “ but I know that he told me , Clinton told me that ‘ I could n’t not appoint Reno because she would have turned on me over Waco ’ . ”
Watch the video :
Morris ’ contention is not to be taken lightly , according to Clinton ’s communications director , George Stephanopoulos :
“ Over the course of the first nine months of 1995 , no single person had more power over the president , and therefore over the government , than Dick Morris — no question about it . ” .
Morris went on to become campaign manager of Bill Clinton ’s successful 1996 bid for re-election .
The “ truth ” that Reno threatened to reveal , later came to light – the BATF fired the first shots at Waco and orders were given to use a prohibited chemical weapon in the form of CS gas grenades against the men , women , and children at Mount Carmel .
This information was highlighted in the PBS Frontline documentary investigation Waco : The Inside Story , which reference FBI audiotapes and documentation .
While the cover story read that David Koresh burned his own family and followers to death in a mass suicide pact , the FBI later admitted firing the “ potentially flammable devices ” into the Davidian compound .
Morris ’ revelation indicates that Clinton oversaw a cover up of the Waco siege and that Reno felt far enough removed from it to use it as an effective tool of political blackmail .

Africa Business Report , BBC World News
Lagos is the financial heart of Nigeria - the most populous nation in Africa , and it is a teeming tangle of humanity and enterprise .
A city within the city aims to turn Lagos into a financial powerhouse
The economy of Lagos state is thought to be worth around $ 33bn , despite the chronic overcrowding , crumbling infrastructure and hellish traffic .
Expansion continues at a breakneck speed and part of the expansion plans for Lagos include an ambitious new city within a city .
The Eko Atlantic project promises to turn Lagos into a hugely important financial powerhouse .
Under construction Enormous quantities of rock are poured into the sea to build what is already being called the great wall of Lagos .
We have 18 million people that reside in Lagos State so you need projects like this to draw people away from the centre and spread them to areas like this
Prince Adesegun Oniru , Waterfront Development
A mile and a half out in the Atlantic ocean , the city is taking a stand against the sea .
Lagos is creating a seven kilometre long wall to hold back the waves .
For more than 100 years the sea has been eating away the shoreline of Victoria island in Lagos - some ten metres disappear every year .
Now Lagos has what it hopes is a permanent solution to the problem of erosion .
The idea is to claw back the lost land and build a new , futuristic city on it .
It is to be called Eko Atlantic City .
Every day some 90 trucks arrive weighed down by granite mined from the neighbouring city of Abeokuta and the wall is advancing some seven or eight metres a day .
Tackling overcrowding Prince Adesegun Oniru , in charge of waterfront development , says the project was put together to protect Lagos because everything was gradually eroding away .
The population of metropolitan Lagos is about 18 million " Population growth within Lagos is always a problem , " he says , " We have 18 million people that reside in Lagos State so you need projects like this to draw people away from the centre and spread them to areas like this . "
Lagos is overpopulated and thousands more people flood into the city every month .
Rental prices for accommodation are some of the highest on the continent .
The new city within a city will offer residents constant power and water , good roads and a light rail system to whisk them around a financial centre reminiscent of Manhattan in New York .
Four hundred thousand people will live and work in the new city , but first they will have to build it .
Engineering project Thousands of new inhabitants flood to Lagos every month
It is a big job to reverse , in just a few years , what nature has taken decades to do .
" You need some huge dredging vessels .
The vessels we are employing are some of the largest in the world , " says David Frame , the lead engineer on Eko Atlantic City project .
The giant dredgers from China pump 400,000 tonnes of sand a day into the space between the shore and the wall .
Eko Atlantic City will need as much sand as the Palm One project in Dubai .
Lessons from Dubai Prince Adesegun Oniru believes Lagos has much to learn from Dubai 's troubles .
" The first lesson to learn as far as I am concerned , is not to saturate the market , " he says .
" Finish a particular area completely and then move on to another - the moral is : do n't saturate the market with too much properties . "
A project this size has never been seen in west Africa before .
Lagos has big ambitions to go with its big population .
It wants to become Africa 's model megacity .

Jason
Chen shows off the new iPhone on the Gizmodo site Police in California have seized computers belonging to the editor of a gadget blog which was involved in the purchase of an iPhone prototype .
Gizmodo had admitted it paid $ 5,000 to an unnamed individual for the next generation device , which was reportedly left in a bar by an Apple employee .
Editor Jason
Chen published photographs and videos of the phone last week .
Gizmodo may have violated a California law covering the appropriation of stolen property for personal benefit .
The phone was lost by 27 - year - old Apple software engineer Gray Powell .
Mr Chen told newswire AFP that he and his wife returned from having dinner on Friday night to find police searching their home .
" The officers had a computer and were cataloguing all the items they took from my house .
They told me they were here for a few hours already and had to break the front door open because I was n't at home , " he said .
The technology blog published the search warrant documents online and said they state that the computer and other devices may have been used to commit a felony .
Apple wrote to Gizmodo last week asking it to return the prototype handset , which it complied with .
The technology blog had already published details of the next - generation iPhone , which is expected to be unveiled later this year .
According to Gizmodo , new features include a front - facing video camera and an improved camera with larger lens and a flash .
It is also thinner and has improved battery life .
Legality Critics argue that Gizmodo has committed a crime because it knowingly handled stolen goods and point out that there are clear laws about what to do with found property .
Gizmodo is owned by Gawker Media and its chief operating officer , Gaby Darbyshire , said it expected the immediate return of Mr Chen 's computers and servers .
" Under both state and federal law , a search warrant may not be validly issued to confiscate the property of a journalist , " she wrote in a letter to San Mateo County authorities on Saturday .
" It is abundantly clear under the law that a search warrant to remove these items was invalid .
The appropriate method of obtaining such materials would be the issuance of a subpoena , " said Ms. Darbyshire .
Gawker Media said the issue now throws into question whether or not bloggers are considered journalists under the law .
Advocacy group the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) , which is following the case , said it found the latest events worrying for two reasons .
" You have a reporter who is disseminating newsworthy information to the public that are supposed to be protected from search and seizures .
These protections apply to people who collect information in order to report it to the public regardless of what name you slap on them ; blogger , journalist or whatever , " Jennifer Ganick , the EFFs civil liberties director told BBC News .
The second issue the EFF is concerned about is if police officers are doing the investigative work of a private company .
" If there was some offence here it is not apparent what it is " , she said .
The raids were conducted by the Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team ( React ) , a Californian computer crime taskforce .
The taskforce was set up on 1997 to address the rising problem of computer fraud and identity theft .
It works closely with the computer industry and Apple is reported to be one of 25 tech firms to sit on the steering committee .

Info below is from a henrymakow.com reader .
His analysis seems plausible :
This is in relationship to the gunshots fired as the pilots who flew the ghost plane might have survived the bellyflop type of landing ; the wings and fuel were off the plane as well .
I checked the cockpit contours with a standard photo of this plane too .
This photo of the crashed plane appears to be a cockpit , and it was intact enough for an escape through an emergency window exit .
FRIDAY APRIL 23
Now , believe the plane left Poland with all passengers with a crack flight team in the cockpit ( 4 ) and this plane had been all done over in December with state of the art equipment , but I believe the pilots were in touch with the tower in - Smolensk - , and based on what they were told landed in Belarus which is still under a soft Russian control even though there is a certain amount of independence with one exception , as all old these old military bases for plane landings are under the control of Russia .
The key to this entire conspiracy is manifested with numerous eyewitness reports and videos ; in fact , all press who stayed at a nearby hotel to report the event had all there photos and all video equipment confiscated by the Russian secret police .
Yep , and when the patsy plane was flying in for a landing the speed was low , and two kids on are youtube video described that one wing hit a tree and came off , and then the other wing slammed into a power line and it came off .
This was not a power crash at all , but rather a floating crash , and many should have survived the impact - very little fire .
Now the patsy plane that was sent to Smolensk on a schedule from Russia was either sent there to deliver a passenger or to pick someone up under military order , so even four or five at the most were on this patsy plane , and it was just business as usual with one catch ; the tower was given instructions to make it crash in order to cover up the real operation at hand .
Ok now lets get to the bottom line with this scenario , and why I spent a lot of time watching this all .
All videos and eyewitness reports who were at the scene first , saw no luggage and no bodies anywhere so go figure with a plane that held almost 100 people - poof .
Come on give me a break as this was a belly flop type of crash with very little fire on landing .
Makow comment :
This would account for why there were no ambulances .
The plane was empty except for possibly the pilots who may have been killed .
The same kind of airport " reception " may have greeted the passengers on the 9 - 11 planes .
More from an informed reader :
The pilots approaching Smolensk contrary to media reports diverted their landing elsewhere based on the reports given to them by the tower and probably landed at another military airport in Belarus .
Then the old KGB arrested all , and none of these people will ever see the light of day .
It is called the plane - switch , whereby , an identical plane was ordered from somewhere with four in the cockpit , according to union laws of flight in Russia , to deliver a passenger to Smolensk .
Russia now controls the defense and security policy of Belarus , has established military bases , and runs key defense installations .
Now , remember that Putin was there about a week before , and his comrades in the tower were given orders to fudge a landing and cause an intentional crash for the patsies flying in on a very fixed schedule ; plan a clean up team to make things look good ; kill anyone in sight ; and the black boxes would be fixed to say this or that ; propaganda would abound to confuse ; and you will all be rewarded .
Henry there is no other explanation , but when my theory is put in place it makes sense .

Read this one carefully because it contains so many of the points which I have previous made .
The plane which was circling the airport appears to have been seeding the area as Russia has indeed been involved with weather technology , so a temporary fog was created .
The cockpit was intact and it is utter nonsense to believe they were burned , as the boys saw the approach and one wing hit a tree , and the other wing got sliced by a hydro wire .
Thus , all the fuel was gone before the belly flop landing took place which meant virtually no fire .
It was a rare plane crash , and there should have been survivors but no bodies to be seen out of 96 passengers - sure and it is time once again to believe in the tooth fairy .

How Satanists Say " We 're Sorry "
By Henry Makow , Ph.D .
In April 1940 , the Soviet NKVD massacred the cream of Poland 's nationalist and Christian intelligentsia in the Katyn Forest and elsewhere .
They were slaughtered because they would n't agree to join the Communists in fronting a future occupation of Poland .
Seventy years later , on April 10 , 2010 , the heirs of the NKVD , who still run Russia , probably finished the job .
They probably engineered a plane crash which killed the Polish President , the heads of the army and navy , the secret service and much of the patriotic wing of the Polish government .
Thus they neatly eliminated one more obstacle to Satanic world government which is descending on the planet like a dreaded darkness .
This is how Satanists say , " We 're sorry ! "
By repeating the outrage , again and again , until they are finally stopped .
The grounds for suspicion are numerous .
1 . The plane was Russian and had recently been " refurbished " in Russia .
One blogger , a pilot , wrote , " Circumstances , however , point to a major accident or intentional blocking of the control system .
Such a blockade may be intentionally installed so that it launched at a release from the chassis or flaps on the line immediately before landing . "
2 . As in the Pentagon attack , where there was no wreckage , there were no bodies to be found .
Here is the YouTube .
If the plane was at tree height , there would have been survivors .
There would have been bodies .
There would been luggage .
As with the 9 - 11 passengers , it is possible the occupants were taken off the plane somewhere else , held or murdered .
On Saturday , Russian authorities said all bodies had been found .
On Monday the story had changed .
A Polish observer wrote : " Given the unlikelihood of Poland 's top political and military leaders flying on the same plan , the execution or kidnapping of some of them in Poland can not be ruled out .
To explain their deaths to the general public , their names could have been added to the passenger list .
According to media , only 14 bodies could be identified in Moscow with the rest being too badly burned . "
A Polish friend wrote to me : " There is no sign of even one body or blood , the Polish cameraman thought that the plane was empty and when he was walking and recording it , he just noticed in shock that the plane was Polish but still did n't know it was President 's plane .
" The plane was very low , at the level of trees but they could recognize only 14 bodies , the rest was shattered into pieces or burnt and needed DNA testing .
" They never called any ambulances , no doctors , only one fire engine and immediately they stated that nobody survived .
In this video there is nobody searching for bodies , nobody looking if any people needed help , just fire engine and quite quickly coffins were sent .
They said first that all the bodies were found and then next day , that only 14 could be recognized and they were still searching for bodies .
There is lie after lie .
Most of the people on the plane were the president 's supporters and belonged to his party , being in strong opposition to prime minister who was n't there .
The cameraman was caught and pushed away from the place , he said later on TV that there was no chance there could be over 80 bodies ( which was cut off later from TV interview ) , he has n't seen even one . "
3 . The entourage was supposed to travel by train .
Suddenly the plans were changed and the generals were induced to join the group .
4 . Eye witnesses heard explosions .
A bomb ?
Another said the fog appeared just before the landing and quickly dispersed afterward .
The Russians claimed the pilot did n't speak Russian which turned out to be a lie .
The New York Times peddled the story that the President made the pilot land against his better judgment .
This is the same New York Times that hid Stalin 's mass murders from the American people .
My Polish friend writes : " Others say clearly about hearing the noise like from a bomb exploding and then silence .
Besides , if there are awful conditions the plane is not allowed to land and the airport is closed for landing .
" It seems , that they were just normally trying to land with no worries and problems and suddenly something happened with the plane that lead all of them to death .
" The most valuable , christian and patriotic head of Poland has been wiped out with one blow , now the way is free , nobody will interrupt big brother any more . "
I do n't know how the Satanists pulled off 9 - 11 but I know the official story is not true .
The same applies here .
Accidents like this do n't happen by accident .
In one stroke , the globalist Masons , who are behind Putin as well as Obama , removed a thorn in their side .
Yes the Poles are in Afghanistan , but they had been steering an independent course on the Euro and the EU , and they rejected the swine flu vaccine and hysteria .
Kaczynski was regarded as skeptical of the European Union while he fought to defend Poland 's sovereignty against Brussels and to protect its traditional , conservative values .
In 2008 , he argued against ratifying the union 's Lisbon Treaty for fear its prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation would become Polish law .
By virtue of its Catholic heritage , Poland is one of the last bastions of civilization in Europe .
This will make the struggle of the Polish people , and all those resisting satanic and globalist enslavement , all the more difficult .

A Mallee grower in South Australia says locusts have eaten their way through hundreds of hectares of early - sown crops .
Wunkar farmer Ian Cass said he thought sowing crops including rye slightly early was a good idea after good rains , but they are now all gone .
" 100 per cent of that , the whole lot 's gone , there 's not even a blade left out there of any kind , " he said .
With sowing to begin soon throughout the region , there is widespread concern about how long locusts will hang around .
South Australian Research and Development Institute entomologist Ken Henry says temperatures need to cool down before the locust problem will ease .
" The locusts [ will ] probably be around ' til the middle of winter , " he said .
Growers are being encouraged to watch for locust eggs which would hatch in spring .
BEIJING — Nearly 150 years after American railroads brought in thousands of Chinese laborers to build rail lines across the West , China is poised once again to play a role in American rail construction .
But this time , it would be an entirely different role : supplying the technology , equipment and engineers to build high - speed rail lines .
The Chinese government has signed cooperation agreements with the State of California and General Electric to help build such lines .
The agreements , both of which are preliminary , show China ’s desire to become a big exporter and licensor of bullet trains traveling 215 miles an hour , an environmentally friendly technology in which China has raced past the United States in the last few years .
“ We are the most advanced in many fields , and we are willing to share with the United States , ” Zheng Jian , the chief planner and director of high - speed rail at China ’s railway ministry , said .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California has closely followed progress in the discussions with China and hopes to come here later this year for talks with rail ministry officials , said David Crane , the governor ’s special adviser for jobs and economic growth , and a board member of the California High Speed Rail Authority .
Twitter !
Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal !
Last night I saw this article , which basically says the one day soon computers wo n't present the user with the ability to manipulate " files " anymore .
Suddenly , I had stuff to say .
But I 've been using Twitter , which limits me to 140 characters .
So , I Tweeted this :
We 're heading toward two classes of computers : one for people like me , and one for people like my Mom .
( And BTW , Mom , usually when I mention you on the Internet , I 'm not really talking about you .
You 're a metaphor for " normal people " , those who use computers to get things done , as opposed to geeks like me , who use computers just because they are shiny . )
Anyway , I thought the tweet would be enough .
It was n't .
In the beginning , we were the only ones here .
Normal people did n't use computers at all .
Only the geeks used computers , and we certainly were n't using them to get anything done .
I remember my Mom saying that she would never use a computer .
( Mom , this one is actually you . )
And I certainly can't blame her for thinking that at the time .
She had no reason to see computers as a way of getting things done .
All she knew is that I would periodically run into the family room to announce to my parents that I had just shaved three more instructions out of the main loop so now my graphics move faster .
And Mom just wanted me to at least stack my Byte magazines in the corner so she could get the vacuum cleaner through .
Fast forward to today .
Computers , by and large , are still designed for geeks .
This is why we all buy T - shirts that say " No , I will not fix your computer " .
The genius of the iPad is that it can not get things like viruses .
It is a closed platform .
You can't put apps on it .
You can't write and distribute software for it without Apple 's permission .
This is why geeks hate it and normal people will love it .
Your Mom wants a computer she does n't have to ask you to fix .
She is willing to trade power and flexibility to get simplicity .
The iPad is another major step .
I find this interesting because it raises all kinds of questions :
The industry is finally ready to sell things that make geeks feel frustrated instead of things that make normal people feel helpless .
What does this mean for geeks and our role in society ?
How is the terminology going to shake out ?
Surely we need two different names ?
Things that geeks use should probably still be called " computers " .
What should we call the class of devices that help normal people manage their Amazon wish list ?
We geeks will become the minority market niche .
How will this affect the pricing of things ?
Will there be sufficient economies of scale to sell computers to geeks at margins that are tolerable to both buyer and seller ?
What kinds of computers / devices will get caught in the middle and suddenly have no place in the world ?
What classes of users are going to be special cases ?
I 'm talking about folks that are not geeks but that for some other reason cannot accept the power / simplicity tradeoff of devices designed for normal people .
This is a major wave of change .
I do n't know the answers to these questions .
The only thing that seems clear to me is that Microsoft will miss this wave just like they missed the last one .
Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 20/4/2010 ( 3816 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .

Why Apple Changed Section 3.3.1
We ’re still in the early days of the transition from the PC era to the mobile era .
Right now , Apple is winning .
There are other winners right now too — RIM is still growing , and Android has grown a ton in the past year .
The App Store platform could turn into a long - term de facto standard platform .
That ’s how Microsoft became Microsoft .
At a certain point developers wrote apps for Windows because so many users were on Windows and users bought Windows PCs because all the software was being written for Windows .
That ’s the sort of situation that creates a license to print money .
I do n’t think Apple even dreams of a Windows - like share of the mobile market .
Microsoft ’s mantra was ( and remains ) “ Windows everywhere ” .
Apple does n’t want everywhere , they just want everywhere good .
The idea though , is to establish the Cocoa Touch APIs and the App Store as a de facto standard for mobile apps — huge share of both developers and users .
So what Apple does not want is for some other company to establish a de facto standard software platform on top of Cocoa Touch .
Not Adobe ’s Flash .
Not .NET ( through MonoTouch ) .
If that were to happen , there ’s no lock - in advantage .
If , say , a mobile Flash software platform — which encompassed multiple lower - level platforms , running on iPhone , Android , Windows Phone 7 , and BlackBerry — were established , that app market would not give people a reason to prefer the iPhone .
And , obviously , such a meta - platform would be out of Apple ’s control .
Consider a world where some other company ’s cross- platform toolkit proved wildly popular .
Then Apple releases major new features to iPhone OS , and that other company ’s toolkit is slow to adopt them .
At that point , it ’s the other company that controls when third - party apps can make use of these features .
So from Apple ’s perspective , changing the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement to prohibit the use of things like Flash CS5 and MonoTouch to create iPhone apps makes complete sense .
I ’m not saying you have to like this .
I ’m not arguing that it ’s anything other than ruthless competitiveness .
I ’m not arguing ( up to this point ) that it benefits anyone other than Apple itself .
I ’m just arguing that it makes sense from Apple ’s perspective — and it was Apple ’s decision to make .
Flash CS5 and MonoTouch are n’t so much cross-platform as meta-platforms .
Adobe ’s goal is n’t to help developers write iPhone apps .
Adobe ’s goal is to encourage developers to write Flash apps that run on the iPhone ( and elsewhere ) instead of writing iPhone - specific apps .
Apple is n’t just ambivalent about Adobe ’s goals in this regard — it is in Apple ’s direct interest to thwart them .
So consider how this change affects the various parties involved :
Apple : Good , they maintain complete control over native iPhone OS app development .
Adobe and other producers of cross - device mobile meta- platforms : Terrible , because they can’t target today ’s leading mobile platform .
And they ’ve wasted a tremendous amount of effort creating tools to generate iPhone apps .
Web developers :
No change .
The iPhone remains completely open to web apps .
The difference between the web , as a competitor to native iPhone apps , from something like Flash is that the web is not controlled by anyone .
There is no platform vendor for the web — and Apple has complete control over WebKit , its implementation for the web .
i Phone developers : No change .
If you ’re a developer and you ’ve been following Apple ’s advice , you will never even notice this rule .
You ’re already using Xcode , Objective - C , and WebKit .
If you ’re an iPhone developer and you are not following Apple ’s advice , you ’re going to get screwed eventually .
If you are constitutionally opposed to developing for a platform where you ’re expected to follow the advice of the platform vendor , the iPhone OS is not the platform for you .
It never was .
It never will be .
( And , in one sense , this is good news for existing iPhone developers : their skill set is now in even greater demand . )
Flash and C# developers : Bad news , if you were hoping to target the App Store with your products .
If you want to write iPhone OS software , follow Apple ’s advice , not Adobe ’s or Microsoft’s .
i Phone users : I can see two arguments here .
On the one side , this rule should be good for quality .
Cross - platform software toolkits have never — ever — produced top - notch native apps for Apple platforms .
Not for the classic Mac OS , not for Mac OS X , and not for iPhone OS .
Such apps generally have been downright crummy .
On the other hand , perhaps iPhone users will be missing out on good apps that would have been released if not for this rule , but wo n’t now .
I do n’t think iPhone OS users are going to miss the sort of apps these cross- platform toolkits produce , though .
My opinion is that iPhone users will be well - served by this rule .
The App Store is not lacking for quantity of titles .
Consider , for one example , Amazon ’s Kindle clients for iPhone OS and Mac OS X .
The iPhone OS Kindle app is excellent , a worthy rival in terms of experience to Apple ’s own iBooks .
The Mac Kindle app is a turd that does n’t look , feel , or behave like a real Mac app .
The iPhone OS Kindle app is a native iPhone app , written in Cocoa Touch .
The Mac Kindle app was produced using the cross-platform Qt toolkit .
Phil Jones , Dec 3 , 2008 :
About 2 months ago I deleted loads of emails , so have very little – if anything at all .
A leading law firm is being investigated over claims that it bullied and harassed hundreds of people wrongly accused of illegal filesharing .
The Solicitors Regulation Authority , an industry watchdog , said it is investigating a complaint brought against Davenport Lyons , the London - based solicitors ' firm that has led a number of prosecutions against illegal filesharers .
The consumer group Which ?
first made an official complaint in 2008 , after a number of people contacted it to say that they had received letters from Davenport Lyons demanding payment for illegal downloads that were nothing to do with them .
Which ?
said that the letters - which usually threatened legal action if immediate payments of hundreds of pounds were not made - were " excessive " and often rested on little evidence of wrongdoing .
Earlier that year , the firm was instrumental in securing the country 's record ruling against an alleged filesharer - a £ 16,000 judgment against a London woman accused of illegally downloading a pinball game worth £ 26 .
Shortly afterwards , the company launched an anti-piracy campaign that involved sending letters to thousands of people accusing them of illegally downloading games , movies and pornography .
But the nature of that action was the subject of heavy criticism when many alleged downloaders said they were wrongly targeted .
The Guardian reported the case of a couple in their 60s who were accused of illegally downloading a pornographic film - despite the fact that they do not know how to do so , while the BBC also reported that similar accusations had left people feeling " upset , scared and angry " .
Deborah Prince , the head of legal affairs at Which ? , said that she was pleased by the investigation - even if the complaint has taken more than a year to come under consideration .
" We 're pleased to see some action at last from the SRA and hope the tide is finally turning in favour of consumers , " she said .
" We now want to see some decisive action to stop these bully - boy tactics . "
A representative of Davenport Lyons was unavailable for comment - but in the past , the firm has said that the accusations are " simply wrong " .
The news comes as the House of Lords considers the hotly - contested digital economy bill - which could give ministers the power to disconnect alleged filesharers and let the courts block websites containing copyright - infringing material .
On Wednesday a series of changes were pushed through which turned up the pressure on the already - contentious bill .
While the controversial clause 17 - which potentially gave parliament the right to change copyright law - was dropped , a new amendment was added which critics say could end up with major websites such as YouTube being unfairly blocked by internet service providers .
The music industry welcomed the move , which they said was a step in the right direction .
" We are pleased that parliament have recognised that legislation to tackle non -peer - to - peer piracy needs to be as robust as that planned to limit peer - to - peer , " said a spokesman for the BPI , Britain 's record industry association .
However the Internet Service Providers ' Association said that it was " outraged " by the changes , which it said were " hastily constructed " .
Under the new proposals , the high court could force ISPs to block websites containing " substantial " amounts of copyrighted material if the rights holder demands it - regardless of whether the website had any knowledge of the actions of its users .
" ISPA has been supportive of peers ' excellent scrutiny of the bill to date , " said Nicholas Lansman , the organisation 's secretary general .
" However , in this instance , our members are extremely concerned that the full implications of the amendment have not been understood and that the reasoning behind the amendment is wholly misguided . "
In Switzerland , parents hire " Evil Clown " Dominic Deville to stalk their children for a week , leave them threatening notes , and finally attack them with a cake in the face , for their birthday .
Military neutrality has a dark side .

Europe get prepared , FrontSoftware ’s critically acclaimed Action / RPG will finally be making it ’s way to PAL territories .
Namco Bandai has revealed that they will be publishing Demon ’s Souls in Europe , making them the third publisher to release the game .
Sony originally published the game in Japan as a first party title before Atlus bought it stateside some 9 months later .
Demon ’s
Souls is best known for being an incredibly difficult but enjoyable game .
It also has an unique online system which allows players to leave tips for one another , watch defeated player ’s final moments and even summons players in to other people ’s games to serve as a boss character .
No release date was announced but Namco Bandai is set to release an official statement tomorrow .
Update :
It is now tomorrow and as the revised article title suggest , Namco Bandai has set the release date for June 25th .

Research on the Iceman glacier mummy has revealed insight into how , on a molecular level , the mummification process can preserve human skin for long periods of time .
Image copyright : South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology / EURAC .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Using cutting - edge microscopy techniques , researchers have gained insight into how human mummies can be extremely well - preserved for thousands of years .
A team of scientists from Germany and Italy has investigated skin samples from Europe 's oldest natural mummy , the 5,300 - year - old " Iceman " who was buried in a glacier shortly after death in the Otzal Alps between Italy and Austria .
The researchers found that the underlying structure of the mummy 's skin is largely unaltered compared with the skin of a modern living human , likely maintaining its protective function due to dehydration .
When the Iceman was discovered by tourists in 1991 , the well - preserved body was first thought to be a modern corpse .
After scientists realized that the body was that of a 45 - year - old man ( possibly a shepherd ) living in the Copper Age , continued research has revealed a wealth of information on Neolithic culture in the region .
Although the Iceman could have died from a number of causes , examinations have suggested that he was killed by an arrowhead that entered his body under the left shoulder blade and caused severe internal bleeding .
He also had stab trauma on his right hand and a bruise at the head that possibly resulted from a blow to the head .
Since the Iceman ’s discovery , investigations using optical and scanning electron microscopes have revealed that , while the epidermis ( outer layer of skin ) is missing , the remaining mummified skin collagen is extremely durable .
However , the underlying reason for the durability is largely unclear .
In the current study , the researchers have investigated three skin samples from the Iceman using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and Raman spectroscopy to try to understand how the mummified skin is so well - preserved .
These techniques allowed the scientists to investigate the skin collagen ’s nanostructure and molecular structure .
In their investigations , the researchers discovered that the mummy ’s skin and recent skin samples were very similar .
Among their findings was that both samples featured the nanoscale periodic banding patterns that are characteristic of collagen fibrils .
Also , the Raman spectroscopy analysis showed that the ancient and recent skin spectra were very similar , indicating that the molecular structure of the mummy ’s skin was largely unchanged .
However , by conducting AFM nanoindentation experiments , the researchers found that the mummified skin had a slightly higher Young ’s modulus , meaning that it was slightly less elastic and stiffer than recent skin .
As the researchers explain , the most probable cause of this increased stability of the mummified collagen is dehydration by freeze - drying .
Dehydration may have resulted in more densely packed fibril structures , leading to the creation of additional cross - links between the subfibrils .
In this way , the dehydrated skin could maintain its protective function and continue to prevent tissue decomposition .
“ The most important finding of our study is that the type I collagen in the mummified skin of the Iceman retained its structure and thus maintained its protective function ( against external influences , such as UV - irradiation , freeze - thaw damage , or microbiological degradation ) enabling continuous tissue preservation for 5300 years , ” Marek Janko , coauthor from the Ludwig - Maximilians - Universität ( LMU ) Munich and the European Academy of Bolzano ( EURAC ) , told PhysOrg.com .
“ But it also covers important aspects of collagen structure and mechanical property analysis and gives important insight into mechanistic details about the mummification process , extending earlier work by Schweitzer , Lingham - Soliar , Williams , Hess and others . ”
Overall , the researchers ’ findings support the theory that the Iceman was covered by snow and ice immediately after his death , and - other than for a few thawing and refreezing cycles - likely remained frozen for the majority of the time until his discovery .
The results could also have implications in different areas , as Robert Stark , coauthor from LMU Munich , explained .
“ Often , mummies are an invaluable cultural heritage because they tell us a lot about life and death in former times , ” said Stark .
“ There are various ways to mummify a corpse .
Examples include the procedures used by the old Egyptians , the methods used to conserve Rosalia Lombardo ( considered one of the most beautiful mummies ) or the Iceman . ”
“ Last but not least , ” Janko added , “ our finding that the dehydration of the collagen may cause an increase in the collagen fibril elasticity can have suitable applications in surgery where collagen tissues with desired mechanical properties are needed . ”

Remember this and this ?
Well , they became these fun knee - high socks !
I call them Springtime Color Block Socks – which kind of rhymes .
They are made from that yummy cashmere with some fun flecks of Koigu Merino .
More below !
I wanted to make socks and do colorwork but when I had all the colors the original idea I had did n’t make much sense .
Then I dove into the fair isle book to find some interesting pattern ideas but none were really right for what I wanted .
So I remembered there was a slip stitch that looked like little blocks and that was more the look I was going for , but I wanted to mix it up a bit .
So instead of doing faux - blocks of even widths around the sock , I mixed it up by going from 2 ×2 to 3×3 and shifting their placement every few rows so it does n’t look like a grid .
And this is the end result !
Yay socks !
A proposal to put the legalization of marijuana in California to a vote this November is causing some growers of the plant in the state to worry about a sharp drop in the value of their crop if the measure succeeds .
As The Los Angeles Times explained in January , when supporters of the proposed Regulate , Control and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010 turned in more than enough signatures to get the measure on the ballot , the initiative “ would make it legal for anyone 21 and older to possess an ounce of marijuana and grow plants in an area no larger than 25 square feet for personal use .
It would also allow cities and counties to permit marijuana to be grown and sold , and to impose taxes on marijuana production and sales . ”
On Monday , The Times - Sentinel newspaper in Humboldt County , a part of Northern California known as the “ Emerald Triangle ” for the density of its marijuana crop , reported :
[ L] ocal business people , officials and those involved in the marijuana industry are planning to meet Tuesday night and break a long - standing silence to talk about what supposedly is the backbone of Humboldt County ’s economy — pot .
More specifically , the meeting will focus on the potential economic effects of the legalization of marijuana .
While the local newspaper ’s report on the meeting quoted the its organizer , Anna Hamilton , by name , it did not state that she was , herself , a grower of the plant — which is legal in the state only when used as medication .
According to The Times - Sentinel , Ms. Hamilton “ said she is ‘ intimately involved ’ with the marijuana industry . ”
That sort of coyness led Frank James to write on NPR ’s news blog :
Marijuana growers tend to be a fairly secretive lot , probably even in Humboldt , so I wonder what the attendance will be like and if the Drug Enforcement Agency will be there .
Ms. Hamilton told the local newspaper that if the county ’s marijuana industry prepares for legalization , there could be some positives for the area : “ We have to embrace marijuana tourism , marijuana products and services — and marijuana has to become a part of the Humboldt County brand , ” she said .
The ballot initiative , which is being presented in part as a way to raise tax revenues for California , is supported by Richard Lee , an Oakland businessman who makes his money selling the drug legally .
Mr. Lee also founded Oaksterdam University , which trains growers .
A campaign Web site , Taxcannabis.org , prominently features the results of a 2009 Field poll that found that “ legalizing marijuana and taxing its proceeds ” was supported by 56 percent of those surveyed in California .
The same Web site noted that three columnists for The Orange Country Register recently included the legalization and taxation of marijuana production in a list of ideas to help California balance its books — along with calls to privatize the state ’s prisons , suspend the fight against global warming and drill for oil in the waters near the state ’s beaches .

Humboldt County worries about life after legal pot
by The Associated Press
Marijuana growing has long been a way of life in Humboldt County , especially in recent years as timber and fishing jobs have disappeared along California ’s North Coast .
Now some residents worry that their way of life is being threatened — not by law enforcement , but by efforts to legalize marijuana in the state .
Community members are gathering Tuesday night to consider the consequences .
They worry about the ripple effect that a drop in marijuana prices could have on the county as a whole if legalization undermines the black market .
“ We have to recognize that if we have something that is this big a piece of our economy that is subsidized by being illegal , that this is an unsustainable situation , ” Humboldt County Supervisor Mark Lovelace said .
In recent years , anti-drug agents have seized hundreds of thousands of marijuana plants in the county , mostly from massive gardens in remote mountain forests that have earned the region the nickname Emerald Triangle .
Law enforcement estimates put the street value of the crop in the billions of dollars .
The eradication efforts have not halted marijuana growing in Humboldt , but the number of plants seized does give a sense of the scale of the industry .
Meeting organizer Anna Hamilton of Shelter Cove said she believes legalization could be “ devastating ” to the region and that Humboldt County should plan ahead by capitalizing on its name recognition as a marijuana destination .
“ We have to embrace marijuana tourism , marijuana products and services — and marijuana has to become a part of the Humboldt County brand , ” said Hamilton , who describes herself as “ intimately involved ” with the marijuana industry .
Supporters of a ballot measure to legalize marijuana in limited quantities are still waiting for official word that they ’ve submitted enough signatures to qualify for the November statewide ballot .

A Galwayman who contracted a flesh - eating virus in hospital , has settled his High Court action for damages in Dublin .
The man , who cannot be identified by order of Mr Justice John Quirke , brought a medical - negligence action against Portiuncula Hospital , Ballinasloe , Co Galway .
The hospital admitted liability in the case .
The court heard the man suffered injuries around his lower abdomen , groin and upper thigh as a result of necrotizing faciitis -- arising out of an operation on July 2 , 2001 .
It had a catastrophic affect on him physically and mentally , the court was told .
He was unable to engage in physical activities , his relationship with his wife was affected , and he had concerns about fertility .
Reconstructive surgery to his scrotal area is not recommended at present , the court heard .
The man claimed that the hospital failed to diagnose the flesh - eating virus and renal failure .
He told the court that the morning after the operation , he awoke with unbearable pain and was throwing up .
He said nothing was done when he complained .
A bell patients use to alert medical staff was taken away from him because he rang it so much , he said .
The following day , he was diagnosed as having the flesh - eating bug , and renal failure .
He was transferred to St Vincent 's Hospital in Dublin and underwent two further operations , including one to implant his testes into his thighs .
He was released from hospital in August 2001 , but made redundant due to his injuries .
He continues to experience pain , has significant scaring and suffers from stress and depression due to his injuries .
A new bill to let food producers decide whether to label GMOs could prevent states from passing mandatory labeling laws .
It ’s expected to be introduced in the next few weeks — so we need to dissuade potential co-sponsors now !
Action Alert !
At the behest of the Monsantos and Cargills of the world , ...
In this article , I will discuss all kinds of aspects of rooting your Android phone and the benefits that come with it .
Maybe you 've heard about " rooting " a phone from a friend or read about it somewhere on the Internet .
Maybe you even * kind of * know what it is but are n't sure what you can do with it .
Or maybe you are already running a rooted phone and looking for more ways you can utilize it .
Whatever the case may be , this article is for you .
What Is Rooting ?
First , for the newbies , let me clarify what rooting is .
Getting root or rooting your phone is the process of modifying the operating system that shipped with your device to grant you complete control over it .
This means you can overcome limitations that the carriers and manufacturers put on your phone , extend system functionality , and even upgrade it to a custom flavor of Android .
The name root comes from the Linux operating system world , where the most privileged user on the system ( otherwise known as Administrator on Windows ) is called root .
Now , I 'd like to take a moment to dispel a common misconception and clarify one thing : rooting does * not* mean installing a custom ROM ( a ROM is a modified , " aftermarket " OS ) .
Now , I 'd like to take a moment to dispel a common misconception and clarify one thing : ( a ROM is a modified , " aftermarket " OS ) .
Installing a ROM may require rooting first , but just rooting can be usually done in only a few minutes , keeping your stock OS otherwise completely intact .
Usually rooting is fairly simple - in most cases you can find several videos and articles on the web that explain how to do it on your specific phone model - just Google " YOURPHONEMODEL root " .
Rooting is not something manufacturers or carriers approve of but they can't really prevent it from happening because the rooting process usually exploits a vulnerability in the operating system code or device drivers and allows the " hacker " to upload a special program called su to the phone .
This program is the one that provides root access to programs that request it .
Contrary to popular belief , su stands for " switch user " and not " superuser . "
Contrary to popular belief , su stands for " switch user " and not " superuser . "
Another program called Superuser Permissions is usually bundled with all root methods .
It gives you a chance to approve or deny requests from any application that wants to utilize root .
Superuser Permissions essentially replaces the conventional root password with a simple Approve / Deny prompt , which is n't as secure as having a password , but is far more convenient on a mobile device .
Now an obligatory warning : rooting your phone does run the risk of potentially bricking it ( i.e. your phone could become nonfunctional ) – so do your homework before attempting anything , unless you 're a fan of $ 500 paper weights .
Benefits Of Rooting
Let ’s check out some of the benefits of rooting your Android phone .
Full Control Over Android
You have access to alter any system files , use themes , change boot images , delete annoying stock apps , such as Sprint 's NFL Mobile live and Nascar Sprint Cup Mobile , and other various native applications that might drive you crazy ( Footprints , Voice Dialer , etc ) .
There is plenty of information on the web on how to accomplish this , but our favorite way is by using Titanium Backup and freezing / deleting the apps from there ( root required , of course ) .
Back Up And Restore The Whole System
On most rooted Android devices , you can back up your entire system to an SD card , much in the same way you can image a hard drive .
This is great if you ’d like to try a new ROM , as you can back up your phone , wipe it completely , flash the new ROM , and if you do n’t like it , just restore from your backup to get your device back to exactly how it was before you wiped it .
The easiest way to do this at the moment is by using ROM Manager , developed by famed Android developer Koush .
ROM Manager allows you to easily flash a custom recovery image which is what you will need in order to backup and restore your phone .
The recovery image is a special program that can be booted into outside of the phone 's main operating system , sort of like an OS recovery console on a PC .
By default , the recovery image on most Android phones only gives you a few options , mainly related to wiping the phone .
Custom recovery images expand upon these options and usually include scripts that can do things like backup and restore your system , fix file permissions , or allow you to flash custom ROMs that the normal recovery image would otherwise reject .
Normally , flashing a custom recovery image requires some command line work , either on your PC , or on a terminal emulator directly on the phone , but Koush 's ROM Manager should automatically flash his custom recovery image ( known as Clockwork Mod Recovery ) for you , provided you 're on one of the supported phones ( < -- the list in this link should be always up - to - date , as it's maintained by Koush ) and that it is already rooted .
Using ROM
Manager is pretty simple .
Download and install the application from the market , fire it up , and you ’ll be prompted to allow the application superuser permissions - make sure you approve it .
The first thing you ’ll need to do is flash the ClockworkMod recovery image that I mentioned earlier , which can be done right in the app ( it ’s the first option ) .
ROM
Manager should automatically find the latest version of the right image for your phone , download , and install it - the whole process is seamless .
After that is done , you can simply use the ‘ Manage and Restore Backups ’ , and ‘ Backup current ROM ’ options to , well , backup your current ROM or restore from an existing backup .
It ’s that simple !
At Android Police , we always encourage supporting developers , so please check out ROM Manager Premium if you enjoyed the free version !
Save Space On Your Phone
While Google did introduce Apps2SD ( moving parts of applications to external storage ) officially in the Froyo update , it remains up to developers to manually add support for it in their apps .
Because of that , it 's still fairly easy to overflow your internal storage and run out of space .
The easiest way to alleviate this problem and enable most applications to be movable to SD would be to flash a custom ROM that enables just that .
For example , CyanogenMod , the most popular Android custom ROM , allows the user to force most apps to SD even if developers of those apps did n't enable this feature .
See 13 Ways CyanogenMod 7 Makes My Android Phone Feel Future - Proof [ Deep Review ] for more info on this and other amazing features of CyanogenMod .
Note that this does n't work on all apps , notably keyboards and apps with widgets .
Run Special Applications
Update 6/26/11 : Rather than list apps that are supercharged by having root access here , we started a series dedicated to them .
Here are the first parts of Top Android Apps Every Rooted User Should Know About :
Install Custom ROMs
The Android custom ROM scene started growing shortly after the first Android phone , the T - Mobile G1 , was released .
The ROMs that were initially available just offered a few tweaks here and there - access to developer only sections of the operating system , debugging information , and things of that nature .
Now , a few years after the release of the G1 , the Android ROM community has grown immensely , and ROMs have been developed for most of the Android phones currently on the market .
They 've gone far beyond simple tweaks and can now give your phone an entirely new look and feel .
There are ROMs that can make your phone fly by replacing the kernel with hyper - optimized versions or even overclocking the CPU .
The possibilities are nearly limitless and attempting to cover all of the features of all the ROM 's available for all of the phones out there would be pretty much impossible .
If you 're interested in flashing a custom ROM on your phone , your best bet is to hit the Googles , search for " phonename custom ROM , " and see what comes up .
You 'll likely find at least one forum dedicated to hacking your phone with plenty of information to get you started .
Here at AndroidPolice , we 're planning a series of custom ROM reviews for as many phones as we can get our hands on .
Stay tuned for updates !
Check out our more detailed guide that dives a little deeper into the reasons to go custom :

Good luck and happy rooting !
Have you rooted your phone ?
If so , what are you running ?
When did George Harrison visit Illinois and Why ?
The year was 1963 and for a two week period in September George Harrison and his brother Peter visited their sister Louise in Southern Illinois .
Like so many events in the life of The Beatles , the circumstances surrounding this visit , including the purchase of his first Rickenbacker , have yet to be described in any detail up until the present time .
After an extended search a few individuals have been located in the Mt. Vernon area who spent time with George and his brother during this visit .
They have kindly offered what they know about his stay at 113 McCann Street in Benton , Illinois and the purchase of the solid body " cresting wave " single pickup Rickenbacker 425 .
More than 35 years later it is quite amazing to realize that one of The Beatles was able to visit the United States for a two week period and go almost completely unnoticed .
The historical information to date is presented in the brief article contained on this page .
As with all of the articles on " NO REPLY " your input is requested , either in the form of a critique or in additional facts that you may be able to add .
Where was the 425 Purchased ?
Mr. Gabe McCarty , formerly of the Illinois music group the " Four Vests " provided invaluable information regarding George Harrison 's purchase of his first Rickenbacker , a 425 Model .
Mr. McCarty experienced what most would consider to be a dream of a lifetime .
He spent two weeks with George and his bother Peter in the fall of 1963 .
This visit took place at a time when almost nobody in the Mt. Vernon area knew anything about George Harrison .
The selection and pruchase took place at the Fenton Music Store located at 601 South 10th Street , Mt. Vernon , Illinois .
Lester " Red " Fenton operated this music store in 1963 at the time of the sale and continued to be its proprietor until the mid 1980's .
Mr. Fenton died in 1991 .
There we no pictures available of this store at the time this article was posted .
" NO REPLY " would be grateful for any picutres that interested readers may be able to submit to the Rickenbacker Registration Page .
What Were The Details Surrounding The Purchase ?
Shortly after arriving in Illinois , George Harrison met Gabe McCarty and another member of the " Four Vests , " Vernon Mandrell .
George expressed his interest in purchasing a Rickenbacker guitar and Gabe knew that the only dealer nearby was the Fenton Music Store .
Apparently Rickenbackers were difficult to come by in England at this time and in Gabe 's words " He just had to have one . "
Mr. McCarty volunteered to drive Harrison from Benton to the store in Mount Vernon to try out a Rickenbacker .
Gabe recalled his pitch " Red , he 's a good friend of mine and wants to buy a Rickenbacker guitar .
Give him the same discount you gave me . "
The Four Vests had fostered a good relationship with Red Fenton as they had purchased equipment from him only a short time earlier .
In his reminiscence of the events that day , Gabe mentioned " George pulled a couple of guitars off the wall " and eventually decided on a Fireglo ( red ) Rickenbacker Model 425 .
This description is validated by the research carried out by Mr. John Hall of Rickenbacker International Corporation which indicates that the guitar Harrison purchased , based on the serial number of BH 439 , was shipped from the factory in the Fireglo finish .
It has also been confirmed by Mr. Hall , that this instrument was shipped by the factory , in error , as a Model 425 even thought it was in fact a Model 420 , having no vibrato .
After all these years this is not the time to rewrite history , and so a Model 425 it remains to this day .
The serial number would indicate that the guitar was made in August 1962 .
That it was " red " is of particular interest .
It is well know that Harrison performed with this guitar on the " Ready Steady Go " television show hosted by Dusty Springfield on October 4 , 1963 , however , the instrument had been refinished to black by that time .
But how did that refinishing come about ?
Why was the 425 Refinished to Black ?
Just days after his return to England in September 1963 Harrison performed with his new 425 during The Beatles ' first appearance on the " Ready Steady Go " television show .
The guitar was , however , no longer in its pristine factory Fireglo finish but had been refinished to black .
He briefly discussed his new purchase and in an interesting comment made to Dusty about its finish quipped " I made it myself . "
This of course , raised the suspicion of some that he had been involved in the refinishing .
Fortunately the comments of the Four Vests have been most helpful in getting to the bottom of such speculation .
Gabe McCarty vividly recalled that Harrison liked the 425 very much but preferred to have it in black similar to the one owned by John Lennon .
He remembers George asking " Do n't you have any black ones . "
Red Fenton , asked Harrison to " give me a week " but that he would be able to comply with his request .
Gabe described that he , Harrison and Vernon Mandrell returned to Fenton Music a week later to pick up the guitar .
Why and Where was the 425 Refinished ?
Gabe McCarty could not understand why George wanted to paint over the especially nice famous fireglo finish that was highly sought after by Rickenbacker lovers .
In reference to the Beatles , George explained that " all the other guys had black instruments " and that the color fit in best with the band .
Gabe also felt that the gist of the argument was that a black guitar fitted in best with the dark suits that the Beatles wore on stage .
Mr. McCarty assessed that the refinishing was carried out in the Fenton Music store as Red Fenton had the expertise and there were no other shops about that Gabe was aware of that could do this work at the time .
In referring to Red , Mr. McCarty offered " I thought he did it himself .
It looked real good and I was quite surprised . "
George Harrison paid in cash , about $ 400 US , for the guitar .
He apparently had no idea of the value of American dollars compared to the pound sterling and at first took out close to $ 800 .
to pay for the 425 .
Most interesting and important historical information has surfaced thanks to the kind efforts of Mr. David Artis .
Mr. Artis writes " I was only 16 in 1963 and had recently purchased my first guitar ( a Harmony imitation of a Gibson 335 ) from Red .
In 1964 , I worked part - time for RED while in high school .
I did not get to met George Harrision in 1963 but I remember RED telling me after the Beatles had been on the Ed Sullivan show that he had sold the insturment to Harrision and that he had redone the finish in black at his request .
RED personally thought it a waste to ruin the fireglow finish of the instrument but he truly believed in giving the customer what they wanted .
This seemed to be a guessed at issue , as to who did the finish , so I thought I would give you what RED had told me .
Other Events During Harrison's Stay
There were a number of other interesting events that took place during the Harrison 's visit to Southern Illinois that are related to George 's Model 425 Rickenbacker .
The day in which George returned to purchase his newly refinished guitar , Gabe recalled " he plugged it into an amp and we jammed for about 30 - 40 minutes in Fenton 's Music Store . "
Red did not know the more contemporatry rock music songs and so George on his 425 and Gabe on a bass from the store played more traditional " pop songs such as It Had To Be You . "
Mr. McCarty also indicated that George played two gigs with the " Four Vests " during September 1963 at the Veterans of Foreign Wars ( VFW ) Hall in Eldorado , Illinois and also at the Bocchi Ball Club in Benton .
Gabe was sure that George was going to play some of his Beatles ' material but this never happened with Harrison performing mostly Hank William 's country tunes at both venues .
Apparently George quite fancied having The Beatles play in the Benton area at some point and went so far as to schedule a concert at the Benton Country Club .
The pandemonium was so great when The Beatles visited in 1964 , however , that the planned concert was never realized .
George also played with the lead guitarist of the " Four Vests , " Kenny Welch and Gabe in his sister Louise 's livingroom in Benton at 113 McCann Street .
Gabe said that George was very taken by Kenny 's style and watched him intently but never really said much about Mr. Welch 's ability .
According to Mr. McCarty , Harrison 's style was much like the picking style of Chet Atkins .
There was discussion about moving this home before it was sold in 1995 , however , it remains in its original location to the present day .
Its exterior was refurbished to resemble its 1963 look and the residence is currently a Bed and Breakfast and museum honouring George Harrison 's stay .
A number of enthusiastic fans wold just not let the idea of saving the Residence go .

Editor 's note : Grant Smith is the federal policy coordinator for the Drug Policy Alliance 's office of national affairs .
The group calls itself the nation 's leading organization working to end the war on drugs , to be replaced with new drug policies based on " science , compassion , health and human rights . "
( CNN ) --
The recent emergence in the United States of " K2 , " sometimes called synthetic marijuana , is testing lawmakers to see if they 've been paying attention to the failures of marijuana prohibition and will respond to K2 with enlightened policy .
The first stories on K2 , or " Spice , " broke out with headlines labeling the mixture of herbs and spices , which are treated with a synthetic compound , as " fake pot . "
K2 was virtually unknown until the media hyped up its presence at tobacco and novelty shops .
Under U.S. law , and in all 50 states , the herbal product is legal , and also unregulated .
People who have tried K2 often report psychoactive effects that are comparable to marijuana , but notably less pleasurable .
When lawmakers consider regulating K2 , they should keep in mind that the government has waged a futile war against marijuana and people who use the drug for decades .
For another opinion , click here
Elected officials have burned through billions of taxpayer dollars chasing marijuana sellers , bagging marijuana plants and jailing marijuana users .
Government - funded media campaigns have sought to scare children and adults away from marijuana with grossly exaggerated claims that using the drug will lead to death and mayhem .
Despite all of these efforts , the public has largely dismissed the myths and hysteria around marijuana and recognized that the drug has important medicinal benefits .
Moreover , public opinion is leaning in favor of a regulated and taxed market for marijuana .
Researchers who have tested K2 identified synthetic chemicals that are thought to mimic the psychoactive component in marijuana .
These chemicals are thought to act on the cannabinoid receptors in the brain much the way that THC -- the principal psychoactive component in marijuana -- operates .
What 's notable about these synthetic chemicals is that very little is known about them , and this legal alternative designed to deliver an experience like marijuana may actually carry more risk .
Thus we have a supreme irony of drug prohibition :
The government continues to criminalize marijuana -- a drug with established medical value that has undergone exhaustive study -- and entrepreneurs introduce a legal alternative to marijuana with ingredients scientists know little about .
Given this potential for harm , and the growing volume of sensational media portrayals of K2 , some lawmakers have ignored the lessons learned from marijuana prohibition and moved to criminalize possession and sales of K2 .
Lawmakers in Kansas , Kentucky and Missouri have already written legislation to ban the herbal mix .
It seems that a reporter need only write an article about an obscure bag of twigs to spur a lawmaker to criminalize more chemicals and the people who use them .
Time and time again , elected officials have dropped the ball when it comes to regulating drugs .
Lawmakers have preferred to lazily pass the responsibility of controlling a drug on to law enforcement and the criminal justice system .
The problem is , we know from marijuana prohibition that law enforcement has no control over the drug market and the criminals who run it .
Criminalizing K2 will only worsen the devastating harm our society already suffers under drug prohibition .
Rather than regulation of the supply and ingredients of K2 , criminalization leaves the question of what goes into the product up to drug dealers .
Rather than passing regulations that bar K2 sales to minors , criminalizing K2 will essentially give dealers the green light to sell the product to whomever they please .
By choosing to ban K2 outright , lawmakers will also forfeit badly needed state revenue from K2 sales and instead commit millions of taxpayer dollars to investigate , prosecute and jail K2 users .
Plus , researchers point out that hundreds of other known synthetic chemicals will easily reach store shelves once K2 is banned .
The sensible legislative response to K2 is to create effective regulatory controls on sale and possession .
California and Maine have passed model legislation that formally regulates and taxes adult sales of salvia divinorium -- another product with psychoactive properties -- and criminalizes salvia sales to minors .
Lawmakers should deliver a knockout to prohibition and pass laws that will actually regulate and control K2 .

What In The World Are They Spraying ?
By Michael J. Murphy
03 March , 2010
Countercurrents.org
What would you say if you were told that airplanes were regularly spraying toxic aerosols in the skies above every major region of the world ?
That is exactly what a group of protestors were claiming outside of the annual American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) meeting that was held in San Diego from February 18 - 22 .
However , inside the convention center was a different story .
The scientists gathered to discuss the “ plausibility ” of implementing various Geo-engineering campaigns throughout the world , all under the guise that the Earth has a man -made global warming problem that can be solved in - part by spraying aerosol aluminum and other particles into the sky to block the sun .
When these scientists were asked about the possibility of existing aerosol programs ; they stated that no aerosol spraying programs have been implemented to date .
A little confused ?
Why would protestors gather outside of a meeting making claims that world - wide aerosol programs were under way if scientist were only now discussing the possibility of implementing these programs ?
Could it be that one of these groups is being deceived ?
Mauro Oliveira , the Webmaster of Geoengineeringwatch.org , was one of the protestors .
He claimed that the program for Stratospheric Aerosol Geo-engineering ( SAG ) , AKA chemtrails , has been well under way around the world .
As a matter of fact , Oliveira stated that witnesses from around the globe claim that heavy aerosol spraying is occurring almost every day over just about every city .
He went on to explain the difference between a contrail and a chemtrail .
He stated that when a jet airplane flies at a certain altitude , a visible trail of streaks of condensed water vapor sometimes form in the wake of the aircraft .
This is called a contrail .
Contrails are normal and usually dissipate in a few seconds .
They are very similar to when we breathe in cold weather .
According to Oliveira , what occurs behind a SAG plane spraying aerosols is quite different .
What can be seen is a thick white line also called a chemtrail that lingers in the sky for several hours .
The SAG lines are sprayed into the upper atmosphere and then spread out forming what then appear to be clouds .
The particles from these aerosols then fall to the ground where they enter our soil and water and can also be inhaled .
Another group of protestors had traveled over 10 hours from a small Shasta County community in Northern California .
They became concerned about SAG when many from this community began to see dramatic changes not only in the sky , but also on the ground .
Trees were dying , grass was not growing and many farmers were having difficulty getting any crops to grow on their farms .
The crisis prompted biologists from the community to take action by testing the soil .
The results were shocking .
Aluminum , barium and other elements were found to be up to thousands of times higher than normal limits .
Such high quantities lead to unhealthy PH levels in the soil which can be deadly to ecological life systems .
These shocking results led to additional testing of Lake Shasta with samples from the Pit River arm tributary that tested over 4,610 times the maximum contamination level of aluminum allowed in drinking water in the state of California .
Also , peer reviewed scientific studies conclude that bio-available aluminum , now found in huge quantities in rain world - wide , is very harmful to flora and thus the eco-system .
Ironically , these are the same substances the scientists are considering implementing in the various potential “ future ” aerosol spraying campaigns that were being discussed at the meeting .
A large number of other protesters became interested in SAG after experiencing burning eyes , migraine headaches , anxiety , irregular heartbeat , high blood pressure and other health problems on days that airplanes were allegedly witnessed spraying aerosols in the sky .
Deborah Whitman , Founder and President of the non-profit environmental organization Environmental Voices and also Producer of the documentary “ Sky Lines ” is no stranger to these symptoms .
She has been hospitalized over 51 times on what she calls “ heavy spraying days ” .
Whitman has committed her life to helping people who claim to be experiencing similar problems resulting from aerosol spraying and gets calls from all over the U.S. in response to her website and documentary .
Her recommended health tips can be found at www.environmentalvoices.org.
Other indicators that possibly validate the claim that SAG is connected to health problems are the respiratory mortality rate , which has risen from eight on the list of mortality to third in the past five years , and the fact that Alzheimer ’s and other illnesses linked to aluminum have continued to rise around the globe at astronomical rates since the inception of the alleged spraying .
The AAAS meeting hosted some of the world ’s leading geo-engineering scientists .
With years of education and even more experience in their respected fields , the scientists looked at geo- engineering issues from many angles .
Workshop subjects ranged from , the effectiveness of geo-engineering to potential problems and even touched upon the issue of ethics .
According to independent reporter Stewart Howe of Los Angeles , all of the scientists seemed to be looking for solutions to what they believe is the problem of global warming .
Howe stated that the scientists appeared to be carefully weighing both the pros and cons of SAG when presenting potential campaigns to address the man -made global warming theory .
Many were actually advocating alternative methods to combat this issue due to the potential risks of SAG that include droughts , ozone depletion , less solar power , decimated weather patterns , military use of technology and other various environmental impacts .
Howe said , “ after witnessing the aerosol spraying for years , I was surprised by the discourse among scientists . ”
Stewart went on to say that he believes that most of the scientists attending seemed to be separated from the knowledge of any current SAG deployment .
As a matter of fact when asked about current SAG operations , leading geo-engineering scientist Ken Caldiera replied that he was unaware of any current aerosol spraying operations and when prompted to explain the long lingering trails left behind planes , he stated that they are simply normal contrails from jets .
David Keith , another leading scientist and expert in the field of geo- engineering , discussed the well - funded studies that have been conducted to predict potential future risks as well as benefits associated with geo-engineering .
Some of the potential benefits include a cooler planet , and the reduction of melting sea ice and rising sea levels .
Keith discussed what aerosol particles would be most effective in achieving the stated goals of the SAG program .
He went on to say that initially sulfur was considered , however , aluminum is more effective and can be used by adding ten to twenty mega - tons per year into the stratosphere .
When asked about health related studies that have been conducted to predict the potential risks of adding the particles in our air , Keith stated that many studies have been completed and indicate few risks .
However , when asked specifically about the use of aluminum as an aerosol , he said “ we have n’t done anything serious on aluminum , so there could be something terrible that we will find tomorrow that we have n't looked at . "
After the meeting , Keith showed consideration to the protesters by initiating a discussion about the SAG program outside where the protestors were standing .
When confronted with concerns about SAG deployment from the group , he went on to say that he shared similar views and is against any deployment until proper research is completed to determine potential risks of aerosol spraying .
He also went on to say that he is unaware of any current SAG operations , but , would be willing to look at any scientific proof if presented to him .
As the skies around our world continue to change , there is strong evidence that points toward current deployment of massive aerosol operations .
Could it be that scientific data and studies are being used to implement pre-mature full - scale SAG programs with - out the knowledge of the top scientists who are involved with the research ?
If so , what kind of ethical considerations can we expect from the geo-engineering community in the future ?
It is hard to believe that the strange white lines in the skies witnessed around the world and the toxic elements found in the soil , water and air are from an unrelated source .
We the people , in partnership with the scientific community need to challenge not only the environmental and health risks associated with SAG but also the numerous world - wide allegations about current deployment .
It is imperative that we become educated and involved in uncovering the truth of this alleged crime against both nature and humanity .

The memory capacity of electronics devices could be increased in future thanks to an organic data storage system using ternary rather than binary data storage .
The current prototype is designed for permanent data storage , and can be written once but read multiple times , but the Chinese researchers hope to develop re-writable data storage based on the technology .
Binary systems record data as a switchable series of zeros and ones , whereas ternary systems record data as zeros , ones or twos , which are also electrically switchable states .
The extra value theoretically means much more data could be stored in the same amount of storage space .
Ternary systems already exist , but are mostly experimental .
A new system , developed by Hongwei Gu and Jianmei Lu and colleagues at Soochow University , Suzhou in eastern China , is a ternary system using a new synthesized organic azo compound sandwiched between aluminum and indium tin oxide ( ITO ) electrodes .
Each electrode unit acts as a data storage unit , which acts in a similar way to the magnetized patches in a hard disk that store data .
When a voltage is applied to the aluminum electrode , the ease of electron flow ( and density of molecular stacking ) in the azo compound is changed to a low , medium or high conductivity state that corresponds to zero , one , or two respectively .

A group of scientists , led by Ritesh Agarwal at the University of Pennsylvania , have previously used inorganic compounds to develop a reliable ternary data storage that is erasable , but Lu and Gu’s prototype is the first reliable ternary system using an organic compound in a permanent data storage device .
High - density data storage ( HDDS ) systems are needed to store the ever increasing amounts of information .
The prototype developed at Soochow University could lead to a massive increase in the potential memory density in future electronics devices .
The paper is published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society .

The encoding used for an HTML page that contains a form should support all the characters needed to enter data into that form .
This is particularly important if users are likely to enter information in multiple languages .
Databases and scripts that receive data from forms on pages in multiple languages must also be able to support the characters for all those languages simultaneously .
The simplest way to enable this is to use Unicode for both pages containing forms and all back - end processing and storage .
In such a scenario the user can fill in data in whatever language and script they need to .
You should also try to avoid making assumptions that things such as the user 's name and address will follow the same formatting rules as your own .
Ask yourself how much detail you really need to break out into separate fields for things such as addresses .
Bear in mind that in some cultures there are no street names , in others the house number follows the street name , some people need more than one line for the part of the address that precedes the town or city name , etc .
In fact in some places an address runs top down from the general to the specific , which implies a very different layout strategy .
Be very careful about building into validation routines incorrect assumptions about area codes or telephone number lengths .
Recognize that careful labelling is required for how to enter numeric dates , since there are different conventions for ordering of day , month and year .
If you are gathering information from people in more than one country , it is important to develop a strategy for addressing the different formats people will expect to be able to use .
Not only is this important for the design of the forms you create , but it also has an impact on how you will store such information in databases .
The Wild began its offseason makeover Monday , cutting ties with longtime goaltending coach Bob Mason , who has been with the organization since 2002 .
“ He had an incredible run here , ” General Manager Bill Guerin said on a video conference call .
“ I have nothing negative to say about him .
Sometimes you just need change , and at that position we needed a change . ”
Guerin was disappointed with the Wild ’s performance in net this past season , which ended on Friday when the team was eliminated from the Stanley Cup qualifiers by the Canucks in four games .
Although both Devan Dubnyk and Alex Stalock are under contract for next season , Guerin said the hierarchy is not clear .
“ Al had a tremendous year and Devan had an off year , and it needs to be better , ” Guerin said .
“ That 's just the way it is .
And if I told you anything different , I 'd be lying to you .
It was not a strong point for us . ”
This was Mason ’s 18th year as the organization ’s goalie coach .
The native of International Falls played two seasons at Minnesota - Duluth , was a member of Team USA at the 1984 Olympics and spent parts of eight seasons in the NHL with Washington , Chicago , the Quebec Nordiques and Vancouver .
In addition to hiring a new goalie coach , the Wild also plans to bring on a new assistant coach .
Current assistant Bob Woods and Darby Hendrickson will be back , Guerin said .
Workers hospitalized after boss shoots them .
Two building workers have been hospitalized in Moscow after their boss shot at them with a Makarych pistol using rubber bullets .
The incident happened around midnight in Moscow when workers who are carrying out building repair works at Izveztia confronted their boss , who had n't paid them .
The director of the firm took out his pistol and opened fire .

The return of the child provoked outrage in Russia Russia says it has halted adoptions of Russian children by US citizens , after a boy of seven was sent back to Moscow alone by his adoptive American mother .
The Russian foreign ministry said the freeze would apply until a bilateral adoption agreement could be signed .
However the US state department said its Russian embassy had been told there was no such suspension and was seeking clarification from Moscow .
It will send a delegation to Moscow next week to discuss the incident .
There was an international outcry last week when the adoptive mother , a nurse , sent the Russian boy on a one - way flight to Moscow on his own .
She sent a note with him saying the boy had psychological issues .
" To Whom It May Concern , " the letter read .
" This child is mentally unstable .
He is violent and has severe psychopathic issues .
I was lied to and misled by the Russian orphanage workers and director regarding his mental stability and other issues . "
Torry Hansen , 33 , reportedly adopted the boy from Russia 's Far Eastern town of Partizansk last September .
' Recent tragedies '
The US state department is arranging for a high - level delegation to visit Moscow next week to discuss the possibility of a bilateral adoption agreement .
Russian foreign ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko told a TV briefing : " Russia believes only such an agreement will ensure that recent tragedies in the United States will not be repeated . "
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the incident was " the last straw " Russians are furious that no charges have been brought ; US authorities have been investigating allegations of abuse and child abandonment .
A Tennessee sheriff told a news conference earlier this week that Ms Hansen 's lawyer had said she would not talk to the authorities unless charged .
The adoptive family hired a driver in Moscow to deliver the boy from the airport to the Russian ministry of education on Thursday of last week .
The driver , Artur Lukyanov , has told AP news agency that on the way into town the boy had played with toys and told him in English how big the lorries were in America .
A US adoption agency assigned to check on the family , Adoption Assistance , said earlier this week that its officials had not been able to contact Ms Hansen since March .
The agency said in a statement that the child had appeared to be adjusting well during a visit by a social worker in January to the family home in Shelbyville , a town about 80 km ( 50 miles ) south of Nashville .
Ms Hansen 's mother , Nancy Hansen , has been quoted as saying that the child had threatened to burn the family 's home to the ground .
Thousands of American would - be adoptive parents have been petitioning leaders of the Russian and US presidents to prevent the threatened adoption freeze by Moscow .
Russian lawmakers have previously urged the suspension of American adoptions after other alleged cases of Russian children being mistreated .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has called the most recent incident " the last straw " .
More than 1,800 Russian children were adopted in the US last year , according to Russia 's health and education ministry .

Just as important , Ms. Barayeva is considered responsible for inspiring a movement of “ black widows ”  women who have lost a husband , child or close relative to the “ occupation ” and killed themselves on missions to even the score .
In total , 24 Chechen females ranging in age from 15 to 37 have carried out suicide attacks , including the most deadly  the coordinated bombings of two passenger flights in August 2004 that caused 90 deaths and ( according to Russian authorities ) the subway blasts on Monday that killed nearly 40 .

The bombers ’ motives spring directly from their experiences with Russian troops , according to Abu al - Walid , a rebel leader who was killed in 2004 .
“ These women , particularly the wives of the mujahedeen who were martyred , are being threatened in their homes , their honor [ is ] being threatened , ” he explained in a video that appeared on Al Jazeera .
“ They do not accept being humiliated and living under occupation . ”
And female suicide attackers have one more advantage :
They can often travel inconspicuously to their targets .
A July 2003 investigative report by the Russian news magazine Kommersant - Vlast found that a potential female suicide bomber could easily avoid public suspicion .
Just days after a Chechen suicide bomber , Zarema Muzhakhoyeva , tried but failed to blow up a Moscow cafe in 2003 , one of the magazine ’s journalists  wearing a niqab , tightly clutching a black satchel to her chest , and behaving in a nervous manner  was able to get a table at the same cafe without ever being questioned .
Perhaps not surprisingly , Chechen women have carried out 8 of the 10 suicide attacks in Moscow .
Although we are still learning the details of Monday ’s bombings , there were warnings that a major attack in Russia was coming .
Twice this year one of Chechnya ’s leading rebel commanders , Doku Umarov , issued video statements warning of attacks in Russia proper .
“ The Russians think the war is distant , ” he said .
“ Blood will not only spill in our towns and villages but also it will spill in their towns ... our military operations will encompass the entirety of Russia . ”
He also made clear that his campaign was not about restoring any Islamic caliphate , but about Chechen independence : “ This is the land of our brothers and it is our sacred duty to liberate these lands . ”
With so many Chechen suicide attacks , one could easily be forgiven for being skeptical about the prospects for a lasting peace .
Yet , a closer examination of the conflict ’s history suggests solutions that both sides may be able to accept .
The trajectory of Chechnya ’s suicide campaign reveals a stark pattern : 27 attacks from June 2000 to November 2004 , no attacks until October 2007 , and 18 since .
What explains the three - year pause ?
The answer is loss of public support in Chechnya for the rebellion , for two reasons .
The first was revulsion against the 2004 Beslan school massacre in which Chechen rebels murdered hundreds of Russian children .
“ A bigger blow could not have been dealt on us , ” one of the separatists ’ spokesmen said at the time .
“ People around the world will think that Chechens are beasts and monsters if they could attack children . ”
Second , the Russians pursued a robust hearts - and - minds program to win over the war - torn population .
Military operations killed significantly fewer civilians .
Amnesty was granted to rebel fighters and nearly 600 Chechen separatists surrendered in 2006 alone .

These are notes of a lecture given by Prof Tim Palmer on some of the fundamentals of weather prediction .
The notes were taken by Simon Anthony .
This is well worth a read , and I 'm certainly struck by how little we know about how to forecast the climate .
If we can't forecast next month 's weather , what hope for predicting climate 100 years from now ?
Lecture at Dept of Earth Sciences , University of Oxford by Professor Tim Palmer , Royal Society Professor at Oxford , previously at European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts .
[ In contrast to simplistic fixed view of climate change preferred by journalists and politicians , TP adopts more traditional scientific view : create and develop models , make predictions , compare predictions with actual measurements , revise / replace models , try to understand models ’ limitations .
He seems happy to talk about uncertainties .
That said , he did sign the Met Office “ Statement from the UK Science Community ” …
http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article6950783.ece .
Taken together with his final suggestion of the need for a “ CERN for Climate ” , I ’d say he seems like a good scientist who believes in the importance of his science , trying to argue the best case for that science but not necessarily too concerned about “ collateral damage ” . ]
Why ask this question ?
Following Climategate , Glaciergate and the repeated failure of Met Office ’s seasonal forecasts , this is a question the public and commentators often ask rhetorically to argue that long - term climate predictions must be nothing more than guesswork .
An answer for the public
The failure of short - term prediction does n't necessarily mean long - term forecasts wo n’t work but you need to be clear what ’s being predicted on different time - scales .
An illustration is the Lorenz model : a simplified weather model which showed " sensitive dependence on initial conditions " ( aka the " butterfly effect " ) : two initially very close states may diverge to very different later states .
Lorenz 's model “ flips ” between two different states ; when it flips or how long it stays in one state before going to the other is unpredictable .
However , the probability of being in either state over a long period is entirely predictable .
Warm and cold winters and greenhouse gases
The two states might be interpreted as " cold " and " warm " winter " ; while it is n't possible to predict whether a particular winter will be cold or warm , the proportion of each type of winter can be predicted .
When an extra " forcing " term is added to the Lorenz model , the system 's flips are still unpredictable but the relative probabilities of the two states change in a predictable way .
The forcing might be interpreted as the effect of greenhouse gases being added .
You ca n’t say for sure whether this coming winter will be warm or cold but the model predicts that warm winters will be increasingly probable .
TP does n’t mean that this is a realistic model .
It ’s only used to make the obvious point that even though you ca n’t predict the throw of a die , if thrown a lot of times , the probability that a particular number comes up is nonetheless predictable .
Weather is a particular event while climate is the probability of particular events occurring .
Hurricane Fish and the butterfly
The butterfly effect in real weather is exemplified by Michael Fish ’s 1987 misfortune .
At that time the Met Office made one prediction , based on measured data , for any given time - scale .
On October 15th , 1987 , that single forecast on which MF relied , did n't predict the UK hurricane .
Nowadays people do ensemble forecasting – they use not just the actual measurements but a number of similar but slightly altered values – and sometimes also average over different weather models .
All these forecasts are run and the probability of various future weathers is assessed .
Ensemble forecasts made using the data available to MF forecast predict , with significant probability , hurricanes in SE UK , as well as lots of other results .
The initial conditions in October 1987 were unstable with a range of very different local predictions .
Forecast probabilities
If the public better understood probability , the Met Office could give the relative probability of different forecasts .
Such predictions can be quite good .
For example , ECMRWF predicts the probability of precipitation throughout Europe , then looks at places for which probability is , say , 60 % to see whether the fraction which actually experience precipitation is 60 % .
Predictions are n’t perfect but work well ( to within ~ 2 - 3 % ) across the whole range of probabilities .
So the straightforward answer is that short - term failures of weather prediction are due to the perceived requirement of giving a single forecast rather than a range of forecasts with different probabilities .
If the probabilities can be accurately predicted then very long - range climate forecasts may still be possible .
Weather influences climate
But that was the easy message : the real relationship between weather and climate is subtler and more complex because initially small - scale weather effects may become amplified to affect climate .
It ’s not obvious beforehand when such complications will occur .
For example , using the same models that work well at predicting short - term weather probabilities , you can make regional seasonal forecasts and assess them in a similar way .
TP has found that predictions are OK for , for example , Amazon and Central America but completely wrong for Northern Europe , no better than chance .
It seems that climate models may have systematic biases , for example persistent blocking anti-cyclones ( as the UK has experienced for the past few months ) are typically under - represented in climate models .
“ Robust ” prediction goes wrong
Should the reliability of ensemble forecasts matter for regional climate predictions ?
One school of thought holds that since the lifetime of a blocking anti-cyclone is very brief compared to , say , 100 years they do n't matter .
TP thinks this may be simplistic .
For example , IPCC AR4 described a supposedly robust signal for future warmer and dryer European summers , typified by that of 2003 .
But these predictions used a model with a grid spacing of ~ 160 km .
When the calculations are repeated on a grid spacing of ~ 20 km , the signal is much weaker and fragmentary .
It seems as though the difference is due to the higher frequency of blocking a /c at the finer resolution .
The point is that climate models running on computers can’t include features smaller than their grid size but the actual climate may amplify the importance of such features so that they make a significant difference to climate predictions .
Possible fundamental problems
How much resolution is needed to capture climate change details ?
For example , convective instabilities ( ~ km scale ) are n't included in climate models ; should they be ?
Does higher resolution reduce uncertainty ?
There ’s no good theory for estimating how well climate simulations converge with increasing resolution .
Even worse , the equations themselves change with finer resolution as new features have to be included .
The underlying unknown is whether there is an irreducible level of uncertainty in the climate equations .
How do you test predictions of climate 100 years hence ?
Obviously you ca n’t use the traditional method of comparison with real measurements .
You can only make and test relatively short - term predictions .
When these are accurate , with known limitations and the same models are used for 100 - year prediction , then you may have confidence in the longer - term predictions .
We need bigger computers
All of which invites the question : does climate science have enough computing power to establish its own limitations ?
Perhaps there ’s a need for a “ CERN for climate science ” , something apparently to be proposed here …

My Story
I wrote about my personal story ( albeit in a different context ) in 2006 .
I 'm going to retell a part of that story here so that everyone understands where I 'm coming from .
I 'm in my early 40's .
You could n't pay me to re-live high school .
Even with 25 years plus of distance between myself and high school , the experiences I had still grate , still define ( on some level ) who I am and why I do what I do , and still haunt me to a certain extent .
Did you ever meet that kid in high school who was just kind of out of place ?
There are some who are out of place and know it - they embrace their " differentness " , incorporate it into who they are and roll with it .
But there are those - and I was one of those - who really wanted to be accepted , yet never was .
That 's a painful enough experience , frankly - to be rejected by one 's peer group .
25 + years has , of course , brought some measure of perspective and a requisite distance which has allowed me to see that these people , whose approval I sought , are not people I would want to know or talk to or hang out with today - but in high school - the center of my teenage universe - it was The.
Most .
Important .
Thing .
It 's one thing to be simply rejected - ignored , treated as though you are irrelevant .
That 's painful in its own way .
It 's another entirely to be actively persecuted , tormented , and vilified .
I fell into the latter category .
I 'll give you a few examples .
It started right at the end of 8th grade .
My mother was always my example for how I wanted high school to go for me .
She had been a stellar student , a cheerleader , and popular .
She told me stories the way mothers who love their daughters tell stories .
She did n't foist expectations on me .
Rather , I adopted them for myself .
At the end of 8th grade , I decided to try out for the freshman cheerleading squad .
I can almost remember my rationale - if I could try out and make it , I 'd achieve the equivalent of the social Holy Grail .
I was n't popular at that point - but I was n't UNpopular , if that makes sense .
I was just kind of not there , more or less , to the crowd that enjoyed popularity .
So I tried out for cheerleading .
The problem was , I did n't work very hard to prepare for the tryout and I was n't very good .
So naturally , I did n't make the squad .
I took some teasing over that - but it was n't around - the - bend .
Just garden - variety stuff ( if there is such a thing ) .
After trying out and failing ( rightfully ) , I dedicated the next year to working towards the goal of trying out again at the end of my freshman year and getting a spot on the junior varsity cheerleading squad .
I had always been a big girl throughout high school - solid and tall .
Not overweight , but not slender , either .
So the end of freshman year rolls around .
I sign up for cheerleading tryouts .
I take a lot of shit over that - " You 'll never make it - why are you trying out ? "
Stuff like that .
But I had worked for this .
I had been improving my flexibility and my strength .
I had been practicing the cheers I 'd seen the cheerleaders doing .
I knew that stuff COLD .
And when tryout day came around , I did great .
It took them a few days to post the results .
The school was divided into color - coded locker rooms ( corresponding to each grade ) and each locker room area had offices associated with that grade .
Staff moved with students throughout their high school tenure , and any and all notices pertaining to a particular grade were posted in the administrative areas next to the locker rooms for that particular grade ( I hope that makes sense ) .
Freshmen were in the blue locker room area .
Because , at the end of the year , they were ascending sophomores , all notices pertaining to the next year were posted in the blue locker room area .
When the cheerleading squad information came out , the 9th grade staff posted a big poster board and put it on an easel in the middle of the freshman area .
Everyone was guaranteed to see it .
It was a Friday .
The results were posted after lunch .
I remember feeling nauseated as I entered the locker room area and spied the poster board from across the space .
I went to my locker , switched books for my next class , and took a deep breath .
I headed for the poster board .
I looked at it - and THERE WAS MY NAME .
I had made the squad .
Joy !!
I spent the rest of the day on cloud nine .
This was WAY before the advent of cell phones , so I had to wait until I got home that afternoon to call my parents at work and tell them the good news .
I went to sleep that night knowing that my whole high school experience was going to change , that I was going to be a cheerleader and was going to be accepted .
Then came Monday .
When I entered the freshman locker room , the poster board was still there .
I went over to it to see my name again .
Next to it , someone had posted a sheet of notebook paper .
The title was " Petition to get RenaRF off of the cheerleading squad " .
There were a lot of signatures , mainly from the jocks who played sports .
I was flabbergasted .
Although I did n't realize it at the time , I was about to have my first anxiety attack .
I could n't breathe - my head was swimming .
My mouth went dry .
I got light - headed .
I thought I was going to throw up .
And it was about to get worse .
I somehow managed to get through my morning classes .
We did lunch in shifts - there were four periods , and I had the last one .
I went to my locker before lunch to stow my books .
When I opened it , a stream of garbage - from the cafeteria - mixed with dip ( chewing tobacco ) and dip spit spilled out .
Everything in my locker stank .
My notebooks and textbooks were soaked with the runoff .
At least I had had a weekend to enjoy the delusion that this was somehow a positive thing .
The taunting I endured , as well , was merciless .
I can't even remember some of the things that were said to me ( I think I 've blocked it ) , but they were uniformly intended to wound , to torment , and to belittle .
Over the coming weeks , my locker would be vandalized multiple times .
Not only that - my house was vandalized .
At first it was just someone who dug up the flower beds by our mailbox and threw the flowers into the street .
But then it got worse - they spray painted my car , garage door , and the side of the house .
After we had repainted , they came back and did it again - the car and the side of the house - and as a bonus , they spray painted " RENARF GIVES GOOD HEAD " on the garage .
I did n't even know what that meant - I had to ask my Dad .
When I did , in my sophomore year , cheer at my first pep rally , I was booed by the majority in attendance when I was annonced .
I was repeatedly told to quit , that I was n't wanted , that I was n't good enough .
Over and over .
Of course , when all of this initially started , I complained to the ninth grade staff .
I knew who had done this , but I could n't prove it .
Damage done to our home was reported to the police .
Multiple times .
My parents came in and met with the staff .
Multiple times .
Yet it continued .
It continued throughout my sophomore year and into my junior year ( I had tried out for and made Varsity cheerleading ) .
I did n't even like cheerleading at that point , you know ?
But the fuck if I was going to let them make me quit .
A new student - a boy - started at our high school at the beginning of my junior year .
In addition to cheerleading , I was involved in theater and choir ( we had a national championship level music program ) .
The new boy also got involved , and we struck up a friendship .
I had a mad crush on him , and we really did get along in those first weeks of school .
He dropped all the hints in the world that he was going to ask me to Homecoming - yet he never did .
I can't remember if I asked or if he volunteered information regarding the lack of a Homecoming invitation , but I basically was told that , while he liked me , he did n't want to commit " social suicide " - his words - by taking me .
THAT was when I finally cracked .
I considered , seriously , suicide .
My parents could n't help .
The school staff could n't / would n't help .
The police did n't do anything .
My life was a living hell of torment and ostracism .
Complaining about it , either to my parents ( who were outraged on my behalf and would promptly demand action from the school ) or to school staff only made it worse .
I had NO ONE - not a single person - in whom I could confide .
Not one person who had my back .
I was utterly alone .
I actually just stopped going to school after the whole Homecoming issue .
I think it was all I could think to do to stop the spiral of loneliness and desperation that I was in .
I 'm quite certain that it saved my life .
I wound up stealing my parents ' car , their money , and their credit cards and running away from home .
I figured I would head to Florida - it was warm there , and I could live in the car .
I made it as far as Roanoke , and I called my parents , who were beyond frightened .
When I came home the next day , I told them that if they sent me back there , I would kill myself .
Period .
And I meant it .
I was incredibly lucky , frankly , that my parents were successful and had the financial means to find a private school of my choice ( a boarding school ) where I wound up going immediately following what could have been a deadly meltdown .
There are kids who - at this very moment - are being tormented to their breaking point who do n't have those options .
" Kids will be kids "
I 've represented the word " bullying " in quotes for a reason .
It was while I was driving home yesterday , listening to CNN on satellite radio , that my outrage meter pegged on high .
From the CNN transcript :
VELSHI : All right .
The investigation found that the actions of the faculty [ in the case of Phoebe Prince ] did not amount to criminal behavior .
But could anti- bullying laws have stopped this ?
Forty - one states currently have anti-bullying laws on the books .
Both the Massachusetts House and Senate , the state where this occurred , has passed versions of a law , but they disagree on whether to require schools to train their staff on bullying prevention .
I want to bring in CNN legal analyst Lisa Bloom .
Lisa , this story really caught my attention .
And I do n't know what to think about it .
I do n't know whether to think anti-bullying laws are the answer , or anti-bullying training for teachers are the answer , or parents who are able to understand what their kids are up to and step in is the answer .
What do you think ?
LISA BLOOM , CNN LEGAL ANALYST : Well , it is a very disturbing case , Ali .
And here 's my take on it .
Why do we use the word " bullying " for behavior that , if it was done to adults , we would call stalking , harassment , threats ?
I mean , if someone was sending threats to my physical safety , to me , by text , on a daily basis , if someone were throwing objects at me on a daily basis -- VELSHI : Yes .
BLOOM : -- I would call the police .
Why do we not do that if it's a child who is the victim ?
VELSHI : I guess the question then is , where is that line ?
Because some people will say kids will be kids .
BLOOM : Right .
VELSHI : Is there some standard by which we decide what is the line ?
Is the line that you would use the same as the line that kids should use ?
If I threw something at you and abused you around the workplace , and you 'd say this is too much , this is something the police get involved in -- BLOOM : Right .
VELSHI : -- is that what the line is ?
BLOOM : That 's right .
I think we have to get over this " kids will be kids " mentality .
This is n't the first suicide that 's resulted from bullying , and some kids act out violently , as we saw in the Columbine massacre , when they perceive themselves to be the victims of bullying .
Bullying implies that it 's OK because it 's just kids being kids .
If someone is threatening the physical safety of someone , if the behavior goes on day after day , month after month , as it did in this case , if it 's making the girl so sick she does n't want to go to school , and ultimately is hanging herself , obviously this is behavior that 's beyond the pale .
I think we should start treating this as the Catholic Church finally started treating molestation , which is this is not just an internal matter , this is something that has to be reported to authorities .
These are crimes being committed against our children , and we have to be serious about it before we have more of these terrible outcomes .
Snap .
I could n't agree more with Lisa Bloom .
WTF are " anti- bullying " laws , anyway ?
Why are schools law - and consequence - free zones for abusers and those who willfully dispense abusive behavior ?
I can't imagine what would have happened if , after that first act of vandalism on my locker , the school administrators had done what they should have done and called the police to come in and take a report from me and from any potential witnesses .
I can't imagine the message that would have sent to everyone who thought it was OK to torment and harrass another person .
Would it have made me popular ?
Hell no .
But perhaps it would have curtailed that behaviorsuch that I was n't literally driven to within an inch of my very life .
If a student walks into his or her school and shoots another student , the police are called .
If a student is dealing drugs within his or her school , the police are called .
There are law in our adult lives that protect us and give us legal recourse if we are incessantly harassed , verbally abused , physically threatened , and if our person or our property is assaulted .
The only mystery here is why those laws seem to end at precisely the point that a student enters a school .
It 's appalling .
Right now , various states are running to talk about how they 're strengthening anti-bullying legislation .
But the real question is - WHY strengthen this legislation ?
" Bullying " is so demeaning to the victims of abuse - and THAT is what they are .
Victims of abuse .
" Bullying " implies that nothing really terribly bad is happening - that a young person is " going through a rough time " or that an abuser " needs to outgrow it " .
What a load of horseshit .
I do n't even know where to begin to try to correct this issue and to compel a move away from the errant notion that " bullying " is somehow less than abuse .
All I can suggest is that you contact your Congressperson and tell them that " bullying " is a euphamism for much more egregious - and illegal - abusive behavior .
Tell them that laws that protect them from harassment , stalking , verbal or physical abuse , and assaults on their person or property should apply to students in schools .
In The End ...
I do n't think children are generally forthcoming about the abuse they suffer while in school .
Under the current construct , the abusive behavior is roundly poo-pooed and written off as some harmless youthful indiscretion , when it is anything but .
Trying to file a complaint with a school or get the involvement of a parent only makes it worse because the situation itself is n't taken as seriously as it should be and the full force of the law is not brought to bear on the guilty .
They 've arrested the students who tormented Phoebe Prince , and national conversation has ensued .
But Phoebe Prince is DEAD .
Countless other students are DEAD because it was less painful to DIE than to go to school .
It 's time that the law extend to all areas of our lives , including that of our children .
Write your Congresspeople today .
Following on from ABC Africa , Iranian auteur Abbas Kiarostami continues to explore the creative possibilities of digital video with this minimalist work , which the filmmaker himself describes as being midway between documentary and fiction .
Its protagonist is an unnamed , divorced mother ( Mania Akbari ) who 's driving around Tehran , and the film 's 10 sequences , shot entirely from the dashboard of her car , record her conversations with a succession of passengers .
Those who ride shotgun include her abrasive young son ( Amin Maher ) , her forthright sister , an elderly worshipper , a defiant prostitute and a female friend .
Featuring frank exchanges and non-professional performances that brim with vitality , 10 is a searching examination of the plight of women in a male - dominated Islamic society .
It 's not one of the director 's best films - that would be Close Up or The Wind Will Carry Us - but it does illustrate Kiarostami 's compassionate concern with " ordinary " human relationships .
Dwight Vows To Find Shaw ’s Successor

Neighborhood leaders channeled fear and concern over losing the Whalley Avenue ’s Shaw ’s supermarket into the beginnings of a citizen - driven marketing drive to lure a new store to town .
Supporters of the replacement grocery store will have to sharpen their sales pitches and rehearse their talking points , as they prepare to prove to the world why Dwight Place — the shopping center anchored by Shaw ’s — would be a great place to open a new supermarket .
This marketing campaign launched at a community meeting Tuesday night in the Dwight Police Substation .
More than 50 potential volunteers gathered to hear about the latest development in the quest to replace Shaw’s .
Linda Townsend - Maier ( pictured above on left ) , executive director of the Greater Dwight Development Corporation ( GDDC ) , said that New Haveners need to “ make the statement loud and clear ” that the city ’s shoppers can support a new grocery store if they expect to attract a new corporate buyer .
New Haven ’s was one of only two stores statewide turned down by buyers like Stop & Shop when Shaw ’s corporate parent SuperValu decided to pull the retail line out of Connecticut last month .
As a result , the Whalley Avenue store will close at the end of March .
That will put more than 100 workers out of a job and convert central neighborhoods like Dwight into “ food deserts , ” where affordable fresh food will be unavailable for those without a car .
Click here to read a back story .
Tuesday night ’s was the second neighborhood meeting about the closing .
Neighborhood leaders have been struggling with the difficulty of “ harnessing the energy and talent [ of the community ] and moving forward , ” said Whalley Avenue Special Services District head Sheila Masterson .
Tuesday night ’s meeting marked the first attempt on behalf of the GDDC to take advantage of community support as part of a concrete plan to advance the search for a replacement .
The first step ?
Filling out a survey .
All of the meetings attendants were presented with a questionnaire , which addressed questions like “ Was it convenient for you to get to Shaw’s ?
Why did you not do more of your shopping at Shaw’s ?
What should a replacement supermarket do to be more attractive to customers ? ”
The point of the survey is to give New Haven a “ leg up ” in attracting potential buyers , said Townsend - Maier .
She said that corporations most likely “ do n’t consider the huge student and institutional population that ’s in this town everyday ” when they do their basic demographic research on the low - income Dwight neighborhood .
Townsend - Maier insisted that there exists a market base to support a full service grocery store .
The survey results will attest to the diversity of this client - base , the strength of their support , and the potential for revenue .
Masterson agreed that the survey will dispel the notion that a discount grocery store is best suited for the neighborhood .
She said that while a corporation might say that Dwight is a “ poor neighborhood , we can sell our junk ” with a discount supermarket , the survey will complicate this perception with information on use by “ commuters and students . ”
Townsend - Maier said that analyzing the data will give the GDDC a unique picture of the community ’s needs , before a third community meeting takes place March 30 .
She said that SuperValu has been less than helpful in providing the GDDC with financial statistics that would be useful for marketing the site to a new buyer .
Community members suggested doing whatever it takes to get as many people as possible to fill out the survey .
Doug Hausladen from the Livable Streets Campaign urged supporters to hand out the survey at the St. Patrick ’s Day Parade and to “ keep tweeting ” links to it on the internet .
Lee Cruz of the Community Foundation for Greater New Haven said that everyone at the meeting should prepare an “ elevator pitch ” and rehearse the “ talking points ” for convincing others in the community to fill out the survey and rally around a new store .
Shaw ’s employee Helen C. Powell asked if anyone could help educate Shaw ’s workers about their financial prospects .
She said that “ some of the workers do n’t understand ” what is happening with their 401k or other aspects of the process .
She carried with her a recent letter from her the United Food and Commercial Workers Union President Brian Petronella , which said that the union had proposed a severance package for the Shaw ’s workers but had not received confirmation yet .
Former Yale Alderwoman Rachel Plattus said that she will do her best to let Yale students know about getting involved , since many students are currently out of town for spring break .
She asked how the community can help “ fill the gap ” during the “ period of time when [ Shaw ’s ] is not available . ”
Even if the GDDC finds a buyer soon , it is likely that there will be a period when the space sits idle .
Townsend - Maier said that security will be a “ major issue ” at the plaza .
She pledged to work with SuperValu to keep the lights on after the store closes .
Masterson said that neighbors ought to pick up the phone and call their carless neighbors to offer rides to suburban grocery stores .
If that happens , the community will not experience “ that much of a desert , ” she said .
While there was some excitement among attendants about starting a farmers ’ market in the store or even in the parking lot during the interim gap , Townsend - Maier said that the space is still controlled by SuperValu , which would probably disapprove of that idea .
There are still “ liability issues . ”
The parking lot is the “ slip and fall Mecca of New Haven , ” she said .
Townsend - Maier said that the GDDC will meet with the mayor on Thursday to see what the city can do to help , such as offer incentive funds to a potential new buyer .

The only way you will have a supermarket is if the Shaw ’s workers and people in the community buy the store .
Right now the community is being sold Snakeoil by the Greater Dwight Development Corporation .... Rember the
Greater Dwight Development Corporation owns this property and you mean to tell me that they did not know that this supermarket was closing .
Are yiu telling me that a owner does n’t know about what is happing with there property ?
Workers and community
It can be done .
When the world trade center was destroy
There was a restaurant call Windows of the world .
The workers used tere own money to buy a new place and started the restaurant back up .
I notice one women talking about their 401k .
That is a start , use some of that money .
Also ask you minster ’s as to why they ca n’t come together and buy this supermarket .
Let ’s be for real with this tax increase comming , It going to be very hard to find some one to come into new haven and buy any property

It sounds like the survey is available to complete on line .
If so please could you provide a link to it .

“ The parking lot is the �slip and fall Mecca of New Haven , � This IS true .
The same neighborhood that shopped at Shaw ’s was also constantly suing Shaw ’s , in a steady stream .
And no , that is n’t how it is everywhere .
In the urban areas of the state , slip and fall lawsuits are epidemic .
There are lawyers in New Haven who eck out a living by pursuing dozens of these cases at a time .
They are nickle and dime .
The way they are resolved is in small nuisance settlements .
The state ’s attorney ’s office is busy dealing with homicides .
The insurance industry tries to keep a list of people suspected of bringing fake cases but that ’s it .
Connecticut Insurance Department only investigates worker ’s comp fraud , not other insurance fraud .
In states like Mass .
that have initiated fraud bureaus that do include investigating these , they have saved millions of dollars for insurance companies / businesses and surely helped keep them from clogging the courts .
I know a lot about this in New Haven because I was victimized by a woman here who it turned out has been involved in this activity with family members in New Haven almost continously , if not continuously , since the 80’s .
She has several lawsuits pending right now as I write this , and yes , that ’s even though the court has questioned her honesty in prior cases .
That does n’t matter —- usually has little affect on nuisance settlement amounts .

Oh , so , forgot to say that maybe part of the lesson here is we New Havener ’s should stop suing our supermarkets unless something really did happen and we really did fall .
It might help .

No one is buying the property , so stop talking about taxes .
Greater Dwight owns the plaza .
They are looking for a grocer to fill the space ( i.e. a tenant ) .
The survey will help market the spending power and diversity of the community and the greater New Haven area to potential grocers .
Please participate .
If you think workers or community members should rent the space themselves and stock the shelves as 3/5 said , put it on the survey .
If you think it should be a Super WalMart as Alderman Greg Morehead suggested , write that down !
The point is , participation is absolutely essential .

There is a significant issues which neither the Dwight Community or the greater New Haven Community is addressing .
It is an issues that might prevent another supermarket from opening in the Whally Avenue space .
That issue is loss - prevention .
Urban areas have a greater potential for higher instances of theft and other criminal activity .
I suspect this is why not one other store bought out the Shaw ’s space .
It is ( was ) a busy market , and it does serve a diverse clientele .
However , in this economic climate businesses are going to be less willing to risk smaller profit margins due to an avoidable expense , i.e. shrinkage / theft .
Such a position might seem to be unfairly prejudicial but it is based on hard numbers and figures .
This city is slowly decaying and it is no one ’s fault but our own .

This is all wrong and those survey questions were horrifyingly misleading .
Shaw ’s did not care abotu Dwight .
Stop &
Shop would not care about Dwight .
National chains do n’t care about communities .
The people who care at the residents .
Those are the people who need to be providing the services and goods to the rest of the neighborhood .
I would love to have a small grocery on Whalley Ave , but I have no idea where to begin .
I ’m sure there are plenty of people in this neighborhood that have wanted to have a grocery store , or a bakery , or a book store , or a flower shop , but have no idea where to begin .
Step 1 :
Find out who the people are that are interested in having a store that provides a service or a good for Whalley Ave ’s adjacent neighborhoods .
Step 2 : Determine what those stores are
Step 3 : Pair or group people up that are interested in the same stores
Step 4 : Go to the city and ask for them to provide some kind of tutoring or information sessions that educate people and help people understand how to operate and maintain a small business
Step 5 : Establish something similar to the WASSD that connects new small business owners by encouraging group - reliance through building off each other with some type of general fund used to help businesses first start and make Whalley more attractive to inhabit
Step 6 : Figure out a way to keep the network of cheap bulk food that is shipped to Shaws loading dock then deployed across Whalley ’s newly established bakeries , groceries , book stores , cafes , banks , etc by having each business pick up their goods from the Shaws loading dock and bringing it back to their business .
This way , the same services and goods that Shaw ’s supplied to the community continues to exist but it is now within walking distance of everyone ’s house that lives in the adjacent neighborhoods to Whalley , and 100 % of the revenue stays in the community and goes towards paying taxes for the business , but also towards the owners home who lives in the community , and the owner is likely to shop at other stores along Whalley .
Trying to kiss a big chains butt to open up a store along Whalley is like asking to have you ’re money shipping away to distant corporations to never be seen again .
Grand
Ave as a good example , has a small affordable chain ( CTown ) and a supplemental network of local groceries that do quite well .
We should look into perhaps trying to get CTown to come back to the Dixwell Plaza or open up somewhere on Whalley since without Shaws it would probably do great and then this could be supplemented by what I had outlined above .
The worst thing we can do , however , is try to get a supermarket that serves the entire region in one gigantic box , this will just put us back into a vulnerable position again and set us up for another big hurt .
Also , even if one of the new small groceries closes , one two blocks down the street absorbs that clientele and perhaps can hire more people or expand the store or open a new store or all three .
A dense network of many many small stores is much more difficult and takes much longer to fail that one giant box that is there one day and gone the next .

Jonathan , you ca n’t just get the same trucks that are showing up at Shaw ’s to continue to show up as much as we ’d like to .
The reason Shaw’s ( and large grocers ) can get those trucks , is because they are SHAW ’S trucks .
Shaw ’s has a network of 35 distribution centers nationally that allows them to get the economies of scale to get those bulk goods .
Shaw ’s goes , those trucks go .
All that being said , YES as to your Grand Avenue comparison .
Grand avenue is definitely a model that Whalley should aspire to for the longer term .
It has probably the biggest concentration of small and large grocery stores in the whole city .
It is bounded by TWO large grocery stores , from C - Town to the East , to Ferraro ’s at the west end .
with small stores dotting the rest of the street between then .
But all of this takes time and years to do .
You ca n’t just expect it to flourish overnight , you can only try to set the environment ( incentives , tax breaks etc. ) for things like this to happen .
I still think a large retailer for Whalley is not gloom and doom , and will be a benefit for the community , but in the long term it ’s clear that relying on a single retailer is not wise .
posted by : New Haven Urbanism Pedro ,
Thanks for responding .
I was more so trying to put the idea out there that we should look to see if there is a way to continue the importing of goods at a large scale that is then deployed locally .
I do not know if there is an example of this , or if it is even possible , but I think it ’s something we should talk about and try to find an answer to - it might be that we are the first to do it , or that it is completely impossible and other solutions are needed .
I understand that time is needed to build a network of local stores and between then and now times are gunna be tough - this is what our country set us up for when the old local networks were destroyed .
But you and I both know that if we get another supermarket everybody is just gunna sit back and say “ phew that was a close one ” , when really all that ’s been accomplished is delaying another huge failure of big box retail .
That is what must be avoided .
I do not know how to avoid this , but that is the conversation we must have - I can put my two cents in and I hope other people do to , so that we can get the best outcome for the community in the short run , but more importantly in the long run .
Is there a reason why a connected network of local network of groceries , florists , butchers , delis , book stores , etc that is deployed over a distance in small shops can not also organize in a way that mimics a much larger single corporation that can control the importation of mass goods ?
Or is it just that this has n’t been figured out yet , and Whalley Ave can be the first to do it .

The third , and arguably most important , is funding .
If you do n’t have the cash , you ’re not setting up anything .
I do n’t know if you ’ve noticed , but banks are n’t writing very many checks to fund start - up mom & pop stores regardless if they are serving an urban community or not .
posted by : New Haven Urbanism Chuck ,
1. Desire to start a business
2. Knowledge of how to operate a business
3. Group people together to pool resources and money
Those 3 elements were outlined in my original post .
Yes I realize tax breaks are made available for big box retail and suburban construction and not for urban infill , renovations and mom & pops in a way that encourages logical development .
This is exactly what I ’m talking about .
The community needs to organize , go to the city , tell the city what it wants to do , see if the city can help and then doing what is best for the community .
The city may be able to help fund in the beginning , or they may be able to get subsidies and tax breaks to the community and away from misguided development practices .
This is what we need to talk about , not getting another wealth funneling blackhole supermarket that provides a much need service in an ultimately destructive way .
Let ’s figure out how to have the great service in a way that also benefits the community .
Perhaps a food co op type thing can be set up in the shaws building , with the idea that the store will slowly expand to smaller locations through the Whalley corridor over the years .
We just had a supermarket that screwed us all over , lets look at all the possibilities before trying to jump right back in the boat with another supermarket !
Perhaps we can get two smaller chains , one in the Walgreen ’s shopping center and one in the Staple ’s shopping center to anchor the corridor but are small enough that local groceries can still stay afloat and establish themselves in due time .

Who said you need Banks .
My in laws are from the Caribbean .
My mother inlaw own ’s fifteen rental property ’s in new york .
My mother - inlaw did not get the start - up money from the banks .
She got the money from a � Sociedad which is a SUSU POOL .
A Popular Way of Saving Money Among Immigrants
SUSU is a method of saving money through a money pool and is most commonly used among the West Indian , African , Mexican and Asian cultures across America .
Mexicans refer to a SUSU as Tanda and Koreans call it Kaes .
According to researchers , with immigrant communities growing , SUSUS are more popular than ever .
Even now , this effective savings plan is an adopted trend among many Americans especially in New York City .
I have participated in a SUSU on many occasions and was able to pay the first and last months rent and the security deposit for an apartment with just one SUSU payout .
The rotating SUSU , is a practice immigrants bring with them from their country of origin and can be slightly different for each group .
Some pools last longer than others .
Some people play with higher dollar amounts .
But common to every SUSU is a strong , collective trust among participants .
They are neighbors , coworkers and sometimes even family .
In such an arrangement , the social pressure on members to fulfill their commitments is very strong .
A SUSU savings plan consists of a group of people who pool their money and distribute it among themselves periodically , one by one .
For example , a dozen people might contribute $ 400 each into the pool every month for a year .
In the first month , one person gets $ 4,800 .
The next month , the next person gets $ 4,800 , and so on .
At the end of the year , each person has contributed $ 4,800 and received $ 4,800 .
That is an example of a monthly SUSU , but can also be used as a weekly SUSU .
For example , 20 people contribute $ 100 a week .
Every week , $ 2000 is collected and one person takes home all the cash .
The rotation ends 20 weeks later after everybody has had a payday .
In Nigerian and Ghana it is called Susu account .
I will say it again .
Comunity kick the Political Prostitutes and Judas Goat sellout
leaders out .
Sit down with yourself and find a way to buy the store period !!!!
posted by : Anon on March 11 , 2010 9:13 pm if the employees find a way to buy the store , wo n’t they have to join some sort of larger cooperative ?
Regional ?
Bigger IS better .
Yes , it ’s true .
Especially if you are a small company trying to compete with the big guys ( and gals ) .
There are some tricks you can do with your website to make you seem bigger than you are and help you land new clients .
Here are the top ten .
1 . Use a great template
There are so many templates out there now that have a professional look , and many of them are free .
Themeforest. net has some incredible templates for sale , some for as low as $ 4 .
They also offer a free template every month .
The tricky part is that you usually have to use an FTP site to upload these templates into a folder on your web host site .
If you know how to do that , then search away !
An easier way to get a great look is to use a platform like WordPress to build your site .
They now have hundreds of free templates available for your use .
While your site will technically be a " blog " , the templates that are available often have " sticky " areas that allow you to create more of a traditional web page look and feel at the top , while still having the functionality of a blog as the user scrolls down .
And having a blog format means you will update your site more often with cool content .. right ?
Because that 's what gets noticed , by clients and web crawlers .
2. Build your brand
Having a consistent look is important .
If you are building your brand , then be sure and secure your company name in all major social media channels : Facebook Fan page , Twitter , YouTube and Flickr .
While you may not be using all these outlets right now , you want to secure your business name for the time when you do .
Load your logo onto each site and choose the same color scheme so that if clients come across it , they can see a consistent look and feel of your brand .
3 . Get your own email
This is one of the best tricks to make you look bigger .
Most hosting services allow you to create an email for your domain .
For example , if your domain is sesamestreet.com , you could create emails such as cookiemonster@sesamestreet.com and bigbird@sesamestreet.com .
This little trick makes it look like you own your own server and makes you look bigger than you are .
You can also set up a " help " or " webmaster " account for the website - and the best part - have all of these emails forward to your home account .
Check with your webhosting service to see if they allow you to create and forward email domains before you choose them as your provider .
4 . Hook it up
The trick of social media is to create content where people " live " and then draw them to your site .
Some people like to search photos at Flickr , while some like to cruise all of the new videos on YouTube .
Some people are way into Facebook .
What this means is that if you want them to come to your website , you need to draw them from those places first .
So , if you have photos , you should load them onto Flickr and then link them to your website .
If you have video , you should post it on YouTube and then embed it on your site .
While this may be more work to create accounts and then hook up these sites ( instead of just putting that content directly on your website ) , you are reaching people where they " live " and allowing them an opportunity to find you on the place where they like to hang out .
Make sure that everything you do drives the people back to your website , so remember to include a link with every video or photo and on your profiles .
5. Become an expert
Posting on blogs , Twitter , alumni newsletters , and forums gives you one of the most important things in business : authority .
So get out there and write , be interviewed , and provide content and make sure you to link back to your website .
You will be happily surprised at how quickly you will come to be viewed as an " expert " and how all those links help to make you a darling on Google .
6 . List yourself as a subcontractor for big contracts
There are several websites related to Requests for Proposals for large contracts .
One example is BidSync.com which lists nationwide government contracts and government bids .
It includes requests for everything from a website redesign for California State University at Monterey Bay ( contract value of $ 67,500 ) to setting up an electronic debit card system for unemployment and disability payments for the State of California ( estimated contract value of several million dollars ) .
Once you sign up , you can list yourself as a " sub seeking prime " on each contract of interest .
If you are chosen as part of the winning team , you will be able to add these large government agencies and multi-million dollar contracts to your website client list and appear bigger and better than your competition .
7 . Take it Global
One of the benefits of social media is that it can open doors for small businesses to worldwide clients .
Social media levels the playing field , so you are only one tweet , post or person away from almost any thought leader in the world .
You can use LinkedIn to find the people you want to target and then use the Linked In system to keep stepping back person by person until you find someone that knows someone that knows them .
Likewise , you can do research on almost anyone using the internet and social media tools .
Does your target use FourSquare or Twitter ?
Follow them and find out where they hang out or spend their evenings and arrange a casual meeting .
8 . Get the word out
Using sites that allow users to leave feedback , like Yelp or Linked In , can drive more people to your website .
Print up a small card to leave on the counter at your business or hand out to clients asking them to give you feedback ( be sure and include the web URL for your business reviews on Yelp ) .
Likewise , reach out to happy customers on LinkedIn and ask them to write a testimonial for you .
Studies show that people will trust other people over ads three out of four times .
9 . Include video on your website
Creating video content may seem difficult and expensive , but it can be easier than you think and it is very effective .
Depending on what your business is , you can use everything from a camera phone to hiring a professional video production company to talk about what you do and why you are the best .
While the video quality can vary depending on what you do ( ie a skateboard shop can use camera phone video , but a bank should pay for higher quality ) - the audio should always be clear and understandable .
If you have to invest money in anything related to creating web content , buy a good microphone .
One success story is a small chair company that started doing videos about the chairs they offered .
Within two months , their sales had quadrupled and the employees featured in the videos were asked for by name when customers called .
10 . Link to Preferred Partners and vice - versa
One way to generate traffic and increase your offerings is to partner with " Preferred Partners " and work out an agreement on posting weblinks on each other 's sites .
You do n't necessarily have to choose businesses that are related to you - instead , choose people with businesses or products that you like , trust , and would recommend .
You can take it even a step further and set up events where you partner together : Lunch and Learns , Happy Hours , Meet - up groups - the possibilities are endless .
Overall , you can appear to be bigger than you are by having a professional website look , consistent brand , and by creating relationships using the internet and social media tools .
Now , get out there and do something !
As Herb Kelleher from Southwest Airlines once said : " We have a strategic plan , it 's called doing things . "
Last but not least
All of this professionalism wo n't do you any good if you do n't have stable website .
A website that is constantly down does n't exactly scream professionalism .
These three providers have a high uptime guarantee and include all the tools you need to setup and manage a professional website .

It was a simple message to say he was off on a working trip to Brazil .
By morning the leftist leader , a divisive figure at home and abroad , had nearly 29,000 followers on Twitter .
With his popularity dented by a recession and soaring inflation , the Venezuelan leader has often been outmanoeuvred by opponents more active on the web than his supporters , correspondents say .
Hey how 's it going ?
I appeared like I said I would : at midnight .
I 'm off to Brazil .
And very happy to work for Venezuela .

Well , John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the Commander - in - Chief
Saying , “ Tell me great hero , but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in ?
-- Bob Dylan , " Tombstone Blues "
One can only assume that the regular editors of the New York Times were all out at a party , or left early for a weekend in the Hamptons , or something -- but somehow , the paper published a front webpage story that stated -- without the usual thousand excuses and extenuations -- that American troops are routinely slaughtering Afghan civilians at checkpoints .
What 's more , the story unequivocally ties the civilian killings to the " surge " ordered by the noble Nobel Peace laureate , Barack Obama .
Here 's what the Times says :
American and NATO troops firing from passing convoys and military checkpoints have killed 30 Afghans and wounded 80 others since last summer , but in no instance did the victims prove to be a danger to troops , according to military officials in Kabul .
And what is the paper 's authority for this astounding admission of atrocity ?
Not the usual " unnamed sources " or " senior official in a position to have knowledge of the situation , " but none other than Obama 's hand - picked commander on the Af - Pak front , General Stanley " Black Ops " McChrystal his own self :
“ We have shot an amazing number of people , but to my knowledge , none has ever proven to be a threat , ” said Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , who became the senior American and NATO commander in Afghanistan last year .
His comments came during a recent videoconference to answer questions from troops in the field about civilian casualties .
Let 's repeat the much - media - lauded general 's statement again : “ We have shot an amazing number of people , but to my knowledge , none has ever proven to be a threat . "
Now , what would the authorities say if you or I shot " an amazing number of people who have never proven to be a threat ? "
Why , they would call us murderers -- even mass murderers .
Yet this is precisely what " the senior American and NATO commander in Afghanistan " has just declared , on videotape .
The story goes on to make the extraordinarily straight -- and indisputable -- point that these wanton killings of civilians who have never even " proven to be a threat " is fanning the very " insurgency " ( which is the Beltway term of art for any resistance to American military presence " ) whose quelling is the ostensible reason for the Laureate 's " surge " in the first place :
Failure to reduce checkpoint and convoy shootings , known in the military as “ escalation of force ” episodes , has emerged as a major frustration for military commanders who believe that civilian casualties deeply undermine the American and NATO campaign in Afghanistan .
Many of the detainees at the military prison at Bagram Air Base joined the insurgency after the shootings of people they knew , said the senior NATO enlisted man in Afghanistan , Command Sgt. Maj. Michael Hall .
“ There are stories after stories about how these people are turned into insurgents , ” Sergeant Major Hall told troops during the videoconference .
“ Every time there is an escalation of force we are finding that innocents are being killed , ” he said .
The story even states plainly that the official figures of admitted killing of unthreatening civilians -- already unconscionably high -- might not be the true extent of these atrocities :
Shootings from convoys and checkpoints involving American , NATO and Afghan forces accounted for 36 civilian deaths last year , down from 41 in 2008 , according to the United Nations .
With at least 30 Afghans killed since last June in 95 such shootings , according to military statistics , the rate shows no signs of abating .
And those numbers do not include shooting deaths caused by convoys guarded by private security contractors .
Some tallies have put the total number of escalation of force deaths far higher .
A spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry , Zemary Bashary , said private security contractors sometimes killed civilians during escalation of force episodes , but he said he did not know the number of instances .
The story also presents an example of one slaughter of civilians , and shows how it leads directly to the rise of resistance against the American military presence :
One such case was the death of Mohammed Yonus , a 36 - year - old imam and a respected religious authority , who was killed two months ago in eastern Kabul while commuting to a madrasa where he taught 150 students .
A passing military convoy raked his car with bullets , ripping open his chest as his two sons sat in the car .
The shooting inflamed residents and turned his neighborhood against the occupation , elders there say .
“ The people are tired of all these cruel actions by the foreigners , and we ca n’t suffer it anymore , ” said Naqibullah Samim , a village elder from Hodkail , where Mr. Yonus lived .
“ The people do not have any other choice , they will rise against the government and fight them and the foreigners .
There are a lot of cases of killing of innocent people . ”
Finally , the story depicts McChrystal -- again , the handpicked commander of the commander - in - chief -- stating flatly when it comes to the widely ballyhooed " counterinsurgency doctrine " that is supposedly now governing the military occupation of Afghanistan , the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing .
In other words , it 's a full - scale , four - star FUBAR :
More recently , General McChrystal moved to bring nearly all Special Operations forces in Afghanistan under his control .
NATO officials said concern about civilian casualties caused by these forces was partly behind the decision , along with the need to better coordinate units and ensure that local commanders were aware of what was happening .
One unit could be doing counterinsurgency , while another carried out “ a raid that might in fact upset progress , ” General McChrystal explained during the videoconference .

People living closer to green spaces are at significantly lower risk for a wide variety of mental and physical illnesses , according to a study conducted by researchers from the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam , Netherlands , and published in the Researchers examined the health records of 350,000 patients who had been registered with one of 195 general practitioners across the Netherlands for at least one year .
Using postal codes , the researchers then calculated the percentage of area within both one and three kilometers ( 0.62 and 1.86 miles ) of their homes that was covered by greenery .
Those living in areas that were 10 percent green in a one kilometer radius had an anxiety disorder rate of 26 per 1,000 .
In contrast , those with 90 percent of the area green within a one kilometer radius had an anxiety disorder rate of only 18 per 1,000 .
Likewise , those living in the 10 percent green zone had a depression rate of 32 per 1,000 , while those in the 90 percent green zone had a rate of 24 per 1,000 .
This translated into a 21 percent lower risk of depression .
The effect was strongest among children under the age of 12 .
Researchers also tested the effects of proximity to green space on the rates of 24 major physical diseases , finding that the risk of 15 was reduced by more green area .
The physical diseases most affected are coronary heart disease , diabetes , asthma , respiratory infections , migraine , stomach infections , urinary tract infections , vertigo , unexplained physical ailments , and back , neck , shoulder , wrist and hand complaints .
While green space only tended to improve health if it was within one kilometer , rates of anxiety , digestive infections , and unexplained physical ailments did decrease in areas with a high proportion of green space within a three kilometer radius .
Scientists believe that green spaces improve air quality , encourage physical activity , help people recover from stress and provide more opportunity for social contact .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. children eat an average three snacks a day on top of three regular meals , a finding that could explain why the childhood obesity rate has risen to more than 16 percent , researchers said on Tuesday .

Children snack so often that they are “ moving toward constant eating , ” Carmen Piernas and Barry Popkin of the University of North Carolina reported .
More than 27 percent of calories that American kids take in come from snacks , Piernas and Popkin reported in the journal Health Affairs .
The researchers defined snacks as food eaten outside regular meals .
The studies will help fuel President Barack Obama ’s initiative to fight obesity in childhood , something Obama ’s wife , first lady Michelle Obama , notes could drive up already soaring U.S. healthcare costs .
Dr. Thomas Frieden , director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , wrote a commentary calling for taxes on sugary drinks and junk food , zoning restrictions on fast - food outlets around schools and bans on advertising unhealthy food to children .
“ Government at national , state , and local levels , spearheaded by public health agencies , must take action , ” he wrote .
Piernas and Popkin looked at data on 31,337 children aged 2 to 18 from four different federal surveys on food and eating .
“ Childhood snacking trends are moving toward three snacks per day , and more than 27 percent of children ’s daily calories are coming from snacks .
The largest increases have been in salty snacks and candy .
Desserts and sweetened beverages remain the major sources of calories from snacks , ” they wrote .
“ Children increased their caloric intake by 113 calories per day from 1977 to 2006 , ” they added .
CONSTANT EATING
“ This raises the question of whether the physiological basis for eating is becoming deregulated , as our children are moving toward constant eating . ”
In a second study in the journal , Christina Bethell of the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland and colleagues analyzed data from the 2007 National Survey of Children ’s Health to find the rate of obesity for children 10 to 17 rose from 14.8 percent in 2003 to 16.4 percent in 2007 .
The percentage of children who are overweight stayed at around 15 percent , they found .
“ While combined overweight and obesity rates appear to be leveling off , our findings suggest a possible increase in the severity of the national childhood obesity epidemic , ” Bethell said in a statement .
Parents , educators and policymakers all hold responsibility for this , Michelle Obama told the School Nutrition Association conference in Washington on Monday .
“ Our kids did n’t do this to themselves , ” Obama said .
“ From fast food , to vending machines packed with chips and candy , to a la carte lines , we tempt our kids with all kinds of unhealthy choices every day . ”
Other studies have shown that obese children are more likely to stay obese as adults , and they develop chronic conditions at younger ages , burdening the healthcare system .
“ You see kids who are at higher risk of conditions like diabetes , and cancer , and heart disease -- conditions that cost billions of dollars a year to treat , ” Michelle Obama said .
The administration has launched an initiative to tackle the issue by improving nutritional standards , getting food companies to voluntarily improve nutrition standards , help kids exercise more and educating parents .
The effects extend beyond health .
Bethell ’s study found that overweight or obese children were 32 percent more likely to have to repeat a grade in school and 59 percent more likely than normal weight kids to have missed more than two weeks of school .
With just about everybody speculating that Jose Mourinho will leave Chelsea this summer , it is hard not to be reminded of the comment of Bela Guttmann , the great Hungarian coach , that " the third season is fatal " .
Some managers - Bill Shankly , Sir Alex Ferguson , Arsène Wenger - are empire - builders , determined to imprint their mark on a club , to build it in their image and lay down structures that will last long after they are gone .
Others are guns for hire , eternal wanderers driven by a constant need to prove themselves again and again .
Guttmann remains football 's greatest wanderer .
An elegant centre - half in the days when the centre - half was the attacking fulcrum of a team , he was instrumental in MTK's Hungarian title in 1921 .
The following season , though , Ferenc Nyul , the player he had replaced , returned to Budapest from the Romanian side Hagibor Cluj , and , relegated to second fiddle , Guttmann did what he would do throughout his career : he walked .
Like many of the Jews leaving the anti-Semitism of Miklòs Horthy 's Hungary , he went to Vienna , which became his spiritual home , a place where coffee - house intellectuals regarded football as just as worthy a subject for debate as literature or politics .
Guttmann joined the Jewish club Hakoah , but opted to stay in New York following a tour of the USA to raise funds for the Zionist cause in 1926 .
He bought into a speakeasy , and almost lost everything after the Wall Street crash , returning to Europe in 1932 to begin his coaching career , first with Hakoah and then in Holland with SC Enschede .
He soon earned a reputation as a brilliant , irascible man with a sharp dress sense and an acute consciousness of his own worth .
Temperamentally , Guttmann and Mourinho seem to have been cut from the same cloth .
How Guttmann spent the war is unclear .
His elder brother died in a concentration camp , but Guttmann seems to have escaped to Switzerland where he was interned .
After a brief spell at Vasas in Budapest in 1945 , he found work in Romania with Ciokanul the following year , insisting his salary should be paid in vegetables so as to negate the effects of the food shortages .
From there his career took off , although the flounce was never far away .
Guttmann never had much time for authority - indeed , his truculence ended his international playing career almost before it had started : back in 1924 , he was so angered by the fact that there were more officials than players in the Hungary squad for the Olympics , and that they had been billeted in a noisy Montmartre hotel better suited to socialising than match - preparation , he led the players on a rat hunt , tying their prey to the doors of the officials ' rooms .
Later , his time at Ciokanul came to an end when a director tried to interfere with team selection .
" OK , you seem to have the basics , " Guttmann reputedly replied , before turning and leaving .
Back in Budapest , he won the title with Ujpest , and then took over from Ferenc Puskas 's father at Kispest .
Puskas had been used to getting his own way and , in retrospect , conflict was inevitable .
Matters came to a head in a game against Gyor , as Guttmann , having tried unsuccessfully to calm Mihaly Patyi's aggressive approach , told the defender not to go out for the second half .
Puskas advised Patyi to ignore him , and when he did , Guttmann retired to the stand for the second half , read a racing paper , then took the tram home , never to return .
On he went : to Padova and Triestina in Italy ; Boca Juniors and Quilmes in Argentina ; Apoel Nicosia in Cyprus , and then AC Milan .
He had them top of the table 19 games into his second season when a string of disputes with the board led , once again , to his dismissal .
" I have been sacked , " he told a stunned press conference , " even though I am neither a criminal nor a homosexual .
Goodbye . "
From then on he insisted on a clause in his contracts that he could not be sacked if his team were top of the table .
Vicenza followed , and then , in the aftermath of the 1956 Uprising , he led a team of Hungarian exiles - Puskas among them - on a tour of South America .
He stayed in Sao Paolo , doing much to popularise the 4 - 2 - 4 formation with which Brazil would wow the world at the 1958 World Cup .
By then , though , he was already back in Europe , leading Porto to the Portuguese title as they overhauled Benfica 's five - point lead , before jumping ship for Benfica .
There he promptly sacked 20 players , promoted a host of players from the youth team , and won the league .
A coach , he said , is like a lion tamer : " He dominates the animals , in whose cage he performs his show , as long as he deals with them with self - confidence and without fear .
But the moment he becomes unsure of his hypnotic energy , and the first hint of fear appears in his eyes , he is lost . "
He made sure he never stayed anywhere long enough for that glint of fear to materialise .
It was in Lisbon he would enjoy his greatest triumphs , although only after signing Eusebio following a chance meeting in a barber shop .
That allowed him to play Mario Coluna deeper , and the result was the last great flowering of attacking football in Europe before the coming of catenaccio and cynicism .
" I never minded if the opposition scored , because I always thought we could score another , " he said .
Benfica beat Barcelona 3 - 2 in the 1961 European Cup final , and retained their crown the following year , coming from 2 - 0 and 3 - 2 down to beat Real Madrid 5 - 3 .
At the final whistle in Berne , Puskas , who had scored all of Madrid 's goals , handed his shirt to the young Eusebio , a gesture it was not hard to interpret as a symbolic passing on of his mantle .
There seemed then no reason to suppose Benfica would not dominate the sixties as absolutely as Madrid had the fifties .
Money , though , soon intervened .
Guttmann approached the directors and suggested he might be owed a bonus .
They replied that there was no such stipulation in his contract , and , once again , Guttmann walked .
Perhaps he had itchy feet anyway - it was his third season at the club , after all - but in that moment of stinginess , the club threw away its future .
Guttmann told them they would never win another European title until he was paid his due ; 45 years on , and five finals later , his curse holds .
His departure made the front page of the London Evening Standard , prompting Port Vale , who were then looking for a manager after the departure of Norman Low , to snap into action .
They posted him a letter that read : " We understand your services are now available and that you would like to come to England .
We are interested ... "
Guttmann , though , was n't , and turned down the chance to coach in the Third Division for the Uruguayan champions Peñarol .
There he built a side that won the Copa Libertadores shortly after he had returned to take charge of the Austrian national side , but he was never quite the same after Benfica .
Neither was football .
More than anybody , Guttmann had built the cult of the manager ; the man who took that on most vigorously was Helenio Herrera , whose concept of the game could hardly have been more different .
The sixties came to be dominated by Italian defensiveness and paranoia ; with Eusebio maturing , it could have belonged to Benfica .
What happens with Mourinho in the summer could be just as significant .
He may speak of his love for Chelsea , but the suspicion is that it is dwarfed by his love for himself .
He has shown every sign thus far of being a wanderer ; the mid-season announcement of his departure from Benfica following the club 's refusal to give him a contract extension was classic Guttmann .
Mourinho may be difficult and idiosyncratic , but if Chelsea need any convincing of the dangers of letting a genius go , then they should look to the Benfica of almost half a century ago .
Digg has its problems , but Digg clones are n't one .
An early Web 2.0 favorite , social news site Digg has seen lots of competition over the years from sites that do almost exactly what it does : have users submit and vote on their favorite websites and news stories .
AOL launched a clone called Propeller ( first called Netscape ) .
Yahoo came out with Yahoo !
Buzz .
A sad site called Mixx even ripped off Digg 's double - consonant name .
According to this chart from NeXT Up Research , none of these sites are close to touching Digg in terms of traffic .
But new Digg CEO and founder Kevin Rose -- who forced former CEO Jay Adelson out earlier this year -- ca n't rest .
While Digg clones are n't a threat , Web behemoths Facebook and Twitter are .
Both services now do the what only Digg used to : allow users to share stories and find others based on their popular appeal .

Those who break the law could be fined or jailed for seven days Belgium 's lower house of parliament has voted for a law that would ban women from wearing the full Islamic face veil in public .
The law would ban any clothing that obscures the identity of the wearer in places like parks and on the street .
No - one voted against it .
The law now goes to the Senate , where it may face challenges over its wording , which may delay it .
If passed , the ban would be the first move of its kind in Europe .
Only around 30 women wear this kind of veil in Belgium , out of a Muslim population of around half a million .
The BBC's Dominic Hughes in Brussels says MPs backed the legislation on the grounds of security , to allow police to identify people .
Other MPs said that the full face veil was a symbol of the oppression of women , our correspondent says .
Senate approval Thursday 's vote was almost unanimous with 134 MPs in support of the law and two abstentions .

It is expected to pass through the Senate without being blocked , with initial reports saying it could come into law as early as June or July .
But the Liberals and Christian Democrats - both represented in the Senate - say they will question the phrasing of the law , which could cause delays .
It will also take longer to become law if elections are called , as parliament would have to be dissolved .
The Belgium government collapsed last week .
The Muslim Executive of Belgium has criticised the move , saying it would lead to women who do wear the full veil to be trapped in their homes .
HAVE YOUR SAY I am opposed to the state presuming to dictate what anyone should wear Beth Amnesty International said a ban would set a " dangerous precedent " .
In a statement , the human rights group said it would " violate the rights to freedom of expression and religion of those women who wear the burqa or niqab as an expression of their identity and beliefs " .
The ban would be imposed in all buildings or grounds that are " meant for public use or to provide services " , including streets , parks and sports grounds .
Exceptions could be made for certain festivals .
Those who break the law could face a fine of 15 - 25 euros ( £ 13 - £ 27 ) or a seven - day jail sentence .
Muslim headscarves
The word hijab comes from the Arabic for veil and is used to describe the headscarves worn by Muslim women .
These scarves come in myriad styles and colours .
The type most commonly worn in the West is a square scarf that covers the head and neck but leaves the face clear .
The niqab is a veil for the face that leaves the area around the eyes clear .
However , it may be worn with a separate eye veil .
It is worn with an accompanying headscarf .
The burka is the most concealing of all Islamic veils .
It covers the entire face and body , leaving just a mesh screen to see through .
The al - amira is a two - piece veil .
It consists of a close fitting cap , usually made from cotton or polyester , and an accompanying tube - like scarf .
The shayla is a long , rectangular scarf popular in the Gulf region .
It is wrapped around the head and tucked or pinned in place at the shoulders .
The khimar is a long , cape - like veil that hangs down to just above the waist .
It covers the hair , neck and shoulders completely , but leaves the face clear .
The chador , worn by many Iranian women when outside the house , is a full - body cloak .
It is often accompanied by a smaller headscarf underneath .

Atif Mehana came to the United States from Egypt two decades ago .
The short , clean - shaven 58 - year - old spent more than a decade selling seafood to tourists on Miami 's bayfront .
He saved enough to open a second eatery in 2008 .
But now he 's broke .
Who 's to blame ?
He says Yelp.com , the megapopular website that allows users to rate and discuss thousands of businesses from Los Angeles to London .
Cult - like followers and insistent ad reps conspired to ruin him .
" I want them to fix the damage they did to my life , " he says .
" I 'm out my entire life savings .
I lost $ 185,000 , and I have a mortgage to pay . "
Mehana claims
Yelp , which averages more than 30 million visitors every month , deleted positive reviews and highlighted negative ones in a behind - the - scenes campaign to force him to buy advertising .
His story has been echoed around the nation since February 23 , when a Long Beach animal hospital sued Yelp , charging " extortion . "
Since then , hundreds of firms have claimed that the San Francisco company tried to extort money for ads .
Their complaints have drawn coverage across the English - speaking world , from the Wall Street Journal to England 's Guardian .
Yelp has vehemently denied those claims , noting that ad reps have no power over placement of reviews .
Yet on April 5 , the company acknowledged the issue .
It added links to deleted comments and took away paying members ' ability to place positive evaluations atop their profiles .
" [ There 's ] no connection between advertising and content , " said Jeremy Stoppelman , one of the company 's two überhip founders .
But that move failed to placate Yelp haters — including scores who claim to have been victimized like Mehana .
They say the changes are just window - dressing .
What 's more , the list of plaintiffs against Yelp is growing , says Jared Beck , one of four lawyers who filed the suit .
So far , ten businesses have signed on .
And more than 500 proprietors have called to report chicanery by Yelp .
" Now we hope we 'll get wholesale changes to Yelp 's business practices , " Beck says .
Yelp was founded in 2004 by two ambitious PayPal employees : the Harvard - trained Stoppelman and Russell Simmons , a software genius .
They launched the site around the same time Facebook began sweeping through college campuses and tapped into the hunger for user - generated content .
The company , which has yet to turn a profit despite astounding popularity , created profiles for businesses from restaurants to drugstores to car washes and then allowed users to post reviews and ratings .
By 2008 , it had expanded to more than a dozen U.S. cities , Canada , and the British Isles .
Last year , it topped $ 30 million in revenue .
In December , Stoppelman and Simmons even rejected a $ 500 million buyout offer from Google .
But in February 2009 , East Bay Express , an alternative weekly newspaper in Oakland , California , reported six local business owners ' complaints that Yelp sales reps tried to strong - arm them into " memberships " of $ 300 or more a month .
Beck and Gregory Weston , a former Harvard Law School classmate from San Diego , filed suit against the company .
They said it would become a class - action , though at first there was only one client : Dogs and Cats Animal Hospital in Long Beach .
Three weeks later , Beck added nine more businesses , including a bakery in Chicago , an appliance repair service near San Francisco , and a restaurant in Washington , D.C .
" All these people who are running their own businesses are taking the time to call us up and tell us their stories , " Beck says .
" And they all line up . "
When Stoppelman announced the changes to Yelp 's business model earlier this month , many observers painted the response as throwing in the towel .
" Yelp Surrenders Payola War , Loses Easiest Shot at Profit , " Gawker crowed .
Bob Gutgsell is skeptical .
He has worked for two decades in San Carlos , wedged between San Francisco and San Jose , to build a niche repairing expensive appliances .
He works on the kind of high - tech imports many repair companies wo n't touch .
About two years ago , Gutgsell found an angry review on Yelp and responded online to try to right the problem .
Soon a Yelp sales rep phoned .
" The lady was sincere and cordial , but I did n't like the business model , " Gutgsell says .
" It did n't seem fair to me . "
She called repeatedly .
He politely declined each time .
Then , he says , positive reviews began disappearing and negative ones crept up his profile .
He 's still doing reasonably well financially , but he decided to join Beck 's suit .
" This is about the principle .
I 'm not in it for the money , " he says .
" What I do want is to see them shut down entirely .
That might not happen , but certainly we could see some legal standards set . "
Across country , in Somerville , Massachusetts , Grover Taylor first ran afoul of Yelp early last year , soon after he opened Eat at Jumbo's , an eatery catering to MIT students .
The Vermont native began receiving phone calls from a sales rep named " Art , " who promised he could remove bad reviews for a $ 500 membership fee .
Taylor responded that Jumbo's ran on word of mouth , so he could n't afford it .
Art threatened that bad reviews would be highlighted and good ones would disappear .
That 's exactly what happened .
" They 're the modern - day Mafia .
Maybe they 're not holding a gun to my head , but they 're playing the same game , " says Taylor , who is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit .
" It 's too late for policy changes to help out .
I just hope all this negative publicity finally tarnishes the company . "

Are u calling the Code Gen Team 's Fake ?..
His First Video Relase Shows
The Other part of the program .
Sending Packets .
Ect .
This Video as he promised in the 2nd video he would show gameplay ....
If you go to there site when its up .
you can see how far down the Tech Tree they are .
They dont have all units / Upgrades .
and they prob dont have chat working .
Between the First and 2nd video they relased .
i would say that these people are not fake .
if they were .
they would not still be working on it and when there site went down the first time they would of not come back if all they wanted were keys ...
Are you serious man ?
lol .
A retarded monkey could spot this as a fake .
Why did n't the players chat with each other ?!!?
Why did he have to click something off screen after clicking " launch " on the supposed emulator ?
Why not shoot a video with a hand held camera showing two computers beside each other , with two humans playing each other ?
If this is what you consider proof , you would probably believe ANYTHING .
To tell u the truth i dont really care because im in the beta .
i just come here to check out its progress .
i downloaded the video from there site when it was up .
and all i did was scan threw it .. I did wonder why he would n't play some one with more skill .
the person he played seem liked he was playing a game of starcraft2 for the first time .
and might of played sc1Ill tell u now for sure that if it was an AI it was one he maid .
cause its not 1 i seen be4 .
and it deff not the one in the beta .
they tech and produce units way faster .
and they do scout .
And i dont see that if the code gen team was fake why would n't they just disappear after the site went down the first or 2nd time .
It pays to stick around the office after 5 p.m. some days .
I just received an e-mail containing a copy of a letter from the office of Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm to Michigan Atty .
Gen. Mike Cox .
It appears the AG is being taken to the woodshed .
It starts :
Getting to the point , the governor continues :
Ah , oh .
Looks like someone 's in trouble , especially since Granholm takes a different position on the legislation :
After reminding the Attorney General who 's the boss and pointing out the relevant sections of the Michigan Constitution , Granholm writes :
In other words , he 's being advised to switch sides or participate in the litigation separately from the state .
Wonder how much this is going to cost us ?
Panax Geothermal has finished drilling and securing its Salamander 1 well at Penola in south - eastern South Australia .
The company has achieved its goal to reach the 4,000 metre mark by mid-March .
Panax Geothermal reached a depth of 4,025 metres in 44 days , setting a record for the Australian geothermal sector in the process .
The absence of oil and gas has been declared a positive and the company is now preparing to perform a flow test on the well , which is yet to reach its normal temperature after the cooling effect of the drilling process .
Panax aims to set up a 5.9 megawatt demonstration plant at the site by the end of next year before expanding to commercial production scale .

I look back at the guy I was when I wrote this site and think , " WOW !
What an IDIOT ! "
Because clearly I did n't know anything about politics .
I was a typical mindless drone , opening my mouth wide for whatever manufactured " truth " the LAMESTREAM media wanted to shovel in there and swallowing it down whole .
Well !
I 've read a lot of very EYE - OPENING books since then , which set me straight about how the world REALLY works .
So now I 'm FIXING NATIONSTATES : correcting all those INCREDIBLY BIASED government categories to be more ACCURATE !
This will probably upset some people , who are SLAVES OF A CORRUPT IDEOLOGY , but the sooner those sheeple confront the truth , the better .
I hope you enjoy the new , ideologically correct NationStates !
Rep. Alan Grayson drives Republicans crazy .
Insane .
They hate him more than probably anyone else in the House , because he does n't mince words , does n't suffer GOP fools , does n't run scared in what is a lean - GOP district ( R+2 ) .
They also hate him because he knows how to poke them in the eye , time and time again .
Like throwing his name into a Republican primary question .
From his press release :
Rep. Grayson Has Huge Lead in Republican Primary
No , that ’s not a typo .
According to a poll of registered Republicans last week , Congressman Alan Grayson has an enormous lead in the Republican primary for Florida Congressional District 8 ( FL - 8 ) .
Of course , Grayson is a Democrat .
Yet Grayson is far and away the leading choice among registered Republicans in FL - 8 .
In fact , he has almost twice as much support among Republicans as all his Republican opponents combined .
In the poll , Grayson won the support of 27.8 % of registered Republicans .
None of Grayson ’s 13 opponents scored higher than 3.7 % .
Their combined performance was only 14.5 % .
The remaining 57.7 % of registered Republicans were undecided .
30.1 % of registered Republican women support Grayson .
And Grayson has the support of 25.5 % of registered Republican men .
Grayson also has an enormous lead in name recognition .
76.9 % of Republicans know Grayson ; none of his opponents scored higher than 15.1 % .
81.4 % of Republican men know Grayson , and 72.4 % of Republican women know him .
Grayson received high marks from Republicans for his Constitution initiative .
Over half of all Republicans said that they were more likely to vote for Grayson because he passed a resolution urging high schools to teach the Constitution , and he had distributed tens of thousands of copies of the Constitution throughout the district .
Interestingly , Grayson is more popular among Republicans than Republican Governor Charlie Crist is .
42 % of Republicans have an unfavorable opinion of Crist , far more than those who have an unfavorable opinion of Grayson [...]
The poll was conducted on Feb. 26th .
There were 324 respondents , all registered Republicans in FL - 8 .
The margin of error was 5 % .
The poll was conducted by Middleton Market Research .
Cheeky , to say the least .
Of course , Republicans are simply besides themselves .
" This is the most bogus thing I 've ever seen in my life , " said Andy Seré , Regional Press Secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee .
That seems to be their stock response whenever they see poll results that do n't match their preconceived reality .
Remember their response to polling showing strong secessionist sentiment in their ranks , or the birther stuff ?
The NRCC can always duplicate the poll to try and prove it wrong , but it wo n't .
Maybe Rasmussen will fill the void , eager as he is to carry the Right 's water with his magical ( and secretively funded ) polling .
In any case , Republicans expect Democrats in Grayson - style districts to run scared , and most do .
National election prognosticators duly slot incumbents like Grayson into the " going to lose " category , because as everyone ( in DC ) knows , strong Democrats never win reelection .
Yet there is Grayson , poking them with a stick .
Mocking them to their face .
The GOP has no idea how to respond .
And it 's a thing of beauty .

Sources and links :
My encounter with Dharavi was reading a statement from Prínce Charles about the sustainability in the neighborhood of Dharavi .
The most incredible of the narration ( fictionalized ) is that the character Krishna Pooraji ( our touristic guide ) is real and works for an enterprise ( Reality Tours ) that offers travels through ‘ the other side ’ of the biggest slums on earth , Dharavi included .
Other links that helped me can be found here , here and here .
Obviously the references to Dominique Lapierre and his “ The City of joy ” are inevitable .

Abstract : IntelliTrace is a new feature that is introduced by Microsoft in Visual Studio 2010 for putting the debugging in the fast track .
It will reduce the time taken by debugging an application by reducing the number of debugging passes required to be executed by the developer .
IntelliTrace : Fast Track to Debug Microsoft .NET Applications in Visual Studio 2010
IntelliTrace is a new feature that is introduced by Microsoft in Visual Studio 2010 for putting the debugging in the fast track .
It will reduce the time taken by debugging an application by reducing the number of debugging passes required to be executed by the developer .
Traditional debugger allows a developer to set a breakpoint in the code and when the debugger hits that breakpoint , it takes a pause in the execution .
At this point , the developer can view the snapshot of the state of the application , including various variables , call stack etc .
Debugger also allows the step by step tracing of the application in the forward direction .
What it does not allow is to know what has happened earlier during the execution .
Some logical error might have happened in the program during earlier execution of some statement which is not traceable .
Developer has to stop the debugging , set a breakpoint somewhere earlier in the program and restart the debugging .
IntelliTrace allows all the traditional facilities of the debugger and also has added an ability to trace the application step by step backward till an error that might have happened earlier is found out .
In this way now the second or any number of subsequent passes that would have been required in the traditional debugger are avoided .
IntelliTrace starts collecting the data as soon as any debugger session has started in Visual Studio 2010 .
It stores the data that it collects in a file which has an extension of .iTrace and that file can be sent to another user for reviewing a session .
Let us view the details of IntelliTrace with an example .
We are creating an interest calculator that is a Windows Forms application .
It needs to accept the principal amount and tenure in number of days from the user ; calculate interest and show the interest and final amount to the user on the same form .
Interest rate is based upon the tenure table of rates is stored in the database .
We have created two components in addition to the windows form .
First component rationalizes the tenure so that it is in the number of days as expected in the database .
Second component is a data access component that gets the rate from the database and provides it to first component .
As per the calculation we expect the rate of interest for 180 to 360 days to be 4.5 % PA and above that it should be 5 % .
Against expectation , when developer enters 361 to 364 days as tenure it still returns the rate at 4.5 % PA .
We need to debug the code to sort out the error .
We start by checking that IntelliTrace is enabled .
This is done from a menu item Tools – Options – IntelliTrace .
By default , IntelliTrace collects data of the IntelliTrace events only to keep the size of the data at the minimum .
To know the events that are enabled by default , we click on the submenu item of ‘ IntelliTrace Events ’
Although it is a comprehensive list that is possible to be configured by selecting or de-selecting the checkboxes as per necessity , what we see is that it cannot collect the data when internal calls from one of our component to the other is made .
We make a note of this and select Modules item .
This allows us to configure the modules for which we want to collect data .
By default anything that is created by Microsoft is omitted since that is not needed to be traced in our application .
Since this setting is satisfactory , we move back to the General item in the menu .
It allows us to select a radio button to collect data at the calls as well as IntelliTrace Events .
This is what we wanted so we finalize the setting there .
We now move to the Advance item in the menu .
We find that by default IntelliTrace stores the data in the files under the folder ‘C: \Documents and Settings \ All Users\Application Data\Microsoft Visual Studio\10.0 \TraceDebugging ’.
We want it at a more convenient location so that we can copy files from it easily .
It should also be noted here that IntelliTrace creates data files for every session of debugger .
It uses FIFO to maintain those files .
It also deletes all the files created for each session when Visual Studio is closed !
It means that we need to copy those files and put them somewhere else if we want to maintain them even after Visual Studio is closed .
We can create a folder and provide the path of that in the settings of IntelliTrace as the folder to store all the data files .
We also provide the maximum size of the data file that is created for every session .
You can see that there also is a checkbox to enable or disable Navigation Gutter when the debugging is on .
We will use this gutter to navigate between calls and to go inside a called method .
Explanation of other two options is given by Ian Huff in his blog as “ The next two options pertain to how symbols are looked up for IntelliTrace .
The first option “ Enable Team Foundation Server symbol path lookup ” means that when you are going to analyze an iTrace file if you have Team Build configured then iTrace files with correct build info can automatically try to pull down the matching PDBs for the build this iTrace file was collected on .
The second option “ Prompt to enable source server support ” comes into play when you open an iTrace file in which PDBs support source server lookup . ”
Now that the IntelliTrace is set to our satisfaction , we start the debugging the way we normally do .
We provide the 10000 as principal amount and 361 days as the tenure .
When we get the interest and the final amount we observe that rate of interest that should have been 5.0 is not applied .
We also observe a link to break the execution with the text ‘ Break All ’ .
When we click on that link the debugger opens the IntelliTrace window and puts the debugging execution to pause .
We can click on the steps in the IntelliTrace Window but that does not provide us with much data .
That is why we had selected to collect call information also .
We now click on the link that says ‘ Switch to call view ’
It shows the calls and an icon in the gutter on the left side to set context to the debugger .
When we click on that icon , it opens the navigation gutter to navigate the calls .
Five linked icons that it shows are for :
1 . Go back to calling site
2 . Go to previous call or IntelliTrace Event
3. Step In ( F11 ) the call
4 . Go to next call or IntelliTrace Event
5. Switch to Live Debugging .
Now we can move forward and backward in the method calls across the components
View the values of the variables , Autos , Locals , Watches , Call Stack etc .
Finally we reach the root of the problem .
We now stop debugger .
If we want to keep the data that was stored by IntelliTrace then we open the folder that we had configured .
Copy the latest session file and paste it in some other folder .
Now we can safely close the Visual Studio 2010 .
If we now reopen that iTrace file by double clicking on the file name , it opens it in Visual Studio 2010 .
If we now double click on any of the threads that is shown in the graphical view at the top then it reopens the session with that thread .
For example following image shows the session that is opened when we double click on the main thread and do the same operations to open the calls view and to set the debugging context .
We can continue to work in the same session as if the application was still open .
IntelliTrace for the ASP.NET web application works in a very similar way .
Events that are collected are much more detailed .
I felt it a bit more complex to search through the call that I really wanted to debug .
Summary : IntelliTrace is a feature that can change the way debugging is done .
It impvroves the effciency with which developer can do the debugging .
It is also possible to collect data in the file and send it to an expert for debugging if the bug is hard to detect .
IntelliTrace settings are quite rich and allow us to optimize the session of the IntelliTrace to suite our requirement .

Hubble telescope captures Saturn 's eerie twin aurorae
A spectacular light show on Saturn has been captured in unique new photos of the ringed planet .
The aurora images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) were made possible by a rare chance to see the planet with its rings edge - on and both poles in view .
It takes Saturn almost 30 years to orbit the Sun , and during that time such a picture opportunity occurs only twice .
[ caption ]
The images show glowing aurorae flickering at each pole - Saturn 's equivalent of the Northern and Southern Lights on Earth .
The phenomena are caused by the " Solar Wind " - streams of electrically charged sub-atomic particles emitted by the Sun - interacting with molecules in the atmosphere .
As on Earth , the particles are channelled to the poles by the planet 's magnetic field .
Astronomers studying the images found subtle differences between Saturn 's northern and southern aurorae .
The bright oval - shaped area containing the northern aurora was slightly smaller and more intense than its opposite number at the south pole .
This implies that Saturn 's magnetic field is not equally distributed across the planet .
Because it is stronger in the north , the solar particles are accelerated to higher energies as they fly through the northern atmosphere .
Watch a video of Saturn 's aurorae ...
Dr Jonathan Nichols , a member of the Hubble team from the University of Leicester , said : ' Hubble has proved to be one of mankind 's most important scientific tools , and this is the first time that a group in the UK has led an HST programme to observe the aurorae on another world . '
Hubble will never capture such images again because the telescope is due to be decommissioned before the same view of Saturn is repeated .
' It is particularly exciting to know that these images are unique to science , ' said Dr Nichols .
' They have not , and will never again , be obtained using Hubble .
This is because HST pictured Saturn at a very special vantage point , near its equatorial plane .
' Due to Saturn 's long orbit , HST will not see this view again in its lifetime .
This sustained series of images of simultaneous north - south aurora are important scientifically , since they cannot be obtained at any other planet , including Earth .

Various traditions uphold different views , and it is unclear whether Medina 's Jewish clans were Arabized Jews or Arabs who practiced Jewish monotheism .
Certainly they were Arabic speakers with Arab names .
They followed the fundamental precepts of the Torah , though scholars question their familiarity with the Talmud and Jewish scholarship , and there is a suggestion in the Qur'an that they may have embraced unorthodox beliefs , such as considering the Prophet Ezra the son of God .
There were rabbis among the Jews of Medina , who appear in Muslim sources soon after Muhammad proclaimed himself a prophet .
At that time the quizzical Meccans , knowing little about monotheism , are said to have consulted the Medinan rabbis , in an attempt to put Muhammad to the test .
The rabbis posed three theological questions for the Meccans to ask Muhammad , asserting that they would know , by his answers , whether or not he spoke the truth .
According to later reports , Muhammad replied to the rabbis ' satisfaction , but the Meccans remained unconvinced .
Muhammad arrived in Medina in 622 believing the Jewish tribes would welcome him .
Contrary to expectation , his relations with several of the Jewish tribes in Medina were uneasy almost from the start .
This was probably largely a matter of local politics .
Medina was not so much a city as a fractious agricultural settlement dotted by fortresses and strongholds , and all relations in the oasis were uneasy .
In fact , Muhammad had been invited there to arbitrate a bloody civil war between the Khazraj and the Aws Allah , in which the Jewish clans , being their clients , were embroiled .
At Muhammad 's insistence , Medina 's pagan , Muslim and Jewish clans signed a pact to protect each other , but achieving this new social order was difficult .
Certain individual pagans and recent Medinan converts to Islam tried to thwart the new arrangement in various ways , and some of the Jewish clans were uneasy with the threatened demise of the old alliances .
At least three times in five years , Jewish leaders , uncomfortable with the changing political situation in Medina , went against Muhammad , hoping to restore the tense , sometimes bloody - but predictable - balance of power among the tribes .
According to most sources , individuals from among these clans plotted to take his life at least twice , and once they came within a bite of poisoning him .
Two of the tribes -- the Banu Nadir and the Banu Qaynuqa - - were eventually exiled for falling short on their agreed upon commitments and for the consequent danger they posed to the nascent Muslim community .
The danger was great .
During this period , the Meccans were actively trying to dislodge Muhammad militarily , twice marching large armies to Medina .
Muhammad was nearly killed in the first engagement , on the plains of Uhud just outside of Medina .
In their second and final military push against Medina , now known as the Battle of the Trench , the Meccans recruited allies from northwestern Arabia to join the fight , including the assistance of the two exiled Jewish tribes .
In addition , they sent envoys to the largest Jewish tribe still in Medina , the Banu Qurayza , hoping to win their support .
The Banu Qurayza 's crucial location on the south side of Medina would allow the Meccans to attack Muhammad from two sides .
The Banu Qurayza were hesitant to join the Meccan alliance , but when a substantial Meccan army arrived , they agreed .
As a siege began , the Banu Qurayza nervously awaited further developments .
Learning of their intention to defect and realizing the grave danger this posed , Muhammad initiated diplomatic efforts to keep the Banu Qurayza on his side .
Little progress was made .
In the third week of the siege , the Banu Qurayza signaled their readiness to act against Muhammad , although they demanded that the Meccans provide them with hostages first , to ensure that they would n't be abandoned to face Muhammad alone .
Yet that is exactly what happened .
The Meccans , nearing exhaustion themselves , refused to give the Banu Qurayza any hostages .
Not long after , cold , heavy rains set in , and the Meccans gave up the fight and marched home , to the horror and dismay of the Banu Qurayza .
The Muslims now commenced a 25 - day siege against the Banu Qurazya 's fortress .
Finally , both sides agreed to arbitration .
A former ally of the Banu Qurayza , an Arab chief named Sa'd ibn Muadh , now a Muslim , was chosen as judge .
Sa'd , one of the few casualties of battle , would soon die of his wounds .
If the earlier tribal relations had been in force , he would have certainly spared the Banu Qurayza .
His fellow chiefs urged him to pardon these former allies , but he refused .
In his view , the Banu Qurayza had attacked the new social order and failed to honor their agreement to protect the town .
He ruled that all the men should be killed .
Muhammad accepted his judgment , and the next day , according to Muslim sources , 700 men of the Banu Qurayza were executed .
Although Sa 'd judged according to his own views , his ruling coincides with Deuteronomy 20:12 - 14 .
Most scholars of this episode agree that neither party acted outside the bounds of normal relations in 7th century Arabia .
The new order brought by Muhammad was viewed by many as a threat to the age - old system of tribal alliances , as it certainly proved to be .
For the Banu Qurayza , the end of this system seemed to bring with it many risks .
At the same time , the Muslims faced the threat of total extermination , and needed to send a message to all those groups in Medina that might try to betray their society in the future .
It is doubtful that either party could have behaved differently under the circumstances .
Yet Muhammad did not confuse the contentiousness of clan relations in the oasis with the religious message of Judaism .
Passages in the Qur'an that warn Muslims not to make pacts with the Jews of Arabia emerge from these specific wartime situations .
A larger spirit of respect , acceptance , and comradeship prevailed , as recorded in a late chapter of the Qur'an :
We sent down the Torah , in which there is guidance and light , by which the Prophets who surrendered to God 's will provided judgments for the Jewish people .
Also , the rabbis and doctors of the Law ( did likewise ) , according to that portion of God 's Book with which they were entrusted , and they became witnesses to it as well … .
Whoever does not judge by what God has sent down ( including the Torah ) , they are indeed unbelievers .
( 5:44 ) Some individual Medinan Jews , including at least one rabbi , became Muslims .
But generally , the Jews of Medina remained true to their faith .
Theologically , they could not accept Muhammad as a messenger of God , since , in keeping with Jewish belief , they were waiting for a prophet to emerge from among their own people .
The exiled Banu Nadir and the Banu Qaynuqa removed to the prosperous northern oasis of Khaybar , and later pledged political loyalty to Muhammad .
Other Jewish clans honored the pact they had signed and continued to live in peace in Medina long after it became the Muslim capital of Arabia .
udaism was already well established in Medina two centuries before Muhammad 's birth .
Although influential , the Jews did not rule the oasis .
Rather , they were clients of two large Arab tribes there , the Khazraj and the Aws Allah , who protected them in return for feudal loyalty .
Medina 's Jews were expert jewelers , and weapons and armor makers .
There were many Jewish clans - some records indicate more than twenty , of which three were prominent - the Banu Nadir , the Banu Qaynuqa , and the Banu Qurayza .
Various traditions uphold different views , and it is unclear whether Medina 's Jewish clans were Arabized Jews or Arabs who practiced Jewish monotheism .
Certainly they were Arabic speakers with Arab names .

Muhammad accepted his judgment , and the next day , according to Muslim sources , 700 men of the Banu Qurayza were executed .
Although Sa 'd judged according to his own views , his ruling coincides with Deuteronomy 20:12 - 14 .
Most scholars of this episode agree that neither party acted outside the bounds of normal relations in 7th century Arabia .
The new order brought by Muhammad was viewed by many as a threat to the age - old system of tribal alliances , as it certainly proved to be .
For the Banu Qurayza , the end of this system seemed to bring with it many risks .
At the same time , the Muslims faced the threat of total extermination , and needed to send a message to all those groups in Medina that might try to betray their society in the future .
It is doubtful that either party could have behaved differently under the circumstances .
Yet Muhammad did not confuse the contentiousness of clan relations in the oasis with the religious message of Judaism .
Passages in the Qur'an that warn Muslims not to make pacts with the Jews of Arabia emerge from these specific wartime situations .
A larger spirit of respect , acceptance , and comradeship prevailed , as recorded in a late chapter of the Qur'an : Some individual Medinan Jews , including at least one rabbi , became Muslims .
But generally , the Jews of Medina remained true to their faith .
Theologically , they could not accept Muhammad as a messenger of God , since , in keeping with Jewish belief , they were waiting for a prophet to emerge from among their own people .
The exiled Banu Nadir and the Banu Qaynuqa removed to the prosperous northern oasis of Khaybar , and later pledged political loyalty to Muhammad .
Other Jewish clans honored the pact they had signed and continued to live in peace in Medina long after it became the Muslim capital of Arabia .
For the past week or so , I have been testing a sleek , light , silver - and - black tablet computer called an iPad .
After spending hours and hours with it , I believe this beautiful new touch - screen device from Apple has the potential to change portable computing profoundly , and to challenge the primacy of the laptop .
It could even help , eventually , to propel the finger - driven , multitouch user interface ahead of the mouse - driven interface that has prevailed for decades .
But first , it will have to prove that it really can replace ...
Wayne Collett , a runner who won a silver medal for the United States in the 1972 Munich Olympics and who was then judged to have acted so disrespectfully during the medal ceremony that the International Olympic Committee barred him as a competitor for life , died Wednesday .
He was 60 and lived in Los Angeles .
His death , at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles , was caused by cancer , said Marc Dellins , the sports information director for U.C.L.A. , where Collett had been a track and field star .
In 1972 , Collett and his U.C.L.A. teammate John Smith were favored in the Olympic 400 - meter dash .
They advanced to the final along with Vince Matthews , another American .
Matthews won the gold medal in 44.66 seconds , Collett finished second in 44.80 and Smith was injured early in the race and did not finish .
In the previous Olympics , in 1968 in Mexico City , the runners Tommie Smith and John Carlos , both African - Americans , had staged a demonstration during a medal ceremony to protest treatment of blacks in the United States .
Olympic officials feared a repetition in Munich .
Not that you probably knew they were looking for it , but a large group of physicists have created a brand new particle called an anti-hypertriton .
Here 's why the physicists think it 's a big deal :
Scientists have a poor understanding of the very , very early universe , before even the tiniest fraction of a second elapsed after the Big Bang .
Some of the world 's smartest physicists , people like Stephen Hawking , are trying to understand the nature of the very early universe .
However , after the first billionth - of - a - second or so in the universe 's history , scientists believe they have pretty good theories to explain what happened .
The rapidly expanding universe , they believe , was filled with something called a “ quark - gluon plasma . ”
This plasma was essentially a super - hot , super - dense liquid in which there were all sorts of exotic particles .
Matter and anti-matter
In the last decade or so , despite some people fearing the worst that they 're trying to rip the cosmos apart , physicists have begun to successfully and safely re-create these plasmas in their labs .
By performing these experiments scientists are not only interested in understanding the early universe , they want to answer one of the biggest questions in modern physics :
Why was n't all matter , that is all the particles in the universe , blown to bits at the beginning ?
The physicists ask the question because they believe the Big Bang created equal parts of matter and anti-matter .
But everything we see in the universe today , from the sun to the moon to the stars , is made of particles like protons and neutrons , rather than anti-protons and anti-neutrons .
What happened to all the anti-matter ?
Scientists like Carl Gagliardi at Texas A&M University believe the answers lie in the quark - gluon plasma , where there was plenty of matter and anti-matter during the first , fleeting few moments of the universe .
“ Somewhere along the way the balance had to get tipped in the favor of matter , ” he said .
“ Physicists would like to try and understand what caused that balance to tip . ”
To do that they 're studying anti-matter in places like Long Island , N.Y. , where a particle collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory happens to be the most prodigious anti-matter factory in the world .
Gagliardi and hundreds of his scientific colleagues zip gold particles around a 2.5 - mile ring and accelerate them to near the speed of light .
Then they smash them together .
In the resulting plasma , which reaches about 2 trillion degrees , or about 100,000 times hotter than the sun , they find gobs of anti-matter .
100 million tries
It 's not easy to find the really exotic stuff they 're looking for .
To find just over 100 anti-hypertritons scientists had to perform 100 million collisions and then , like detectives , look at the crash scene and determine what actually happened at the time of the collision .
That 's because the exotic particles in the quark - gluon plasma rapidly “ decay ” into normal , mundane particles within about a millionth of a second , like what happened during the Big Bang when the plasma cooled and protons and neutrons could form .
Gagliardi and nine other Texas A&M physicists are among the many co-authors of a paper describing the anti-hypertriton find that 's being published today by the journal Science Express .
So what is an anti-hypertriton ?
It 's one of the most exotic forms of anti-matter ever discovered .
And now that scientists have found them , they can began to compare anti-hypertritons to their normal matter counterpart – the hypertriton .
Is one larger than the other ?
Or maybe an anti-hypertriton decays faster than a hypertriton ?
Finding these answers may help scientists explain where all the anti-matter has gone , and why normal matter exists .
It will take some time , however .
Gagliardi says they 're at the beginning of identifying all of the exotic matter and anti-matter particles in the early universe 's quark - gluon plasma .
If the plasma were an ocean , then , it 's kind of like scientists have walked up to the beach and caught a few fish .
That does n't mean they have a census of the ocean .
Fortunately , as computers become more powerful scientists can detect and analyze many more collisions than ever before , and a new particle accelerator in Switzerland , the Large Hadron Collider , also promises to deliver more powerful — and therefore more instructive — collisions than ever before later this year .

WARSAW ( Reuters ) - Polish feminists have objected to a hospital ’s breast cancer prevention slogan which they say encourages workplace harassment , the Gazeta Wyborcza daily said on its website on Monday .
The slogan “ I check the breasts of my workers on my own ” was devised by a cancer hospital in the southern town of Opole and aimed at convincing employers to encourage their female workers to have their breasts checked regularly for cancer symptoms .
“ This is a sexist slogan that obviously brings sexual molestation to mind , ” the head of the Feminoteka foundation , Joanna Piotrowska , was quoted on the website as saying .
“ This campaign treats women as objects and is not far removed from advertisements in which girls flaunt their breasts over car bonnets .
I wonder if this would be equally funny if it were changed to ‘ I check the penises of my workers on my own ’ . ”
Posted 2005 - 02 - 13 , evaluated by the judges panel
Newcomer Ben Briggs , alias chthonic , sends in a jammin ' Super Mario 64 ReMix of the Wing Cap theme .
After reading their unanimously positive but at times reserved opinions , I 'd say that I probably dig this more than those members of the judges panel who voted on it .
I suppose it 's partly because I do n't think this is a particularly easy theme to cover , but more that I think Ben 's done due diligence in experimenting and actually taking some risks .
It 's all relative , of course , but the blending of latin piano riffs and percussion with traditional trance elements , with some rippin jazz sax soloing , plus harp glissandos and substantial timbral variety with choral patches struck me as being pretty fresh .
Maybe not the " next big thing " to sweep the nation , but not a ReMix that seems particularly conservative or " safe " , at least in my book .
Regardless of the innovation factor , there was n't much ambiguity as to what 's here being well - constructed , polished , and mixed with something I 'd say goes a little beyond just competence .
This is a fun mix , sure , but while the integration of the chiptune - esque riff ( which ai n't ripped but reconstructed ) might make it seem " light " at first , the transitions here are handled very gracefully , and the mix does evolve over its four minute timespan .
It 's sort of a hybrid between groove - oriented composition and more linear styles , due to the cohesive contributions of the sax .
Check out the segue to a half - tempo groove with vibe arpeggios at 3 ' 42 " that Ben uses to close out the piece - that 's not the obvious choice for closure , but when you hear it , I think you 'll agree it works quite well .
There 's elements of this mix that remind me of Gecko , Disco Dan , and Darkesword , which are all great mixers to be compared to , but Ben 's also got his own voice .
Maybe I 'm just in an unusually good mood or something , but to me this is a very promising initial mix that takes relatively simple material and expands upon it in a lot of intelligent , expressive ways .
Great lead synth action with large multi-octave spanning portamento glide effects , too .
Kudos .
There are the lean and specialised mobile or embedded Linux distributions which run your smart phone or TV set top box , or there is the super flexible Tiny Core Linux which weighs in at a miraculous 10 MB and can be expanded to fulfill any specialised purpose you could wish for .
There are tiny GNU / Linux distributions that are engineered for specific purposes , to run in memory while you search and rescue data that has been lost on broken filesystems , such as SuperGrubDisk or the SystemRescue CD .
You can do the same with Puppy .
Puppy is useful for accessing and retrieving files on Windows systems , but lacks some of the more esoteric tools .
There are GNU / Linux distributions such as Damn Small Linux and Slitaz which are a better bet for specialised applications .
Damn Small Linux is half the size of Puppy and can be expanded into a full blown Debian installation , a web server or a router , and is better configured for security .
Slitaz is even smaller and serves a similar purpose .
Puppy weighs in at about 100MB , and comes with unfamiliar but practical applications to achieve just about everything you could possibly want for most everyday use in the office or at home .
Puppy Linux is one of several minimalistic GNU / Linux distributions that can live on a USB flash memory stick and run entirely in your computer 's memory - in Puppy 's case as little as 64MB .
But what distinguishes Puppy Linux is its simplicity and charm , and its sense of fun .
Fun is a large part of the GNU / Linux experience , and is a significant motivation for users to bother with the hassle of leaving Windows or other operating systems behind .
" The most important design issue ... " , Linus Torvalds wrote on the Linux kernel mailing list in 1995 , " is that Linux is supposed to be fun ... "
On the move
In these days when memory and storage are cheap , the small Linux distributions may seem redundant .
But Puppy , like the other compact GNU / Linux systems , has its uses .
Puppy takes the approach that small is beautiful , and makes it possible to offer different opportunities to understand and learn how the system works .
Puppy is small and nomadic , can live in your computer 's memory , and be taken from place to place on a memory stick .
You can save changes to the stick , with or without encryption for the security of your data , and leave barely a trace of your presence on the host computer .
You can work on the move , and carry your private data from place to place , from home to work , without the need to take your computer with you .
You can equally well use a DVD or CD .
This applies not only to the data but also to the extra applications you may choose to download .
Puppy may not come with OpenOffice or The Gimp pre-installed but there is nothing to stop you downloading any application you want in any package format that is supported by any other major Linux distribution .
Puppy is also the perfect educational tool , playful and transparent enough to give inexperienced users the opportunity to learn without doing any real damage , and unencumbered by the layers of software that are the norm on a modern operating system .
A minimal operating system strips away the layers , but inevitably comes with compromises .
So a vanilla download of Puppy Linux , which will run amazingly fast in 64MB of memory , can't afford or wo n't allow you the space for overblown applications that give you options and choices that you might never want to use .

We are witnessing a frenzy of climate “ scepticism ” .
Following the hacking of emails from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia , the right are arguing that the science of human - caused global warming is wrong .
Their offensive has a clear purpose — to reverse the growing public belief that rising emissions of greenhouse gases are causing climate change .
Concern about climate change has brought hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets worldwide .
The real target of the climate sceptics is this movement and the demands it is raising .
Climate sceptics claim the leaked emails show that scientists deliberately suppressed evidence contradicting their conclusions .
They say that this makes the whole science of human - caused global warming flawed .
US Republican Sarah Palin calls climate scientists a “ politicised scientific elite ” that “ manipulated data ” to “ hide the decline in global temperatures ” .
Yet the leaked emails do not show this .
Instead they show the defensive response of a small group of scientists to the pressure they felt from what they described as a “ politically motivated climate disinformation machine ” .
Many scientists involved had already had their research attacked by individuals motivated by an anti-global warming agenda , rather than genuine scientific debate .
So they refused requests for data from individuals such as Steve McIntyre , editor of the climate sceptic website Climate Audit .
And they used the peer review process to marginalise work dedicated to climate scepticism .
Critically , the emails do n’t undermine the science of human - caused global warming .
The science of climate change is complicated .
It relies upon understanding temperature and climate over thousands of years .
For most of this time , evidence can only come from “ proxy ” data such as tree rings or ice cores , rather than recorded temperatures .
Evidence
This can produce varying results , which is why climate scientists assess a balance of evidence to reach conclusions .
The balance of evidence currently is that we are experiencing a prolonged period of warming which is observable .
And this warming matches models of what would happen if the greenhouse effect caused warming — rather than natural events .
The most recent evidence produced by the Met Office , based on 100 studies , confirms this .
That ’s why human activities such as burning fossil fuels are seen as central to the planet ’s climate .
The climate sceptics are not defending the interests of ordinary people or pursuing rigorous scientific debate .
Rather , they have presided over 30 years of free market policies .
Ex -Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson is a prominent climate sceptic , as is Lord Monkton , a former advisor to Margaret Thatcher who runs the so called Global Warming Policy Foundation .
They fear that public pressure to deal with climate change will raise demands that challenge the priorities of their system .
One of the reasons climate sceptics have made some headway is because politicians ’ rhetoric over climate is n’t matched by radical policies aimed at solving the problem .
Nearly all climate change policy has been based on market mechanisms that have failed to halt emission rises and have redistributed wealth from the poor to rich polluting companies .
It ’s no surprise that climate scepticism finds some resonance among ordinary people .
They are already cynical towards politicians and find it easy to believe they may have been lied to again .
But working class people have nothing to gain from the sceptics .
If they win it will legitimise a lack of action on climate change .
That may be alright for those such as Lawson , rich enough to buy himself protection from the impact of climate change .
But it wo n’t be alright for the poor suffering the consequences of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans , floods in Cumbria or drought in Africa .
This is a class argument we need to take up and win .

The bombings left many injured Psychologists say they have treated hundreds of survivors of the 2005 London bombings for post - traumatic stress disorder .
Over a third of the 1,000 survivors they identified and contacted using police and hospital files needed help coming to terms with the events of 7/7 .
Yet few had been referred for treatment by their family doctor and might otherwise have missed out on care .
The University College London findings are reported in Psychological Medicine .
Professor Chris Brewin and his team say mental health outreach programmes such as the one they set up after the London bombings , with funding from the Department of Health , should be featured in future plans for the aftermath of disasters or terrorist attacks .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Prof Brewin said : " If this programme had n't existed then there would be hundreds of people still suffering from post - traumatic stress or other psychological problems as a result of the 2005 terrorist attack .
" Many of the survivors complained that GPs often did not recognise or know how to treat their post - traumatic stress . "
He said there were extreme situations when relying on GPs and primary care services did not work .
Only 4 % of the patients contacted by the psychologists in the outreach programme had been referred for treatment by their GP .
Real difference
Of the 189 patients they treated , the vast majority reported improvements .
Prof Brewin said : " After events like these people have had contact with the death of others and the possibility of their own death .
It can be very distressing . "
Nightmares , flashbacks and a heightened sense of danger are among the symptoms .
" It 's important not to let them struggle on for too long on their own .
Post - traumatic stress disorder can last for years and years if untreated . "
Dr Andrew McCulloch , chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation , said : " It 's fantastic that so much effort was put into looking after the mental health of the London bombings survivors and it would probably be a wise to take a similar approach after future disasters .
" However , everyone should be able to expect high quality and timely treatment for their mental health problems , whatever the cause .
" Unfortunately , many common occurrences such as road traffic accidents , or domestic abuse leave people suffering from shock and PTSD every day , and they should be able to expect support from regular NHS mental health services . "
Care Services Minister Phil Hope said following the 7/7 attacks " all those who need help have continued to receive help from the NHS " .
The Department of Health has also been working to improve access to psychological therapies for any needing them , setting the target of at least one service in each primary care trust by April 2011 .

" Trapped under a beam with the countdown ticking away , the monster just on the other side of the battered door , and my friends are trying to free me , I look up at them and yell , " Go on without me .
I 'll be alright .
I 'll hold him off while you escape ! "
And my friends , because they know my sacrifice wo n't be in vain , make their getaway and when the monster breaks through just as the explosives go off , I know I died saving the lives of my dearest friends . "
That pretty much sums up my experience reading Aaron Rayburn 's novel , THE SHADOW GOD .
I took one for the team , so the rest of you would NEVER have to be subjected to this beast .
I beg you , do n't let my selflessness be for nothing .
Heed my warning .
This is the worst book ever written .
The back cover copy reads " Craig Johnson had two best friends , two caring parents , a hot girlfriend , and a nice truck -- not bad for a twenty - year - old . "
Already we 're in trouble .
The author photo shows Rayburn in all his mid-20s virginal glory .
Manson contacts , a black cap turned backwards with a red 666 monogrammed on it , he 's posing next to what looks like a rubber demon .
His bio includes the line " He also says that he owes a great deal of gratitude to the Devil . . . for filling his mind with such horrific images . "
If this book is the most horrific thing the devil can come up , I think humanity is safe from the threat of hell .
There are so many things wrong with this book , I decided to keep notes so I could present them in an orderly fashion , with quotes to back me up .
I do n't want you to take my word for this novel 's horridness , I 'm going to let Rayburn speak for himself .
We 'll start with the plot .
Craig Johnson was cursed at birth when his parents left the town church led by the possibly - evil Father Spiers .
Spiers then tricked Craig 's father Matt into strangling him , only in the end , Matt had killed , not Father Spiers , but one of the doctors .
So Matt 's been in jail Craig 's entire life .
Shortly after Craig 's 20th birthday he begins to notice a blue light emanating from his bedroom closet .
He calls for his mommy ( I 'm not making that up , it 's on page 14 ) , but she does n't see any light , so he plays it off like he'd seen a rat , and asks her to check in his closet .
After she leaves , Craig is compelled to enter the light , which takes him to the Dark World , which is sometimes like a vast black void , paved of course cuz you have to have something to walk on in a void , and sometimes is like Craig 's own neighborhood , complete with the houses of his friends .
Those friends , Todd and Mark , are also pulled into the Dark World , but they make their escape and then begins the action as the three try to solve the mystery of the blue light and the dark world .
To sum up -- this book is 454 pages , okay ?
-- Craig is the reincarnation of Abel , the Shadow God is Cain , and Father Spiers is Cain 's acolyte , sent to prepare for his return to the real world .
In the midst of all this Mark is killed and resurrected by Ridley , a club owner / satanist ( he runs The Satanist Group Association .
Again , I wish I was making this up ! ) and servant to Spiers and the Shadow God .
Craig 's girlfriend , his mother , his father , as well as Mark 's sister Margie and Todd 's parents , are all killed and the cops think Craig did it .
One cop does , anyway , Detective Jim Underwood , son of the doctor Craig 's father Matt strangled to death 20 years earlier .
DUN - DUN -DUN !!!
There 's a showdown where Craig is sucked into another portal to face Cain , who then becomes a dragon , and Todd jumps in to help his friend , they all die -- except Craig - - and we live happily ever after .
Okay , I know it does n't seem THAT bad from the plot .
But I have n't begun quoting yet .
Mark Twain said , " The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and the lightning bug . "
Rayburn was n't even close .
" Spiers 's eyes popped extraneously from their sockets , as his face turned from a deep red to a sickly purple . "
" Extraneous " means " irrelevant . "
I do n't think that 's what he meant .
At least , I hope not .
Here 's my favorite :
" The lamp 's glow was very weak compared to the blue glow emancipating from the basement . "
Emanating , Rayburn , EMANATING .
When will people learn never to trust their SpellCheck without verifying it's the word they meant ???
There are , in total , 11 instances of Rayburn using the wrong word , and believe me , each one is funnier than the last .
Okay , one more .
" It infiltrated his lungs , filling them with a kind of innovativeness he had never felt before . "
To be honest , I do n't know what word he meant , but I keep seeing Craig 's lung filing patents for a dozen new inventions , getting promotions for discovering an even newer formula for Tide laundry detergent , or finding the cure for cancer .
Then there are the characters .
Craig and his buddies are all 20 , they 're in college , and they have cars and money .
Craig bribes the guard with hundred dollar bills when he 's trying to get in to see his father in
prison .
Yet never in the entire book do these men go to class , nor to a job .
Where did Craig get his " nice truck " ?
His mother works " odd jobs " , so I doubt she co-signed the loan .
And the dialogue .
Oh dear , the dialogue .
" That 's probably the fiercest dragon known to man , " Craig tells Todd toward the end .
Because , you know , we have so many different kinds of dragons in the world with which to compare .
Okay , so he uses the wrong word and his characters are morons .
You can overlook a misused word here and LOTS of writers are horrible with characters .
Hell , I 'm guilty of this myself .
But sometimes he just
plain gets his facts WRONG :
" The stranger was beastly in size with thick , bushy eyebrows , a prominent protruding forehead , and a thick , black coarse beard .
His gait was that of a mammal --a Neanderthal . "
I know I never went to college , but um . . . do you think Rayburn knows HUMAN BEINGS are mammals as well ?
And later we learn that Cain and Abel were Neanderthals who lived in the stone age , feared dinosaurs , and that Cain was kicked out of the Garden of Eden for slaying his brother .
Dude , Cain and Abel were n't born until a LONG time after Adam and Eve-- the only two people who ever lived in the Garden of Eden - - were kicked out .
And not only is this the worst book ever written , it 's also the worst - written book ever .
Behold :
" Of all the things to think , he never thought he'd think that . "
And :
" Already , he knew he would n't be able to do it .
In fact , he KNEW he would n't . "
???
Was n't that already established in the previous sentence ?
" Eubanks looked annoyed .
He exhaled annoyingly and said ... "
You know what ?
I could do this all night .
THE SHADOW GOD is the perfect example of everything that 's wrong with publishing in today 's world .
Anyone with the notion - - talent or not -- can write a " book " , then contact a place like AuthorHouse ( " publisher " of this fine volume and , I 'm sure , Rayburn 's second novel which I do n't care enough to look up the title to ) , and unleash this mess on an unsuspecting world .
And then we wonder why no one reads anymore .
Why should they ?
If this is the kind of stuff they 're being subjected to .
Used to be a writer had to learn to WRITE before they could get published .
Now , all you need is a couple thousand dollars and you got yourself a book .
Talent ?
Who needs it ?
Skill ?
What for ?
Learning to write ?
Are you kidding me ?
Forget about it , I 've got this here manyooscript and an address I can get it printed , I 'mma be one of dem novelists .
Riches , here I comes !!!
It 's enough to make aspiring writers want to give up seeking legitimate publishing venues .
Please do n't .
Just be sure to write better than this guy .
God knows it wo n't be difficult .
Or should I say , God knows it wo n't be deficit .

It ’s been a busy Earth Day here at the White House and around the Administration .
Yesterday Vice President Biden kicked off the Administration ’s Earth Day Celebration by announcing $ 452 million in Recovery
Act funding to support a “ Retrofit Ramp - Up . ”
This program will create thousands of jobs and allow these communities to retrofit hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses while testing out innovative strategies that can be adopted all over the country .
President Obama also issued a Presidential Proclamation on Earth Day calling on Americans to join in the spirit of the first Earth Day forty years ago to take action in their communities to make our planet cleaner and healthier .
This afternoon , Carol Browner , Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change , hosted a live chat on WhiteHouse.gov to answer your questions about how the Administration is working to improve the environment and build a clean energy economy that supports the jobs of the future .
This evening , the President hosted an Earth Day reception in the Rose Garden at the White House where he discussed some of the challenges that lie ahead in achieving a clean energy economy :
I think we all understand that the task ahead is daunting ; that the work ahead will not be easy and it ’s not going to happen overnight .
It ’s going to take your leadership .
It ’s going to take all of your ideas .
And it will take all of us coming together in the spirit of Earth Day -- not only on Earth Day but every day -- to make the dream of a clean energy economy and a clean world a reality .
Over on the Social Innovation and Civic Participation blog , guest blogger and former Peace Corps volunteer Kelly McCormack shares here story about a community solution to an environmental problem in Gautemala .
Finally , President Obama ’s cabinet and other senior government officials fanned out across the country as part of the Administration ’s 5 - day celebration of the 40th anniversary of Earth Day .
From live chats , to announcing major investments in renewable energy , to appearing on the David Letterman show - all - in - all a busy day !
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson
Both EPA and Earth Day celebrate their 40th birthdays this year !
On Earth Day , Administrator Jackson joined Green For All at the Grant Houses Community Garden in Manhattan to take a tour of the garden , deliver remarks to students and volunteers and participate in a planting activity with volunteers .
Later tonight catch her on the David Letterman Show to talk about the 40th anniversary of Earth Day and the President ’s clean energy and green jobs agenda .
Check out EPA ’s Earth Day website to learn more about what they are doing to celebrate 40 years of going green !
The examples are many and varied , but appalling all the same .
Pregnant women being forced to stand for long hours in factory production lines without breaks , or perform heavy lifting under threat of the sack ; meat factory workers having frozen hamburgers " like stones " thrown at them by line managers ; women with heavy periods being refused toilet breaks so that they bled on their clothes on the production lines ; workers with bladder problems refused breaks so that they urinated on themselves , workers exposed to verbal and physical abuse .
The " widespread mistreatment and exploitation " of agency workers , particularly migrant and pregnant workers , in meat and poultry processing factories , revealed in a report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission ( EHRC ) could be describing conditions in developing countries .
But the inquiry , published today , focuses on employees in the UK .
Part of the largest manufacturing sector in Britain , the meat and poultry industry is worth hundreds of millions of pounds and employs 88,800 people .
A total of 80 % of processed meat goes to supermarkets .
The 15 - month inquiry into recruitment and employment in the sector found that 70 % of agency staff , a third of the workforce , are migrants .
They are mainly Polish , followed by Lithuanian , Latvian , Czech , Slovakian and Portuguese .
Some of the mistreatment of agency workers was illegal , it said , while other examples were a clear affront to respect and dignity .
The report concluded :
• A fifth of workers interviewed reported physical abuse , being pushed , kicked or having things thrown at them by line managers .
A Polish man working in a meat factory , said : " The managers … they would pull our clothes … and shout .
They [ threw ] hamburgers .
They were so angry because we were new and could n't do the job as fast as we were supposed to … those frozen hamburgers are like stones . "
• A third of workers said they experienced , or witnessed abuse , which was " bullying , humiliating and abusive " .
Some female workers said that women were verbally abused by line managers more than men and there were instances of sexual harassment .
One Brazilian man working in a poultry factory in the east of England , said : " I 'll never forget it ... I 'm not a slave .
I just ca n't speak English .
He talked to me like he talked with an animal .
It is so terrible ... sometimes I do n't even sleep in the night .
Because the next day , I need to go to there [ to that ] horrible place " .
• A quarter of workers mentioned poor treatment of pregnant workers and women attributed miscarriages to conditions .
There were reports of pregnant workers forced to continue work that posed risks , including heavy lifting , standing for long periods , under the threat of being sacked .
Some workers were given no further work once managers learned they were pregnancy .
• Some , including pregnant women , those with heavy periods and people with bladder problems , had been prevented from going to the toilet by their line managers .
• Some workers told ECHR they worked every day of the week without days off .
The maximum number of hours worked a week regularly was 90 hours , while some shifts lasted 16 - 18 hours with only a few hours rest in between shifts .
• Workers spoke of pains to their limbs and extreme fatigue , partly due to carrying out repetitive tasks on fast - moving production lines for extended periods .
There were also reports of a lack of protective equipment – only three in five firms said businesses provides the agency with a health and safety risk assessment .
A Polish woman , working in a meat processing factory , said : " Working at a line , its really hard work .
And the boxes are about 16kg each , so they are quite heavy and my hands are swollen at the end of the day ...
There are days I cannot open the door or keep a glass in my hand .
I can't feel anything . "
• Some workers spoke of being forced to work while tired after a long shift , ill or pregnant , under threat of losing their job .
There were reports of an agency entering homes and waking sleeping people to make them work on their day off .
• More than eight out of 10 of the 260 workers EHCR interviewed said agency workers were treated worse than directly employed workers in all aspects , from poorer pay to allocation of poor jobs , to being treated like " second - class citizens " .
Half of agencies and a third of processing forms said it was difficult to recruit British workers and that they thought they were deterred by the pay and working conditions .
A few British workers spoke of their difficulty registering for work with some agencies who supply almost exlusively eastern European workers , which would be unlawful under the Race Relations Act .
Despite finding the workplace distressing and degrading , nearly one - third of workers endured this treatment without complaint because of fears that their work would be terminated and their chances of securing stable , permanent employment harmed .
These workers also had little knowledge of their rights or how to make complaints .
However , the report also found examples of firms who managed or treated permanent and agency workers of all nationalities with respect .
One employer , Bernard Matthews , was mentioned as an employer of choice for agency workers for this reason .
One of the major problems highlighted by the commission was the way that supermarkets , as the largest customers of British meat , ordered products .
Some agencies thought that the downward price pressure exerted by supermarkets and the way they went about ordering products from suppliers brought about the conditions that supported unethical traders .
One HR manager in a poultry processing plant said : " If the supermarkets ' ordering system was better you could say for the next 10 weeks we want that amount of staff and we could recruit them . "
Firms also said their ability to offer permanent employment is affected by fluctuations at short notice in supermarket orders .
The commission 's recommendations include : supermarkets improving their auditing of suppliers ; processing firms and agencies improving recruitment practices , working environments and the ability of workers to raise issues of concern ; and for the government to provide sufficient resources for the Gangmasters ' Licensing Agency to help safeguard the welfare of workers .
It said it would review their responses over the next 12 months and will consider taking enforcement action .

Four Rio Tinto executives have been found guilty of bribery and stealing secrets by a Chinese court and have all been handed lengthy jail terms .
Australian Stern
Hu was handed a 10 - year sentence .
Wang Yong was given 14 years , Liu Caikui seven years and Ge Minqiang eight years .
The four colleagues were also fined and had assets confiscated .
Australia 's Foreign Minister Stephen Smith described
Hu's sentence as " very tough " .
Mr Smith also criticised the court for not allowing Australian diplomats access to the parts of the hearing dealing with the commercial espionage charges .
" As a consequence I think there were serious unanswered questions on that part of the trial , " he said .
AT THE SCENE By Damian Grammaticas , BBC News , Shanghai Journalists were allowed to watch on a video link as the verdicts in this highly - anticipated trial were delivered .
We had just a glimpse of the four Rio Tinto executives as they filed in and sat down in silence .
The judge reeled off lists of sums he said the four men had received in bribes .
He said they had seriously damaged the competitive interests of Chinese steel enterprises , which led China to suspend major price negotiations last year .
Many foreign businesses in China are extremely concerned that the secret proceedings of the trial mean they cannot learn the lessons of the Rio Tinto case .
There are also suggestions that foreign businesses are looking to divert investments away from China because of what they say is a growing legal and regulatory obstruction designed to protect Chinese companies and shut out foreign competitors .
" Whilst we do not condone bribery in any way , I think the sentence , on any measure , is harsh , " he said .
However , Mr Smith said the verdict and sentencing would not have any adverse effect on Australia 's relationship with China .
' Important relationship ' Rio Tinto described its employees ' behaviour as " deplorable " and said it had decided to dismiss them .
It said it had concluded that the illegal activities were carried out " wholly outside our systems " .
It has also ordered a second , more in - depth review of its processes and controls .
" [ We ] will spare no effort in doing everything we can to prevent any similar activity , " the company said in a statement .
Chief executive Tom Albanese said he was " determined " to ensure that the case did not affect the mining firm's " important relationship " with China .
Stern
Hu was Rio Tinto 's lead negotiator in talks with Chinese steel mills to try to settle a price for China to buy iron ore from Australian mining companies .
During the trial , the defendants admitted taking bribes , but disputed the amounts of money involved , their lawyers said .
According to reports ,
Hu was charged with accepting bribes of $ 900,000 ( $ 600,000 ) .
Confiscated assets
Hu was given a seven - year sentence for bribery and five years for commercial secrets theft , reduced to 10 years in total .
He also had assets worth 500,000 yuan ( $ 73,000 ; £ 49,000 ) confiscated and was fined the same amount .
China has made it absolutely clear that if we want to play on their manor , we play by their rules .
And these are not rules that are necessarily consistent with western ideals of fair play and free trade .
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert 's blog in full Nick Bryant on Rio Tinto 's response Murky world of corruption in China Ericsson in $ 1.8bn China deals Wang Yong was given 13 years for bribery and three for secrets theft , reduced to 14 years in jail .
He was fined 200,000 yuan and assets worth 5 m yuan were confiscated from him .
Liu Caikui was given five years for bribery and four for secrets theft , reduced to seven years .
He was fined 400,000 yuan and had assets worth 300,000 yuan confiscated .
Ge Minqiang was handed a six - year sentence for bribery and three and a half years for secrets theft , reduced to eight in total .
He was fined 300,000 yuan and had 500,000 worth of assets confiscated .
Australia 's Consul - General Tom Connor told reporters that all the sentences would be backdated to 5 July 2009 when the four were first arrested .
They have been detained ever since .
A month before the arrests , Rio Tinto scrapped a proposed investment of $ 19.5 bn from China 's state - owned Chinalco in favour of tie - up with BHP Billiton , which angered some in Beijing .
However , earlier this month , Rio Tinto signed a deal with Chinalco to develop a massive iron ore mine in Guinea .

Observatory has provided an astonishing new vista on our turbulent star .
The first public release of images from the satellite record huge explosions and great looping prominences of gas .
The observatory 's super - fine resolution is expected to help scientists get a better understanding of what drives solar activity .
Launched in February on an Atlas rocket from Cape Canaveral , SDO is expected to operate for at least five years .
Researchers hope in this time to go a long way towards their eventual goal of being able to forecast the effects of the Sun 's behaviour on Earth .
It 's like looking at the details of our star through a microscope
Richard Harrison , Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Solar activity has a profound influence on our planet .
Huge eruptions of charged particles and the emission of intense radiation can disrupt satellite , communication and power systems , and pose a serious health risk to astronauts .
Scientists working on SDO say they are thrilled with the quality of the data received so far .
" When we see these fantastic images , even hard - core solar physicists like myself are struck with awe , literally , " said Lika Guhathakurta , the SDO programme scientist at Nasa Headquarters .
SDO sees the Sun 's whole disc but can then zoom in to view fine detail
SDO is equipped with three instruments to investigate the physics at work inside , on the surface and in the atmosphere of the Sun .
The probe views the entire solar disc with a resolution 10 times better than the average high - definition television camera .
This allows it to pick out features on the surface and in the atmosphere that are as small as 350 km across .
The pictures are also acquired at a rapid rate , every few seconds .
In addition , the different wavelengths in which the instruments operate mean scientists can study the Sun 's atmosphere layer by layer .
A key quest will be to probe the inner workings of the solar dynamo , the deep network of plasma currents that generates the Sun 's tangled and sometimes explosive magnetic field .
It is the dynamo that ultimately lies behind all forms of solar activity , from the solar flares that explode in the Sun 's atmosphere to the relatively cool patches , or sunspots , that pock the solar disc and wander across its surface for days or even weeks .
" The SDO images are stunning and the level of detail they reveal will undoubtedly lead to a new branch of research into how the fine - scale solar magnetic fields form and evolve , leading to a much , much better understanding of how solar activity develops , " said co-investigator Richard Harrison from the UK's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory ( RAL ) .
" It 's like looking at the details of our star through a microscope , " he told BBC News .
And Dr Guhathakurta added : " It 's thought that [ SDO ] is going to revolutionise heliophysics much as the Hubble Space Telescope has revolutionised astrophysics and cosmology , which is true .
There is however a very key difference .
While Hubble is designed to observe almost everything in the cosmos , SDO is designed to study only one thing and that is our very own star .
It is tailor - made for the study of Sun stuff . "
SDO 's three remote - sensing instruments are : Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager ( HMI ) : will study the motions and magnetic fields at the Sun 's surface , or photosphere , to determine what is happening inside the star .
It will try to decipher the physics of the solar dynamo - the very source of the Sun 's activity .
The dynamo regulates all forms of solar activity from the lightning - fast eruptions of solar flares to the slow decadal undulations of the sunspot cycle .
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly ( AIA ) : is a suite of four telescopes that will image the corona , the outer layer of the Sun 's atmosphere .
The AIA filters cover 10 different wavelength bands , or colours , from the extreme ultraviolet to the visible .
It will see details as small as 725 km across .
These images will be acquired every 10 seconds .
Previous observatories have taken pictures at best every few minutes .
Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment ( EVE ) : will measure the Sun 's energy output in extreme - ultraviolet ( E - UV ) wavelengths ( this is called irradiance ) with unprecedented precision .
The Sun is at its most variable in the E - UV .
E- UV rays can break apart atoms and molecules in the Earth 's upper - atmosphere , creating a layer of ions that can severely disturb radio signals .
The UK has a prominent role in the mission through the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Didcot ; the e2v company in Chelmsford which supplied CCD camera detectors ; ABSL Space Products in Abingdon which provided the battery , the Mullard Space Science Laboratory in London ; the University of Warwick ; the University of Sheffield ; and the University of Central Lancashire ( UCLan ) in Preston .
UCLan handles the SDO data coming into the UK .
With the mission producing some 1.5 tera - bytes per day , it requires a dedicated gateway for scientists to exploit .
Multi - wavelength observations slice through the different atmospheric layers

PEWS are being ditched for pints as part of a Merthyr Tydfil chapel ’s bid to bring in younger worshippers .
A men-only beer and Bible session is just one of the new initiatives at the soon - to - be refurbished Hope Chapel in the High Street , Pontmorlais , as new ministers Tony Graham and Gareth Lloyd try to break down the boundaries between Christians and the wider community .
“ We ’re putting sofas and bar stools in the basement to have a relaxing evening and learn what the Bible ’s about , ” said Mr Lloyd .
“ Drinking is n’t a sin but people from other generations think of it as so because of alcohol abuse and the bad consequences that can come of it .
“ Forty or 50 guys will be here , studying the Bible with a pint of beer in their hand . ”
The chapel is undergoing a £ 200,000 refurbishment to bring the old building , which has been closed for the past two years , into the 21st century as the Sovereign Grace Church .
Refurbishment plans include ripping out the pews and replacing them with chairs , a move the men accept will anger some of the older congregation but one which they feel will help modernise the chapel and make it more suitable for wheelchair users .
“ I was the pastor in Dowlais Baptist Church for five years , ” said Mr Lloyd .
“ I was a young man but was so restricted and I could n’t move the gospel on .
People are worshipping in a bygone era . ”
Feeling he could not express the gospel in an up - to - date manner , the 37 - year - old moved to Christ Church in Newport , a sister branch to Hope , where he served for a year with Mr Graham .
The pair have been preaching in Merthyr for five years at Pen y Dre , and have now opened the doors to the town centre chapel .
Mr Graham , 44 , is a former Catholic who feels he first heard the word of God not in Catholic services in Belfast , but when he visited a Pentecostal Church .
“ I responded immediately , ” said the trained lawyer .
“ Then , about six years ago , I trained as a pastor .
“ We ’re trying to make church attractive to young folk , we ’re very conscious most do n’t want to go to church because it ’s boring . ”
With that in mind the organ at the back of the unused altar is gathering dust , swapped for an electronic keyboard , and services include 16 - year - old drummers and a 24 - year - old worship leader .
But there are signs that it is drawing people in – the 150 - strong congregation on Sunday was made up predominantly of young men and women .
The first beer and Bible session takes place this Saturday from 7 pm to 10.30 pm .

What ’s more important , however , is that banks beefed up their barricades against further damage .
The industry ’s first line of defense against insolvency — loan loss reserves — stood at 3.1 % of loans outstanding as this year began .
That ’s greater than any time since 1934 , when the FDIC began keeping such records .
And the last line of defense — bank equity capital — also improved , despite the repayment of three - quarters of the funds the government poured into banks and financial corporations to avoid a meltdown in 2008 .
( The federal assistance was repaid at a handsome profit to the American taxpayer , by the way . )
At 11 % , the industry ’s equity - to - asset ratio stands at its highest since 1938 .
These substantial cushions are one reason the purse strings are likely to loosen this year .
First , let ’s get the bad news out of the way : Bank losses remain huge .
The industry racked up a whopping $ 187 billion in losses last year , amounting to 2.9 % of loans outstanding — greater than any time since 1934 .
About the best that can be said is that the rate at which losses are increasing slowed during the course of the year , and a plateau seems to be taking shape .
Business access to bank loans is poised to improve as lenders get losses under control and upgrade their economic outlook , while borrowers strengthen their financial condition .
The result will be a virtuous circle : easier credit stimulating economic activity , which feeds back to still easier credit .
This ca n’t go on forever , of course .
But the self reinforcing dynamic has at least a year to run .
Banks are taking heart from the nascent economic recovery , though they remain prepared for the worst .
The Federal Reserve reported that in January , for the first time since early 2007 , the percentage of banks tightening terms on business loans was nearly offset by an equal number of them easing lending terms .
Sixty percent of the banks that did relax loan terms cited a “ more favorable or less uncertain economic outlook . ”
This growing optimism ( or , more fairly , diminished pessimism ) is largely rooted in the improving financial condition of their customers .
As I noted last week , businesses have been stockpiling cash .
The resulting liquidity bolsters lender confidence that short - term loans will hold up well .
And with the recent stabilization of property values , banks now have greater certainty when assessing the collateral backstopping longer - term loans .
The impending ease wo n’t be geographically uniform , however .
Community banks in states with more severe economic hangovers , including those coping with auto sector restructuring ( Michigan , for example ) and the real estate bust ( including Florida , California , Nevada and Arizona ) are struggling with higher loss rates and intense regulatory scrutiny that will likely be slow to thaw .
As Cam Fine , president of the Independent Community Bankers of America , puts it : “ The economies of those states are struggling , and the bank examination atmosphere has been so severe in the past two years that many bankers have decided to simply hunker down and not go out on a limb . ”
Advertisement - Article continues below
If my prediction of an imminent easing of bank lending holds up , two developments will soon confirm it .
First , the next Federal Reserve survey of lending officers will show a majority of respondents easing their terms on business loans — the first such occurrence in three years .
This survey is now under way and will be available during the first week of May .
Second , a monthly survey conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business will show a sharp drop in participants claiming that loans are “ harder to get . ”
As of February , 12 % more survey respondents said loans were harder to get than those who said credit was easier to secure .
While that ’s an improvement over last year — when , in May , a net 16 % of respondents said lending was tougher to come by than three months earlier — a 12 % margin is still symptomatic of very tight conditions .
Normally , that figure would range between 3 % and 9 % .
Aside from the obvious implication -- that creditworthy businesses wo n’t have as tough a time with their bankers -- this easing of credit is also critical to the economic outlook .
The federal stimulus is set to wind down around year - end , and the private sector will increasingly be required to keep the momentum going .
Additionally , broader lending will be an important precondition for any change in monetary policy :
It ’s hard to imagine the Fed hiking interest rates or draining money from banks when lenders still are n’t doing their job .
GREEN LIARS
PART 1 of 3

During the Bush - 41 years British - born chemist Robert Watson , the head of NASA 's " Mission to Planet Earth , " program — like Al Gore , Jr. , and Eugene TeSelle — was one of the early radical soothsayers of global warming during the mid-1980s .
Watson grabbed Gore 's attention when , during the 1992 Federal Coordinating Council on Science , Engineering and Technology Conference in Kennebunkport , Maine he said that the ozone crisis had reached such catastrophic levels that there was a genuine threat of an ozone hole in the atmosphere over Kennebunkport .
Watson , who very much wanted to join the Clinton Administration , read Gore 's pseudoscience ecoalarmist book , Earth in the Balance from which his equally fictitious , Nobel Prize winning documentary , An Inconvenient Truth ( which Britain 's equivalent to the US Supreme Court ruled it had to carry a warning label that the film was " ... partisan political advocacy , not a factual representation of what was actually happening with the climate of the world " before it could be shown in any school in England ) to make sure he was on the same page with the Vice President when they met for the first time .
Shortly after the Clintons arrived in Washington , DC , Vice President Al Gore pushed House Committee on Science , Space and Technology chairman George Brown , Jr. [ D - for early hearings on global warning and ozone depletion .
The two " expert " witnesses called were Watson and William Happer , Jr. the Director of Energy Research at the Department of Energy { DOE ] .
Happer was the most important Reagan - Bush carryover by the Clinton people because he was the most respected scientist in government .
If Clinton wanted funding for the super - conducting super - collider they needed his credibility to get the money from Congress .
As Brown 's hearing progressed , Watson resorted to Gore - style fear - baiting , arguing before the committee that chloroflourocarbons were so deadly they needed to be banned worldwide .
Watson insisted that chloroflourocarbons were burning holes in the ozone layer and would soon cause intense global warming sufficient enough to melt the ice caps in the South Pole .
Watson cited estimates from unnamed and uncredentialed environmentalists that the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere ranged for 3 % to 5 % over the past dozen years .
When he testified , Happer presented documents for the Committee that clearly showed a political paradox was in play since the actual scientific measurements — not ecoalarmist speculation — showed that an entire century 's worth of ozone depletion over the South Pole had been scientifically measured and recorded at less than 5/18th of 1 % .
Happer was branded as a heretic by the Gore ecoalarmists and , even though Clinton needed him to pitch Congress for the money to complete the super - conducting super - collider the White House needed , pressured by Gore , Clinton ordered O'Leary to fire him .
Global warming was the engine that fueled Gore a full decade before Clinton .
And global warming would become the engine that drove the new Vice President in 1993 in part because he was frozen out of just about everything else .
Hillary Clinton was determined to become the defacto Vice President .
She even took his office in the White House and forced him to move his office to the Old Executive Office Building .
Gore needed to find something else to occupy his time and attention .
Gore was content to save the world from man-made global warming .
Only , man -made global warming was a myth .
Gore had to know that the computer models the ecoalarmists used were fabricated .
But like most zealots who are convinced they are right even when real science says they 're wrong , the rules they play by let them fabricate whatever evidence they need to make them appear to be right .
When Gore created his ecoalarmist documentary An Inconvenient Truth , he wanted to prove his bogus claims that the glaciers near the South Pole were melting an alarming rate , thus suggesting that as the ice shelves broke off and floated into the warmer waters of the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans , ocean levels would rise at least 20 feet in the foreseeable future due exclusively to the Antarctic and Greenland ice melts , and that people are already evacuating the Pacific island nations due to sea level rise .
Because there was no photographic evidence that large ice ledges were breaking off the continental ice shelf in Antarctica , Gore arranged with Lion 's Gate™ and the Mark Gordon Company for the rights to use some footage from their apocalyptic environmental doomsday film , The Day After Tomorrow .
The scene in An Inconvenient Truth that depict a large ledge breaking from continental ice shelf was really a large block of Styrofoam™ that appeared to be breaking off the Antarctic ice shelf and slipping off into the ocean .
In England , as in the United States and the other industrialized democracies , the public school systems are provided large financial grants for textbooks not only from the charitable foundations of large transnational corporations but also from the carbon fuel giants .
The grants give the donors editorial rights to the textbooks they finance .
When the ecoalarmist educators in England decided to bring An Inconvenient Truth into the British public school system , Stuart Dimmock , the father of two secondary school students objected to the school forcing his children to watch what he believed was pure fiction , filed suit on May 4 , 2007 .
The film , he argued to the court , was full of ecoalarmist , political bias and factual errors about climate change .
He further argued that the film should not be shown anywhere in England without a warning label pointing out the political bias and factual errors .
The court agreed and ordered the United Kingdom 's Department of Education to attach the court 's opinion to the video and require its reading before the video could be shown in any British school .

The nine errors the court recognized in Gore 's claims were : [ 1 ]
( Error : Gore asserted that a sea - level rise of up to 20 feet would be caused by melting ice sheets " in the near future . "
Judge : " This is distinctly alarmist , and will only occur after , and ever , millennia . " [ 2 ]
Error : Low - lying Pacific atolls have already been evacuated .
Judge :
There is no evidence of any evacuation having happened . " [ 3 ]
Error : The Gulf Stream , that warms up the Atlantic , would shut down .
Judge : " It was very unlikely that the Gulf Stream would shut down in the future , though it might slow down . " [ 4 ]
Error : Graphs showing a rise in CO2 and the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years showed an " exact fit . " [ 5 ]
Error :
The disappearance of snow on Mt. Kilimanjaro was due to global warming .
Judge : " It can not be established that the recession of snow on Mt. Kilimanjaro is attributable to human - induced climate change . " [ 6 ]
Error :
The drying up of Lake Chad is a prime example of a catastrophic result of global warming .
Judge : " Insufficient to establish the exact cause . "
( Author 's note :
The drying up of lakes and rivers , and the conversion of fertile lands into deserts is the direct result of the lack of carbon dioxide , When carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere , plantlife — even tundra — cannot produce oxygen , the byproduct of carbon dioxide which is the food plants eat .
Without oxygen to bond with hydrogen , rain will cease and the rivers and streams which feed the lakes of the land , will dry up — as will the lakes . ) [ 7 ]
Error : Hurricane Katrina was blamed on global warming .
Judge : " There is insufficient evidence to show that . " [ 8 ]
Error : polar bears were being found that had actually drowned swimming long distances — up to 60 miles — to find the ice .
Judge : " Only four polar bears have been found drowned , because of a storm . "
( Editor 's note : Gore used the attached photo of what appears to be two polar bears stranded on a melting Arctic ice floe , suggesting the floe broke off from the continental ice shelf during the winter months as evidence that global warming would ultimately destroy the polar bear population .
Gore 's advocacy suggested the photo was taken by Canadian environmentalists when it fact it was taken by an Australian marine biology student , Amanda Byrd on a field trip .
The photo was taken in August — in the middle of the summer — when the fringes of the Arctic ( not Antarctica ) ice sheets melt each year regardless of whether or not we are in a hot or cool solar cycle .
The ice floe , by the way , was within easy swimming distance of the polar ice shelf .
The photo ended up in the Ottawa Citizen which first attributed it to Canadian environmentalists .
It was then printed by the New York Times , the London Daily Mail and the Sydney , Australia Sunday Telegraph .
Sanitized from fiction to fact , the photo was made for Gore .
It did n't matter that it was not true .
Four newspapers said it was .
That was good enough for him . ) [ 9 ]
Error : Coral reefs were bleaching because of global warming and other factors .
Judge : " Separating the impacts of stresses due to climate change from other stresses such as over - fishing and pollution , was difficult . "
Creating the machine for the redistribution of wealth
Selecting the environment as his personal charge , Gore went about picking his team .
Gore had already picked socialist eco-wacko Carol Browner ( who was one of 14 leaders of the communist Commission for a Sustainable World Society when Obama tapped her as his Energy Czar ) to head the EPA when he convinced Clinton to bring former US Senator Timothy Wirth on board .
Wirth wanted the EPA slot .
Gore wanted him as Energy Secretary .
When word leaked out that Clinton planned to name Wirth to Energy , a delegation of Senators from both sides of the aisle called Clinton and told him to save the appointment for someone who could be confirmed .
Wirth , they told him , was not that person .
Clinton named him Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs — a job that did not require Senatorial vetting .
It should have .
Wirth , with help from Gore , was the primary author of the Kyoto Protocol .
Wirth , as Clinton 's — or more appropriately — Gore 's personal Undersecretary , together with Sen. John Heinz [ R - PA ] ( the former husband of Theresa Heinz - Kerry ) created what was initially going to be called " Project 88 . "
It was the money baron 's first attempt to enact the " Cap & Trade " concept to tax the emission of carbon dioxide in what would be a tax on every living person in the United States and , ultimately , a UN tax on the industrialized world .
Project 88 was buried in the Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990 .
The law contained a provision that would allow industries in smog - layered industrialized states to purchase ' pollution credits " from the government .
The total amount of " credits " given could not exceed the national " cap " on emissions .
Thus , when one corporation purchased emissions credits , another corporation somewhere else lost them .
Since purchasing carbon dioxide emission credits would be expensive , only the Fortune 500 companies could afford to buy them .
This greatly raised the cost of production on small , family - owned businesses with carbon dioxide emission levels that are too high , but who can't afford to buy credits , forcing them to reduce production and lose market share to the transnational industrialists who produce far more pollutants but buy carbon credits that " ecologically erase " the affect of their smog by basically selling it to the emerging nations where smog does n't count because even the world 's most horrific ecoalarmists know that global warming and cooling ( i.e. , climate change ) is not caused by carbon dioxide , it is caused by the solar cycles of the sun .
These cycles generally last about 11 years .
About 80 - years ago astro-scientists discovered that solar eruptions have an east - west orientation that reverses its magnetic polarity with each new cycle , creating what could be construed as a 22 - year cycle rather than an 11 - year cycle .
When each new cycle begins it first impacts temperatures at either the North or South pole regions .
At midpoint in the cycle ( usually around 5 1/2 years ) it impacts temperatures at the equator , warming the waters of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico and creating " hurricane season . "
As the global warming gurus screamed that Hurricane Katina in 2005 was caused by man-made global warming , it was actually due to Solar Cycle 23 which began to die in Feb. , 2007 .
The first signs of Cycle 24 were seen in June , 2007 with warmer temperatures at the North Pole .
The ecoalarmists blamed that phase of climate change on man .
In March , 2008 , we reversed into Solar Cycle 24 .
Only , the massive solar eruptions that marked Solar Cycle 23 are thus far absent in Cycle 24 .
The Earth entered into what could be a decades - long cooling phase sometime in the 1950s , but its full impact was concealed by solar eruptions during two 11 - year solar cycle that ended in 1975 .
By 1976 the ecoalarmists were screaming man-made " ice age ! " and blaming it on carbon dioxide emissions .
Understand this : whether its global warming or global cooling , the climate change advocates will continue to claim that the culprit is carbon dioxide because the money that funds the global warming mantra knew rationing of crude oil , which they still insist , publicly , is a fossil fuel created from the decayed carcasses of dinosaurs , allow them to dramatically raise its price without public outcry .
While the environmentalists decry " Big Oil , " they are nevertheless funded , by the most part , by the same Seven Sisters whom they protest and denounce .

Just as the 150 - year old lie that oil is the byproduct of decayed dinosaurs and prehistoric fauna is a every bit as much a tooth fairy fabrication as the ecoalarmist extremism " evidence " that global warming is caused by man , and that by imposing draconian regulations on the consumer use of fossil fuels that global warming can be reversed .

ARCATA , California ( Reuters ) – Below the perpetual fog that shrouds the redwood groves , green hills and rocky coastline of remote Humboldt County thrives a lucrative but hush - hush industry — marijuana .
Pot pays the bills in this Northern California enclave , home to hippies and good old boys alike who espouse the weed ’s curative and economic benefits .
The expensive trucks , bustling restaurants , escalating rents and plentiful wads of cash all point to profitable pot cultivation in Humboldt .

Now , a state voter initiative on the November ballot that would make California the first U.S. state to legalize and tax this cash crop has locals jittery about losing their dominant market position .
“ We ’ve always had a cannabis tinge to our culture , ” said Kevin Hoover , editor of weekly newspaper The Arcata Eye .
“ What we have now is a very entrenched industry that ’s making a lot of money off the fact that it ’s illegal . ”
Starting in the 1960 ’s , free - thinkers wanting to get away from it all moved to the area long dominated by the lumber and fishing industries .
Marijuana cultivation supported these new residents and newly unemployed blue - collar workers who watched the demise of Humboldt ’s traditional manufacturing base .
Although the underground pot economy makes for poor statistics , Beth Wilson , an associate professor of economics at Humboldt State University , estimates the area ’s annual income from marijuana at about $ 500 million .
The “ multiplier effect ” of that money circulated to support local businesses — garden centers do a brisk business and the town of Arcata ’s sushi restaurant is always packed — could push that figure to $ 1 billion annually , she said .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s not negligible , ” said Wilson .
PURPLE KUSH PLEASE
Everyone knows someone who grows pot .
In the north county , indoor growing that fetches prices of over $ 3,000 per pound is popular , while in the south , marijuana is planted outdoors .
The industry has also fueled an itinerant labor force of “ trimmers ” who make $ 20 per hour or more snipping the leaves from the more potent dried buds of the plant .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ This vote has become a conflict of interest , ” said Deniz Farnell , 31 , an Arcata hotel worker , who , like the vast majority of locals , supports decriminalizing pot smoking .
“ Do you vote for the good of the state or for the next - door neighbor who ’s a mom who ’s supplementing her income through trimming ?
When that law passes , she ’ll be on food stamps . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
That is because legalizing marijuana could turn a cottage industry into Pot Inc .
Locals fear big tobacco will swoop in and drive down prices , supplying millions of new , legal pot smokers with “ Marlboro Green . ”
Rumors abound in Arcata that the tobacco giants have already snatched up land and copyrights to the most popular names of weed strains , whether Purple Kush , Big Bud , Headband , Trainwreck or L.A. Confidential .
But at least one big tobacco company , Reynolds American , says it has no plans to move in .
“ Everything else would be purely rumors and speculation , ” said spokesman David Howard .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We better hope it does n’t become legal because this area is going to become a ghost town , ” one reader wrote to the North Coast Journal in a response to a recent article on how to stay afloat in the post - illegal pot era .
The Tax Cannabis campaign has gained traction in the cash - strapped state of California , historically at the forefront of contentious social issues .
It led the nation in 1996 by approving the use of cannabis for medical purposes .
An April 2009 Field Poll showed 56 percent of state voters supported legalizing pot for social use and taxing the sales .
On a statewide level , that could bring in $ 1.4 billion per year , according to the office that regulates sales tax .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Think of all the pot smokers out there , ” said a mid-30s mom who has grown for six years , plans to enter law school , and favors legalization .
“ They can bail California out of its deficit .
Smoke more pot ! ”
Under the initiative , possession and cultivation of small amounts of pot for personal use would be legal for those 21 and over .
The measure allows municipalities to determine how to tax and regulate the drug — with monies going to local governments — and does not affect medical marijuana laws .
Pot is illegal under U.S. law but the Obama administration halted raids on medical marijuana clinics last year .
It is unclear how state legalization would be affected by federal law , and whether the U.S. government would interfere .
APPELLATION FOR HUMBOLDT BUD ?
Those who favor legalization predict it could curtail the seamier side of the industry .
The profusion of “ grow houses , ” gutted to accommodate indoor greenhouses , have pushed up rental prices , while robberies of cash and plants are on the rise .
ADVERTISEMENT
With no real organized opposition to the measure , local leaders in Humboldt say it ’s time to face up to the future and brainstorm creative ideas to offset any impending slump .
“ Here we have an industry with whom our county ’s name has , quite frankly , become synonymous , ” said County Supervisor Mark Lovelace .
“ We ’ve lived with the downside of that name association for the past thirty years .
Maybe it ’s time to capture some of the upside . ”
Ideas include taking a tip from French champagne , branding the Humboldt name as an appellation and focusing on terroir and tasting rooms .
Others say that ’s a pipe dream .
“ We do n’t need to panic and create weed Disneyland , ” said one grower , who believes the risk to growers has been overblown and foresees a continuing black market even if the law passes .
The 32 - year - old illegal grower , who declined to be identified , predicts connoisseurs will eschew the cheaper varieties in a legal market and pay a premium for Humboldt ’s best strains .
ADVERTISEMENT
Pot growers could also harness their know - how for other horticultural pursuits , he said .
“ It ’s easy money right now , ” said the self - described “ average indoor grower ” with $ 40,000 in income every two and a half months .
“ But these might be the future organic farmers of the area .
That skill can be applied to more things than just marijuana . ”

Printer Friendly Page I love to decorate my Christmas Yule Log with these Meringue Mushrooms .
They are crispy and nice and sweet which makes them the perfect accompaniment to the rich and chocolately Yule Log .
But they are also very nice on their own .
For a gift , package them in a party bag tied with a festive ribbon or place them in a basket .
While there is a recipe for Meringue Mushrooms in Fannie Farmer 's Original 1896 Boston Cooking School Cookbook , I think Maida Heatter is responsible for their current popularity .
She has a recipe for Meringue Mushrooms in her lovely 1978 book " Book of Great Chocolate Desserts " which is the same recipe she used to win first prize for originality at the International Cooking Olympics .
Meringue Mushrooms are really not difficult to make .
But there are a few things to keep in mind when making any meringue .
First , make sure the egg whites are at room temperature and free of any specks of egg yolk .
Superfine sugar makes for a smoother meringue as it is easier for the sugar to dissolve .
Make sure your bowl and whisk are clean and free of grease to obtain maximum volume .
Adding the sugar gradually to the egg whites ensures that the sugar completely dissolves and does not produce a gritty meringue .
Cream of tartar is used in the whipping of egg whites to stabilize them and allows them to reach maximum volume ( although you can use an equal amount of lemon juice ) .
Also , it is a good idea to use parchment paper to line your baking sheets .
Distribute the caps and stems evenly on the baking sheet to ensure even baking .
You can put the ' caps ' on one sheet and ' stems ' on another , as I have done , or you can bake them all on one baking sheet .
To prevent cracking of the meringues , do not open the oven door during the first hour of the baking time .
Baking the meringues in a slow oven allows for gradual evaporation of the moisture from the meringues .

You will need two baking sheets lined with parchment paper .
To make all the mushrooms the same size , I like to make a template .
Take a piece of parchment paper and draw 24 - 2 inch ( 5 cm ) circles , spacing the circles about 1 inch ( 2.5 cm ) apart .
Flip the parchment paper over , and place it on your baking sheet .
Have ready a large piping bag fitted with a round plain 1/3 inch tip ( 8 mm ) ( I used Ateco # 804 ) .
In the bowl of your electric mixer , fitted with the whisk attachment , ( or with a hand mixer ) beat the egg whites and cream of tartar , on medium low speed until soft peaks form .
Continue beating , on high speed , gradually adding the superfine sugar , until the whites are shiny and hold stiff peaks .
( To make sure that the sugar has fully dissolved , rub a little of the meringue between your fingers .
It should feel smooth , not gritty .
If it feels gritty then beat the meringue a little more . )
Transfer the meringue to your piping bag .
To Pipe Caps : Holding the pastry bag upright and close to the parchment paper , and with even pressure , pipe the meringue into 2 inch ( 5 cm ) rounds that are about 1 inch ( 2.5 cm ) high .
Smooth out any tips on the tops of the meringues using a wet fingertip .
To Pipe Stems : Holding the pastry bag upright and close to the parchment paper , and with even pressure , pipe the meringue into a cone - shape that is about 1 inch ( 2.5 cm ) high .
Try to keep the stems as straight as possible .
Some of the stems may fall over during baking , so it is best to make a few extra stems .
Bake the meringues for about 1 1/ 4 to 1 1/2 hours , or until the meringues are firm enough that they easily release from the parchment paper without sticking .
Once baked , turn off the oven , have the oven door slightly ajar , and allow the meringues to completely cool and dry out .
I like to leave them in the turned off oven at least a couple of hours ( or preferably overnight ) .
To attach the mushroom stems to the caps , spread the bottom of each mushroom cap with a little melted chocolate ( acts like a glue ) .
Then gently press the top of a stem into the center of the mushroom cap .
Let the chocolate dry by placing the meringue mushrooms upside down on a baking sheet .
Once the chocolate hardens , lightly dust the tops of the mushrooms with cocoa powder .
Store in an airtight container for several weeks .
If you live in a humid climate I find it best to store the meringue mushrooms in the refrigerator .
Makes about 24 - 2 inch ( 5 cm ) Meringue Mushrooms .

Outraged Judge Reverses Murder Convictions

Declaring that two convicted murderers suffered a “ manifest injustice , ” a judge ordered two New Haven men set free after serving 16 years — but prosecutors have blocked their release , for now .
George Gould and Ronald Taylor ( pictured left and right ) are currently serving 80 - year sentences for the murder of Fair Haven bodega owner Eugenio DeLeon Vega on July 4 , 1993 .
After two key state witnesses came forward and admitted they were coerced by police to give false testimony , Taylor and Gould have been fighting for their freedom through a habeas corpus suit .
Click here , here , and here for previous in - depth articles on the case by the Advocate ‘s Betsy Yagla and Caleb Smith .
In a blistering , 58 - page decision Wednesday — labeled “ unprecedented ” by one longtime criminal defense attorney — Superior Court Judge Stanley Fuger , Jr. took their side .
He ordered the men be released from prison immediately , that their convictions and sentences be tossed out , and that the finding of probable cause and even the arrest warrants all be vacated .
“ It is now an inescapable conclusion that a manifest injustice has been done to these two men , ” Judge Fuger wrote .
George Gould and Ronald Taylor served 16 years in prison “ for a crime that , based upon all of the available evidence , they did not commit , ” he found .
Click here to read Fuger ’s decision .
If upheld , the decision means Gould and Taylor would be set free , and the state would have to start from scratch if it wanted to bring a new trial .
Peter Tsimbidaros of Fairfield , Taylor ’s attorney , said he visited both men in person Wednesday to deliver the news .
Taylor , who has been diagnosed with cancer , lay handcuffed to a hospital bed at the UConn medical center .
Gould is at the MacDougall - Walker Correctional Institution in Suffield .
He is represented by attorney Joseph Visone of Mendon , Mass .
Tsimbidaros said it was hard to explain the great relief these men expressed after working so hard for their freedom .
“ They were both very emotional and appreciative , ” he said .
However , the bells of freedom were interrupted by an intervention from the state .
On the heels of Fuger ’s decision Wednesday , Supervisory Assistant State ’s Attorney Michael O’Hare filed an “ emergency motion for stay of execution ” with the state appellate court .
O’Hare asked the court to put the case on hold to give the state time to review the decision .
O’Hare said the judge only faxed his office the final page of the 58 - page decision , which orders the prisoners ’ immediate release without an automatic waiting period for appeals .
Fuger ’s orders would mean “ the immediate release of two individuals who have been convicted of a brutal homicide , ” without giving the state time for an “ orderly ” appeal , O’Hare protested .
Click here to read his motion .
The Appellate Court ’s Chief Judge Joseph P. Flynn granted the motion Wednesday , effectively delaying Judge Fuger ’s orders , and the prisoners ’ release until Monday at 2 p.m. ...
And So Shall
This Case Fall Fuger ’s decision uses passionate language in parts , and at times reads more like magazine feature than a court document .
“ A senseless , cold - blooded , execution style murder was committed in the early morning hours of July 4th , 1993 , ” Fuger begins .
Eugenio Deleon Vega went to his small Fair Haven bodega , La Casa Green , to open shop at 5:08 a.m .
“ Before the hour of six AM , before he could even arrange the morning newspapers , he was dead .
He had been executed , shot once in the left temple with a projectile from a .38 caliber semiautomatic pistol .
These are indisputable facts . ”
Fuger sets the scene for his sharp reproof with a blazing sub -header on Page One .
“ This case rises and falls on the testimony of Doreen Stiles , ” the sub - header reads , quoting New Haven ’s Senior Assistant State Attorney James Clark ’s words during Taylor and Gould ’s 1995 Superior Court trial .
“ No truer statement has ever been spoken , ” Fuger wrote .
Stiles , a drug - addicted police informant , was the only supposed eyewitness who placed the defendants at the murder scene .
DNA evidence found at the murder scene did not match Gould or Taylor .
The state ’s case rested on Stiles ’ testimony , as Clark openly admitted during the trial .
Stiles came forward and recanted her statement in 2006 , allowing the defendants to open a joint habeas corpus claim of actual innocence , based on new evidence .
It is “ crystal clear , ” wrote Fuger , “ that the sole piece of evidence , the only thread that links George Gould and Ronald Taylor to this senseless murder is the testimony of Doreen Stiles .
If this tether breaks , then there is absolutely nothing that implicates these two men . ”
“ At the trial of the case in 1995 , the case rose because Doreen Stiles made that linkage ; at the trial of the habeas petition in 2009 , the case must fall , once again , based upon the testimony of Doreen Stiles , ” Fuger wrote .
Stiles originally testified under oath that she saw Gould enter the store , heard a gunshot , and saw Gould and Taylor leave the murder scene .
During a habeas trial in 2009 , Judge Fuger got what he called a unique chance to hear fresh testimony from a witness , and compare it with testimony from a prior trial .
Stiles , now drug - free and confined to a wheelchair , confessed during the habeas trial that she had lied under oath and was never at the murder scene at all .
A second state witness , Mary Boyd , also recanted her statements during the habeas trial .
Fuger said his habeas case came down to a question of credibility —
Is Stiles lying now about her recantation ?
Or was she lying then ?
The answer lay in her demeanor , he said .
“ In a nutshell , this Court finds that the demeanor of Doreen Stiles on the witness stand in the habeas trial is far more conducive to finding her to be credible when she recanted her earlier testimony than when she initially delivered that earlier testimony . ”
In the first trial , the witness looked “ drawn , haggard , and was clearly annoyed at the whole proceeding . ”
She was “ hostile ” and not polite .
In the second trial , her whole demeanor changed , and she no longer had a “ combatant , impatient ” air about her , the judge found .
“ She was polite , thoughtful , in no way evasive and presented clear and uncompromised testimony . ”
Police Coercion
Why did Stiles lie during the first trial ?
“ Simply put , Ms. Stiles , in 1993 , was a deeply troubled woman , addicted to heroin ( 10 bags a day ) , and engaging in prostitution to fuel her habit , ” Fuger wrote .
She was “ dopesick ” on heroin when cops picked her up on a prostitution charge later that July .
Detectives , “ in particular , Det. Brian Sullivan , ” told her “ if she did not tell them what they needed to hear , that she would be taken downstairs and booked on the charge of prostitution , ” Fuger ’s decision reads .
Detective Sullivan told her that he would help her buy heroin “ if she told them what happened . ”
Only then did Stiles , guided by “ not - so - subtle hints ” from detectives , pick out Gould and Taylor from a photo lineup and — “ in response to the suggestive questions of the police ” — come up with a story about witnessing the murder .
Two detectives then gave her $ 60 , and drove her to a house on Wolcott Street so she could buy heroin .
Detectives later took her out for a dinner of stuffed shrimp , and took her out to buy more heroin , Stiles testified .
Police denied giving Stiles money to buy drugs .
Fuger went on to poke holes in the state ’s case , which he said “ is that the petitioners were two crack addicts who had been committing several small street robberies to obtain money with which to buy crack cocaine . ”
He ran down several details of the state ’s case that did not match up .
In a scathing closing , Fuger said the case completely falls apart without Stiles ’ testimony .
“ In short , the finding that Doreen Stiles was not telling the truth in 1993 - 1995 not only renders the ultimate conviction unreliable , it wholly vitiates all of the proceedings against George Gould and Ronald Taylor .
These cases , in fact , go way beyond ‘ actual innocence . ’
The criminal cases never should have been initiated in the first place !
These men deserve immediate relief . ”
“ Unprecedented , ” “ Breathtaking ” “ Wow . Wow , ” said longtime New Haven civil rights lawyer Norm Pattis upon hearing the news Thursday .
He called the decision “ breathtaking ” and “ unprecedented in my mind . ”
Habeas corpus relief is rarely granted , and if a judge overturns a conviction , it ’s most often because new DNA analysis comes into play and invalidates a conclusion that was made in good faith .
The judge in this case made a much more far - reaching conclusion , Pattis noted .
“ Fuger went an extra step and said , based on what was known at this time , this should never have happened , ” Pattis noted .
“ This is more than an honest mistake . ”
Pattis called the decision “ incredibly encouraging . ”
“ It gives hope to others who are wrongfully convicted , ” he said .
“ What ’s chilling , ” Pattis said , is there are other people in prison based on mistakes and sloppy police work .
“ It ’s no mystery , a lot of these cases involve men of color , who remain a dispensable class ” in modern society .
Pattis said the state now faces a tough question : “ What do you do when you ’ve stolen someone ’s life with a lie ? ”
The legislature should act quickly and ask the state to pony up to repay these men for their suffering , he said .
“ Restitution is a small word , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think enough can be done for these men . ”

Un - freaking - believable !!!
What a disgusting , abominable , humiliating , and hurtful chain of events .
This is not just about getting the wrong dudes , or making a human mistake .
This is more about officers of the court and the law blatantly disrespecting and cheating the criminal justice system in the most unspeakable manner ; recklessly using their professional power and privilege to do nothing but ruin the lives of innocent people and their families .
What a disgrace !!
posted by : Shady on March 18 , 2010 4:41 pm ... Do you know how hard it is to convict a person of murder ?
The detectives do n’t have that much power to do it alone .
I know it makes a great story , but it is not easy to do .
In order to do it , the police , witness , states attorney , judge and jury have to be on the same page .
Run the inmates rap sheet before you start celebrating and saying these men were wronged .
...
This judge should be ashamed of himself and remember the victim , oh how we always forget the victim .

Before you go putting halos on both these men ’s heads , look at their prior records and lifestyles .

Nobody is celebrating these dudes !!
But there is NEVER justification for officers of the law and the court to FRAUDULENTLY use their power to put two people behind bars for crimes they did not commit .
Cops and state attorneys are not supposed to be CHEATERS !!
They are supposed to uphold the LAW !!
Not say , we did n’t get you on this so we will ILLEGALLY get you on something else ?
CHEATERS !!

Here ’s an interesting twist .
In a murder case , the state often focuses on that and not on any other crimes a defendant committed , and usually folds them over into the sentencing .
Taylor admittedly committed numerous street robberies , for which he should have been put away for 20 years anyway .
So vacate the murder sentence and resentence him for all the crimes he committed and you net out zero anyway .
And this judge referring to Taylor ’s street robberies as “ small ” and insignificant shows this judge is a bit of a loonybird .

Even if the two defendants hold prior histories of petty crime , you can still only convict them on this crime if you have the evidence .
It would seem quite clearly that the police and prosecution did not have adequate evidence , only the ‘ hearsay ’ testimony of two witnesses , both of whom later recanted their statements .
These two defendants may have been destined for a life in and out of jail because of their lifestyle , but this does not give either the police or the prosecution the right to circumnavigate the justice procedure .
If the two defendants did not commit this crime , then they should n’t be behind bars .
The police and prosecution involved in this case have brought disrepute and disrespect upon themselves , their colleagues , and their city .
They have also opened the way up to be sued by these men for wrongful conviction , and possibly leading to criminal prosecution for perjury and falsifying evidence in order to gain a conviction .
Not to mention the trampling of the two defendent ’s social rights .
The means to conviction do not justify the gaining of the conviction .

Sharon , you are mistaken my husband Ronald Taylor was never arrested before this case and if you truly believe that the police and the state attorney do n’t have that much power read this case .
Yes I remember the victim maybe his son Carlos Deleon should have remembered that before he shot his father in the head after stealing over $ 50,000 from his father ’s business bank account and executed after Mr. Vega found at it ’s all in the court records

And as far as Ronaled Taylor ’s lifestyle .
I dare anyone who made such a comment to throw the first stone .
There but for the grace of God .

When prisons were in command prisoners could look forward to being productive in life .
But after several decades of prison bureaucrats experimenting with new reform methods they ended up taking a well run prison system and turned it into a Nightmare of Hell and a Playground for Criminal ’s Rights .
There is no prison reform methods left that will cure the lack of administrative and prisoner discipline , or stop how prisons have become so contaminated with flaws , imbedded with unthinking unknowing or corrupted officials and political bureaucrats ?
it send chills up and down your spine , when you are forced to move daily between freedom and captivity while walking a delicate line between administrative politics and the threat of inmate violence .
The lockup system in these new high - tech all solitary confinement prisons , have turned most convicts into psychopathic monsters , acting like prehistoric man existing all over again …
My prison career was coming to an end and I was looking forward to my retirement when what I always expected would happen did happen .
One morning in my shop , without security present , I was brutally attacked by a serial killer serving two life terms for several senseless killings .
He showed no remorse in society nor did he in prison .
He should have received the death penalty , but lawmakers and prison officials choose to protect this criminal ’s rights at taxpayers ’ expense …
Gang wars are taking over our society like butter melting over a hot stove .
Approximately eighty - percent of thugs and gangsters control prison compounds and are career criminals , which come from the ghettos of our society .
Eventually , the old gang members from the streets will be incarcerated for new crimes , and meet up with old gang members already imprisoned .
Together they will bond once again , to continue dealing in contraband and committing more crimes in prisons .
Taxpayers are living in hard times to support their families and keep their jobs .
But this merry - go - round of political justice to protect criminal ’s rights while they keep violated the rights of other is un-constitutional …
In today ’s society we have too many repeat - felons being released from prisons without being fully disciplined or rehabilitated .
That is why repeat felons along with illegal - immigrants are committing most of the crimes in the United States .
Lawmakers for years cannot locate approximately twelve - million illegal immigrants crossing the borders into this country .
The new programs they are offering is to trick illegal immigrant out of hiding , by providing full amnesty , and give them entry permit into this country , along with healthcare benefits , at taxpayers ’ expense .
This is not going to help reduce the deficit and crime rates in this country .
Federal Lawmakers recognize that prison spending is out of control .
They keep pressuring the local government and prison officials , to set up a program that will reduce prison overcrowding and release thousands of criminals that have not completed their sentences or been fully reformed .
For example , in California they have approximately 33 - prisons that are filled with about 153 - thousand criminals , and most of them are murderers , rapist , pedophiles , and drug - pushers and mentally unstable inmates living off the taxpayers .
But why are lawmakers demanding that 55 - thousand criminals from the California Correctional Facilities , be released within 3 - years .
When most of them are career criminals and will return back to prisons committing the same crimes ?
Taxpayers ’ will be paying over $ 5,000 dollars a years to keep one - criminal on parole .
Not to mention , the cost of law - enforcement officers putting their lives on the line again , chasing down the same felon (s ) to be put back through our Judicial System at taxpayers ’ expense .
The present California Governor is now trying to make lawmakers reconsider their options of releasing prisoners because of the recidivism rate , which is more then seventy - nine percent returning in one to three - years .
The three major problems that criminals have when incarcerated is to get revenge , continue dealing in contraband and demoralize and attack correctional officers because they remind them of the police officers on the streets .
Prison Officials ; know that repeat felons get more violent and evil - minded because they are surrounded , daily , by the same type of criminals they have become .
You cannot reform criminals without re-socializing them first .
And that ’s why rehabilitation and prison reform have become just words to keep the taxpayer ’s money flowing into these institutions .
In Mexico , the crime rates are high , and that breeds a lot of corruption in their society , including law - enforcement officials .
They now have the highest kidnapping rate in the world .
When these Mexicans and millions of other illegal immigrants keep pouring over the boarders into our county , crime rates keep increasing .
Phoenix Arizona now has the second highest kidnapping rate in the world .
The federal panel of lawmakers within our government has created a stimulus package to help the American taxpayers that are out of work and many have to foreclose on their homes .
The sad situation within our government , is how they are taking chances with taxpayers ’ money to create stimulus packages , while supporting the highest deficit in the history of this country ?
How can our children and grandchildren that will be paying for all this , and continue to pay for government experiments and their political adventures without jobs ?
Prison spending is out of control .
And the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world .
When I hear how local governors , of each state , keeps on playing politics with the federal government in hopes they can reduce prison spending by reducing prison population , closing prisons , and reducing prison staff .
This type of thinking is hypercritical and appalling to the security of prisons and society .
Hello out there my fellow American , do n’t walk to the employment office run , before some lawmakers pass a new law to allow illegal immigrants to collect unemployment …
Prison officials cannot afford or keep releasing dangerous prisoners frivolously .
Our criminal justice system was developed by lawmakers to pass laws to put these criminals behind bars and keep society safe .
You can now read how federal and state prisons have deteriorated to their worst condition in the history of these institutions .
They have changed from being run with dignity and strong security into a hellish nightmare where corruption is the norm .
With the loss of positive leadership in our prisons came the increase of prisoner ’s power , primarily caused by their ability to hide behind highly - defended “ Civil Rights ” , which has now taken precedence above all else .
These rights allowed them to live without fear of strong retribution for their actions , thereby leading to a breakdown in inmate behavior and resulting in riots , fights , and physical and verbal abuse of prison workers .
Sincerely
John J. Pecchio , Author

Despite the criminal justice system ’s massive failure in convicting these men originally , the case is now a triumph of justice .
I know the old saw about justice delayed being justice denied , and that these men ca n’t get 16 years back , but the truth came out and set them free .

I have been waiting for years for George Gould ’s success in overturning his conviction .
I have known George and his family for over 12 years , and I knew from the start that he was not guilty of this murder .
I visited him many times , read the whole transcript , discussed the case with him , and did some work to help him pursue justice .
Finally he and Ron Taylor got an outstanding investigator who uncovered a lot of new evidence , and Judge Fuger really listened to all the testimony and studied the case carefully .
As he said in his decision , this case should never have even been brought to trial .
Why are the prosecutors still trying to deny that police obstructed justice by falsely coercing witnesses , leaving the real murderer out in our community ?
Does n’t this make you wonder how many others have been wrongly convicted in CT ?
I personally know several individuals wrongly identified by witnesses and convicted because of it .
Thank God that the truth finally came out about Gould & Taylor .
I look forward to George ’s success in his future career as a talented artist .

Hello people
…
It is awesome to finally see someone of Superior stick of for convicted ppl .
True when they state that it is alot of innocent people sitting behind bars for NOTHING .. NOTHING at all , I know there are some folks saying ohh most of them committed the crime but the truth of the matter is no most of the time some of these folks do n’t ccommitthe crime but because their aAfricanaAmericansor consider a minority ppl have no choice but to take what the state offer them without a paid lawyer …
Its all about money , when you have the money to pay your way out your are all good .
But when you do n’t have the money to fight your right you are cornered to take what ever deal is best …
I think it is time for them to go through alot of ppls records and reconsider a fair punishment or if any ..
We have alot of folks out here that ca n’t even make it becuase of the system .
These men may be free per the judge but theres one man who is dieing form cancer yes that is right DIEING from cancer and altalthough is a relief to be out of priprisono will repay this man of 16yrs lost for nothing for some crocrockedp or decdetective lie on him ( prey is what I like to call it ) they preyed on the weak the less unfortunate people they knew could n’t pay for attorney fees .
And now look whos to say that they did n’t kill this man .
I pray to God for these men sake that if they really did n’t do this and if those detectives did it ….
I hope the get the same kind of treatment life in prision or the death penalty …
They took these men lives away , money can’t repay all the things they have missed in 16 yrs children weddings grandchildren parents homegoihome - goings is trully truly

No shock for me .
Welcome to Connecticut Justice .
Welcome to American justice .
And someone had the nerve to say that justice prevailed because they are released after half of their life was spent serving time for something they did n’t do .
Should they be grateful ?
Wow !!!!

I am grateful that Judge Fuger , Jr. is a part of our judicial system .
I have a few questions for “ Shady ”
It is an appropriate pseudonym for one who exhibits such ignorance .
Does having a rap sheet as a petty thief and drug addict makes you a hit man ?
How do we know that the very police officers who reportedly went to such lengths to set up these two men were not themselves involved in the crime ?
And to Ohwait :
If we were to treat everyone , including some police officers , and even you , according to your past deeds many of them and you would likely be locked away too .
And some police officers should have been .
Not all prior records and lifestyles make one a cold - blooded killer .
How about what was said about Mr. DeLeon ’s son in the records ?
Who were his friends ?
Why were the police so quick to pay a vulnerable drug addict to lie against these two men ?
Why would the judiciary system take the word of this one person and lock away these men for life ?
Could it be that because they are black , and because they are not valued by society ?
When we think of all the unsolved murders in New Haven , what was so special about this one why ( according to their own witness ) they had to plot to frame these two men ?
Do you know how many affluent students get through law & medical school by abusing many substances that help them to stay awake ?
Many also commit illegal acts !
Drug addiction is really common .
Those of you who think like Shady and Ohwait should remember the famous NY Police case of officers Frank Serpico and David Durk .
While working as a plainclothes police officer in 1967 , Serpico reported “ credible evidence of widespread , systematic police corruption ” .[ cite this quote ]
However , bureaucracy slowed down his efforts , [ 5 ] until he connected with another officer , David Durk , who helped him in his anti-corruption efforts .
Serpico was shot in the face at point blank range with a .22 LR handgun .
The bullet penetrated his cheek just below the eye and lodged at the top of his jaw ; he lost balance , fell to the floor , and began to bleed profusely .
Serpico ’s colleagues failed to place a “ 10 - 13 ” , a dispatch to police headquarters indicating that an officer has been shot .
[ 6 ]
Instead , Serpico was saved by an elderly Hispanic man who lived in an apartment adjacent to the one being used by the suspects ; the man called emergency services and reported that a man had been shot , and then stayed with Serpico to help keep him alive until an ambulance arrived . [ 6 ]
A police squad car arrived prior to the ambulance , however , and the officers , unaware of the bloodied Serpico ’s identity , took him to Greenpoint Hospital . ”
Why did this happen ?
Because Serpico was set up by his so - called partners who wanted him dead for reporting on their criminal activities .
Police corruption wherever it is reported is nothing new .
The only surprise is when someone has the courage to report on it .
Serpico was deafened in his left ear by the gunshot , which severed an auditory nerve , and has suffered chronic pain from fragments lodged in his brain .
Although he was visited the day after the shooting by Mayor John V. Lindsay and Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy , while he lay recovering in bed from his wounds , the police department harassed him with hourly bed checks .
He survived , and ultimately testified in front of the Knapp Commission .
“ The circumstances surrounding Serpico ’s shooting quickly came into question .
Serpico , who was armed during the drug raid , had only been shot after briefly turning away from the suspect when he realized that the two officers who had accompanied him to the scene were not following him into the apartment , raising the question whether Serpico had actually been brought to the apartment by his colleagues to be executed . ”
“ On May 3 , 1971 , New York Metro Magazine published an article about Serpico titled “ Portrait of an Honest Cop ” .
On May 10 , 1971 , Serpico testified at the departmental trial of an NYPD lieutenant who was accused of taking bribes from gamblers .
On May 14 , 1971 , Serpico was awarded a gold shield by the police commissioner and promoted to detective . ”
In October , and again in December 1971 , Serpico testified before the Knapp Commission : [ 6 ] “ Through my appearance here today …
I hope that police officers in the future will not experience the same frustration and anxiety that I was subjected to for the past five years at the hands of my superiors because of my attempt to report corruption …
We create an atmosphere in which the honest officer fears the dishonest officer , and not the other way around …
The problem is that the atmosphere does not yet exist in which honest police officers can act without fear of ridicule or reprisal from fellow officers .
” Frank Serpico was the first police officer in the history of the New York Police Department to step forward to report and subsequently testify openly about widespread , systemic corruption payoffs amounting to millions of dollars . [ 7 ]
( Is n’t this a SAD commentary on the police dept ?
And it is true of dozens of them .
There are police depts in the country where there are reported to be “ closed shops ” of renegade cops and no one challenges them !
Serpico still speaks out against police corruption and brutality .
He continues to speak out against both the weakening of civil liberties and corrupt practices in law enforcement , such as the alleged cover - up following the Amadou Diallo shooting in 1999 .
[9 ]
He provides support for “ individuals who seek truth and justice even in the face of great personal risk ” .
He calls them “ lamp lighters ” , a term he prefers to the more common “ whistleblowers ” , which refers to alerting the public to danger , just as Paul Revere was responsible for having lamps lit in the Old North Church to warn the public in Charlestown , Massachusetts , of the British Regulars movements during the American Revolutionary War.
Judge Fuger , Jr. is New Haven ’s Serpico .
Thanks to the NHI for bringing us this story .
We the people need to think more analytically and critically .
Check our biases and instead think about the principles involved .
Many of us detest drug abuse and thievery , but police lies and corruption , and the framing innocent people are every bit as bad and should be exposed every time .
posted by : NewHavenerToo on March 20 , 2010 7:52 am Mr. Taylor and Mr. Gould :
Here is a prime example where housing assistance if needed should absolutely should be offered to them .
There is a family reunification program that is in effect in New Haven and it would behoove the Round - table to offer this program to them .
Gentlemen , and I say it with much respect , I hope that those who did not do their job and placed you in this unbelievable predicament get their “ comeuppance .

It is not a case of a few bad apples it is a bad orchard .
A crime has been committed .
The police pick up the usual suspects .
To them it makes no difference who did it only that their skin be of a matching color or that the speak a language other than English .
In fifty years of revolution the United States cannot point to a single case where some one was shot to death on Cuban Streets .
Unlike the Empire .
No one has disappeared .
Unlike Columbia where a secret mass grave of more that 2000 was discovered .
No one has been tortured on Cuban soil except at the US Guantanamo Naval Base .
The Cuban people paid with 20,000 lives for their revolution .
We need one here .

Unfortunately , there are many such cases of innocent people behind bars , the great majority of whom will never be released .
That ’s a tragedy .
Imagine being put away for 16 years for a horrible crime you did n’t commit .
Think about the horrors inflicted on the body and psyche while in prison , the ties of family and friendship on the outside that do not survive , the fact that even with expunged records these men are indelibly marked by their experience and will be hard - pressed to find the opportunities many of us take for granted .
Hre ’s what ’s really disgusting to me : the things that went wrong in this case are not just of the “ mistakes happen ” variety .
Yes , mistakes do happen , unavoidably .
But what do we KNOW beyond a shadow of a doubt ?
We KNOW that even eye witnesses who are not drug - addled OFTEN get it wrong .
No one should be given an 80 - year sentence of the basis of testimony from one eye - witness alone .
Period .
That person will get it wrong all too often .
This witness was a police informant ?!
Are you KIDDING me ?
Why not just straight - out pay the man / woman to say what you ( often police ) want to hear ?
Common sense alone confirms that people like the woman in this case w/ all kinds of obvious incentive to lie will often do just that .
To take her word for it and send two men to jail for what turns out to be 16 years is absolutely criminal .
Speaking of which , where ’s the accountability for prosecutors here ?
Can they just do whatever the h*ll they want ?
So she ’s credible enough to cause the conviction of two men on the basis of nothing but her testimony , but suddenly becomes not - credible when she recants ?
And ti should absolutely make your stomach turn to read that this judge ’s actions are “ unprecedented ” — because this general set of circumstances is FAR from unprecedented .
What ’s truly “ breathtaking ” is the ridiculous latitude given to “ law and order ” — from police to prosecutors — who themselves have every incentive to lock people up regardless of guilt or innocence and WAY too little check on their power .
On the other side you have too many men of color ( whose communities are profiled ) who too often do n’t know their rights , too often do n’t have the resources to hire the best talent , and are typically paired with overburdened public defenders .
It ’s awful and pathetic .
And , finally , anyone interested to know what these two innocent men will get from the state for 16 years of false imprisonment ?
Not just false imprisonment , mind you .
AVOIDABLY false imprisonment !
Again , on the basis of what was known at the time , these men should NEVER HAVE GONE TO PRISON IN THE FIRST PLACE .
You can be damn well sure that the prosecutor ’s kid under the same circumstances would never have been arrested to begin with .
So what will they get ?
What wold be fair compensation to you if it were you , your father , your sibling , your kid ?
And , okay , the state is holding up these men ’s release because they do n’t want to look bad , admit their hideous mistake .
Ok .
How about further compensating these men for the additional lost time , since I guarantee you this is n’t going to be a one - day or even one - week delay .
Disgusting .
So George Gould and Ronald Taylor were held “ accountable ” for something they did n’t do .
16 years of wrongful acocuntability .
How about Michael O’Hare and especially James Clark , the Asst. State ’s Attorneys responsible for this awfulness ?
How about the cops who coerced the original testimony from the obviously tainted witness ?
Or the judge who let it all slide ?
I ’d REALLY like to read THAT newspaper article .
Ca n't decide between a tablet or a laptop , why not get the best of both worlds with the best 2 - in - 1 detachable laptops .

FORD will be the next carmaker to quit manufacturing in Australia because " throwing money " at the industry can only work in the short term , a government adviser has claimed .
Subsidies were doomed to fail because the industry lacked a vision for the future and Ford was most vulnerable because it was isolated from its parent 's global operations .
The carmaker has a 3000 - strong production workforce in Australia .
" As soon as choices have to be made , Ford is the next Mitsubishi , " said John Wormald , principal of international consultant Autopolis , referring to the Japanese company 's decision to shut down its Adelaide factory two years ago .
Mr Wormald , who is in Australia to advise the Victorian Government , said the replacement for the Falcon , due in about five years , could be imported cheaply and the carmaker did not need its Melbourne plant .
" Ford is n't short of assembly capacity in other places , " he said .
" Where 's the plan to integrate Australia ? "
Ford is the smallest of the three Australian makers and , unlike GM Holden or Toyota , lacks export markets for the locally made Falcon or its SUV variant , the Territory .
Last year , it made about 60,000 cars out of an industry total of 223,000 .
A spokeswoman for Ford said the company had no plans to abandon manufacturing in Australia .
China 's top internet official has warned that Google will " pay the consequences " if it continues to go against Chinese law .
Google announced in January that it would no longer comply with China 's internet censorship laws .
It warned that it may shut down google .cn because of censorship and a hacking attack on the portal .
Minister of Industry and Information Technology Li Yizhong was speaking at China 's annual legislation session .
" We need to preserve our nation 's interest , our people 's interest , we can not be relaxed with any information that will cause harm to the stability of our society , to our system , and to the health of our under - age young people , " he said .
" So , of course , what needs to be shut down will be shut down , what needs to be blocked will be blocked . "
' Up to them ' Google began operations in China in 2006 to widespread criticism .
While many argued Google was complicit in the censorship imposed by Chinese government , Google insisted it was nevertheless serving the public interest even though it was furnishing censored results .
Relations between China and Google cooled in January after what Google described as a sophisticated cyber attack in which the webmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists were targeted .
Since then , the firm has been in talks with Chinese officials about how to provide an unfiltered service but still remain within the law .
Google chief executive Eric Schmidt said this week that he hoped the results of those consultations would be revealed soon .
Mr Li said that whether the firm quits China or not is " up to them " , saying the internet would flourish in China regardless .
" I hope that Google will abide and respect the Chinese government 's laws and regulations , " he said .
" But , if you betray Chinese laws and regulations ... it means that you are unfriendly , irresponsible , and you will have to pay the consequences . "
Google is a distant second in search engine stakes in China , holding less than a third of the market ; rival Baidu has about 60 % .

Breaking News : President Obama makes the right call .
President Obama on Thursday signed a memorandum requiring hospitals to allow gays and lesbians to have non-family visitors and to grant their partners medical power of attorney .
The president ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to prohibit discrimination in hospital visitation .
The memo is scheduled to be made public Friday morning , according to an administration official and another source familiar with the White House decision .
An official said the new rule will affect any hospital that receives Medicare or Medicaid funding .
The decision injects the president squarely into the debate over gay marriage by attempting to end the common practice by many hospitals of insisting that only family members by blood or marriage be allowed to visit patients .
Gay activists have argued for years that recognizing gay marriages would ease the emotional pain associated with not being able to visit their partners during a health crisis .
By contrast , opponents of gay marriage have said the visitation issue is a red herring , and have argued that advocates want to provide special rights for gays and lesbians that others do not have .
High school and college students who understand the geological age of the Earth ( 4.5 billion years ) are much more likely to understand and accept human evolution , according to a University of Minnesota study published in the March issue of the journal Evolution .
The finding could give educators a new strategy for teaching evolution , since the Earth 's age is typically covered in physical rather than biological science classes .
Researchers Sehoya Cotner and Randy Moore , professors in College of Biological Sciences , and D. Christopher Brooks , of the university 's Office of Information Technology , surveyed 400 students enrolled in several sections of a University of Minnesota introductory biology course for non-majors .
The survey included questions about knowledge of evolution and whether students were taught evolution or creationism in high school as well as questions about religious and political views .
Participation was voluntary and had no effect on grades for the course .
The researchers extracted six variables from the survey to explore factors that contributed to students ' views about the age of the Earth and origins of life and the relation of those beliefs to students ' knowledge of evolution and their vote in the 2008 presidential election .
Using that information , they created a model that shows , for example , when a student 's religious and political views are liberal , they are more likely to believe that the Earth is billions , rather than thousands , of years old and to know more about evolution .
Conversely , students with conservative religious and political views are more inclined to think the Earth is much younger ( 20,000 years or less ) and to know less about evolution .
" The role of the Earth 's age is a key variable that we can use to improve education about evolution , which is important because it is the unifying principle of biology , " said lead author Sehoya Cotner , associate professor in the Biology Program , which provides general biology classes for University of Minnesota undergraduates .
Through this and previous surveys , Cotner and her colleagues have learned that 2 percent of students are taught creationism only , 22 percent are taught evolution and creationism , 14 are taught neither and 62 percent evolution only .
" In other words , about one in four high school biology teachers in the upper Midwest are giving students the impression that creationism is a viable explanation for the origins of life on Earth , " Cotner says .
" That 's just not acceptable .
The Constitution prohibits teaching creationism in schools . "
The researchers noted that understanding the Earth 's age is a difficult concept ; even Darwin found it challenging .
Teaching and understanding creationist views of about the Earth 's age and life 's origins are much easier .
The paper cites a 2009 Gallup poll that coincided with the 200th anniversary of Darwin 's birth reporting that only four out of 10 people in the U.S. believe in evolution .
The poll also reported that 16 percent of biology teachers believe God created humans in their present form at some time during the last 10,000 years .
The introduction of the iPad Friday morning sold an estimated 50,000 units in two hours , and also bumped Apple 's " hobby , " the Apple TV , from the front page of its online store .
Also , a mysterious icon included in iPad promotional pictures gains attention , and Apple has expanded its site to explain features of the coming hardware in greater detail .
i Pad sales estimated at 25,000 per hour
After it went on sale at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Friday , the iPad is estimated to have sold 51,000 in its first two hours .
As discovered by Philip Elmer - DeWitt at Fortune Brainstorm Tech , users at the Investor Village AAPL Sanity Board took their order numbers and attempted to crack the code to figure out total sales .
Victor Castroll , analyst with Valcent Financial Group and member of the AAPL Sanity Board , has been monitoring the spreadsheet and came up with the calculation of 51,000 units in the first two hours .
i Pad preorder bumps Apple TV from front page of online store
In accepting preorders for the iPad on Friday , Apple made some minor adjustments to the front page of its online store .
As a result , the Apple TV product and its accompanying picture were bumped and are no longer featured atop the store 's main page .
The Apple TV used to be featured prominently alongside the company 's line iPods , the iPhone and Macs .
Now users must scroll down and find it in the left column under the " For iPod " heading .
Last month , Apple Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook said his company still views the Apple TV as a " hobby , " and noted that sales of the product simply do n't compare to the consumer markets for smartphones , computers and MP3 players .
Cook said he does n't believe the Apple TV will remain dormant , but it may take time for the potential market for the device to grow .
" Because our gut says something is there , we 're continuing to invest in this , " Cook said .
" But today , it 's still just a hobby . "
Last October , Apple released the 3.0 software update for Apple TV , featuring a redesigned main menu that made navigating content simpler and faster .
It also added support for the new iTunes LP and iTunes Extras formats .
Mysterious app icon gains attention
Apple updated its
Web site with new pictures of the iPad Friday , and one screenshot in particular garnered attention from readers due to its inclusion of a mysterious icon .
Included on the home screen
Web page , the picture shows an icon on the far right of the device in landscape mode , and the application is not shown in any other screenshots .
Though the text is too small to read clearly , the icon appears to show the logo for the publication National Geographic .
It 's likely that the icon is for a digital version of the magazine , to be sold through Apple 's iBookstore .
Apple expands on iPad features
As preorders began Friday , Apple also fleshed out the official iPad section of its Web site , adding greater detail on the iBooks application , 3G data subscriptions with AT&T , and more .
As before , all of the built - in applications on the iPad have their own page describing their function .
Apple also has special dedicated pages for the iBooks application , which must be downloaded from the App Store , as well as the $ 9.99 Keynote , Pages and Numbers software .
A page devoted to 3G access on the iPad describes how users can start and cancel a no - contract data plan with AT&T direct from the device at any time .
As was revealed at the product 's unveiling , the data plans run $ 15 per month for 250 MB of data , or $ 30 per month for unlimited access .
Talk about a miracle diet – Katie Couric has become the Incredible Shrinking Anchorwoman .
Thanks to a computer “ slight ” of hand , the Tiffany network has made the new face of “ CBS Evening News ” instantly drop about 20 pounds .
In a picture widely distributed to the media last month , a normal - looking Couric wore a frumpy light gray suit and her trademark smile .
But thanks to Photoshop , the popular editing software , the same photo , printed in a CBS magazine , shows her looking much , much thinner – and her suit has become a few shades darker .
Couric , who was made aware of the picture ’s alteration yesterday , joked that she liked the original better .
“ There ’s more of me to love , ” she quipped .
The picture was taken in May when Couric , 49 , appeared at the CBS “ Upfront ” presentation at Carnegie Hall .
It was later widely distributed by CBS as an official photo of its new $ 15 million - a- year anchor- woman .
Then the computer generated version appeared in the latest quarterly edition of Watch !
It ’s produced and edited by the CBS press department and distributed to network employees , news - media outlets , affiliates , network gift shops and Paramount - owned theme parks .
Network officials say the magazine has a circulation of around 400,000 .
“ The picture was retouched without the knowledge of Ms. Couric or CBS News management , ” a CBS spokesman said .
As far as the magazine goes , an insider insisted the publication was just following normal industry practice when it shrunk Couric .
He claimed that just about all magazines tinker with photos – even though some top photographers and photo editors at news organizations have lost their jobs in recent times for doing just that .
Most media experts say that whenever a photo is altered in any way , the public should be alerted , although it ’s more of a problem if it occurs at newsmagazines rather than a magazine a company publishes about itself .
A top health expert joked that if Couric dropped the weight as rapidly as she appeared to , it would have cost her an arm or a leg – literally .
“ Besides Photoshop , the only other way to lose 20 pounds in a matter of seconds would be to hack off a limb , ” joked Samantha Heller , the senior clinical nutritionist at NYU Medical Center .
“ I mean , liposuction is pretty fast – but that takes longer since you have to prep for surgery and everything . ”
On a more serious note , she said , “ Of course the healthy way to do it would n’t be fast .
“ If you lose weight too quickly it scares your body – the body is not designed to lose weight quickly .
[ Instead ] , cut back on the junk , pretty standard stuff .
Katie could eat more vegetables , cut down on carbs and increase her exercise , ” said Heller .
“ I know she has a trainer because she talked about it [ when she was on ‘ Today ’ ] so she could have the trainer pump up her exercise a bit . ”
