NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Banks have launched public relations campaigns to bring in customers and soothe nerves , with ads offering " peace of mind " and other promises .
Citigroup , along with JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo and Bank of America got the biggest chunks of the bailout .
But what 's not public is what they are doing with the billions in federal bailout money they 've received -- the money doled out through a $ 700 billion rescue plan so banks could start lending again .
CNN contacted the banks that were given the biggest chunks of the bailout : Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo and Bank of America .
The latter received $ 15 billion as part of the federal Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) .
Where the money went is not clear .
" We are using the TARP funds to build our capital and make every good loan that we can , " Bank of America said .
The bank said it expects to release more information in its fourth quarter earning report .
Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo each received $ 25 billion -- the largest amount given to any bank .

Wells Fargo said it can't provide any details until it releases its fourth quarter statement , though the bank said it intends to use the money to help customers avoid foreclosure .
Citigroup said it was using TARP money to help expand the flow of credit and had formed a special committee to oversee the TARP money .
JPMorgan
Chase pointed out that it recently bought more than $ 1 billion in Illinois bonds and plans to lend $ 5 billion to nonprofit and health care companies .
" What the banks have said largely is that we 're using the money to stimulate the economy , to get the economy moving , " said Sarah Binder , a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution , a Washington think tank .
" That 's far , far too general to know what ... the banks are doing with the money . "
The vague responses from the banks should not come as a shock , said one U.S. House Financial Services Committee member who opposed the bailout .
" One of the fundamental problems with the Wall Street bailout was the people who had caused the problem were never called in front of Congress to explain what they had done , what needed to be done , " said Rep. Thaddeus McCotter , a Michigan Republican .
Congress did not put conditions on the bailout money , leaving lawmakers to press the Treasury Department for transparency after the money was handed out .
Critics say Congress needs to demand conditions before the second round of bailout money is distributed .
Earlier this month , members of a key congressional committee blasted the Treasury for its handling of the bailout , saying it lacks appropriate measures to ensure the bailout is working .
At a hearing held by the Financial Services Committee , chairman Barney Frank , D - Massachusetts , accused the Treasury of failing to address its obligation to address foreclosures and enforce lending obligations on banks .
The hearing served as a follow - up to two reports on how the Treasury has conducted its bailout program , including the Congressional Oversight Panel 's report on TARP , as well as a GAO report delivered to lawmakers that called for more accountability and transparency .
Congressmen on both sides of the aisle used the scathing reports as a launching pad , lambasting the Treasury for a general lack of clarity about its strategy as well as a dearth of measures that ensure banks are using the bailout funds for their intended purposes .

Israel has defied a formidable international consensus in favour of a ceasefire in Gaza by opting to continue its unprecedentedly fierce air attacks on Hamas targets and stepping up preparations for a possible ground offensive .
As the security cabinet rejected an EU - backed French proposal for a 48 - hour humanitarian halt to the bombing , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said : “ We did not begin the Gaza operation in order to finish it with rocket fire continuing like it did before .
Israel has restrained [ itself ] for years and given plenty of chances for a calm . ”
With Palestinian sources putting the total death toll in Gaza at 390 , since the bombing beganon Saturday , with 1,600 wounded , Associated Press reported that a long column of tanks and armoured vehicles was visible along an access road to Gaza from Israel , while dozens of other tanks were parked in a field close to the border .

The Israeli military reported that more than 50 rockets had been fired by Gaza militants yesterday , including further longer - range , reportedly Chinese - made , rockets at the large southern city of Beersheeva which is more than 22 miles from the border .
There were no serious casualties as a result by early evening .
Four Israelis have been killed since the bombardment began last Saturday .
The Defence Minister , Ehud Barak , had let it be known on Tuesday that he intended to submit the proposal for a halt to the offensive – whose backers include the US – to yesterday ’s security cabinet .
But , after considerable confusion , he appears to have been persuaded at a meeting which included Mr Olmert and the Foreign Minister , Tzipi Livni , not to do so .
In Gaza City , apartment buildings shook during air strikes on government buildings which the Israeli military said included an office of Ismail Haniyeh , Gaza ’s Hamas Prime Minister .
The Israeli military said it was not aware of a missile striking an ambulance , which Palestinian sources said had killed two medics .
An Egyptian official said Israel has destroyed 120 of between 200 and 400 smuggling tunnels since Saturday .
Mark Regev , Mr Olmert ’s spokesman , said Israel would work with international agencies to increase aid to the civilian population .
“ I do n’t detect much criticism from Berlin , Paris and London about hitting Hamas targets .
What there is concern about is the humanitarian situation , ” he said .
The Israeli human rights organisation B’tselem yesterday reported testimony that a truck destroyed in an air attack on Monday , which the military said was carrying Grad missiles , was in fact carrying oxygen canisters .
Eight people were killed in the bombing .
Abu Imad Sanur , the owner of the truck , whose son was among the dead , and who denies any connction with militants , told the agency that he and his family had been salvaging the canisters from his metal workshop , which was next to a building that had been bombed .
An Israeli official strongly denied the claim and said the military was preparing a full response .
Gordon Brown said : “ It is vital that moderation must now prevail – there ’s a humanitarian crisis .
Of course , the second thing we ’ve got to do is secure an immediate and urgent ceasefire . ”
The Prime Minister said proposals for a ceasefire package being discussed by Arab foreign ministers in Cairo offered “ the best way forward ” .
The package contains similar elements to those spelled out on Tuesday by EU ministers and the Middle East Quartet .
The proposals call for an immediate and sustainable ceasefire , with international monitors guaranteeing the truce and the reopening of border crossings into Gaza .
European governments hope that , if the Arab states agree a united position , it would increase the pressure on Hamas to compromise .
But yesterday it was Arab divisions that were on display .
The Saudi Foreign Minister , Prince Saud al - Faisal , said : “ This terrible massacre would not have happened if the Palestinian people were united behind one leadership speaking in one voice .
“ We are telling our Palestinian brothers that your Arab nation cannot extend a real helping hand if you do n’t extend your own hands to each other with love . ”
Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff has been saying lately that the budget the Conservative are drafting , to be presented to Parliament in a few days , is not his budget , it 's the Harper government 's budget .
Fair enough , but if the Liberals vote for the budget , it will become their budget as well .
That 's how a minority government works .
You either support the basic program of the government or you do n't .
There 's no wiggle room .
Ignatieff is in the unhappy position of having to make the most important decision he will make in the next two years in just a few days .
He has made clear what he wants to see in the upcoming budget : protection for those most vulnerable to the recession ; the rapid creation of jobs through infrastructure spending ; and investments in productivity and competitiveness .
On the latter point , he emphasizes the need for retraining people to help unemployed workers find new jobs .
This is a good list .
But the devil will be in the details .
Whether the budget amounts to a little sprinkling of good will on these issues or a genuine plan to counter the recession will depend on how much money is invested in these programs .
To counter the savage economic downturn , anything less than one hundred billion dollars over the next two years will amount a sham .
Double that amount is what is really needed .
A key to assessing the budget is to understand how the Conservative government thinks about the recession and what its socio-economic goals are .
We 've already heard in recent days from Finance Minister Jim Flaherty that he wants to make sizeable tax cuts a central element of the upcoming budget .
That 's no surprise .
Right - wingers , in both the United States and Canada , have a well - developed set of ideas about how to deal with the economic crisis and the descent into deflation which is its critical element .
The bursting of the housing bubble , the failure of financial institutions and the crash of stock markets around the globe , struck investors , the rich , and the well - to - do with the force of a tsunami .
The consequence was a sharp decline in the high - end spending of those who had had money and suddenly had less .
As in the 1929 crash , the sharp reduction in spending and investing by the wealthy and near - wealthy played a signal role in spreading the crisis from financial markets to the " real " economy .
Layoffs in the retail sector , bankruptcies and bankruptcy sales pushed the economy down the dismal road of sharply rising unemployment and deflation .
While most of us have experienced inflation and the falling value of the dollars we hold , very few alive today have suffered deflation , a far more deadly economic affliction .
On the surface , deflation , a condition which arises when prices fall , has its attractions .
Few motorists in Canada are complaining about the nearly fifty per cent drop in the price of gasoline since the summer of 2008 , and few homeowners are complaining about the thirty per cent decline in the price of fuel to heat their houses .
The problem with deflation is that it is symptomatic of a severe economic downturn that can last not a few months but for years , crossing the line from recession to depression .
Throughout the industrialized world , economic policy makers are grappling with the onset of deflation , whose devastation can be seen , among other places , in the crisis of the automobile industry .
When deflation strikes an economy , the prospects for economic growth are so negative that companies , not only lay off large numbers of employees , they put on hold capital investment projects that are a key to future growth and the hiring of additional workers .
For instance , the catastrophic sales declines in late 2008 at the major automobile companies signaled a drastic reorganization of the industry .
In December 2008 , Chrysler 's sales of automobiles in the United States plunged fifty per cent in comparison to the previous December .
This left analysts concluding that Chrysler ( now Daimler Chrysler ) could not long survive as a separate auto producer .
Many predicted that what remained of Chrysler would have to be merged with General Motors , which would also have to be dramatically downsized .
While the price bargains being offered by the two ailing auto makers have never been better , at the end of the restructuring , the American auto industry will employ tens of thousands fewer workers than it did at the start of 2008 .
Cities , towns and entire states will be dramatically affected by the lurch of the economy into deflation .
Deflation negates the motivation for business to make capital investments .
The reason is quite simple .
As consumer purchases decline , the prospect for increased sales diminishes .
Rather than making investments , which involves hiring more workers , either by the company itself or through its suppliers , to expand plant capacity , to purchase new machinery , or to design new products , the company reduces production and lays off some of its existing employees .
The company sells off its inventory , reducing prices to capture as large a share of the shrinking market for itself as it can .
The consequence of this behaviour is that the ranks of the unemployed are expanded .
Consumer purchasing power is further reduced , which lowers demand further , driving the system through successive rounds of layoffs and deepening deflation .
The deflationary downward spiral during the Great Depression was not self - correcting as it turned out .
Orthodox neo-classical economists and right - wing politicians are wedded to the idea that markets left alone by governments , will work out these problems on their own .
They believe that if the price of labour ( wages and salaries ) is allowed to fall , along with prices , a point will be reached where companies will once again find it profitable to make investments and to increase their production .
This way , they insist , the downward spiral , if allowed to work itself out , will reverse to be followed by an upward virtuous cycle .
On this reading , the culprits standing in the way of economic renewal are trade unions that keep the price of labour artificially high , and governments that stand in the way of allowing wages and salaries to fall by paying out unemployment insurance and social assistance to the unemployed .
Right - wing orthodoxy insists that the price of labour should be allowed to fall to the point where it becomes profitable to re-hire workers .
In late 2008 , in the United States and Canada , right - wingers were quick to make unionized auto workers the poster boys for what was wrong with the auto industry .
The wages of auto workers had to drop dramatically , they insisted , for the auto companies to return to viability .
Using the same logic , right - wing thinkers and politicians , in principle , are opposed to the implementation of minimum wages , and are utterly against raising them .
Minimum wages , they say , are uneconomic .
They make the price of labour " sticky " to the downside , and stand in the way of the market sorting things out so that the drive to prosperity can be resumed .
Because right - wingers want to create a more market driven economy , they are basically opposed to bailing - out particular industries , such as the auto industry and the forest products industry .
They can be pressured to support bailouts , as the Harper government recently was in the case of the auto industry , but they want government involvement in industry to remain as limited as possible .
Long - term government involvement in key industries is anathema to the political right , even when it makes very good economic sense .
All this is not to say that right wingers and their intellectual allies , who populate the business schools of the United States and Canada , are opposed to any public policy measures being undertaken to cope with a severe economic downturn .
They favour three types of actions by governments under such circumstances .
First , they approve of central banks lowering interest rates to make it less costly for businesses to borrow and invest capital and for individuals to purchase automobiles , other durable goods or to buy houses .
Second , they applaud governments making deep tax cuts , on the assumption that this will put more money in the pockets of people and in the coffers of business , which will allow consumer spending to rebound along with new capital investments .
Third , they favour sharply reducing government spending , as a corollary to the tax cuts .
This , they say , will keep deficit spending by governments to a minimum .
It has the additional attraction for them of permanently reducing the role of government in favour of the market , which is an overriding objective of theirs .
The problem with this right - wing agenda , and its individual elements , is that it does n't work .
All of it was tried for years during the Great Depression .
The consequence of this dreary experiment was utter failure .
The dirty little secret of neo-classical economics is that left to its own devices a market economy can achieve a point of equilibrium between supply and demand that leaves millions of people , a high proportion of the work force , without employment .
An equilibrium can exist that leaves economic output far below full capacity .
This is the ground on which the great disputes between the Keynesians and the monetarists were fought out .
John Maynard Keynes made the case that neo-classical economics had not solved the problem of economic equilibrium being achieved without full employment or full utilization of economic capacity , or anything close to it , being realized .
He insisted that governments had to play an indispensable role in ensuring that sufficient demand existed to allow the economy to function , at or near , full capacity .
( Experience has shown that during a recession , interest rate cuts by themselves do little to generate economic recovery .
Interest rates on their own have been compared to trying to push a string forward . )
In addition to the stimulus provided by monetary policy , through interest rate cuts , according to Keynes , there had to be the stimulus provided by direct government spending , as well as through tax cuts , not to the wealthy but to the mass of the population .
The trouble with tax cuts for the well - to - do is that , during a recession , the affluent are inclined to use the tax break to replenish their savings rather than to spend .
Tax cuts for the majority of the population , those who are wage and salary earners , result in much more stimulus for the economy , because people with lower incomes will be inclined to spend their additional dollars on goods and services .
There is , however , a problem with tax cuts as a way to help Canada cope with recession .
The Canadian economy , much more than other industrialized economies , is geared toward the export of primary products ( and assembled automobiles ) and the importation of vast quantities of finished goods .
Much more than most other industrialized countries , Canadians are importers of the end products they consume .
As a consequence , tax cuts tend to promote a huge increase in imports of all manner of manufactured goods .
In this way , the stimulus from tax cuts leaks out of the country .
It is a far less efficient way to generate recovery than is direct spending by the federal government on infrastructure , whether we are speaking of rebuilding roads , sewer systems , and schools , or undertaking huge new projects in urban public transit or high speed rail systems between cities .
If the budget promises its major stimulus through tax cuts , Michael Ignatieff should understand the dead - end economics and ideology that underlies this and he should defeat it and the government .
If the measures he wants to see in the budget do n't have a serious price tag attached to them , he should also defeat it .
Ignatieff has a fundamental choice to make .
The country will either go down one road or it will go down another .
He will have to decide .
And he will wear the decision .

With the number of medical marijuana states growing at the rate of one a year , and with Michigan last November becoming the first state in the Midwest to embrace therapeutic cannabis , two Upper Midwest state legislatures are about to grapple with the issue -- again .
A bill was introduced last week in the Minnesota legislature , and one will be introduced next week at the South Dakota statehouse .
In Minnesota , the Medical Use of Marijuana Act , SF 97 , would allow patients with a physician 's approval and who have registered with the state to grow up to 12 plants and possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana , or to obtain that same amount from a state - regulated nonprofit .
To be eligible , an individual must suffer from one of a long list of " debilitating medical conditions , " including cancer , glaucoma , AIDS wasting syndrome , Hepatitis C , and MS .
The bill is nearly identical to legislation that last year passed the state Senate , but stalled in the House after Gov. Tim Pawlenty ( R ) threatened to veto it .
Pawlenty said he would veto any medical marijuana bill opposed by law enforcement .
This year 's bill includes support from members of Pawlenty 's party .
Two Republicans are coauthors , and three more have signed on as cosponsors .
Similar bipartisan support is expected in the House when a companion bill will be introduced next month .
That 's not surprising given the broad popular support for medical marijuana among the Minnesota electorate .
In a KTSP / SurveyUSA poll conducted last May just after Gov. Pawlenty 's veto threat , 64 % supported medical marijuana .
Even 53 % of Republicans did , something for Pawlenty and GOP legislators to keep in mind .
In neighboring South Dakota , Bob Newland of South Dakotans for Safe Access has reported that a medical marijuana bill will be filed next Tuesday by state Rep. Gerald Lange ( D - Madison ) , with a hearing set for the following Monday .
Another Democrat , then Rep. Ron Volesky ( D - Huron ) introduced a medical marijuana bill in 2001 , but it went nowhere , being deferred until " the 41st day " of the 40 - day session .
In 2006 , South Dakota suffered the ignominy of becoming the only state to defeat an initiative that would have legalized medical marijuana .
That effort came close , but ultimately fell short with 48 % of the vote .
The South Dakota bill will have at least two cosponsors , Reps. Ed Iron Cloud ( D - Porcupine ) and Martha Vanderlinde ( D - Sioux Falls ) , a registered nurse .
While the odds are against this bill passing , the effort may help Newland lay the groundwork for another try at the initiative process in 2010 .
John Wolkonowicz , an analyst at Global Insight , said : " If consumer confidence does n't snap back soon , it 's going to be difficult for the auto - makers .
It is n't just GM , Ford and Chrysler that are suffering from this , it is the entire global auto industry . "
On Dec. 16 , a Nanterre court in France ruled that Google infringed on the trademarks of Le Meridien by allowing the hotel chain 's rivals to bid on keywords of its name and appear prominently in related search results .
Le Meridien had sued Google 's French subsidiary on Oct. 25 after failing to reach an amicable agreement , according to court documents .
In a blow to Google 's keyword - bidding engine , the French court ordered the company to stop linking ads to Le Meridien - trademarked terms by Monday or face a daily fine of $ 194 ( 150 euros ) .
The company must also cease linking ads related to Le Meridien brands within 72 hours of whenever Le Meridien notifies it of listings in violation , or face a daily fine of 150 euros .
Finally , Google must pay all court fees and a fine of $ 2,592 ( 2,000 euros ) .
A representative of Mountain View , Calif . - based Google said the company will appeal the decision .
" We will continue to defend against this suit , which we believe is without merit , " the representative said .
The decision casts a shadow on Google 's billion - dollar money engine , keyword - based advertising , and potentially on the company 's financial prospects in Europe .
The company makes about 98 percent of its revenue from keyword advertising linked to search technology , and many such ads are tied to branded or trademarked names of products and services .
The technique has been effective because Web search is one of the primary ways that people find products and services .
But as the company has grown precipitously and has planted seeds of expansion in markets around the world , more companies have sought control over their brand names and trademarked terms in paid search .
In Europe , some courts have been favorable to trademark owners .
Louis Vuitton sued Google and its French subsidiary for similar alleged trademark infringement , and a French court ordered Google to cease the practice and pay a fine .
In the United States , however , the company recently won a favorable ruling in a case brought by Geico , the car insurance company .
In December , a judge in Virginia ruled that as a matter of law , Google 's use of Geico trademarks to trigger ads did not constitute trademark infringement and that Geico had not proven its case for dilution sufficiently .
Google still faces other copyright disputes , including one brought by American Blind and Wallpaper Factory .
Barack Obama 's arrival in the White House and the wind of change sweeping through Washington could lead to the ousting from power of Hamid Karzai , President of Afghanistan , The Independent has learnt .
International support for Mr Karzai , who was once the darling of the West , has waned spectacularly , amid worsening violence , endemic corruption and weak leadership .
But until very recently , diplomats insisted there were no viable alternatives even as fighting has intensified and the Taliban insurgency in the south has grown .
But four key figures believed to be challenging Mr Karzai have arrived in Washington for meetings with Obama administration officials this week .
There is now talk of a " dream ticket " that would see the main challengers run together to unite the country 's various ethnic groups and wrest control away from Mr Karzai .
" The Americans are n't going to determine the outcome of the election , but they could suggest to people they put their differences aside and form a dream ticket , " said a senior US analyst in Kabul .

Mr Obama has already started getting to grips with the challenge of Afghanistan ; he received a briefing on the coming American troop " surge " from General David Petraeus on Wednesday , his first full day in the Oval Office .
Last night , Mr Obama appointed the veteran US diplomat , Richard Holbrooke , as his new special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The unofficial delegation to Washington was made up of three ex-ministers and a serving governor .
Dr Abdullah Abdullah was the foreign minister , Dr Ashraf Ghani served as finance minister , Ali Ahmad Jalali was interior minister and Gul Agha Sherzai is the governor of the eastern province of Nangahar , where US troops are based .
When Mr Obama visited Afghanistan in July he met Governor Sherzai in Jalalabad , even before he saw President Karzai in Kabul .
" They are not going to blindly back President Karzai like the Bush administration did for so long , " said John Dempsey , head of the United States Institute of Peace in Kabul .
On the ground in Afghanistan , Camp Bastion in Helmand province is already becoming the symbol of the Americanisation of the war in the south .
US forces have started arriving and will be joined by many more .
Airfields are to be built to bring in transport and warplanes in preparation for a coming offensive with the dispatch of 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan .
Karzai officials had hoped Hillary Clinton , now the US Secretary of State , would prove their ally in White House .
But those hopes were dashed last week when she branded Afghanistan a " narco- state " with a government " plagued by limited capacity and widespread corruption " during her confirmation hearing .
Ahmed Wali Karzai , the Afghan president 's brother , was named last October in leaked US intelligence reports as a major narco - trafficker .
The allegations , vigorously denied by both men , are widespread in Afghanistan but , until then , Western officials had refused to corroborate them .
But the leak was seen as a shot across Mr Karzai 's bows from the Bush administration , to make him clean up his act and rein in his brother .
The flurry of criticism suggests the international community is less than happy with his response .
Mrs Clinton 's remarks coincided with stinging criticism from Nato 's secretary general , Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , who said corrupt and inefficient government was as much to blame for instability as the insurgents .
Writing in The Washington Post , he said : " The basic problem in Afghanistan is not too much Taliban ; it 's too little good governance . "
Individually , Mr Karzai 's rivals risk splitting their support base .
Together , diplomats are optimistic they could win the election , expected next summer , and reinvigorate a jaded population .
" We need to create a new momentum , like in 2001 , " said Haroun Mir , co-founder of the Afghanistan Centre for Research and Policy Studies .
" Change will bring hope , because right now the momentum is with the Taliban . "
The planning for new policies on Afghanistan has been going on for months by Pentagon and State Department staff in anticipation of Mr Obama 's inauguration .
One official said : " We have to come up with fresh innovative ideas on counter - insurgency , counter - narcotics , governance , development .
Now they are drafting in people from other departments .
There is no doubt we neglected Afghanistan after the Taliban fell but there is a worry that we may be trying to do too much , too fast now . "
A slew of initiatives are on the way .
They include the arming of local groups to fight the Taliban , in the way Sunni militias were used against insurgents by General Petraeus in Iraq .

US , British and Nato forces will also play a much more direct role in counter - narcotics operations in an effort to tackle Afghanistan 's heroin trade which provides 93 per cent of the world 's supply of the drug .
Some policy analysts insist it is impossible to blame the Afghan president for all his country 's ills .
They say the international community has been ineffective , often divided and international military effort was focused on catching terrorists , not quelling an insurgency for far too long .
British anger at Taliban patients
British soldiers complain that they are being forced to share hospital facilities in Afghanistan with Taliban fighters .
Enemy combatants are treated at the Camp Bastion Field Hospital in line with the Geneva Convention .

The challengers : Who might replace Karzai ?
Gul Agha Sherzai
A veteran of the wars against the Soviets , Mr Sherzai ( whose name means " son of a lion " ) is a former governor of Kandahar criticised for human rights abuses .
He escaped assassination in 2006 .
Dr Abdullah Abdullah
Although half Pashtun , he is considered a leader of Afghanistan 's Tajik population .
He was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in 2001 and served until 2006 .
Ali Ahmad Jalali
An ethnic Pashtun and former colonel , Jalali joined the anti-Soviet resistance after the Russians invaded Afghanistan in 1979 .
He took US citizenship and spent 20 years broadcasting for Voice of America .
Dr Ashraf Ghani
An ethnic Pashtun , he studied in America , at Colombia University .
He worked at the World Bank from 1991 to 2001 , when he returned to Afghanistan for the first time in 24 years .
From 2002 - 04 he was Finance Minister and oversaw the successful transition to Afghanistan 's new currency .
In an impossible figure , seemingly real objects — or parts of objects — form geometrical relations that physically cannot happen .
The artist M.C. Escher , for instance , depicted reversible staircases and perpetually flowing streams , whereas mathematical physicist Roger Penrose drew his famously impossible triangle and visual scientist Dejan TodoroviTodorovi created an Elusive Arch that won him Third Prize of the 2005 Best Visual Illusion of the Year Contest .
These effects challenge our hard - earned perception that the world around us follows certain , inviolable rules .
They also reveal that our brains construct the feeling of a global percept , “ or individual item we perceive , ” by sewing together multiple local percepts .
As long as the local relation between surfaces and objects follow the rules of nature , our brains do n’t seem to mind that the global percept is impossible .
Several contemporary sculptors recently have taken up the challenge of creating impossible art .
That is , they are interested in shaping real - world 3 - D objects that nevertheless appear to be impossible .
Unlike classic monuments – think of the Lincoln monument - which can be perceived by either sight or touch , impossible sculptures can only be interpreted ( or misinterpreted , as the case may be ) by the visual mind .

Christine A. McCallum : Fired Teacher Pleads Not Guilty To Rape ( Video , Photo )
A Rockland , Massachusetts elementary school teacher , 29 year old Christine A. McCallum , has been charged with carrying on an 18 month sexual relationship with a boy that began when he was 13 years old .
McCallum was arrested at her home on Thursday night , January 8 , 2009 , according to Rockland police chief John Llewellyn .
McCallum pleaded not guilty today in Brockton District Court to three counts of statutory rape in Abington and then moved on to Hingham District Court to be arraigned on four additional counts of statutory rape in Rockland .
The fifth grade teacher was accompanied to court by her husband of five years , Scott McCallum , who stood by her side during the court proceedings .
The teacher was fired today from Woodsdale Elementary School in Abington according to Superintendent Peter G. Schafer .
He released a statement that said : " We are aware and are deeply concerned about the disturbing allegations against her , and we will be fully cooperating with the authorities . "
According to the complaint , McCallum was working as a teacher 's aide and was tutoring the boy 's younger brother when the relationship began .
The boy is now 16 years old and his father recently discovered letters between his son and McCallum and went to authorities .
The teen admitted to police that he had engaged in sex with the woman every other day for a year and a half .
She reportedly gave him a cellphone so that the two could communicate .
McCallum told authorities that she had become a surrogate mother to the boy , who lives in Abington and is being raised by a single father .
Authorities believe they have sufficient evidence to suggest that she plied the boy with alcohol and the relationship progressed to a sexual one .
The accused woman 's attorney , Frederick McDermott , indicates there is no evidence to suggest that the relationship was sexual .
His client reportedly ended the relationship in July 2007 when she caught the boy stealing liquor from her home .
McCallum has been ordered to surrender her passport , must wear a GPS tracking monitor and stay away from the boy , his family and all children under the age of 16 years of age .
Check out more photos ( two from her Facebook page ) and video of her court appearance earlier today .
A performance update
normcdf
exp
I 've continued playing with the LLVM .
I discovered that when generating code for theand Black - Scholes functions I did not tell LLVM that the functions that were called ( etc. ) are actually pure functions .
That meant that the LLVM did n't perform CSE properly .
So here are some updated numbers for computing an option prices for 10,000,000 options :
Pure Haskell : 8.7s
LLVM : 2.0s
normcdf
normcdf x = x %< 0 ?? ( 1 - w , w ) where w = 1.0 - 1.0 / sqrt ( 2.0 * pi ) * exp ( - l*l / 2.0 ) * poly k k = 1.0 / ( 1.0 + 0.2316419 * l ) l = abs x poly = horner coeff coeff = [ 0.0,0.31938153,-0.356563782,1.781477937,-1.821255978,1.330274429 ]
Vectors
Just as a reminder , the code forlooks like this :
A noteworthy thing is that exactly the same code can be used both for the pure Haskell and the LLVM code generation ; it 's just a matter of overloading .
An very cool aspect of the LLVM is that it has vector instructions .
On the x86 these translate into using the SSE extensions to the processor and can speed up computations by doing things in parallel .
Again , by using overloading , the exact same code can be used to compute over vectors of numbers as with individual numbers .
So what about performance ?
I used four element vectors of 32 bit floating point numbers and got these results :
Pure Haskell : 8.7s
LLVM , scalar : 2.0s
LLVM , vector : 1.1s
C , gcc - O3 : 2.5s
Only on MacOS does the LLVM package give you fast primitive functions , because that 's the only platform that seems to have this as a standard .
The vector version of floating point comparison has not been implemented in the LLVM yet .
Do not use two element vectors of type 32 bit floats .
This will generate code that is wrong on the x86 .
I sent in a bug report about this , but was told that it is a feature and not a bug .
( I kid you not . )
To make the code right you have to manually insert EMMS instructions .
The GHC FFI is broken for all operations that allocate memory for a Storable , e.g. , alloca , with , with Array etc .
These operations do not take the alignment into account when allocating .
This means that , e.g. , a vector of four floats may end up on 8 byte alignment instead of 16 .
This generates a segfault .
Some caveats if you try out vectors in the LLVM .
On the whole , I 'm pretty happy with the LLVM performance now ; about 8 times faster than ghc on this example .
[ Edit : ]
Added point about broken FFI .

Writers Dinesh D’Souza and Christopher Hitchens brought their polemics on religion and atheism to a debate Monday evening at the University of Colorado at Boulder before a sold - out crowd of 2,050 in the campus ’ Macky Auditorium .
D’Souza , a Catholic and author of the book “ What ’s So Great about Christianity , ” argued that Christianity is the foundation for many common values such as scientific inquiry and respect for the individual .
Additionally , he asserted that Christianity proposes the best answer for bridging the chasm between man and God .
Hitchens , a prominent atheist and author of the book “ God is not Great , ” argued that religion ’s influence is largely bad for the world .
He said religion makes otherwise good people do bad things , forestalls human thought , and limits human responsibility .
The debate , moderated by Denver radio talk show host Dan Caplis , was sponsored by the St. Thomas Aquinas Center for Catholic Thought , an intellectual outreach program of St. Thomas Aquinas Parish in Boulder , Colorado .
The event centered on the theme “ What ’s so Great about God ? – Atheism vs. Religion . ”
Father Kevin Augustyn , pastor of St. Thomas Aquinas Parish , prefaced the debate , saying , “ As Catholics , we are not afraid of intellectual debate .
Faith and reason are not opposed to each other . ”
D’Souza opened his initial argument by stating he would debate on “ the ground of reason alone . ”
He listed what he believed to be important to all people , including atheists : concern about the idea of the individual , science as an autonomous enterprise , the equal dignity of women , the abolition of slavery , and compassion .
“ Christianity brought these values into the world , ” he argued , claiming that slavery was abolished in Christian societies between the fourth and tenth centuries .
Modern science , he said , was “ faith - based ” in that it was rooted in Christian assumptions .
We presume that we live in a lawful , rational universe whose external rationality is mirrored in our own minds , presumptions nourished by Christianity .
“ It is no accident that modern science developed in Western culture , ” he said .
D’Souza then argued that the universe was “ finely tuned for life . ”
Imagining that the physical settings of the universe could be altered by a control board , he argued that an infinitesimal change to one constant would render an inhabitable universe impossible .
He also proposed that despite natural constraints , “ in some way , man is free from fixed laws . ”
Man is placed between two distinct domains of “ the way we are ” and “ the way we ought to behave . ”
“ You might do well to consider living as if there is a God , because ultimately that will make you a better person , ” he suggested .
Hitchens opened his comments by half - jokingly saying that he does not value compassion and quite enjoys crowing over the misfortunes of others .
He began his argument by ridiculing the popular idea that the absence of religion would cause moral chaos .
If Jesus and Mary or any other religious figure were proved “ entirely mythical , ” he questioned , “ would you really look at your neighbor differently ?
Would you then become a thief , a rapist ? ”
If atheism were correct , Hitchens argued , “ we would be in precisely the same place we are now ” in considering what our duties are towards others and why we are here .
He then claimed that religion , by holding that a revelation from God has happened , suppresses these questions by holding that it is only necessary to live up to religious commandments .
This makes personal responsibility meaningless and attacks mankind in “ our deepest integrity ” by saying we have no knowledge of good and evil .
This is also the “ origin of totalitarianism , ” Hitchens claimed .
He further accused the God of Christian belief of making us sick and commanding us to be well , suggesting this view of God is “ very incompetent , very vicious , or very cruel . ”
He questioned why God would redeem others ’ suffering only by taking away sins , and not by going to jail or becoming sick for them .
D’Souza responded by arguing that without Christianity “ we would be a very different civilization , ” noting that only Western , Christian - influenced countries appear to rush to help disaster victims across the world .
He cited an Indian proverb from his youth which says “ the tears of strangers are only water . ”
Hitchens then raised the raised the questions of why Christianity should be considered superior to other religions , such as Islam .
D’Souza replied by noting the disconnect between “ the way things are ” and “ the way they ought to be . ”
This can be explained by supposing a chasm between the “ human level ” of existence and the “ divine level . ”
In D’Souza ’s view , Islam and Judaism hold that this chasm may be closed by mankind building a “ ladder ” to climb to God .
Christianity , however , declares this project “ wonderful but impossible ” by teaching that the chasm “ has to be closed from the other side ” through God entering the world in the person of Jesus Christ .
Hitchens responded by attempting to equate Mohammed ’s claims to be a prophet with Christian claims that Christ is an emissary from God , while D’Souza countered that Hitchens neglected to consider the place of Christ ’s divinity in Christian theology .
Other topics raised in the debate included the existence of natural rights , the historicity of the Gospels , the reliability of the first Christian witnesses and the nature of Catholic teaching on the salvific necessity of Christ and the Church .
D’Souza also described how he had first met Hitchens after the latter penned an essay in the left - wing magazine The Nation supporting legal protections for the unborn .
Hitchens then explained that he finds it “ extraordinarily objectionable ” to exclude the “ occupant of the womb ” from the human family .
Following the debate , CNA spoke with Father Augustyn .
He said it was an “ excellent debate ” with both speakers doing “ very well ” on their positions .
In his view , D’Souza countered and “ unmasked ” some of Hitchens ’ “ unfair ” and “ selective ” comparisons of religions .
“ At the same time , Christopher Hitchens is a formidable opponent .
He ’s very witty , very sharp , he makes good points , and he brings out audience participation .
I do n’t think his arguments hold water , but I think he is a good debater . ”
The St. Thomas Aquinas Center has scheduled follow - up sessions to discuss the debate in campus classrooms on Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday evenings .
Father Augustyn characterized them as apologetics or “ question and answer ” events .
He reported that the debate had been streamed via live video to another building housing 300 viewers , bringing total attendance to more than 2,300 .
“ This is the largest event we ’ve hosted in our history , ” Father Augustyn said , appealing for more partners to assist the parish ministry ’s evangelization mission on campus .
December 3 , 2008
A COURT ruling has ousted Thailand 's democratically elected government by dissolving the ruling party just two years after a military coup against a government run by the same political forces .
Thailand 's Constitution Court ostensibly made its December 2 ruling based on election law violations by the ruling People 's Power Party ( PPP ) .
Some 108 members of the PPP are banned from politics under the decision .
But the court 's timing was obviously the result of mass protests by the opposition People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) , which had blockaded Bangkok 's two main airports .
The PAD has been trying to oust the PPP , the successor party to the exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra , who was ousted by the military in September 2006 .
The military junta subsequently rewrote the constitution to favor opposition forces .
But in elections held in 2007 , Thaksin 's allies won a clear majority and formed a government .
The PAD accuses Thaksin of corruption and authoritarian tendencies , charges for which there is plenty of evidence .
The democratically elected government of Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat was ousted under a court ruling
However , the PAD demands not more democracy , but less .
It proposes a parliament substantially composed of appointed members .
It is openly monarchist -- its supporters wear the royal color yellow - - and it has openly fascist elements .
Its political base is the Bangkok middle class that resented Thaksin 's populist measures , which have created a solid voting bloc among the rural poor .
The Wall Street Journal explained the social roots to this polarization :
A few decades ago , Thailand was a largely agrarian society , with a relatively small income gap between urban and rural residents .
Then globalization swept the country , as foreign investors descended upon Thailand to take advantage of its low - cost labor pool - - a phenomenon later repeated in China .
From 1985 to 1995 , Thailand was the fastest - growing economy in the world , and it became a manufacturing platform for the world , with large multinationals including Ford Motor Co. and other American , Japanese and European companies making investments .
Much of the wealth accrued to Bangkok , a once - charming city of canals and temples that spawned gleaming office towers and roadways clogged with Mercedes - Benz sedans .
Rural residents , who migrated in and out of the city working in factories or on construction sites , felt left out as the income gap widened further .
AFTER WINNING election in 2001 , Thaksin , a wealthy telecommunications magnate , instituted a debt moratorium and health care subsidies that provided relief to Thai peasants devastated by the East Asian financial crash of 1997 - 98 .
These measures enabled Thaksin to win reelection in 2005 .
When a court invalidated that election in 2007 , Thaksin was preparing to seek office again when the army seized power .
Prior to the coup , Thaksin had been under pressure from a genuine pro-democracy movement that organized mass protests against corruption and Thaksin 's domination of the military .
Today , however , the country is polarized on a different basis .
On one side is the urban middle class and government elites who want to defend their traditional privileges .
On the other is the poor who are mobilized by the businessmen tied to Thaksin .
The PPP has launched a protest group of its own , the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship , whose supporters wear red .
Some 20,000 members turned out to protest the court 's decision December 2 .
The PAD , however , has the advantage of the implicit backing of the army and King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
The party has repeatedly used force and intimidation to try yo bring down the government , including the occupation of the offices of Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat , which took place with no real action by police .
Under the terms of the judge 's order , members of the PPP will form a new party , Pua Thai , that will still hold the majority in parliament .
But there is much speculation that the military will pressure the parliament to form a " government of national unity , " to be run by a PAD supporter .
It 's possible that the courts could declare the entire 2007 election to be null and void , thereby forcing a new vote .
It is n't clear what approach the incoming U.S. administration of Barack Obama will take toward Thailand .
The U.S. deepened its longstanding military ties to Thailand under Thaksin 's government , but made only token objections to the 2007 coup .
What the U.S. wants from this key ally is " stability " -- even if that requires another coup .
The Thai left is trying to rebuild an independent pro-democracy movement to counter the PAD and its right - wing and military backers .
Those efforts will be essential to defending democracy in Thailand .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Citigroup
Inc , scrambling to survive losses triggered by the credit crunch , unveiled plans to split in two and shed troubled assets , and reported a quarterly loss of $ 8.29 billion .

The banking giant also said it expected more departures from its embattled board , which is losing former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin as a director later this year .
Still , the bank ’s shares rose 4 percent in premarket trading , in part because investors hoped the plan to separate its most troubled assets into a new company would help revive the company .
“ It ’s one of the first steps toward some positive news and the end of this nightmare , ” said Michael Holland , founder of Holland & Co in New York , which manages more than $ 4 billion of investment .
Citigroup , whose shares have plunged 87 percent since the beginning of 2008 , said it recorded $ 28.3 billion of writedowns and credit losses in the 2008 fourth quarter .
Losses over the past 15 months total more than $ 92 billion .
The bank ’s fourth - quarter loss was $ 8.29 billion , or $ 1.72 per share , compared with a year - earlier loss of $ 9.8 billion , or $ 1.99 a share .
The most recent results included $ 3.9 billion of gains from the sale of it German retail bank .
BREAKING UP
Citigroup , once the champion of the “ financial supermarket ” model , is splitting into two operating units in what is known as a “ good bank / bad bank ” strategy .
Critics of the bank , who argue it had become too big and complex to manage , have demanded a break - up for some time .
Citigroup ’s core commercial , retail and investment banking worldwide -- the good bank -- will be reorganized as Citicorp and led by Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit .
The other unit -- to be called Citi Holdings -- will encompass brokerage , retail asset management , consumer finance and a pool of risky assets .
The bank is considering selling off Citi Holdings assets , or letting them mature .
The bank said it was searching for someone to run Citi Holdings .
The break - up plan comes three days after Citigroup announced plans to sell its Smith Barney brokerage business to Morgan Stanley .
Initially , Citigroup will own 49 percent of a venture comprising the brokerages of both banks .
Morgan is expected to acquire full control after five years .
Citigroup will receive $ 2.7 billion upfront from Morgan as part of the deal , expected to close in the third quarter .

DEPRESSED RESULTS
Citigroup ’s fourth - quarter revenue fell 13 percent to $ 5.6 billion , reflecting weak capital markets .
It global credit card business saw revenue decline 27 percent on weakness in North America .
Consumer banking revenue declined 22 percent , driven by a 47 percent drop in investment sales .
Its institutional clients group , securities and banking revenue was negative $ 10.6 billion , mainly due to net losses and writedowns of $ 7.8 billion .
“ Our results continued to be depressed by an unprecedented dislocation in capital markets and a weak economy , ” said Pandit .
Citigroup said its
Tier 1 capital ratio , a measure of financial strength , stood at 11.8 percent at year - end , well above the level required by regulators .
The bank has sold $ 45 billion of preferred stock to the Treasury as part of the government ’s effort to prevent the collapse of U.S. banks .
Citigroup also disclosed it was reviewing goodwill on its balance sheet to determine if it should record an impairment .
Goodwill , the difference between what a company pays for an acquisition and its value , must be written down if a company believes the value of the acquired business will not recover .
Matt McCormick , portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati , said of the quarterly results , “ I think people knew it was going to be bad , but I ’m surprised it ’s this bad . ”
Throw Your Vote Away - Vote for a Second Party By Bryan Caplan
The standard argument against voting for third parties is that “ You ’re throwing your vote away . ”
There ’s no point voting for someone who ca n’t win .
Now consider how this applies to Singapore , where even second parties have no real prospect of winning .
Suppose a Singaporean says he ’s voting for the Workers ’ Party .
Is n’t it just as valid ( or invalid ) to tell him that “ You ’re throwing your vote away , ” as it is to say the same to an American who says he ’s voting for the Libertarian Party ?
Valid or not , the “ Why vote for a party that ca n’t win ? ” argument is probably an important reason why the opposition does so poorly in Singapore .
The upshot is that even in democracy , there may be equilibrium where one party gets on top , voters do n’t bother with rival parties because they do n’t think they can win , and this resignation in turn becomes self - fulfilling .
Hmm .
P.S. When you read what the Workers ’ Party has to say about organ trading , you too may be delighted that their party is a joke .
Yes on 8 campaign officials had challenged the constitutionality of the state ’s Political Reform Act , saying that people who gave money were being harassed and some had even received death threats .
A federal judge today denied a request by supporters of Proposition 8 to withhold disclosing anymore names and addresses of donors who gave money to pass the state ’s ban on same - sex marriage .
The act , passed in 1974 , requires campaigns to reveal the name and employer of people who give more than $ 100 to campaigns .
The law is intended to prevent money laundering and other illegal campaign activities .
But campaign supporters requested they be exempted from it arguing their supporters were being unmercifully harassed .
A judge disagreed , clearing the way for the donors who made contributions in the last two weeks before the election to be made public on Monday , the next filing date .
“ This is a victory for the people of California and for campaign finance disclosure , ” said Roman Porter , executive director for the California Fair Political Practices Commission .
“ We will vigorously defend public disclosure on behalf of the people of California on this and any other case . ”

According to a new study , the oestrogen hormone therapy , which is used to treat a number of symptoms of menopause , contracts women 's brains .
The research showed that elderly women , who participated in the clinical trial initiated by Women 's Health Initiative and took oestrogen pills , registered a tiny decrease in the size of two brain areas that play an important role in forming and recalling memory compared to women who were on a placebo .
The lead researcher , Susan Resnick , who works as a clinical researcher at the National Institute of Aging in Baltimore , Maryland , said that the brain 's shrinking could explain earlier accepted links between Hormone Replacement Therapy and dementia .
The most probable explanation had been tiny strokes that interrupted the supply of blood to the brain .
However , one of the recent studies found that patients on HRT had no more tiny brain lesions than women on a placebo .
The lead researcher of the study was Laura Coker , who works as an epidemiologist at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center , located in Winston - Salem , North Carolina .
Two reports that observed volunteer patients from the Women 's Health Initiative were unable to find what cause the shrinkage of the brain .
In 2002 and 2004 doctors decided to stop the Women 's Health Initiative research because preliminary results showed that oestrogen hormone therapy raised the risk of heart attacks , the development of breast cancer and strokes in elderly patients .
A research carried out later showed that HRT also increased the risk of dementia in women over 65 .
In order to confirm their discovery , the teams of Resnick and Coker decided to observe 1,400 women , who were asked to undergo a magnetic resonance brain scan .
With its help scientists estimated the volume of the brain and the dimensions of microscopic lesions .
The volunteers included patients who took either oestrogen therapy for about 18 moths and those who took a combined oestrogen and progestin therapy or placebo for about 36 months .
The average age of the study participants was slightly over 77 .
Researchers found that patients who took either form of HRT had smaller brain than those on placebo .
Their brain was several cubic centimeters smaller in size .
The therapy had the most significant impact on hippocampus ( an area in the brain involved in the formation of memories ) and frontal lobe ( an area in the brain involved in memory recall ) , reports BBC News .
" We found the negative affects on these brain volumes were greatest on women who entered the trial with the lowest cognitive function , " said one of the lead researchers .
Scientists look forward to carry out a new study in order to see whether the brain continues to shrink .
Now , however , Coker warns that women older than 65 should not begin HRT due to the risks involved .
At the same time she says that women in their 40s and 50s should not draw back from hormone therapy if necessary .
In case these women have menopausal symptoms they should consult their doctor and decide whether to continue taking hormone therapy .
On a chilly but brilliantly sunlit Friday morning , about two dozen people have gathered along the sidewalk near the main entrance to Central Baptist College in Conway , Arkansas .
The group includes a local lesbian couple who have been together for 35 years , a young African - American trans - man who came out of the closet a week before he graduated from another Southern Baptist college in Missouri , and a 22 - year - old aspiring minister from Philadelphia who quotes Proverbs , declares his love for God — and laments the recent breakup of his relationship with a boyfriend .
They are all members or supporters of Soulforce , an organization that aims to change the hearts of those who use religion to justify discrimination against sexual minorities .
Most of the 20 - somethings in the crowd are participating in Soulforce ’s Equality Ride , a semiannual event that shuttles queer young adults and their allies to conservative colleges and seminaries , where they try to engage students and administrators in dialogue around the issue of sexuality .
Terry Kimbrow , president of Central Baptist College , is not in a talkative mood .
A few minutes after the riders and their friends have unfurled banners identifying themselves and their cause , Kimbrow strides across a shady stretch of lawn to read a statement declaring that the Soulforce contingent is not welcome and that anyone who ventures off the sidewalk onto the college ’s campus will be arrested for trespassing .
“ We love you , ” one of the riders calls out as Kimbrow gives instructions to a police officer who has followed him to the edge of campus .
“ I love you too , ” Kimbrow replies before he turns and walks away from the strangers at his gate .
“ This is just what happens sometimes , ” says 26 - year - old Katie Higgins , one of the co-directors of this fall ’s Equality Ride .
“ We wait to be rejected . ”
Higgins grew up in South Carolina and now makes her home in Minneapolis , where she ’s one of a handful of fulltime staffers with Soulforce Q , the young - adult division of Soulforce .
“ There is a sort of redemptive suffering in standing here , ” she says as a brisk autumn wind reddens her cheeks .
“ A lot of times students at the places we go are n’t able to be out as gay , so that ’s the idea of these vigil lines — to be out and seen . ”
The riders always alert administrators that they plan to visit their campuses , Higgins explains , and that initial contact often opens the door for a conversation between Soulforce and campus thought - leaders once the Equality bus arrives .
But not always .
“ Through e-mail , ” Higgins says , “ we ’ve had students [ at other schools ] say that they ’ve watched us from the library window but they did n’t have the strength to come outside .
That ’s why sometimes we need to walk on campus even it means being arrested — they need to see how far we will go and how far their school will go . ”
In fact , Higgins and three other riders were arrested for trespassing at Central Baptist College four days earlier , when they made their first swing through Conway , about 30 miles northwest of Little Rock .
Hiding out in Seattle is not Christian
Soulforce was founded a decade ago by Mel White and his partner Gary Nixon .
From the 1960s until the late 1980s , White was an evangelical minister and ghostwriter for the likes of Billy Graham , Pat Robertson , and Jerry Falwell .
After he came out as a gay man in the 1990s , White began to integrate nonviolent principles of social change into his efforts to reshape the anti-gay cultural institutions of which he had been a part .
Thus both the tactics and the language used by the participants in Soulforce ’s Equality Ride , which was first launched in 2006 , bear a strong family resemblance to the culture of the American Civil Rights Movement .
“ Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere , ” says Lauren Parke , quoting Martin Luther King Jr. She and another rider compose messages that they hope to give to members of the Baptist Missionary Association of Arkansas , which owns Central Baptist College and is holding a meeting on campus while the Soulforce crew keeps its vigil along College Avenue .
Parke , 25 , says she studied theology as an undergraduate at Texas Lutheran University before she moved to Seattle , where she now works for an agency that provides services to homeless youth .
“ Simply hiding out in the safety and comfort of a place like Seattle is not Christian , ” she says in reply to a question about why she would leave a gay - friendly city to spend two months visiting places that actively discriminate against queer folks .
“ Statistically , ” she continues , “ a third of homeless young people identify as gay , bisexual , or transgender .
That ’s the result in many cases of this message from some Christians who say that if you are gay or transgender you are not worthy — which families and friends use to justify their rejection of young LGBT people .
I encounter them on the streets , and my agency recognizes this as a reality .
I ’m here to try to change that reality . ”
The political tide in Conway , and indeed the rest of Arkansas , is definitely turning against the kind of change that Parke and the other riders hope to see .
Faulker County , of which Conway is the seat , is part of a broad swath of the Southeast — from Oklahoma and Arkansas through Tennessee and along the lower ridge of the Appalachians — that has become redder , even as the rest of the country has trended purple and blue in recent elections .
John Kerry won 40 percent of the vote in Faulkner County in 2004 , but Barack Obama drew just 35 percent in this year ’s presidential contest .
On November 4 , a statewide measure aimed at preventing same - sex couples from becoming foster or adoptive parents passed by a comfortable margin , just as a ban on gay marriage did four years ago .
Conway should be Democratic territory .
It ’s a well - educated college town — in addition to Central Baptist , there ’s the University of Central Arkansas and historically progressive Hendrix College — on the northern fringe of the Little Rock metropolitan area .
But the predominantly white population is mostly made up of evangelical Protestants , and the feel of the place is small - town rather than suburban — the kind of community Sarah Palin might have called “ the real America . ”
In that respect , Central Baptist more closely mirrors the culture of Conway than either UCA or Hendrix , both of which are more demographically diverse and tend to attract students from elsewhere .
Most of Central Baptist ’s tiny student body ( the school has a current enrollment of about 500 ) commutes to campus , and many students are part of the college ’s adult education program , which caters to older locals returning to college or pursuing an undergraduate degree for the first time .
You ’re protesting God !
Everyone who registers for classes at Central Baptist is required to sign a document indicating their assent to the college ’s doctrinal statement .
It declares , among other things , that the Bible is God ’s inerrant revelation and that homosexuality is a sin justifying a student ’s expulsion from the school .
That policy and its enforcement by an institution that reflects Conway ’s religious culture — which is itself a reflection of a larger and increasingly obdurate conservative movement in opposition to advancing queer rights — are the core memes of intolerance that the Soulforce contingent has come to Conway to disrupt .
“ I ’m someone who knows what it feels like to be rejected by his family on the basis of doctrine , ” says Jarrett Lucas , the other co-director of this season ’s Equality Ride .
Lucas , 22 , was raised a Jehovah ’s Witness by his grandparents , who turned their backs on him when he told them he was gay .
Gazing toward Central Baptist with his hands tucked into his jacket pockets , Lucas says , “ These are people who reinforce the beliefs that cause LGBT people to suffer .
If I ’m in a place where I can love myself and teach others to love me and others like me , I have to use that opportunity to the fullest . ”
A little before noon , a handful of students from Central Baptist approach within a few dozen yards of the riders and take pictures of the scene with their cell phone cameras .
Traffic on College Avenue begins to pick up .
“ You ’re protesting God ! ” a motorist hollers when he catches sight of one of the Soulforce banners .
Finally a slender young man wearing a “ CBC Soccer ” jacket ventures all the way to the sidewalk .
“ I just kind of want to show them I care , ” says Jonathan Jacobs , a junior at the college .
Jacobs , whose family moved to Conway from Memphis when he was in the sixth grade , is reluctant to talk much at first , but warms to conversation after he and Jarrett Lucas trade soccer stories .
“ I do n’t agree with the fact that they ca n’t come on campus , ” Jacobs says .
“ We say that we love and accept everybody , but that ’s not what ’s happening here . ”
Sexual sins
By mid-afternoon , the student parking lot is nearly empty ( classes were cancelled to accommodate the missionary association ’s meeting ) and the Equality Riders have packed up and moved on .
The stern - faced police officer has ended his vigil too .
Curt Crook , the director of development at Central Baptist , is welcoming , if a little wary .
His office is decorated with devotional art , including an impressive broad - strokes watercolor painting in which Jesus extends a bloody palm toward the viewer .
“ You hear homosexuals talk about Christians trying to shove their beliefs down their throats , ” Crook says in reply to a question about why the riders were kept off campus .
“ And yet they ’re here basically trying to do the same thing to us .
They ’re wanting us to talk to them and our students to talk to them to try to get us to believe the way they do , but as an institution we have those beliefs in the Bible and we believe that it ’s very clear on what it says about homosexual behavior .
We did n’t feel it was necessary to allow them on campus to try to push something that was against what we believe . ”
Crook says he does n’t know whether there are gay students at Central Baptist — Jonathan Jacobs said he knows a few — but if there were , they would n’t be harassed , though being open about gay sexual relationships would subject queer students to the penalties prescribed for “ sexual sins ” in the college handbook .
Does Crook see a connection between the worldview promoted at Central Baptist and the violence and rejection LGBT people often face ?
“ There ’s a lot of talk about religious bigotry , ” he says .
“ About Christians hating other people for the way they act .
I do n’t think that ’s true .
We do n’t hate them — we love them like we love anybody else .
We just happen to disagree with them .
That gets turned around into they hate us , and it may be that people who say things like that have experienced something like that .
That ’s not Christian .
We would n’t invite them on campus , but we would n’t go out and intentionally be hurtful either . ”
More power than they knew
As night falls , the Equality Riders have gathered for a potluck dinner at the home of John Schenck and Robert Loyd , one of the few out gay couples in Conway and coordinators of the city ’s annual pride parade , which began in 2003 .
The pink clapboard house — two blocks north of Central Baptist College and across the street from a Church of Christ — is festooned with rainbow flags , and life - size cutouts of Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell beckon customers to the hair salon that Schenck and Loyd run on the ground floor .
How have the men fared in the two decades since they moved to Arkansas from New York ?
“ We have n’t been shot at in two , maybe three years , ” says Schenck , who was working as a bar - back in the Stonewall Inn on the day of the riots in 1969 .
“ For our first pride parade , we had over 1,800 protesters and over 3,000 people holding a prayer vigil .
This past year we had just one rabid protester .
We ’ve come a long way . ”
Loyd , a soft - spoken Vietnam vet who grew up in a rural area near Conway , credits the peace that the couple currently enjoys to their willingness to confront their would - be oppressors head on .
“ The night before our first parade someone dumped six tons of manure in front of the house , ” he says .
“ But we found out who did it and we saw to it that they did time in jail .
We ’ve made it clear that we would be addressing persecution with prosecution . ”
As the riders mingle with friendly locals — including a faculty member from the University of Central Arkansas , a handful of undergraduates from UCA and Hendrix , some pixieish theater kids from Little Rock , and the soccer player from Central Baptist — Katie Higgins is circumspect .
“ Kimbrow was tough , ” she says .
“ But I do n’t see what we could ’ve done differently . ”
He runs his school on a shoestring budget .
( Central Baptist has an endowment of about $ 970,000 .
By comparison , Hendrix College , with just three times as many students , has an endowment of $ 193 million . )
And the riders ’ visit to the school happened on a day when Kimbrow was playing host to the organization that owns it .
Although the cultural forces that Higgins wants to thwart are much bigger than she is , the tiny institution she and the other riders confronted earlier in the day is very fragile .
Under the circumstances , they wielded more power than they knew .
Her eyes brim with tears as she examines the day from a fresh perspective .
“ You know , there was another school that was just as hard to crack , ” she says .
“ Finally one of the administrators told us via e-mail that if we wanted to make headway , we should skip the bus and the vigil lines and just send a couple of people to talk .
We ended up having to sign this elaborate contract , but two of us got on campus , and we talked . ”
Higgins says there was no press involved in that visit — and even now she declines to name the school — but she knows the seed of change was planted .
Next time .

Interviews with residents of RafahDecember 29th , 2008 | Posted in Gaza Region , This is a longer video report , including interviews , of the aftermath of the bombing of the pharmacy in Hi Alijnina on the 28th December .
Yeah , I know , but I have to , I really do .
Matt Drudge falsely accused NBC of banning Coultergeist from their network because they cancelled a spot over a Tony Blair appearance .
Drudge has put forth so many falsehoods that he should be ignored by the press , ( but is hailed as the king of the world ) and Ann says this with a straight face .
COULTER : The point is , I was canceled twice .
And it was n't until the Drudge Report ran a headline on its own reporting -- and the Drudge Report has never had to retract a report the way -- LAUER :
You know -- you know what -- you know what that expression is -- COULTER : -- NBC
News has .
LAUER : -- just because you 're paranoid , does n't mean you do n't have enemies .
But anyway , let 's get to the -- COULTER : Let 's get to the reason --
Wow , that 's never happened in show business before .
I was cancelled a few times because other news breaks and the focus shifts .
But she has never been afraid to play the conservative victim before .
Nobody does it better than her .
Conservatives have almost destroyed this country for the last 8 years , but to Coutler it 's all B. Hussein Obama .
Well , her new book is called Guilty : Liberal " Victims " and Their Assault on America , and that 's what she did to get back onto NBC .
( Guilty : Coulter 's latest book filled with falsehoods )
She could n't wait to get back onto the network that wants to destroy America in O'Reilly 's mind .
And let us not forget when she was on with Vieira she said that Rudy Giuliani was crazy enough to " nuke " Iran .
That 's something that really builds bridges .
But she 'll always have a nice slice of the TODAY
Show no matter how hate filled her books are or what she says .
Remember when C&L break open her attacks on the 9/11 Widows ?
The blogosphere went wild and then the media followed .
Bill O'Reilly was upset that the 9/11 widows gave me their response to Coulter 's attack before the traditional media .
After
Ann got through blabbering about Drudge , Lauer confronted her on her idiotic writings , called them venomous and over the line .
She looked pretty dazed and confused in her usual garb , attempting to defend her attack on single moms while trying to sound sane .
I 'm pretty proud of C&L 's push to get a sane pundit like Rachel Maddow on the TODAY Show .
She has so much class that it must really be freaking Coulter out .
You know , I doubt Coulter would ever debate me at all .
I tried to set that up once already , but she balked ...
Washington , D.C. , January 21 , 2009 - On his first full day in office , President Barack Obama signed an executive order and two presidential memoranda heralding what he called a " new era of openness . "
Announcing a Presidential Memorandum on the Freedom of Information
Act to reestablish a presumption of disclosure for information requested under FOIA , President Obama said that " every agency and department should know that this administration stands on the side not of those who seek to withhold information , but those who seek to make it known . "
The FOIA Memorandum articulates a presumption of disclosure for government records and a hostility to the use of secrecy laws to cover up embarrassing information .
It directs the Attorney General to issue new guidelines governing FOIA and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to improve information dissemination to the public .
President Obama also issued an executive order reversing changes made by President George W. Bush to the Presidential Records Act ( PRA ) , stating he would hold himself and his own records " to a new standard of openness . "
The PRA order permits only the incumbent president ( and not former presidents ' heirs or designees or former vice presidents ) to assert constitutional privileges to withhold information , and would provide for review by the Attorney General and the White House Counsel before a president could claim privilege over his or her records .
Finally , President Obama also today issued a Presidential Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government which recognizes that " [ o ] penness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government . "
It directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget , the Chief Technology Officer , and the Administrator of the General Services Administration to develop an Open Government Directive within 120 days to implement the memo .
" This is the earliest and most emphatic call for open government from any president in history , " said Archive director Tom Blanton .
" President Obama has reversed two of the most dramatic secrecy moves of the Bush initiatives , one that told agencies to withhold whatever they could under FOIA and the other that gave presidential heirs and vice presidents the power to withhold presidential records indefinitely . "
In November 2008 , the National Security Archive and a coalition of more than 60 organizations called on President Obama to reverse the secrecy trend and issue new directives on openness on Day One of his presidency .
Today , President Obama heeded that call and took decisive action to ensure that openness , transparency , and accountability would be the rules and not the exceptions for his administration .
" President Obama is doing what he said he would do from the campaign trail .
He is trying to transform how the public will learn about government decisions and actions " said Meredith Fuchs , the Archive 's General Counsel .
" I hope his decisive leadership on these issues pushes the bureaucracy to make these principles a reality -- to give us an accountable , democratic , national government . "

[ Ex - Insomniac programmer Nathan Fouts created one of the standout Xbox Live Community Games for Xbox 360 in 2D side - scrolling shooter Weapon Of Choice , and explains just how in this in - depth Gamasutra postmortem . ]
Working on games such as Resistance : Fall of Man and Postal 2 was a dream come true .
While I really enjoyed contributing to stunningly - complex 3D games , my secret passion was to create a smoking , 2D , side - scrolling action game that looked like it crawled off that high school , stoner kid 's notebook , and then ate Rainbow Brite .
For me , directly mapping 2D stick controls to a 2D action game is like pizza and beer .
And maybe some warmed pie on the side .
And some ice cream on the pie .
Mmmm ... anyway , I drugged my wife and convinced her that I should quit my great job at Insomniac Games , and use all of our savings to make my own game .
( Okay , just kidding -- no one actually took drugs despite what Weapon of Choice 's art direction may suggest . )
With most of my teenage years spent fighting Red Falcon and the Bydo Empire , Weapon of Choice 's designs and drawings flowed freely .
The game revealed itself to me over a period of months , and fortuitously , XNA became ready for primetime as well .
Figure 1 . Final title and original pencil art .
All the art in the game started as pencil and was then scanned and colored digitally .
My friend , AJ Johnson , wrote the dialogue and the story , and Hamdija Ajanovic composed the game 's rocking , custom soundtrack .
A programming friend helped with a few enemy prototypes , and another old colleague designed one of the levels .
Those poor saps worked remotely and agreed to get paid on the back end , based on sales profit .
I also remotely contracted two texture artists for occasional environment texture work ; they were paid with actual money .
My wife acted as the producer and business manager .
Friends and family were the QA department , playtesting the game at milestones .
That left everything else for me , which included the original concept , design , programming , art , animation , sound effects ... you know , the game part .
While initially I wanted to release the game on Xbox Live Arcade , Weapon of Choice swaggered onto the Xbox 360's Community Games on November 19th and seems to be well received .
The game is an " approachable hardcore game " meant for older gamers who do n't always have time on their hands for retail games .
Though I 've worked in the professional game industry for over a decade , there were many sadly entertaining things I learned along the way .
But let 's leave the embarrassment for last .
Enlarge Elliott Minor , AP Peanut Corp. of America 's plant in in Blakely , Ga. ONLINE RESOURCES ONLINE RESOURCES FDA.gov :
For the latest list of product recalls CDC.gov :
For medical information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PeanutsUSA.com : American Peanut Council list of brands not affected by the recall BAD HISTORY AT PB PLANT BAD HISTORY AT PB PLANT Senior congressional and state officials called Wednesday for a federal probe of possible criminal violations at a Georgia peanut processing plant linked to the nationwide salmonella outbreak .
The government Tuesday accused the peanut butter manufacturer Peanut Corp. of America ( PCA ) of shipping products in 2007 and 2008 after internal tests found bacterial contamination , violating food safety regulations .
Q&A : What you should know about the peanut butter recall VIDEO : Feds : Bad history at peanut butter plant ON THE WEB : See FDA 's inspection report for yourself
The company 's actions " can only be described as reprehensible and criminal , " said Rep. Rosa DeLauro , D - Conn. , who oversees Food and Drug Administration funding .
" Not only did this company knowingly sell tainted products , it shopped for a laboratory that would provide the acceptable results they were seeking .
This behavior represents the worst of our current food safety regulatory system . "
In Georgia , the state 's top agriculture official joined DeLauro in asking the Justice Department to determine if the case warrants criminal prosecution .
" They tried to hide it so they could sell it , " said Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin .
" Now they 've caused a mammoth problem that could destroy their company — and it could destroy the peanut industry . "
There was no immediate response from Peanut Corp. , which owns the Blakely , Ga. , processing plant at the center of the investigation .
The company has previously said it fully cooperated with the salmonella investigation .
Irvin , the Georgia agriculture official , said he was outraged by the company 's actions and said a state criminal probe was possible .
He would not , however , specify which Georgia laws the company may have violated for fear it would help the company start planning its defense .
Meanwhile , state lawmakers were drafting a plan to require food makers to report the results of internal inspections to state officials , something the peanut plant in Blakely was n't required to do .
Peanut butter and peanut paste manufactured by Peanut Corp. has been tied to the salmonella outbreak that has sickened 501 people in 43 states and is believed to have contributed to eight deaths .
The FDA said that its inspection of the plant found records of 12 instances in which plant officials identified salmonella in ingredients or finished products .
The products should not have been shipped , the FDA says .
PCA took no steps to address cleaning after finding the salmonella , says Michael Rogers , director of the FDA 's division of field investigations .
In some instances , the company had the product tested again by a different laboratory and got a clean test result , FDA officials said in a telephone conference with reporters .
It 's quite possible that a retest would miss the salmonella , says Michael Doyle , director of the University of Georgia 's Center for Food Safety .
The product should have been destroyed after the first positive test result , he says .
This outbreak is hitting children especially hard , says Robert Tauxe of the Centers for Disease Control .
Half of those stricken are younger than 16 , and 21 % are under 5 , Tauxe says .
While PCA 's peanut butter was sold in bulk to institutions , its peanut paste has been used as an ingredient in snack foods .
The FDA says it has not found the exact outbreak strain in the plant , but it has been found in tubs of peanut butter made at the plant , considered the sole source of the contamination .
" It 's incredibly negligent , " says William Hubbard , a former FDA associate commissioner .
Hubbard questions why the FDA did n't act sooner , given the sanitation violations found by state inspectors .
Previous inspection reports by the Georgia Department of Agriculture found deficiencies in how well the plant was cleaned .
In a statement issued Tuesday , PCA said it " has cooperated fully with FDA from day one during the course of this investigation .
We have shared with them every record that they have asked for that is in our possession , and we will continue to do so . "
Shipping products known to be contaminated is " a violation of the law , " says the FDA 's Stephen Sundlof .
" Whether or not there was any criminal activity involved is a different issue . "

An airline refused to apologize for losing a Staten Island couple ’s dog at Kennedy Airport – even after the panicked pooch met a tragic end on a busy Queens thoroughfare .
“ If they had lost a $ 5 suitcase , we would probably have gotten a quicker response and more sympathy , ” a heartbroken Matthew Mirones – a former state assemblyman – told The Post yesterday .
“ But here was a member of our family , who because of Olympic Airlines ’ incompetence is dead , and they ca n’t even say , ‘ I ’m sorry . ’ ”
On the way to Athens , Mirones and his girlfriend , Lisa Lonuzzi , were able to bring Leo , an 18 - pound beige terrier , as a carry - on and stow him under their seat .
But on the return flight , Olympic officials insisted that the dog fly in the cargo hold .
After arriving at Kennedy Airport on the night of Nov. 30 , Lonuzzi and Mirones stood by the baggage carousel waiting for Leo to come down off the conveyor belt .
Their bags appeared right away , but after a half - hour , there was still no sign of the dog crate in which the couple 12 hours earlier had meticulously packed their beloved terrier .
When they became the last ones standing at the carousel , they began to panic and approached an airline official .
“ At first , they gave us the runaround , ” Lonuzzi said .
“ Then they finally told us they had the crate – but no dog . ”
According to Olympic spokesman George Kessanis , when the belly of the aircraft was opened , Leo darted out the door .
The 22 - month - old pooch raced toward Terminal 2 , outrunning half a dozen employees .
“ This is not something we are prepared to handle – it has never happened before , ” Kessanis said .
“ This is not a lost suitcase that you can trace – this is a living being , and there is only so much we can do . ”
When asked why the airline had not apologized , Kessanis said only , “ It ’s a regrettable event for us . ”
Port Authority police drove the couple around the ramp area of the terminal .
After searching for an hour or two , Mirones and Lonuzzi went home , devastated .
“ I had to do something , so I posted an ad on Craigslist , ” she said .
Responses came pouring in from animal lovers – many of whom had been involved in the search for Vivi , the Westminster show dog lost at Kennedy in 2006 and never seen again .
The day after their pet was lost , Lonuzzi received the news that a dog matching Leo ’s description had been found dead on the side of Rockaway Boulevard .
“ We scraped him off the side of the road – we were devastated , ” Lonuzzi said .
“ At least we know where he is .
We have closure , just no apology . ”

For a company who clearly have their sights set on becoming one of the must - have applications no self respecting Mac user can be without , Parallels have some considerable way to go .
Back story
The idea is simple enough .
Because of the amazing technology Intel have put into their Core 2 Duo chips , which power every Apple computer , Parallels software is able to “ cheat ” ( which is n’t really how it works but stay with me ) your computer into thinking it ’s not just a Mac , but a regular off the shelf Windows / Linux PC as well –and one which can run these two operating systems alongside Mac OS X , in what ’s know as a virtual machine –complete with a virtual video card , sound card and software simulations of everything an operating system expects to “ see ” when it ’s installed on regular real PC hardware .
Being as I was in the market for a new computer around the time Apple switched from IBM PPC microprocessors to the Intel architecture , the addition of Parallels to my order from Apple seemed like a natural step .
$ 49 seemed like a small price to pay for the ability to run Windows and Linux whenever I might need to , without leaving the OS X environment .
Unfortunately that early version delivered little and felt uneven and buggy .
It was n’t long before at least two point releases had been issued and some but not all of the early teething issues were addressed .
Then along came version 3 . A paid upgrade .
The alarm bells began to ring , that Parallels might not be so much interested in making great software as much as they were in charging their customers twice for something that still did n’t work right .
But I dutifully paid for the upgrade , eager to give the much hyped Coherence Mode a whirl and try out some Windows only games with the promised Direct X support and numerous other bug fixes , which should probably have been addressed in a free upgrade for those of us who simply wanted Parallels to work as promised from the start .
Sadly in version 3 neither of these new features managed to impress , and in reality simply sapped all available RAM .
An experience akin to that of an early 90’s PC attempting to run Windows XP .
More disk grinding and stuttering audio , before the inevitable “ bong ” of the Windows error message and the occasional system lock up , than a smooth computing experience the marketing hype had suggested .
Parallels to customers : “ More cash please ”
The launch , then , of Parallels version 4 , yesterday , did not greet me with a great deal of excitement–and having used it for less than 24 hours I ca n’t say I ’ve had my mind changed .
Installing Parallels version 4 was a nightmare .
Convincing parallels.com to cough up a trial serial number was like convincing a lazy old arthritic dog to beg for a treat .
Then the software did n’t work anyway , giving the above error message .
Then , once I eventually got the thing installed and working , it attempted to convert the old Parallels version 3 disk images of Windows XP and Ubuntu Linux into version 4 compatible virtual disks –which despite assuring me this had taken place successfully , did n’t once apologies for freezing the entire computer for 10 minutes while it did it or that this had to happen twice ( both times “ successfully ” except not ) before I conceded defeat and reinstalled both operating systems from scratch–happy that at least version 3 had been so buggy I ’d never entrusted any important information to the now unreadable disk images of either Linux or Windows XP which I now had to delete in order to use the “ new and improved ” version 4 .
If at this point I had simply decided version 4 was n’t for me , I ’d be out of luck–as launching the previous version 3 now only displays the same error message as above and , despite its instruction to re-install the application , no version 3 download of the installer remains available on the parallels .com website , since version 4 was launched .
Again , clear indication that Parallels software are more about selling what ’s already been sold than fixing what should never have been broken .
Linux
Product “ support ” is yet to answer any of my emails on previous problems I ’ve had with their software , so I wo n’t hold my breath for a reply to the one I fired off to them explaining my experience thus far–but to add insult to injury non of the shared folder networking problems have been fixed with Linux , nor have the much promised , never delivered enhancements to 3D graphics support–meaning anyone hoping that yet another injection of cash into the project would finally bring Beryl 3D desktop eye candy to Ubuntu or Aero interface to Vista , is going to be sorely disappointed –unless , that is , they can translate the hieroglyphic “ help ” documentation on the matter , provided by Parallels ( shown opposite ) .
The one and only saving grace of version 4 , apart from that it has been given a rudimentary make - over in it ’s appearance ( icons , window transition animations and a more user friendly preference and configuration pane ) is that Kubuntu 8.10 is now supported by Parallels Tools , which means you can glide between OS X , Windows and the latest version of the most popular version of Linux without having to “ focus ” the mouse with a keyboard shortcut–although aside from that non of the other benefits of using Parallels tools are currently working as promised , i.e. , folder sharing or Open GL interface graphics and even then getting Parallels Tools to actually install and work properly under Linux is nowhere near as simple as the documentation leads you to believe .
Not even close
All in all , I have to admit , I ’m one of the biggest shout from the rooftops Apple Mac fan boys out there , when there is something to shout about–but Parallels version 4 is just annoying .
From the demand for more money , to the failure to fix things which were never addressed in previous versions , a lick of paint to the interface and an updated set of Linux tools is simply not worth the asking price .
$ 39.99 for existing customers to upgrade from version 3 is insulting when it should be free .
As for the whopping $ 79.99 being asked of new customers , to my mind , this is daylight robbery , when it has to be presumed , from their track record , that Parallels Software wo n’t be issuing any bug fixes free of charge .
Simply put , if you want to run Windows applications on a Mac , use Boot Camp .
If you want to use a particular Linux application in Mac OS X , compile it yourself from source code using the free libre open source application Fink and spend your money elsewhere .
A big fat raspberry
It is an impossibly hot summer evening in St Louis , a city in the American Midwest best known for barbecues and blues music , and I ’m driving around the streets of the town ’s Central West End wondering if this will be known one day as the place where the revolution began .
In less than an hour I am to meet its leader , a young man whose face I have never seen though we ’ve been talking for months .
I know I should n’t be this eager to greet him in person , to finally see what he looks like , but then again it ’s not every day you meet a young healthy man who is 100 % uninterested in sex .
In a world where lust can be bought in a pill and skin is the marketing tool du jour , being David Jay can not be easy .
At the age of 22 he has never had sex .
He has never experienced sexual attraction towards another person and does not believe it will ever happen .
There are many others who have similar stories to tell .
They talk about growing up not being able to understand why everyone else seemed so interested in dating , kissing and touching ; in experiencing the ritual of mating .

Common label
Until recently these people felt isolated , never suspecting others felt the same .
But now , thanks in great part to an online forum founded by Jay , they are finding each other and identifying themselves with a common label .
They call themselves asexual , and are coming out to parents and loved ones , declaring their asexuality to be as valid an orientation as being straight or gay .
They are printing T - shirts and pamphlets , and discussing the concept of “ A - pride ” and what it means to be “ A - sexy ” .
They are , essentially , announcing to the world that they are not broken or defective , or sexually dysfunctional .
Instead they have a bona fide sexual identity that must no longer be ignored .
A few months ago it might have been easy to dismiss these individuals as outsiders whose coming together in the era of the search engine has given them an inflated sense of community .
However , little - publicised studies of rodents and sheep suggest that asexual behaviour in mammals is not so uncommon .
And this August , a researcher in human sexuality published the first tentative figures for the number of asexual people in the population , which suggested that there might be almost as many asexual people as there are gay individuals .
The figure raises the intriguing spectre of a repressed , underground minority on the verge of bubbling up into the mainstream .
Are we about to witness the birth of the asexual revolution ?
Coming out
Discovering our sexuality , we are told , is a perfectly normal process that must be celebrated .
We might wish to tame it perhaps , but never negate it .
Even concepts such as celibacy or abstinence work on the implicit assumption that we are deliberately rejecting sexuality .
Doctors tell us that if we lose interest in sex we must seek help with the problem .
Unsurprisingly , one of the hardest things about being asexual is convincing other people that there is nothing wrong with you .
Tell someone on the street that you are asexual and they ’ll stare at you in disbelief , says Jay .
The immediate supposition is that you ’re just a late bloomer , he adds .
A powerful example of how people react to the idea appears in an article titled “ Eight myths about religious life , ” which appeared in Vision 2002 , an annual magazine from the National Religious Vocation Conference in the US .
It states : “ Question : what do you call a person who is asexual ?
Answer :
Not a person .
Asexual people do not exist .
Sexuality is a gift from God and thus a fundamental part of our human identity . ”
But now , people outside the asexual community are starting to question these assumptions .
Elizabeth Abbott , Dean of Women at Trinity College , University of Toronto , Canada , is one of the few academics who are aware of the issue and believes it is a real phenomenon .
Soon after her book A History of Celibacy was released in 1999 , letters started pouring in from people who told her that , like celibates , they did n’t have sex .
Only in their case , it was not a question of choice – they simply did n’t want to .
That ’s when she realised that asexual people actually existed .
“ The asexual can be somebody ’s husband or wife , ” says Abbott .
But societal pressures keep most asexuals in the closet , she adds .
“ They have to hide themselves because we are in a highly sexed society .
Imagine someone who does n’t even want it and who is n’t having a problem if they ’re not getting it .
There ’s not really anyone for them to talk to . ”
Something different
According to Jay , one of the biggest battles is convincing other people that being this way is what feels right .
Many asexuals discovered their orientation in their early teens and refer to their asexuality as something that has always been with them .
One example is 17 - year - old Aspen ( name changed ) , a mild - mannered girl with big blue eyes who lives in Worcester , Massachusetts .
One summer afternoon over lunch she told me that she had looked up the word asexual in the dictionary at age 15 , hoping to find a definition for how she saw herself .
None of the explanations fitted , so she wrote in her journal : “ What am I ?
Like I said before I ’m not anything ; not anything there ’s a word for , at least
If there were a word for what I ’m starting to think I am it would n’t – unlike the word homosexual , heterosexual , bisexual , transsexual – have the word sex in it .
I ’m something different . ”
When I asked Kate Goldfield , a 20 - year - old college student from Maine , to describe her feelings , she offered an analogy .
“ It ’s almost as foreign to me as someone saying  You know , when you ’re 18 we ’re going to take you on a space shuttle and we ’re going to go to Mars ’ . ”
Angela ( name changed ) , a lively 40 - year - old writer from Massachusetts , explains it this way : “ I have never had interest in sex all my life , at all .
It ’s like algebra .
I understand the concept , but have no interest .
I do n’t have the strong feeling about it that the rest of the world has , ” she says .
Loving variety I finally meet Jay face - to - face at the lobby of my hotel .
He flashes a confident smile and firmly shakes my hand as if he had known a part of me was secretly expecting a weirdo and he was glad to set me straight .
Jay is no Calvin Klein model , but not unattractive either ; in fact , he ’s kind of got the air of a young JFK Junior , tall and slender , with warm , dark eyes , and the mouth of a Greek god I can imagine young girls dying to kiss .
More intimate
He is living proof that it is absolutely wrong to assume asexuals shun sex simply because they ca n’t get any .
I ask him if anyone has ever tried to convert him into the realm of the sexual .
“ Yes , that ’s definitely happened , ” he replies .
“ That ’s actually the time that I made out with [ snogged ] someone . ”
It did n’t do anything for him but he ended up having a relationship with the girl – a sexless one , of course .
“ We had a physical relationship , more intimate in a lot of ways .
We hugged each other a lot . ”
That Jay “ likes ” girls is one of several intriguing facts I learn about asexual people as they discuss some of the most intimate details of their lives with me .
There are asexuals , for example , who have never felt the need to get close to other people , not even in a non-sexual way , and describe themselves as loners .
But others , like Jay , want to connect with males or females – some people would define it as an orientation – only it seems to be purely emotional .
Their desire is to find a “ mate ” with whom they can share interests and spend time with but not have any form of sexual relationship with .
( Jay once worried he could never feel love , but now knows he can .
Indeed , unencumbered by sexual feelings , he believes his is a more powerful , unconditional form of love . )
In addition , some asexuals are capable of experiencing bodily arousal .
They get erections and some masturbate , although even while experiencing the physical cues of arousal there never is an impulse to do anything sexual with another person .
A number of asexuals told me that watching porn or looking at erotic pictures were awkward experiences that they could n’t relate to .
“ I get the feelings but my body never made the mental connection to what I would do about it , ” explains Pete ( name changed ) , a high - school student who is in a non-sexual relationship with a girl .
“ I get the arousal but when it happens it gets annoying because to me there is really no purpose to it , there is nothing I can do about it , ” he says .
No definition
The amazing degree of variation in the experiences of asexual people suggests that the underlying causes of their lack of sexual attraction are very different .
Some asexuals might simply have extremely low sex drives in spite of an innate orientation towards males or females .
Other asexuals might form a fourth category of sexual orientation in addition to the hetero- , homo - and bi-sexual ones , namely people who are attracted to neither gender , even if they have normal sex drives .
There is no official definition for asexuality yet , but it probably needs to take all these variations into account , says Anthony Bogaert , a psychologist and human - sexuality expert studying asexuality at Brock University in St. Catherines , Canada .
“ The place where we draw the line is the desire to interact sexually with other people , ” says Brian ( name changed ) , a navy veteran from Virginia .
When it comes to having children , some asexuals say they would like to have a baby , but most would use IVF to avoid having to have sex .
Much of the sense of community that emerges when Brian and others talk about their collective status as asexuals comes from the fact that they have found a virtual neighbourhood where they constantly interact .
“ It ’s made it a whole lot easier for us to find each other , ” Brian says .
One such web forum , called AVEN ( for Asexual Visibility and Education Network at www.asexuality.org) was founded by Jay in 2001 and provides extensive information about asexuality along with discussion forums .
It began with fewer than 50 members but now boasts more than 1200 .
People from all over the world have visited the site : from Saudi Arabia , Japan and Cuba .
Convincing the sceptics
Discussion of asexuality in academic circles is virtually non-existent , save for its occurrence in plants , worms and other lowly critters .
“ It has not been out there , there is nothing written about it , ” says Nicole Prause , a graduate student at Indiana University in Bloomington , who has done one of the very first studies on the subject .
One reason is that the bulk of research on human sexuality has been driven by the problems sexual activity creates , such as sexually transmitted diseases and teenage pregnancy .
“ Concern about those problems is what produces money to do research , ” says John DeLamater , a human - sexuality expert from the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
And even when researchers do study people who are not having sex , it is always on the understanding that sexual inactivity is a problem that needs fixing .
“ Hypoactive sexual desire ” is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - IV ) – the bible of psychologists and psychiatrists .
The manual says this can happen during adolescence and persist throughout a person ’s life .
It is considered a disorder if it causes the person distress .
But the hypoactive sexual desire label fails to acknowledge people who are happy and healthy but have a lifelong aversion to sex and feel no attraction towards men or women .
It is this subset of the population whose true sexual identity has not been recognised , argues Jay .
Below the radar
“ This is a category that has socially not been manufactured yet .
It ’s below the radar , ” says sociologist Edward Laumann from the University of Chicago in Illinois , one of the world ’s top experts on human sexuality .
“ You have to have someone who is prepared to accept asexuality as a way someone is born , like [ having ] blue eyes , ” says Abbott .
This might be a novel view but it ’s not unreasonable , adds DeLamater .
“ Motivation to engage in sexual intimacy is a dimension that runs basically from zero to extremely high , and there are probably some people at that zero end , ” he says .
The question is whether that zero end represents a tiny sliver of the sexuality bell curve or a substantial slice .
The limited research on asexual mammals suggests that asexual behaviour is actually not that rare .
For example , studies in rats and gerbils done as early as the 1980s have demonstrated that up to 12 % of the males in the population are not interested in females .
Named “ duds , ” these animals are described as asexual in the literature .
But because males are so aggressive , it had not been possible to put one of these individuals in a cage with another male to test whether their lack of interest in females was had to do with attraction to males .
Sheep studies
In the 1990s , however , three separate teams from the US Sheep Experiment Station in Dubois , Idaho , Oregon State University in Corvallis and the Oregon Health and Science University , Portland , tackled this question .
In one study , young but sexually mature rams were put in a pen with females on 18 different occasions to assess their partner preference .
As expected , the majority of rams mated vigorously with the ewes , but around 10 % did not mount the females or show any interest .
Those rams were then put in a pen beside either two males or two females and behavioural tests measured the number of times the animals showed “ interest ” ( kicks , vocalisations , sniffs , mount attempts ) towards members of either sex .
Some of the rams – between 5 % and 7 % of the population – tried to mount , sniff and sexually interact with other rams .
Intriguingly , another group – some 2 % to 3 % of the population – showed no interest towards either males or females .
“ They have no interest whatsoever in mating , ” says Fredrick Stormshak from the Oregon team .
“ They appear to be 100 % asexual . ”
This asexual preference still held when the tests were performed one year later .
Stormshak believes these asexual rams could offer a good model for understanding the basis of asexual behaviour in mammals .
They could be used , for example , to see if the hormone levels in these animals are different .
Not having sex
Although such studies might offer insights into asexuality in people , comparisons between such different creatures as humans and sheep are controversial and should be made very cautiously .
The closest we have got to understanding human asexuals comes from studies – mostly surveys – of people who report not having sex .
Obviously this category not only includes people who see themselves as asexual but also people who are simply unable to have sex because of old age or ill - health .
Nonetheless , these surveys offer some interesting clues .
Laumann published one of the best - known sexuality surveys in 1994 ( The social organization of sexuality : sexual practices in the United States , by Laumann and others , The University of Chicago Press ) based on very detailed responses from almost 3500 Americans from all over the country and all walks of life .
The survey showed that about 13 % of respondents had not had sex in a year .
Forty per cent of those people considered themselves extremely or very happy in spite of this .
The study also revealed , according to Laumann , that about 2 % of the entire adult population has never had a sexual experience .
But that does not tell us whether these people would ever want to have sex .
It is only recently that sexuality research has begun to focus less on behaviour and more on people ’s desires as a better measure of their sexual preference .
Bogaert has just published the very first study estimating the prevalence of asexuality in the population using this notion and the results are intriguing ( The Journal of Sex Research , vol 41 , p 279 ) .
Same - sex attraction
In his analysis , Bogaert looked at another study of sexual practices , published in 1994 , that surveyed more than 18,000 people in the UK .
Although it did not specifically target the issue of asexuality , it did include a section questioning respondents on sexual attraction .
One option read : “ I have never felt sexually attracted to anyone at all . ”
Bogaert saw that a surprisingly high 1 % of respondents had chosen this last option – close to the rate for same - sex attraction , now believed to be running at about 3 % .
Prause took a different approach in her – as yet unpublished – study of asexual people .
Instead of looking at older data she decided to recruit asexuals via the internet and ask them questions about their sexual experience , their arousability and desire levels .
What she found , though she stresses the results are very preliminary , is that people who describe themselves as asexuals ( 41 responded to the survey ) seem to have similar levels of sexual behaviour to other respondents , suggesting that they are often having sex when they do n’t really want to .
More importantly , says Prause , her study suggests that asexuality is not some kind of illness .
“ People are using it as their sexual orientation , ” she says .
A pride
If asexuality is indeed a form of sexual orientation , perhaps it will not be long before the issue of “ A ” pride starts attracting more attention .
AVEN ’s online store sells items aimed at promoting awareness and acceptance : one T - shirt proclaims , “ Asexuality : It ’s not just for amoebas anymore , ” and there ’s a thong that reads , “ It ’s only underwear .
Get over it . ”
Jay has been working hard at raising awareness : giving talks , networking with other organisations and getting the issue of asexuality aired in the media .
He thinks asexual activism is indeed beginning to coalesce into a real political movement .
“ It ’s interesting because we ’re in the shadow of the gay rights movement , so it ’s a very different process now because we have things to draw on .
There is also a culture that is ready to accept sexual variation much more readily than it was before . ”
After raising money through the AVEN website , Jay designed , printed and distributed 5000 educational pamphlets .
The front panel reads : “ not everybody is interested in sex ” .
Positive identity
DeLamater says he sees several parallels between this flurry of activity and the beginnings of the gay revolution in the 1970s .
“ In that sense they are very much like what happened in the gay and lesbian and transgender community ; a group of people who originally were treated and thought of themselves as strange or deviant or not fitting somewhere who gradually come together and create a positive identity out of those characteristics , ” he says .
One example of that transformation is the fact that people are coming out of the closet .
“ I was so excited about finally discovering myself that I just went out and told a few of my friends and it kind of spread , ” says Pete .
By finding this positive identity and being open to loved ones about it , some asexuals , like 23 - year - old Esther Dail from Colorado have even been able to fill “ traditional ” societal roles by getting married to sexual partners .
“ He does n’t push me , ” says Dail of her husband , with whom she does n’t have intercourse and whom she told about her asexuality when they were dating .
Bogaert and other academics believe that while the idea of an asexual movement is not far - fetched , it is likely to have less impact and momentum than the gay revolution because the notion of asexuality is uncontroversial .
“ It does n’t repel , it just does n’t appeal , ” says Abbott .
But who knows , maybe 10 years from now we will live in a world where it ’s totally cool to be “ A ” and being a “ happy single ” is no longer considered an oxymoron .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In her first full week as the nation 's homeland security secretary , Janet Napolitano got a full dose of the job 's diverse responsibilities -- responding to ice storms in the Midwest , dealing with Congress on budget matters and scrutinizing security plans for the Super Bowl .
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano had a busy first week at her new job .
During it all , she said , she tried to learn her way around Washington .
Napolitano , who stepped down as governor of Arizona to accept the job , said her routine includes morning security briefings followed by visits to Department of Homeland Security agencies and interviews with job candidates .
In addition , she called the governors of Arkansas , Missouri and Kentucky to make sure they were getting the help they needed to cope with ice storms , she said .
Napolitano described the ice storms as the " most pressing issue " during her first week in office .
Napolitano has issued a series of " action orders " asking for information from DHS agencies about northern border security , cyber security and transportation security , among other things .
Responses for some of the issues are due Monday .
" I would say , by and large , Congress has done a pretty good job at getting resources to this key department , " Napolitano told reporters Friday , adding that her job is to make sure those resources are used effectively .
Napolitano said she will be seeking areas where her department can save money but still accomplish its mission .
She cited expenses for facilities and vehicle fleets as possible examples .
" Are we as lean as we can be ? " she asked .
" My perception is , overall we 're lean . "
Napolitano said DHS needs to focus more on employers who hire illegal workers instead of focusing on the illegal immigrants themselves .
" You really have to look at the demand side for illegal labor and go after the employers as strongly and as effectively as you can , " she said .
Asked if that meant easing up on actions against the illegal workers themselves , Napolitano said , " No . "
Another area of concern : illegal immigrants in prisons .
Napolitano said she wants DHS to focus on arresting illegal immigrant fugitives and on deporting them immediately upon their release .
Napolitano said she was also " very focused " on transportation security .
She said there is a vast disparity between resources spent on aviation security and those on security for buses , subways and other mass transit .
She added that DHS has to do more to prevent weapons from being shipped from the United States to Mexico , where they are used in drug - related killings .

ADELAIDE , Australia 
Under the midday sun on a country road , Janette Makowski , cancer survivor , waited for Lance Armstrong , cancer survivor , with a friend by her side and a white board in her hands .
On it , Makowski had written , “ Lance would you like to come over for dinner to our house ? ”
As Armstrong ’s comeback began in earnest Tuesday with the opening stage of the Tour Down Under , Australia continued to give him an unusually warm welcome .
And Tuesday ’s welcome actually turned out to be a little too warm for Armstrong ’s taste , as temperatures during the 140 - kilometer race peaked at just over 104 degrees .
“ This is the day they said was going to be the easy day , ” said Armstrong , who on his Twitter page also described the conditions as “ hotter than doughnut grease . ”
It was a day for persistence , not brilliance , and Armstrong complied .
He and some of his Astana teammates stayed near the front of the chase pack for much of the stage before turning more conservative in the final five kilometers .

in response to Nate Borg Regarding Dave Chappell 's comment in the article about the WebSphere " Sargasso Sea of technology " : he has a point .
Making sense of and evaluating all of these products ( in addition to all the pre-existing WebSphere products of course ) is not for the faint of heart .
Did n't someone say that SOA would simplify IT and better align it with the business ?
The jury 's still out on the " simplifying " aspect ...
I can't resist throwing in a ridiculous conspiracy theory : the whole of WebSphere was invented by IBM in order to convince customers that they should stick to mainframes , OS / 390 , Cobol , CICS and DB2 :-)

I do n't understand how they can build such a great product as eclipse and at the same time deliver websphere / rad wich is IMO a big bunch of pathetic crap .
I dont even care to look at the other pathetic crap .

Websphere 6.0 is a joke and so is RSA .
IBM seem to go out of their way to make JEE more complex than it needs to be .
Ever tried to use their appliaction server without their IDE .

It 's not an app server for small , lightweight development , that 's for sure .
If you are writing straightforward webapps , Websphere is severe overkill .

Websphere 6.0 is a heckuva lot better than 5.1.1.1.1.1 .
I could n't even get the latter to work on Linux whereas 6 installed quite smoothly .

Wonder if you guys are speaking from " really real " experience's .
There are lots of real life case studies , where WebSphere is being used without WebSphere / Rational IDE .
J2EE can be as complex as want it to be and at the sametime it can be as simple as you want it to be .
WebSphere just like others , is just a J2EE server .
BTW , do you mind sharing your experience with WebSphere / RSA , I can try and help you out .

I do speak out of " really real " experience , as I am a couple of months dedicated deployment manager in a large project that makes use of WebSphere .
Yes as a J2EE server WebSphere is indeed just like others , but not where it goes about deployments .
It seems like the whole point of it is to make it tightly coupled with retarded IDE and to make the whole thing so complicated that you would definitely need to hire couple of IBM consultants to solve that mess .
To pretend I 'm constructive , I 'll write my personal complaints top 5 list :
1. Deployment process is made unnecessary heavy .
To stop - undeploy - deploy - start an application , it takes about a minute , compared to a few seconds on almost any other J2EE server .
2. WebSphere config repository breaks on numerous occasions ( e.g. when someone using web console while JACL script is running ) .
The application is there in list but it can't be uninstalled , because it 's not installed .
No it can't be installed either , because it 's there in list .
After installation , the application can't be started .
Because it 's not installed .
Wait a minute ... no , it 's installed already .
And indeed no documentation is available on the internal repository XML format .
Therefore , the problems with configuration repository are often only cured with total reinstallation of WebSphere .
3. IBM assumes that a developer is always working alone and with WSAD .
With these ugly wizards .
Hey IBM , have ever heard of dedicated build servers , automated builds / tests , continous integration , and so on ?
Obviously not .
Building and deploying an EAR from WSAD without WSAD itself is obviosly not what IBM want to support .
The possible solutions for those creative ones are :
a ) rewrite the build process with ANT or
b ) use that freaking ' headless WSAD ' build ... oh yes you'd then need one more WSAD license for build server as well
4. XMI format for IBM - specific extensions is not documented .
I have to use that thing , WSAD , you know , just to make things like transaction attributes of datasources look properly in XMI .
5. Logging of error messages .
That 's a plague that comes over absolutely all IBM products , from OS / 390 and OS / 400 till WebSphere .
If a JACL script fails , it says something very informative like ' a quote is missing ' .
No line number , though .
Go figure .
If there are incorrect user rights on one of WAS directories , the error message is so vague that surely only IBM consultant can find the cause .
I do n't want even start on classloaders and so on ... obviously you at IBM rarely test with more than one application on the server .
* * *
At this moment , I 'd _never_ would use WebSphere as an application server , unless the customer wants me to .
But the big accounts seem to like IBM and they buy everything IBM sells .
Today IBM sells J2EE and Struts , they buy J2EE and Struts .
Tomorrow IBM will sell Spring and AJAX , they 'll buy it as happily as they can - for no one can be fired for buying IBM .

To me BEA is not any faster when it comes to deployment .
Perhaps its even slower .

A one - minute deployment is lightning fast .
I have to use a really bad B2B / SOA product where deployments take from 30 minutes to 2 hours on dev , test , and prod .
It also has a space leak so deployments get slower and slower as the OS starts thrashing once the server needs more than 1 or 2 GB of memory .
You have to undeploy , and delete all your apps to clean up and lose all the configuration which takes hours to setup and save .
Sorry to get off topic but I do n't feel sorry for people complaining about one minute start - up times .
In any event , back in the good old days I was involved in an evaluation of J2EE app servers and BEA was a joy to use over our SilverStream / Novell piece of crap .
Gotta love hot - deployments for development .
Even JBoss was n't too painful , despite the lack uof usable documentation .
Actually , you could use the BEA documentation to help with JBoss .
The guy doing the evalaution for WebSphere was pulling his hair out and cursing all day long .
Actually , they tried to make me use WSAD on my current job , even though we do n't do J2EE on this team , and I 've decided they should just drop the ' W ' and call it SAD .
ANGRY would be a better name , but SAD 's good enough .
I finally just downloaded Eclipse .
It 's funny how much better the OS project made it .
Still has that dumb-ass problem where a non-perfect close destroys your workspace though .
I hear the newer version of SAD is better but I 'm ' once bitten , twice shy ' , if you 'll forgive the cliche .

Actually , they tried to make me use WSAD on my current job , even though we do n't do J2EE on this team , and I 've decided they should just drop the ' W ' and call it SAD .
ANGRY would be a better name , but SAD 's good enough .
I finally just downloaded Eclipse .
It 's funny how much better the OS project made it .
Still has that dumb-ass problem where a non-perfect close destroys your workspace though .
I hear the newer version of SAD is better but I 'm ' once bitten , twice shy ' , if you 'll forgive the cliche .
Anyway , I digress .

in response to Timur Evdokimov 1 .
Deployment process is made unnecessary heavy .
To stop - undeploy - deploy - start an application , it takes about a minute , compared to a few seconds on almost any other J2EE server .
Agreed .
It 's only that it takes 15 minutes for our dedicated box to perform the task , not 1 minute ;)
>>> 2 . WebSphere config repository breaks on numerous occasions ( e.g. when someone using web console while JACL script is running ) .
The application is there in list but it can't be uninstalled , because it 's not installed .
No it can't be installed either , because it 's there in list .
" Childish " WAS problems .
A rule of thumb in my department is to _never_ ever use the WAS admin console of the build server .
It 's a one - time administrative task performed during setup and nothing else .
>>> 3. IBM assumes that a developer is always working alone and with WSAD .
Absolutely :) )
And they are naive to really believe in benefits it provides .
Our customer forced use to use WSAD at first ( and drop the favourite IDEA ) .
I will just quote on of the post I saw here on the site : " PRODUCTIVITY DISASTER " .
Luckily , we have built enough trust over 1 year to let us use the tools _we_ consider productive .
Now , IDEA +
Ant + CruiseControl , and nobody can match that speed on customer 's side .
Much closer to a " rapid " development , if its applicable to WAS at all .
>>> 4. XMI format for IBM - specific extensions is not documented .
I have to use that thing , WSAD , you know , just to make things like transaction attributes of datasources look properly in XMI .
That one is really astonishingly stupid on their side .
Even their official InfoCenter docs tell you to use WSAD for these kind of things .
TIP : they use the XML ID fields , so if you rename those senseless numeric timestamp values to _your_ values ( say , meaningful strings and names ) , you can match them in EAR descriptors and IBM XMI binding files .
I did that to automatically map bind application users to the ones specified in a custom auth provider for WAS .
>>> 5 . Logging of error messages .
That 's a plague that comes over absolutely all IBM products
Oracle takes the same route , so we have a trend here :)

in response to Timur Evdokimov I can take a stab at some of your complaints with our experience RE : WAS 5 , we are about to migrate to WAS 6
1 . You do n't need to stop , uninstall install restart to deploy your app you can use the update command , to refresh an ear , although expecting it to update in seconds is optimistic .
Of course this will only be valid as long as the binding info ( groups to roles , db etc ) has not changed , in which case you will have to uninstall and reinstall your app .
Alas I think the JBOSS publishing to a folder hot deploy mechanism is and will remain just a dream .
We do this update thru a jacl script
2 . Yes , we 've seen this and worse .
In one case the jacl script manage to corrupt the entire repository .
This was tracked down to a bug and the apporiate fixpack was applied .
3. IBM push headless ant with WSAD , IMHO it is not necessary .
I agree that developers should not be triggering builds and deploys from their local machines or sacrificing a licence , a wonderful change control process which would give our admins a fit .
WAS ( Server ) includes a special version of ant ( WS_ANT ) which allows you to link of to some specialized ant tasks to do the EJB deploy and publish , if anyone has gotten JSP compile to work i'd love to hear from you .
So you can constuct a build script and run it on a build server ( although this must have the WAS libs and tools ) .
4 . Yup , I agree and you wonder why 3rd party tools like xdoclet are always a version or 2 behind for deployment descriptors ..... and also why you need to develop with RAD or WSAD .....
5 . Yup , jacl is the pits ..... and error messages are always especially helpful ( NOT ) .
Although you now have the option of JYTHON as of 5.1 , not that it probably matters .
Classloaders do n't get me started ...... a constant never ending battle .

I think this what frustrates a lot of people who use WebSphere .
In websphere 6.0 , they now have a separate tool that you have to run in order to get hot deployment .
But it is still bad and require wierd ass configuration .
Why a seperate tool ?
In Jboss , you just dump a ear file or a sar file and you 're off and running .
No such luck with Websphere .
It is just like their other products such as lotus notes and clearcase : big , memory hog and a lot of annoying things that makes the user 's life difficult .
It took until version WAS 5.1 until our product was stable .
We made the mistake of using too many J2EE components .
And yes , at our company we have websphere because of management .
I 've been in this field for some years now and I have never heard a positive comment about Websphere .
Nice fact : to install Websphere 6.0 you need 2.2 Gig .
The developer studio : 1.8 Gig .

in response to huc muc I am not a big WebSphere fan ( using it since version 3.0 ) but it is not as bad as people make it in this thread .
My experience is that WebSphere is not a good choise for development ( especially if your are not using WSAD or RAD ) because startup time , ( re - ) deployment takes to long and the configuration part is too complicated .
In many projects we are using Tomcat or JBoss ( depending if we needed EJB or not ) in development and WebSphere in production .
WebSphere in production is a good choice because of a professional support ( that is even cheaper than JBoss support ) and a good manageability of big clusters and lots of servers .
( Deployment Manager )
And if you look at monitoring tools a lot of vendors support just WebSphere and Weblogic ...

you don`t think it 's risky to do development on a completely different platform than you run on in production ?
I assume you go through a prod - like test environment before deploying to production .

in response to Kapil Israni Wonder if you guys are speaking from " really real " experience's .
No I work at home with it because i like it so much , common man is that all you can say about it .
How real is real to you ?
If I am working on a team with 4 other people i have no right to say anything because i am not real .
I worked for banks only the last couple of years , is that real enough ?
And I can tell you that only the board still believes in IBM , if you lose them your gone man .
I take any chance I get to convince 'm to dump it forever .
some reason 's why .
- No console output in debug mode
- stacktrace elements not clickable anymore
- server starts in debug mode if you want to just start it .
- servers just starts in non debug mode if you want to debug ( there is unfortuannaly no pattern in this , just random )
- Dont ever remove or rename anything , you will spend hours on cleaning garbage .
- struts editor cannot save files .
IDE says it is saved , close file , open file again , changes lost .
- stacktraces from yesterday pop up making you think something is wrong now .
- stopping the server takes minutes ??? , starting it up also .
- custom tag assist sometimes works .
- html assist sometimes works .
- html assist ( if works ) totally ***** up indentation of the whole page .
- the server hangs for minutes several times a day .
- j9 can not run in debug mode with crashing .
- do n't get me started about clearcase that comes with it .
I could go on for a while .
If i would deliver like that i am out of a job real fast .
Ibm used to have my sympathie because of eclipse and other open source initiatives but that is fading quickly now .
They seem to be intersted in marketing only these days .
Just sell the blue boxes to big companies letting us work with it .
Well i'am not going to work with it anymore after i finish my current job , I ' am going to explicitly look for non-ibm jobs .
It - Market is to good these days to just take anything that comes along .
And then you will never hear from me again .

in response to Dennis Bekkering RADv6.0 and its initial fixpacks 6.0.0.1 etc , all use a quite old version of the IBM JVM to run under .
This JVM had issues such as throwing GPF faults from the J9 JIT during debugging .
The RADv6.0.1 update upgrades the JVM to a more recent version which fixes some of the instability issues .
One of the biggest problems with RAD is its resource usage .
I run with 1GB of RAM and that is pretty tight .
I cannot ran too many other applications at the same time .
2GB is recommended .
Part of this is due to memory leaks in areas such as the JSP editor .
I have seen the memory used leap from 196MB to 600 MB after editing a couple of JSPs .
Using Open With ...=> Text Editor helps this issue .
As for WASv6 , I have found it to be pretty solid .
Certainly a lot better than the previous releases .

in response to Chris James I have been following this post after I added my brutal comment .
There are 17 explicitly negative comments and 4 rather poistive .
Are Matt and Kapil still there , do you learn anything from this or are you just offended ?
What have you got to say about this apart from calling me a basher or not " really real " .
If I add a nice diplomatic comment about how hard it is to work with IBM software then that would not reach you at all .
I am brutal because it is the only way to get through , do something about it please .
The stuff works for 98 % but that last 2 % gives a lot of people a really hard time .
Either you do n't take / get the time or you are not up for it .
I believe it is the first rather then the latter .

in response to Dennis Bekkering I , for one , am no lover of IBM ( I 've had my own share of frustration ) , but I have to say that I 'm impressed with RAD / RSA and WebSphere for the kind of work I do in large organizations ( banks , insurance ) which require a lot of integration .
By the way , I disagree with the comment about WAS 3.5 to 5.1 migration .
I 've recently completed a project to migrate all of an insurance companies apps from 3.5 to 5.1 and they migrated without any code changes at all !!
Only had to repackage the WAR file to be compliant .

in response to Kapil Israni 1 .
My company is one of the first customer who bought the entire suite of IBM New product line based on SOA .
So far not even a single day we have gone home with peace of mind .
2 . You talk about any thing from RSA , RAD6.0 , WID60,6.0.1 , ProcessServer 6.0,6.0.1 .
None of these would install properly on windows server or professional editions after applying all the service packs on the OS and also the latest fix patches on the products .
3 . None of these will successfully install test environment properly .
No proper customer support .
WE have lost all the UML Models developed on RSA when we applied the fix patch of 6.0.1 .
4 . No body at IBM is bothered about the known issues list and we have even raised a ticket , but its of no use .
5 . HOw can a product fix pack does not have a backward compatibility .
we have sent the .emx files to IBM , but still they could not find .
6 . RSA is supposed to be supporting UML 2 version , where as we are not finding many notations in the activity diagrams and Sequence Diagrams .
7 . Latest suite of websphere does not support EJB 3.0 which is already an year old .
8 . It also does not support struts 2.0 . but we can do a work around for this .
I think i have mentioned enough issues to say the product is not well tested .
IBM thinks that and can sell any product to their clients like us .

in response to Chris Johnson I really hate IBMWebsphere .
Why ?
for a simple deployment of an ear file into the server , without using RAD , I was supposed to write a build file which does that .
In weblogic the ant tasks provided by the server is smooth like silk and the deployment happened in secs .
BUT for the past 4 - 5 days , I am still trying to figure out which monkey will make this work on websphere 6 .
I came to know that there is a task but the documentation is so less on net , and ofcourse the IBM Red yellow green books .... i dont know whether they know how to writ documents ... I am still figuring out .
One thing is for sure .... IBM makes products COMPLEX so that THEIR PERSONNEL ( pseudo consultants ) can only decrypt the CIPHER in it planted by themselves .....
I am really feeling like kicking this app server out of business .
Just imagine I had to include ejb stubs separately as it was getting called from a POJO and the ejb was in a different ear .
I am using Jbuilder 2006 , and JBUILDER is perhaps the best IDE in market today better than IntelliJ .
Even their product eclipse .... is what i believe to overshadow the good job done by SUN Microsystems .
SUN - eclipsed ... get the idea .
Never make their own product ..
They brought Rational .... IBM keeps on buying companies ... HA HA ...
Actually IBM is ... International Bullying Machines ....
I hope that really help the suckers ...

in response to Nate Borg Your short tag line for WebSphere Everyplace Deployment is a little miss leading , WED is a product built ontop of Eclipse RCP that extends the SOA programming model and J2EE APIs to the desktop .
It allows Smart Client applications to be developed and for them to be integrate into an SOA infrastructure using WebServices and Messaging etc .
It can also be used to offer an integration point at the glass using Eclipseo mix , SWT , Swing , Browser and ActiveX application all within one user experience .
The WED client will be released on Windows and Linux operating systems .
It also includes a server component that runs ontop of WebSphere that allows application to be deployed out to large number of client desktops .
Not sure where you got the monitoring bit , may just have been a cut and paste issue .

in response to Matthew Perrins Good to see the IBM bashers are out early on this post !!
Actually it was late in my case as I 'm in old Europe :-)
But anyway , I do n't consider myself an IBM basher at all and I posted my conspiracy theory solely as a joke .
As was predictable , other theories popped up afterwards and their authors seem dead serious about them .
But these theories sound rather naive about the way large organizations work .
Do people really believe that there are big secret meetings among IBM 's top software honchos with agenda : " How to make our products even more complex so that we make a fortune on consulting " ?
Mmmmm ...
I think a more reasonable explanation is that IBM , as a huge company selling everything from hardware to software and services to countless other huge companies has to cover requirements that go all over the map .
They have an applications portfolio made of thousands of products with various origins , many of which came through acquisitions .
And somehow they must unify all of that into a cohesive , all - embracing platform and vision .
Given the complexity of the problem , it 's somewhat miraculous that they manage so well .
But the downside is that , from the perspective of a single customer , making sense of that behemoth platform , using some parts of it and keeping somewhat up to date with them takes vast resources .
Large system integrators ( among which IBM G.S. ) thrive on this complexity and are usually keen on dragging the customer ever further on the complexity path because this will tighten their control on the customer and lead to future budgets .
SOA is widely publicized as a way to " simplify " IT but as I said yesterday , the jury 's still out on that one !
People 's interest in so - called " lightweight " solutions such as Spring / Hibernate / Tomcat / Axis /etc is quite often , in my humble experience , a consequence of being burned by the complexity of more mainstream , vendor - approved solutions .
But are these lightweight thingies going to make that much difference in the long run ?
Again , the jury 's still out , but I 'd say it will only be incremental improvements .
For more profound changes , we shall need something radically different from all this J2EE " legacy " stuff :-)

And products like WSAD are not that bad .
I know many developers out there who were not able to develop webservices without it .
This doesnt necessarily mean that the developer is incompetent but perhaps he has a different focus .
It really depends on the target audience .
We , as we write here on TSS , are not the average developers .
The typical developer working in big companies hardly knows TSS , nor does he consume the latest and greatest open source frameworks .
Talk about Spring at companies like Vodafone or DaimlerCrysler , you will need some time to meet someone who has experience with it ( if you find one at all ) .
But one thing is for sure .
Application Servers nowadays are monsters .
And when you look at all these specs they have to implement ( plus the ones which they add as value add like SOA things ) , its no surprise that deployment takes plenty of minutes ( the one minute complaint was a joke wasnt it ?
We have about 5 minutes minimum deployment time here ) .
As someone allready said , one should really carefully judge if its necessary to use all the bells and whistles .
Currently i am working for one of the biggest telcos in the world and even here , there are scenarios where we could live quite happily without the full J2EE stack , and i speak about a CRM system with some traffic .

Alain is correct .
Its ridicolous to think that the websphere unit is creating websphere with complexity and non-usability in mind to sell ( a ) more boxes and ( b ) more consulting .
At the end , they are competing with BEA , JBoss and even with Tomcat .
And dont forget that IBM is not that small , every unit has its own revenue targets and stuff .
I dont think that the websphere product manager can report to Sam that his product is absolutely useless , but the service unit sold 3 % more consulting days last year .
Its not the way any company that size works .

I agree .
No product manager would ever agree to a strategy of deliberately making a product difficult to use .
The complexity is there because it's both a broad and deep product .
I 've worked in a large company ( 100 K + employees ) .
Different business units work with each other ony up to the point that it makes sense .
The WebSphere product group would not hesitate for a second , for example , to use external resources over internal resources if it that made more more .

I doubt it 's a conscious decision .
I don`t know the real reason .
Incompetence ?
Management interfering with the design to ( " make WSAD a neccesity " ) ?
There are clearly serious deficiencies in the product .
Have they implemented any sort of XDoclet or annotation support yet ?
Given my experience with some consultants lately , I can see them recommending the most complicated and time - draining app server .
I doubt it 's a conscious decision .
I don`t know the real reason .
Incompetence ?
Management interfering with the design to ( " make WSAD a neccesity " ) ?

in response to Alain Rogister < blockquoteI think a more reasonable explanation is that IBM , as a huge company selling everything from hardware to software and services to countless other huge companies has to cover requirements that go all over the map .
They have an applications portfolio made of thousands of products with various origins , many of which came through acquisitions .
And somehow they must unify all of that into a cohesive , all - embracing platform and vision .
Given the complexity of the problem , it 's somewhat miraculous that they manage so well .
I still fail to see what problems like obscure error messages , failing config repository , WSAD as the Only Way of development , and lack of documentation have to do with the reasoning stated above .
What I do see is that the reason IBM does n't care is that it sells not to actual developers ( as , say , IntelliJ does ) , but to top - executives , who never will find themselves in front of WSAD eating their workspace or struggling with cryptic error messages .
Top - executives , on the other hand , do like sentences like " a BPEL engine that coordinates business processes with the new ESB , is built in to provide the messaging backbone " , no matter what it means really .
And remember , no one 's fired for buying IBM ... even if it was WebSphere 3.5 .

What will IBM and BEA do when businesses start realizing the benefits of lighweight containers such as Spring ?
99 % of the applications being developed today DO NOT need the complexities of EJB , etc. that tie them to an application server such as WebSphere or WebLogic .
For those wondering , yes , I have developed my share of EJB's in the past and as a consultant have developed applications for major companies ( American , Verizon , FedEx , Southwest ) , so I do speak from experience .
My advice , take a hard look at what you are really wanting / needing those " heavy " app.
servers for and decide if there is a better way to architect your system .
Do you really need remote deployment of EJB's ?
Do you really need some RAD tool ( provided by the big company ) to handle your web services deployment files ?
I will end by saying that I know the major ( expensive ) app.
servers provide more than just EJB capabilities , but are you really using these services ?
Just recently the IT industry has begun a monumental move towards web servics and SOA , however these app .
servers are not necessary for this type of development either .
Remember , big companies with expensive app.
servers MUST make money for their shareholders , so what do you think they advertise regarding their products : advanced , complex architectures that support the need to buy their products .

Regulars of the Science Weekly podcast will remember our interview with Jo Marchant , the author of Decoding the Heavens .
The book tells the story of the Antikythera mechanism , a mysterious clockwork object made up of numerous meshed cogs that was discovered more than a century ago among the cargo of a Greek shipwreck .
The mystery of how the Greeks had made a machine that appeared to be 1800 years ahead of its time and why that knowledge was seemingly lost is fascinating , but Marchant 's story is really about the scientists and engineers who have fallen under the spell of the Antikythera mechanism over the last century .
It is a gripping tale of scientific obsession , rivalry and skulduggery .
If there is one thing that lets the book down , it lacks clear diagrams of how the cogs fitted together and hence how the mechanism worked .
This video makes up for that .
It shows Michael Wright 's working model of the Antikythera mechanism .
I defy you not to be amazed .
A British computer expert hacked into US military networks through " naivety " as a result of his Asperger 's Syndrome and should not be considered a criminal , an expert said today .
Gary McKinnon , 42 , is fighting extradition to the US , where he faces up to 70 years in prison if he is found guilty of gaining access to and damaging 97 American Navy , Army , Nasa and Pentagon computers .
His supporters held a press conference today to make a desperate plea for him to be prosecuted in the UK on a lesser charge instead .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Cambridge University professor Simon Baron - Cohen , a leading expert on Asperger 's Syndrome , said what Mr McKinnon did was " the activity of somebody with a disability rather than a criminal activity " .
Mr McKinnon , from Wood Green , north London , was only diagnosed with the condition in August last year .
He insists he was looking for evidence of UFOs when he hacked into the US military networks in 2001 and 2002 .
Prof Baron - Cohen said Mr McKinnon 's behaviour was typical of the " social naivety " that is common in people with Asperger 's Syndrome .
He said : " It can bring a sort of tunnel vision so that in their pursuit of the truth they are blind to the potential social consequences for them or for other people . "
The academic added : " There are questions about whether he should be imprisoned at all because someone with Asperger 's Syndrome will find it very difficult to tolerate a prison environment .
" If , as I believe , the crime was committed through naivety and through an obsession - in this case with computers and trying to find information - without any intent to deceive , without any attempt to hide what he was doing , we should be thinking about this as the activity of somebody with a disability rather than a criminal activity .

Prof Baron - Cohen said Mr McKinnon " believed that what he was doing was right " when he hacked into the computers because he was trying to uncover the truth .
Asperger 's Syndrome is a form of autism .
Sufferers often struggle to communicate with other people and can develop obsessive interests .
Mark Lever , chief executive of the National Autistic Society , said : " We are calling for urgent action to stop this extradition and allow him to stand trial in the UK . "
Mr McKinnon 's solicitor , Karen Todner , said she had written to Foreign Secretary David Miliband asking him to appeal to George Bush to pardon her client in his final days as US president .
She has also written to Keir Starmer QC , the new director of public prosecutions , inviting him to bring charges against Mr McKinnon in the UK .
Ms Todner enclosed a statement from Mr McKinnon accepting that his hacking constituted an offence under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 .
An application for permission for a judicial review of the proposed extradition will be heard at the High Court on Tuesday .
Ms Todner said : " If this fails , it will be likely that Gary will be on a plane within days with no guarantee he will ever return . "
The US military alleges that Mr McKinnon caused 800,000 dollars - worth ( £ 532,500 ) of damage and left 300 computers at a US Navy weapons station unusable immediately after the September 11 2001 terror attacks .
He is accused of hacking into 53 US Army computers and 26 US Navy computers , including those at US Naval Weapons Station Earle in New Jersey , which is responsible for replenishing munitions and supplies for the Atlantic fleet .
He is also accused of hacking into 16 Nasa computers , one US Department of Defence computer and one machine belonging to the US Air Force .
Mr McKinnon was caught in 2002 as he tried to download a grainy black and white photograph which he believed was an alien spacecraft from a Nasa computer housed in the Johnson Space Centre in Houston , Texas .
He was easily traced by the authorities because he used his own email address .
Mr McKinnon said he believed he would get a fairer trial in the UK .
He told the press conference in central London the strain of his situation was getting to him .
" I'm on beta - blockers at the moment , I 'm extremely stressed , " he said .
" I am very controlled , which is probably not a good thing , but inside the fires of hell are burning .
It 's not a good pace to be . "
Dec. 16 , 2008  --
A drifter who died in prison 12 years ago was responsible for the 1981 abduction and murder of Adam Walsh , bringing to an end one of the country 's most famous cold cases , police in Florida announced today .
The six - year - old son of " America 's Most Wanted " host John Walsh went missing from a Hollywood , Fla. , mall more than 27 years ago .
His head was discovered two weeks later , though his body was never found .
Hollywood , Fla. , police named Ottis Toole , a convicted killer long suspected of the Walsh murder , who died in prison in 1996 , as the perpetrator .
" For 27 years we 've been asking who could take a six - year - old boy and murder him and decapitate him ?
Who ?
We needed to know , " said John Walsh , as tears streamed down his face .
" And today we know .
The not knowing has been a torture but that journey is over . "
Hollywood Police Chief Chadwick Wagner apologized to the Walshes for mistakes that he said were made early on in the investigation , before he became police chief , saying there was enough evidence against Toole to charge him before his death .
Wagner said there was no new evidence against
Toole that made police name him as the killer , but that there was a " vast amount " of circumstantial evidence .
" If Ottis Toole were alive today , he would be arrested for the abduction and murder of Adam Walsh , " he said .
" What was there was everything that was in front of our face for years , " he said .
" This case could have been closed years ago . "
From Ordinary Father to ' America 's Most Wanted '
The murder transformed John Walsh 's life , turning him from a middle - class hotel marketing executive into one of country 's best known advocates for missing children .
" The not knowing is almost as bad as the murder but today 's a good day .
Today 's a wonderful day , " Walsh said today .
" We can end the chapter of our lives .
For all other victims who have n't gotten justice , I say one thing , do n't give up hope .
Do n't give up hope . "
After his son's death , Walsh , who will turn 63 later this month , became a tireless advocate for missing children .
He started the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center and co-founded the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .
His television show , " America 's Most Wanted , " debuted in 1988 .
Since 1984 , the center has assisted law enforcement with more than 148,160 missing child cases , resulting in the recovery of more than 132,300 children .
" America 's Most Wanted " went on to become one of the country 's longest - running television shows .
It began profiling missing persons , especially children , in 1991 .
It was briefly canceled in 1996 , but reappeared after a public outcry .
The show says its reports have led to the capture of more than 1,000 fugitives .
" We were absolutely devastated , heartbroken , " Walsh told Larry King on the 25th anniversary of his son 's abduction .
" We had nothing in common but the anger and the grief .
And [ Walsh 's wife , Reve ] said , ' You know , we 're destroying ourselves .
This is not something that Adam would want .
We 've forgotten who the real victim is . ' "
The Walshes lobbied for the Missing Children Act , which was passed in 1982 and set up an FBI database of missing children .
In 2006 , President Bush signed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act , which , among other things , created more stringent requirements for sex offender registration .
Adam Walsh's Mysterious Disappearance
On July 27 , 1981 , Reve Walsh went with her son to the Sears department store in the Hollywood mall .
She left him in the toy department playing video games .
When she returned a few minutes later , he was gone .
They never saw each other again .
Toole : Adam Walsh's Killer
The police , without the benefit of the missing children search tools that Walsh would later champion and modern tracking systems , were overwhelmed .
" Leads are coming in and nobody 's looking at them .
And people are throwing them around .
And I , I saw one on a napkin , I saw one here , I said , you know , there 's no organization , " Joe Matthews , a Miami Beach homicide detective , told ABC's Primetime in 2007 .
The names of numerous possible suspects have been advanced over the years , including Jeffrey Dahmer .
Toole , a serial killer who was in prison for an unrelated murder , twice admitted to killing Adam , but recanted both times .
Toole , the partner of notorious serial killer Henry Lee Lucas , reportedly confessed to committing dozens of murders , though many of those claims later proved to be false .
Police were unable to find Walsh 's body in the area where Toole said it was located .
During his first confession , in 1983 , Toole reportedly said he used a machete to cut off Adam 's head .
Police recovered a bloody piece of carpeting from Toole 's car , but with no sophisticated DNA testing available at the time , police could never determine if it contained Adam Walsh 's blood .
The carpeting later disappeared .
Documents released Tuesday show that detectives who reexamined the case in 1996 located several people who were at the Hollywood mall on the day Walsh was abducted but who had not been shown a photo lineup during the original investigation .
Several of those witnesses said they saw Toole at the mall ; one witness said he had seen Toole talking to Walsh , the documents say .
ABC News ' Jason Ryan and Geoff Martz contributed to this report .
From So Humble Beginnings ...
Arthur Blessitt — who is famous for carrying a large wooden cross through every nation , traveling around the Earth 1 ½ times — devised a plan to launch a small cross made from his large one , along with a copy of the Bible on microfilm and two Jesus stickers , into a polar orbit so that it would pass over the heads of every person on the planet .
He planned to accomplish this by piggy - backing on an orbital burial service offered through the private company Celestis , which sold space in small capsules for the cremated remains of people who presumably have chosen to not take part in the Rapture .
These " cremain " capsules were then packed together in a satellite and launched aboard a private rocket .
Blessitt purchased space in one of these capsules for his cross .
On August 3 , 2008 , the Falcon 1 rocket operated by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation ( SpaceX ) carrying Blessitt 's cross was successfully launched but failed to reach orbit , causing the loss of all payloads , including the cross .
On his site , Blessitt expressed optimism over this partial success , saying : " However the cross from the cross I 've carried around the world did go up 134 miles !
Glory ! "
As of this writing he is waiting for more information from Space Services Inc. , parent company of Celestis , on whether there will be another attempt on which he can again piggy - back .
When the MSM ( Mainstream Secular Media ) reported on Falcon 1's failure , they focused on the loss of the cremated remains of James Doohan , an actor who played " Scotty " on the Secular TV show Star Trek , rather than Blessitt 's more important payload .
In fact , the Media did n't report on the cross payload at all , either before or after the failed orbital delivery .
Besides general anti-Christian bias in the MSM that would incline them to ignore this important witnessing mission , I think part of the problem here stems from Blessitt 's much too humble vision for the orbital cross .
( Please understand , this is no real criticism of Blessitt himself .
He is , after all , a humble man of humble means who could not afford to place a cross into orbit other than through his piggy - back plan .
Also , his plan holds a very personal meaning to himself as his orbital cross was made from the burden that he carried for 40 years in emulation of our Lord . )
Had the cross made it to orbit , being that it was only a couple of inches tall and inside a capsule inside a satellite , it would have been unseeable and would not have impressed the few unsaved people aware of it , much less the billions who would never have known it was there .
In order to really get the unsaved world 's attention , an orbital cross project must be on a grander scale — one that , even in failure , would demand acknowledgement ( and would open the door for witnessing ) .
Therefore , I propose that Blessitt 's plan be expanded and enlarged into a truly monumental project that I call Orbital Cross Alpha ( OCA ) .
Orbital Cross Alpha : A Bolder Vision
I propose launching into polar orbit a cross of significant dimensions , with a sun-reflecting surface that will be easily visible in the night sky to the naked eyes of unbelievers .
This space - age testimonial will fly over Communist China , Mussulmanned Saudi Arabia , Hindooed India , Godless France , and all other nations in need of the simple yet profound message of Christ 's sacrifice and His offer of Salvation .
All the people of the world will see it shine , like a beacon of hope on the runway of the aircraft carrier of the night sky , an omnipresent reminder of the Lordship of Jesus over our world .
Unlike Mr. Blessitt 's plan , mine will require a more elaborate cross design and access to more costly launch services , as it would necessarily require multiple single - payload launches .
Fortunately I feel that my connections within the Department of Defense will help bring this plan to fruition .
Orbital Cross Alpha Design :
Potential design of Orbital Cross Alpha , with approaching Space Shuttle .
Potential design of Orbital Cross Alpha , with approaching Space Shuttle .
In order to be viewable and identifiable as a cross to the naked eye , my calculations show that OCA will need to be at least 1000 feet along its main axis and 500 feet along the perpendicular , and placed into Medium Earth Orbit ( between 1,243 and 22,236 miles ; dimensions will need to be increased for visibility at higher orbits ) .
By being at MEO , it will be high enough to catch and reflect the Sun 's light throughout the entire night .
To achieve this great size while minimizing costs and enabling the parts to fit inside a minimum number of launch vehicles , its surface will be constructed of collapsible panels applying the same technology used to deploy solar arrays on satellites or space stations .
A skeletal framework will be first assembled in a lower orbit from expandable sections delivered by rocket .
This will require EVAs by astronaut technicians , who will arive at the construction site via shuttle , using the ISS as a base of operation .
After the skeleton is finished , a series of collapsible panels will be attached to it , as will booster rockets that will deliver it to its final position in MEO .
Once there , the panels will be unfurled to produce the final , brilliant surface .
The panels will serve a dual purpose of both reflecting sunlight to the Earth and acting as solar power generators for the onboard systems .
Due to the large surface area and minimum energy needs , only a handful of the panels will need to be photovoltaic , the rest can be purely reflective ( or alternately , photovoltaic elements can be sparsely placed over all the panels , whichever the engineers decide to be most efficient ) .
The electrical systems will include computer and control systems necessary for repositioning the cross should it need to avoid orbital debris , and also to realign it so as to aim its reflected glory at target nations during times of spiritual warfare .
( Imagine , if you will , a pitched battle between our brave forces and the Islamofascists , when , seemingly out of nowhere , a giant reflection of a cross sweeps across the battlefield .
At that moment of revelation the Islamofascists will see the error of their ways , drop their arms , and surrender — not to Islam , but to Christ !
Bloodshed averted and new souls won .
Such will be the power of Orbital Cross Alpha . )
Excess power could be used to run a communications package that would broadcast patriotic hymns and inspirational sermons 24/ 7 in multiple languages , receivable with a simple radio , providing additional information to the unsaved who see the cross in their sky and want to learn more about our Lord .
Putting OCA into Orbit :
An Air Force Delta rocket launches into space .
A Similar vehicle could deliver a payload of Good News to the world .
An Air Force Delta rocket launches into space .
A Similar vehicle could deliver a payload of Good News to the world .
As stated , getting the parts into orbit for assembly will require multiple , dedicated launches .
There are a number of options available , but most can be ruled out : we will not use NASA , as they are infested with Darwinists vehemently opposed to any program that would acknowledge God 's creation ; foreign launch services are out of the question , as they might employ anti-Christian subcontractors who would seek to sabotage the mission ( perhaps by slyly substituting American measurements with their queer metricisms so that the parts of the cross do not fit together properly — or worse , end up forming the Mussulman 's crescent ) ; private payload launch companies , such as SpaceX , are not as far along in their technology and have a poor success rate ; and Blackwater 's Aerospace Force , although promising , is unfortunately still in its infancy .
I believe that the best option — the only option that makes sense , really — is to use the launch vehicles maintained by the US Air Force .
Unlike NASA , the USAF is solidly committed to the mandate of Christianity .
With both Air Force Space Command ( AFSPC ) and the Air Force Academy located within the sphere of influence of numerous Christian outreach organizations in Colorado Springs , we can be sure that the OCA program will be made Priority One .
We have been bringing up Air Force cadets with strong training in Evangelism for precisely this sort of mission ; now is the time for them to show what a fully Christianized Air Force can accomplish .
While most in the civilian sector are unaware of this ( in no small part due to national security concerns , ) the Air Force has a space program that is larger than that of NASA .
AFSPC has at its disposal spacelift vehicles more than capable for a mission such as OCA , including Atlas and Delta platforms .
They also have the experience to assure mission success , having launched hundreds of satellites and other more sensitive payloads over the decades ( the Air Force 's Delta rockets have an impressive 95 % success rate ) .
Furthermore , for the EVA missions needed to complete OCA assembly , what better occasion than the construction of an orbital cross to finally officially reveal the existence of the military - grade space shuttles — smaller and more agile than their cumbersome civilian counterparts — that AFSPC has been flying since the early '90s .
Air Force Shuttle Providence could not have been more providentially named .
Funding :
Some may argue that this is not something the Defense Department should be involved with , that with our current war stance and multi- theater global operations to fight Terror and spread freedom we should not be spending taxpayer money on such a thing .
To these people I say :
You could not be more wrong .
Orbital Cross Alpha will be an integral part of our campaign to win the hearts and souls of the unsaved people who are at risk , through their ignorance of the Gospel , of becoming terrorists , and is therefore necessary for our national defense and to win the War on Terror .
The more would - be terrorists we can convert into peaceful Christians , the less there will be to threaten our nation and our families , and the more allies we will have in our crusade .
As the old boot - camp chant goes : " No Jesus , no peace ; Know Jesus , know peace . "
And what better way to let everyone know Jesus than to put His sacrifice on display in the Heavens for all to see — and where Islamofascist and Secularist regimes can't hide it from their cowed citizenry .
We will secure peace by securing a place for Jesus in the night sky .
Therefore , it is imperative that funding for OCA should be added to the DoD 's counterterrorism and psyops budget .
Besides using Defense funds , Orbital Cross Alpha should also be funded out of NASA 's budget .
President Bush has already started the process of moving our nation away from NASA 's Darwinistic space program — which seeks to prove the Godless " Big Bang " and laughable " microbes to Marsmen " theories — towards a program based on righteous Interplanetary Manifest Destiny .
The planned bases on the Moon and Mars are important for the future conquest of our solar system , but we have no real need for space telescopes and the like .
After all , anything we need to know about the extrasolar Heavens can be discovered via Biblical exegetics .
If not being diverted to our Moon and Mars base missions , funds used for these pointlessly unbiblical , and socially unhealthy , programs would be better spent on a giant orbital cross .
And if we must , we can always slap a zooming camera on the back of it and call it a " space telescope platform " to appease the foolish interests of the star - obsessed unbelievers at NASA .
Conclusions :
The goal of an orbital cross is attainable ; we have the technology , the vision , and the faith to do it .
It is only a matter of our Christian leadership seizing the initiative and making it so .
I will not lie to you and say it will be easy or cheap , but the one thing that it will be is necessary .
Islam is the fastest growing religion on the planet , followed only by the nihilism of Secularism .
The Satanic forces of anti-Christianism are mustering on the horizon , planning their siege of this stronghold of Faith , America .
Of course , we cannot lose this war , for God is on our side and has foretold our victory , but that is no excuse for laziness .
This is the End Times , people !
It will happen only once .
This is what we will be talking about for the rest of eternity , so lets not embarrass ourselves with a slapdash effort .
We must make our stand in this epic battle for the souls of Mankind and we must make our stand one that will shock and awe our enemy .
Orbital Cross Alpha will be both shocking and awesome .
Update - 8/27/2009 :
I am happy to report that my call for Christian manifest destiny in space has emboldened others to launch the Great Commission into orbit .
The Cross on the Moon Foundation ( COM ) is a newly formed , non-profit organization dedicated to advocate , design , and implement the placement of a Christian Cross on the surface of Earth 's Moon in 2011 .
Besides setting their goals on the Moon instead of Medium Earth Orbit , their plan differs from mine in that they will acquire passage for the Cross aboard a private spacecraft .
As of this writing they are still developing the details of the Lunar Cross -- two leading candidates include a gold plated one that would be visible from a live HD video feed and one formed from a constellation of reflective targets that would be illuminated by earthbound lasers to make it visible to the naked eye -- and the transfer mechanism they will use to plant it into the Moon 's surface .
I do not see their plan as a competitor to my own .
Rather , it will be one of the many Crosses that will fill the Heavens to proclaim the Glory of our Lord to all spacefarers of the future .
We need Crosses not only in MEO and on the Moon , but on every planet , satellite ( natural or otherwise ) , asteroid , space station , and Lagrange point in our Solar System .
No quadrant of our system should be left bereft of the sign of His Sacrifice .
Therefore , I welcome COM 's participation in this , Mankind 's greatest pre-Rapture adventure .
Also , given that our current non-Christian Commander in Chief does not share in our common creed and consequently will hinder military involvement in Witnessing Missions such as I propose , COM might represent our best opportunity to place a Cross in the heavens before we retake the government in 2012 .
But fear not ; my contacts in the Palin camp confirm that she will be solidly behind OCA when the time comes .
Mike Griffith cited Guitar Hero as a sign of the influence of gaming Video games are poised to " eclipse " all other forms of entertainment , according to games studio boss Mike Griffith .
The Activision chief made the bold call during a keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
He said video games were prospering as interest in almost every other category of entertainment declines .
Mr Griffith said social gaming , more interactivity and better technology would help gaming dominate the entertainment landscape in future .
He said : " Movies , recorded music and TV - these are all stagnating or contracting entertainment sectors . "
40 % growth
He quoted US market statistics which showed that between 2003 and 2007 sales of movie tickets fell by 6 % ; the number of hours of TV watched dropped by 6 % , sales of recorded music slumped 12 % and purchases of DVDs remained flat .
Over the same four - year period , said Mr Griffith , the video game industry grew by 40 % .
" Video games are poised to eclipse all other forms of entertainment in the decade ahead , " he said .
Gamers will spend longer with James Bond than moviegoers
The success of Guitar Hero , said Mr Griffith , showed how influential gaming had become on many other entertainment sectors .
He quoted Nielsen SoundScan data which showed that artists whose music featured on Guitar Hero had seen a rise in download sales of 15 - 843 % .
The game had proved so popular that some bands , such as Metallica and Aerosmith , were bringing out a version of the game that only features their music .
" Music has a history of evolving through technology and we are at the beginning of the latest chapter in that story , " he said .
Technology , community and interactivity were the three factors that would help the video game industry become the driving force in entertainment , said Mr Griffith .
' Story telling '
The powerful processors in consoles such as the PS3 and Xbox 360 meant that games were getting ever more realistic and immersive , he said .
" Games are no longer pre-set trips through linear mazes , " said Mr Griffith .
" They are becoming a legitimate story - telling medium that rivals feature films . "
He cited the video game of the latest James Bond film Quantum of Solace ( QoS ) as an example of how games were taking over .
Guitar
Hero players are sharing their own musical creations " The moviegoer is passive whereas the gamer is active and part of the game itself , " he said , adding that anyone who played QoS would spend more than 50 hours in the company of James Bond compared to only 106 minutes if they watched the movie .
The communities growing up around titles such as Guitar Hero World Tour also showed how entertainment was changing , he said .
Owners of the game had created 141,000 tracks of their own using its in - built mixing studio and uploaded them to the Guitar Hero community site , which now has more than 600,000 members , he said .
More interactive controllers such as the guitars and drums in Guitar Hero and the Wiimote on Nintendo 's gaming console were also helping encourage more people to take up gaming , said Mr Griffiths .
" Those new controllers are encouraging new ways to become more socially active in gaming , " he said .
" They are bringing in a whole new group of consumers that have never before been involved in gaming . "
He concluded : " The one thing that is for sure is entertainment is changed forever with gaming . "

4 men sought in gang rape of lesbian
Police are offering a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of four men who allegedly kidnapped and gang - raped for nearly an hour a 28 - year - old Richmond woman , who was left naked when they fled in her car .
The crime , which occurred on Dec. 13 , is being investigated as a hate crime because of comments the suspects made about the victim 's sexual orientation , police said .
The woman is openly lesbian and had a rainbow sticker on her license plate , a symbol of gay pride .
" The emotional impact has changed her life , " said Lt. Mark Gagan of the Richmond Police Department .
" It is an absolute nightmare for her to have gone through .
For 45 minutes , four strangers brutalized her . "
The ordeal began around 9:30 p.m. in the 1500 block of Visalia Avenue in Richmond 's Belding - Wood neighborhood , said Gagan .
The woman was sexually assaulted in that location after she got out of her car , police said .
Then she was forced back into her vehicle after the suspects noticed someone approaching .
She was driven seven blocks away to the 1300 block of Burbeck Avenue , where she was repeatedly sexually assaulted near an apartment complex , Gagan said .
After the attack , the men drove off in her car , police said .
She sought help from a nearby resident who called police .
She was taken to a local hospital and treated for her injuries .
Her car was recovered the next day in Richmond .
The attackers are being sought on charges of assault with a deadly weapon , robbery , kidnapping , carjacking and sexual assault .
The charges carry a hate crime enhancement .
Police described the first suspect , believed to be the group leader , as a Latino man in his 30s , who stands 5 feet 6 inches tall , weighs 180 pounds , and has black hair , brown eyes and a mustache .
The second suspect is described as an African American man in his early 20s , about 5 feet 10 inches , 170 pounds with black hair and brown eyes .
He is known by the nickname " Blu , " police said .
The third suspect is described as Latino , 18 to 20 years old , who is nicknamed " Pato . "
The fourth suspect is described only as a Latino man 18 to 20 years old .
" Everybody in our community has an interest in making sure these people are apprehended and brought to justice , " said Gagan .

Montana sank to 39th in the nation in median family income , according to the most recent Census figures  took hold of much of the rest of the state ’s population .

Some residents , in interviews here and in Bozeman , an hour north of Big Sky , said they were not particularly upset about the club ’s plight , given its excesses and presumptions .
But most people also know someone whose fortunes are tied to the financial engines that made this corner of Montana ’s economy go in recent years  wealth , vacation housing and tourism .
“ It ’s kind of like a double - edged sword for a lot of people around here , ” said Greg Thomas , a 31 - year - old construction worker from Bozeman .
“ It ’s pretty grotesque and ridiculous , but at the same time , a lot of people depend on going up there for jobs . ”
Bill Hopkins was more to the point .
“ I can kind of gloat on one hand , but I ’m not really happy about it , ” said Mr. Hopkins , 51 , who works at Yellowstone National Park , just south of here , coordinating volunteer trail maintenance crews .
Mr. Hopkins said he disliked the club ’s environmental footprint  13,500 acres of formerly pristine open - space backcountry , now sealed off and built on .
“ The damage has been done , as far as development there , ” he said , “ so as long as it ’s developed , I ’d just as soon see it operational . ”

Advertisement Bagpuss creator Oliver Postgate has died aged 83 , his family has confirmed .
Postgate , who lived in Kent , created some of the best - loved children 's TV series including Ivor the Engine , the Clangers and Noggin the Nog .
His work , screened on the BBC and ITV from the 1950s to the present day , was often in collaboration with the artist and puppeteer Peter Firmin .
In a poll earlier this year , Bagpuss , a saggy pink cloth cat , was voted the best TV animal of all - time .
Postgate 's partner , Naomi Linnell , confirmed he died at a nursing home near his home in Broadstairs in Kent on Monday .
Oliver said it himself , he was always a little boy
Sandra Kerr , colleague of Oliver Postgate Friend and colleague , Sandra Kerr , has been paying tribute to " a creative and eccentric talent " .
Ms Kerr , the voice of the mice in Bagpuss , said they had so much fun working together , their giggles can be heard on the Bagpuss soundtrack .
Asked where his inspiration came from , she said : " Oliver said it himself , he was always a little boy .
" He and Peter just responded to that part of themselves they had never lost . "
Conservative leader David Cameron told BBC Radio 5 Live that Ivor the Engine was his favourite of Postgate and Firmin 's characters .
" I never really got the Clangers , " he added .
" My wife 's a big Clangers fan - I never quite got that in the same way . "
Oliver Postgate created many much - loved children 's TV programmes Postgate 's work was popular with generations of children who loved the strangeness of the characters and the warmth of his story - telling .
The short animated films , which he would script and narrate , were created by Smallfilms production company , set up with Firmin .
The partners worked in a makeshift studio in a disused cowshed in Kent on a tiny budget often using home - made equipment .
Ivor the Engine , a series for ITV about a little Welsh steam engine who wanted to sing in a choir , was their first creation .
The 1960s BBC series of Noggin the Nog about a baby - faced king of the race of Nogs followed .
The pair swiftly established themselves as reliable purveyors of children 's entertainment , in the days when there were just two channels and children 's television occupied a privileged teatime slot .
' Praise and encouragement '
Describing the commissioning process , Postgate said : " We would go to the BBC once a year , show them the films we 'd made , and they would say , ' Yes , lovely , now what are you going to do next ? ' "
HAVE YOUR SAY Oliver Postgate 's work was a big part of my childhood .
Noggin the Nog , The Clangers , brilliant , inspired stuff Ian Barker , Bolton " We would tell them , and they would say , ' That sounds fine , we 'll mark it in for 18 months from now ' , and we would be given praise and encouragement and some money in advance , and we 'd just go away and do it . "
Only 13 episodes of Bagpuss were made in 1974 , but were regularly repeated until 1987 .
London - born Postgate made his last film in 1987 , complaining that children 's television commissioners were no longer interested in what he had to offer .
In October this year , the rights to many of his characters were bought by company Coolbai , which said it planned to introduce Bagpuss to a new generation .

The New Year 's Day shooting death of Oscar Grant on an Oakland BART platform has been electronically re-enacted hundreds of thousands of times as videos of the incident are broadcast on television and spread over the Internet .
The videos now could play a critical role in the investigation into the shooting of Grant , 22 , by BART police Officer Johannes Mehserle , 27 .
Three videos made public so far show Grant 's final moments from multiple angles in a way that could help investigators , attorneys and use - of - force experts determine whether the shooting was accidental , intentional or inexplicable .
The videos - taken by onlookers - have been downloaded more than 450,000 times from KTVU - TV's Web site , said William Murray , the site 's managing editor .
That 's tantamount to two months ' worth of downloads in a few days , he said .
An annotated version of one video uploaded to YouTube on Sunday was averaging more than 1,000 views an hour .
" It 's taken on a life of its own , " said Murray .
" It 's one of those phenomenons of the Internet world . "
BART spokesman Linton Johnson said the agency was troubled by the way the video footage had become a media sensation .
" It does a disservice to the integrity of the investigation because people form opinions , and then they can't give independent recollections of what they actually saw because they are tainted by the videos , " Johnson said .
" It 's unfair to ( Grant 's ) family , it 's unfair to the police officer , and it 's unfair to the public .
But that 's the world in which we live , and you have to adjust . "
The Chronicle asked several use - of - force experts , many with years of experience training police officers and military personnel and several with decades of law enforcement experience , to analyze the videos - an endeavor several experts warned can be informative but also inconclusive .
Shooting in context
The videos begin with a chaotic scene : BART officers questioning and restraining several people as a crowd of onlookers - many wielding cameras - shout in protest from a nearby train .
Several videos capture , from different angles , Mehserle and another officer speaking with and eventually moving to restrain Grant .
The trainers said the scene as shown in the video moments before the shooting would be as important to understanding what happened as the shooting itself .
" The four officers have to be operating under a high level of stress given the relatively confined setting and the people on the BART train who are expressing , in a very loud vocal fashion , their displeasure with the officers ' actions , " said Frank Borelli , a use - of - force expert in Maryland .
" Those officers , should things go bad for them , are vastly outnumbered by a group of people who have already voiced their unhappiness with the police . "
But other experts saw the moment differently .
" It 's clear it was not a use - of - deadly - force situation , " said Gregory D. Lee , a retired supervisory special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration who has testified in federal use - of - force cases .
" You 've got more than enough manpower there to handle these guys . "
Bruce Siddle , founder of Illinois - based PPCT Management Systems , a use - of - force training and research firm , agreed with Lee 's interpretation .
" If you look at the officer 's body language , it 's clear in my mind he did n't believe he was in a deadly force situation , " he said .
" He 's relaxed . "
Seconds before the shooting , Mehserle and another officer apparently placed Grant on his stomach to be searched or handcuffed .
" Two officers appear to be struggling with Grant prior to the shot being fired , " Borelli said .
" This would indicate that , at best , Grant was being uncooperative , or at worst aggressively resisting arrest .
I have to emphasize that no one except those two officers knows what happened in that struggle and how the officers perceived it . "
Escalation of force
Several use - of - force trainers said it appeared that the struggle led the officer to change tactics .
" In my mind , what happened here was this guy was resisting , " Siddle said .
" And at some point there was a decision made ... we can't control him , so we 're going to use the Taser . "
BART officials say some officers carry a Taser X26 , a top - of - the - line model used by several other Bay Area police agencies .
A BART spokesman said the Police Department started training to use the devices three or four months ago , but a source within BART said officers had only been using them on regular patrols since mid-December .
Agency police have not said whether Mehserle had a Taser the night of the shooting , although several of the experts said the videos appeared to show that he had the device on his belt .
The experts were split on whether Mehserle should have been drawing a weapon of any kind , lethal or otherwise .
" Why would you draw a firearm in that situation to begin with ? " said George Kirkham , a Florida criminologist and consultant .
" This does n't even seem like a Taser situation . "
Chaos on platform
Other experts said it is possible that given the chaos on the platform and the apparent struggle , Mehserle might have concluded that using a Taser to control Grant was justified .
A source familiar with the investigation has said BART is looking at the possibility that Mehserle had intended to fire a Taser at Grant but drew his service weapon instead .
Several cases have been documented of police officers in the United States accidentally shooting people with handguns when they intended to use Tasers , including a 2002 case in which a Madera ( Fresno County ) police officer shot and killed a 24 - year - old man .
The officer was not charged criminally ; a civil case brought by the dead man 's family is still pending .
Similar confusion could have led to Grant 's death , said several trainers , who noted that Mehserle and the other officers appeared in the video to be startled by the shooting .
Siddle said changes in how the brain processes information in a stressful situation might have led the officer to mistake the butt of his service weapon for the Taser .
But other experts found the idea that the shooting resulted from such a mix - up hard to believe .
" That 's as reflexive as you getting in on the driver 's side of the car ( instead of ) the passenger side if you want to drive it , " Kirkham said .
" There 's no remote similarity to a conventional firearm .
...
The Taser is just like apples and oranges . "
It is more likely , Kirkham said , that the officer and his attorney will argue that the officer saw or felt something on Grant - a cell phone , a belt buckle - that he believed was a weapon and that Grant was about to use it .
" That is the only possible explanation I can come up with , " he said .
" Beyond that , you 've got me . "
BART officials have said Grant was unarmed .
Another expert , Roy Bedard , who has trained police officers around the world , advanced a different theory after his first viewing of the video : that the shooting was a pure accident , a trigger pulled because of a loss of balance or a loud noise .
But in an indication of how the videos might move the investigation , Bedard reached a different conclusion after viewing the shooting from a different angle .
" Looking at it , I hate to say this , it looks like an execution to me , " he said .
" It really looks bad for the officer .
...
We have to get inside his head and figure out what he was thinking when he fired the shot . "
With that in mind , here are five of the most entertaining purveyors of awful advice to be found on television .
Entertainment and good advice rarely cross paths .
This is partly because most good advice -- do n't run with scissors , watch your money , do n't bring a bong to a job interview - - is n't fun to watch .
No , it 's far more fun to watch people flail and flounder than to succeed at life , and that 's exactly what bad advice accommodates .
5 Mystery from VH1's The Pickup Artist
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Mystery , the star of VH1's The Pickup Artist , has dedicated his career to teaching men how to seduce women through seminars and bootcamps that he hosts around the world .
And like the other professions that exist exclusively within the conference rooms of the La Quinta Inn chain -- knife sales , pyramid schemes , sports memorabilia auctions , beauty pageant workshops for children - the fact that Mystery charges money for the advice he dispenses seemed more likely to send him to Hell than cable television .
Mystery promotes the concept of " peacocking " or wearing outrageous clothes to attract attention from girls , adhering to the " all attention is good attention " school of thought that most of us abandoned after we were no longer toddlers .

Vests .
Ties .
Fuzzy hat .
What 's missing ?
Oh , right .
Women .
When Mystery walks into a nightclub dressed like a costume shop mannequin in Haight - Ashbury , he 's not just saying " Hey , Look at Me ! " - he 's saying , " Hey , Look at Me : I 'm a douchebag ! "
Mystery prides his outfits on their depth and sophistication , but it 's precisely that depth that sells out his desperation , his wafer - thin personality and the fact that he 's the one that 's been looting the local Burlesque theater 's prop room .
Yeah , the Amelia Earhart look sort of died with ... Amelia Earhart .
Actually , you have to wonder how much Mystery himself buys into his own advice ; he could be pulling everyone 's leg when he tells men to paint their nails black and initiate conversations with women by insulting them .
Think about it :
These desperate lonely types watch his show , then boldly stride from their basements to attract chicks while wearing Richard Nixon masks and snow shoes .
They embarrass themselves even further when they break the ice by asking a woman if her hair is real .
They figure they still must not have it right , and that adds a premium to the special advice that Mystery hawks for a fee behind closed doors in the Sacramento Airport 's EconoLodge business lounge .
Intel has released version 0.3.0 of its Concurrent Collections for C/ C ++. Intel Concurrent Collections for C/C++ 0.3.0 , which can be downloaded here , provides a mechanism for constructing C++ programs that executes in parallel while allowing application developers to ignore issues of parallelism such as low - level threading constructs or the scheduling and distribution of computations .
The model lets programmers specify high - level computational steps including inputs and outputs without imposing unnecessary ordering on their execution .
Code within the computational steps is written using standard serial constructs of the C++ language .
Data is either local to a computational step or it is explicitly produced and consumed by them .
An application in this programming model supports multiple styles of parallelism ( e.g. , data , task , pipeline parallel ) .
While the interface between the computational steps and the runtime system remains unchanged , a wide range of runtime systems may target different architectures ( e.g. , shared memory , distributed ) or support different scheduling methodologies ( e.g. , static or dynamic ) .
Intel provides a runtime system for shared memory systems that supports parallel execution although it is not yet highly optimized .
Among the new and updated features Release 0.3.0 includes are :
Performance improvements .
Steps can now be specified with different priorities to improve performance .
See 1.1.4 Attributes for steps in the Intel Concurrent Collections for C/C++ Reference Manual .
Memory usage improvement .
Garbage collection by ref-counting is now supported to reduce memory usage .
See 1.1.5 Attributes for items in the Intel Concurrent Collections for C/C++ Reference Manual .
Samples added .
MatrixInversion demonstrates the new ref-counting feature
Translator license expiration date .
The license for the translator ( cnc.exe ) in the download package expires on 12/31/2009 .
Documents updated .
Intel Concurrent Collections for C/C++ Reference Manual
Problems fixed .
The cnc.exe ( translator ) " The system cannot execute the specified program " problem that occurs when VS2005 SP1 is not installed on the system has been fixed .

After - the - fact interview :
Your browser is not able to display this multimedia content .
Currently , NVIDIA is really missing out on the netbook market , which is dominated by all - Intel platform designs .
NVIDIA has finally woken up to this reality , and the outspoken cofounder , president , and CEO of NVIDIA , Jen - Hsun Huang , has launched an all - out campaign to promote his company ’s Ion platform – and he is n’t shy of flinging some poo to Intel and netbooks in general .
NVIDIA ’s Ion platform combines the well - known Intel Atom 1.6 Ghz processor to the GeForce 9400M GPU , providing a powerful graphics core in netbooks ( in fact , the same GPU powers Apple ’s new MacBook ) .
While release dates are as of yet unknown , the platform is supposed to arrive in the coming months .
In any case , NVIDIA is in a precarious position .
Basically every netbook sold today is an all - Intel machine , from the graphics core down to the processor .
Considering the use - case of most of these netbooks – quick , on - the - go computing – most users probably wo n’t need a really powerful GPU .
The screen is mostly the limiting factor here .
This obviously hurts NVIDIA , because they see a fast - growing market they ’re not part of .
So what do you do when you missed a major market explosion because you were caught sleeping on the job ?
Well , you do what all other big companies do in the same situation : you start talking said market down ( see Apple and AMD ) .
Huang does so by the book , and leaves no stone unturned .
However , in doing so , his complaints borderline on clinging - to - straws .
About netbooks , he says :
The Atom platform is creating an installed base that does n’t run modern applications .
It does n’t run anything well from Electronic Arts , it does n’t run anything well from Adobe , it does n’t run anything well from Microsoft .
I just mentioned the top software companies in the world .
So in a way , the Atom platform is creating an installed base of PCs that ’s going to eventually hurt the PC software industry .
I think we all have to be very thoughtful about the proliferation of PCs that are inferior to what people think a PC should be , yet still is a PC . ”
Despite the fact that his claims are debatable , at best , one also has to wonder if , assuming his complaints really are true , they actually have any relevance to people buying netbooks .
Is the prime reason you buy a netbook to play the latest and greatest Electronic Arts game ?
Do you buy it to do serious Photoshop editing ?
To me , it simply seems as if NVIDIA is a little scared it wo n’t ever make serious inroads into the netbook market , especially now that Intel ’s second generation Atom processor will have the GPU on - die .
Ati obviously does n’t have this problem , being part of AMD and all .
Curiously , Huang has a lot of nice things to say about Via ’s Nano platform .
“ Nano is a fabulous processor .
You could argue that it ’s architecturally one generation beyond Atom , ” he states , “ The amount of software and hardware outside of the CPU is so much , unless you have tier - one capabilities , you ca n’t build a tier - one - capable machine .
That ’s really VIA ’s weakness .
They do n’t have the resources to build the GPU in the system to be competitive . ”
They say misery loves company , but the same may be even more true of happiness .
In a study published online today by the British Medical Journal , scientists from Harvard University and UC San Diego showed that happiness spreads readily through social networks of family members , friends and neighbors .
Knowing someone who is happy makes you 15.3 % more likely to be happy yourself , the study found .
A happy friend of a friend increases your odds of happiness by 9.8 % , and even your neighbor ’s sister ’s friend can give you a 5.6 % boost .
“ Your emotional state depends not just on actions and choices that you make , but also on actions and choices of other people , many of which you do n’t even know , ” said Dr. Nicholas A. Christakis , a physician and medical sociologist at Harvard who co-wrote the study .

The research is part of a growing trend to measure well - being as a crucial component of public health .
Scientists have documented that people who describe themselves as happy are likely to live longer , even if they have a chronic illness .
The new study “ has serious implications for our understanding of the determinants of health and for the design of policies and interventions , ” wrote psychologist Andrew Steptoe of University College London and epidemiologist Ana Diez Roux of the University of Michigan in an accompanying editorial .
Christakis and UCSD political scientist James H. Fowler examined the relationships of nearly 5,000 people who were tracked for decades as part of the landmark Framingham Heart Study .
They discovered that happy people in geographic proximity were most effective in spreading their good cheer .
They also found the happiest people were at the center of large social networks .
Advertisement
In many regards , they concluded , happiness is like a contagious disease .
“ We know people who are most susceptible to HIV are people who have lots of partners , ” Fowler said .
“ This is the same thing . ”
This is n’t the first evidence that emotions can spread like a virus .
Studies have found that waiters who offer service with a smile are rewarded with bigger tips .
On the flip side , having a mildly depressed roommate made college freshmen increasingly depressed themselves .
Fowler and Christakis thought they could document the spread of happiness more convincingly by studying the copious records of participants in the Framingham study , a massive effort launched by the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute in 1948 to find common causes of cardiovascular disease .
Participants gave researchers the names of their parents , spouses , siblings , children and close friends , including many who were also study volunteers .
That allowed the researchers to track multiple relationships for each participant out to several degrees of separation .
Advertisement
Fowler and Christakis focused on 4,739 people who were part of the second - generation cohort that joined the study in 1971 , in part because many of them had parents and children in other cohorts .
The researchers rounded out their networks by using home addresses to locate neighbors and employment information to identify co-workers .
Altogether , they constructed a social network that included 12,067 study volunteers who were linked to each other through 53,228 ties .
In earlier studies of the network , Fowler and Christakis showed that obesity and smoking spread among groups of friends and relatives .
To assess happiness , the researchers relied on how much the volunteers said they agreed with four statements like “ I was happy ” and “ I enjoyed life . ”
The questions were asked three times between 1983 and 2003 .
The results were striking :
Advertisement
A happy friend who lives within a half - mile makes you 42 % more likely to be happy yourself .
If that same friend lives two miles away , his impact drops to 22 % .
Happy friends who are more distant have no discernible impact , according to the study .
Similarly , happy siblings make you 14 % more likely to be happy yourself , but only if they live within one mile .
Happy spouses provide an 8 % boost -- if they live under the same roof .
Next - door neighbors who are happy make you 34 % more likely to be happy too , but no other neighbors have an effect , even if they live on the same block .
“ We suspect emotions spread through frequency of contact , ” Fowler said .
As a result , he said , people who live too far away to be seen on a regular basis do n’t have much effect .
The one exception was co-workers , perhaps because something in the work environment prevented their happiness from spreading , the study found .
Advertisement
The research was funded by the National Institute on Aging and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation .
Shigehiro Oishi , a University of Virginia psychologist who studies the causes and consequences well - being , said the importance of geography was a profound finding .
“ Although we are connected with friends and family members who live far away via cellphone and the Internet , these results indicate that there is nothing like a face - to - face interaction , ” Oishi said .
“ We are told to get connected by cellphone companies , but in order to get connected you really have to live close by and interact face to face . ”
Fowler and Christakis said they did n’t know the mechanism by which happiness spreads .
One possibility is that happy people spread their good fortune directly by being generous with their time and money .
Evolution may have encouraged infectious happiness if it helped hominids and early humans enhance their social bonds so they could form successful groups , the researchers said .
Advertisement
UC Irvine sociologist Katherine Faust , who studies social networks , said the study might overstate the role of social ties in transmitting happiness .
Many of the Framingham volunteers are the parents , siblings and children of other volunteers , and their propensity toward happiness could be grounded in their genes , she said .
But Richard Suzman , director of behavioral and social research at the National Institute on Aging , said Fowler ’s and Christakis ’ work was persuasive enough to force policymakers to rethink the importance of social ties when contemplating happiness or obesity or smoking .
“ You ca n’t just treat individuals ; you have to treat networks or communities , ” he said .

The pirates are being tickled , rather than sobering up in the brig " Drunken sailors " have been removed from the lyrics of a nursery rhyme in a government - funded books project .
But the Bookstart charity says the re-writing of What Shall We Do With the Drunken Sailor ? has " absolutely nothing to do with political correctness " .
The charity says that the shift from drunken sailor to " grumpy pirate " was to make the rhyme fit a pirate theme , rather than censorship .
" Put him in the brig until he 's sober , " has also been lost in the new version .
This latest ideological spat over nursery rhymes was sparked by the re-writing of What Shall We Do With the Drunken Sailor .
' Rusty razor '
Bookstart , a project that encourages parents to read with their young children , has produced a different version - with no references to alcohol - swigging sailors .
PIRATES AHOY !
What shall we do with the grumpy pirate ?
What shall we do with the grumpy pirate ?
Early in the morning
What shall we do with the grumpy pirate ?
What shall we do with the grumpy pirate ?
What shall we do with the grumpy pirate ?
Early in the morning Hooray and up she rises
Hooray and up she rises
Hooray and up she rises
Early in the morning
Do a little jig and make him smile
Do a little jig and make him smile
Do a little jig and make him smile
Early in the morning Instead the hard - drinking sea shanty has been turned into something gentler , with lyrics such as " Tickle him till he starts to giggle , Early in the morning . "
The charity has dismissed accusations that this is a politically - correct attempt to avoid the alcohol references , saying that it was a case of re-cycling a familiar tune for reading events that were based on a pirate theme .
" We wanted to find a rhyme which would fit in with this subject and this one has a tune which is instantly recognisable by all , " said a statement from Bookstart .
" The inclusion of action lyrics like ' wiggle ' and ' tickle ' offer parents and small children an opportunity to interact , have fun and enjoy acting out the rhyme together . "
Although the Drunken Sailor version familiar to children already leaves out some of the saltier verses .
The original includes such suggestions as : " Shave his belly with a rusty razor " , " Stick him in a bag and beat him senseless " and " Put him in the hold with the captain 's daughter . "
The captain 's daughter was a euphemism for a lashing from a cat o' nine tails .
Baa -baa
This is the latest in a series of disputes over nursery rhymes .
There were complaints in 2006 about pre-school children attending two nurseries in Oxfordshire being taught " Baa Baa Rainbow Sheep " .
Last year , a story based on the Three Little Pigs fairy tale was turned down by a government agency 's awards panel as the subject matter could offend Muslims .
A digital book , re-telling the classic story , was rejected by judges who warned that " the use of pigs raises cultural issues " .
However , a study in 2004 showed that nursery rhymes exposed children to far more violent incidents than an average evening watching television - including Humpty Dumpty 's serious head injury .

Attorney General contender carries 9/11 related baggage Peter Lance
Published : Tuesday November 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Mondays New York Times reported that former Deputy A.G. and 9/11 Commissioner Jamie Gorelick was a candidate for Attorney General in the new Obama Administration .
Five - time Emmy winning investigative reporter Peter Lance details a shocking , but little known story about Gorelick involving the loss of a key al Qaeda operative .
This is an excerpt from his 2006 HarperCollins book TRIPLE CROSS soon to be published in trade paperback .
On December 16th , 1994 , agents in the FBIs San Francisco office made an extraordinary seizure .
Mohammed Jamal Khalifa ( MJK ) Osama bin Ladens brother - in - law and former roommate , was captured at a Holiday Inn in Morgan Hill , California .
If this arrest had been fully investigated by the FBI and the Justice Department , it might have led to the seizure of 9/11 mastermind 
Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , and stopped the planes as missiles plot dead in its tracks .
But what followed was series of missteps and bad decisions at the highest levels of the State and Justice departments that had a catastrophic impact on Americas ability to cut short bin Ladens jihad against America .
At the center of the decision making at the time , was Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick .
Khalifa , 37 , was born in Medina , Saudi Arabia .
A short , wiry man with a close - cropped beard ; his aliases included Abdul Bara , Abu Baraa , and Jimmy Jack .
Khalifa was so close to the Saudi billionaire that hed married bin Ladens sister .
From 1983 to 1991 he had been trusted by al Qaeda with running the Philippines branch of the International Islamic Relief Organization ( IIRO ) , one of their key NGOs with links to the Hamas terrorist organization .
The Philippines National Police ( PNP ) believed that via Konsonjaya , a Malaysian cutout company , Khalifa was bankrolling the Mania cell of KSM and his nephew Ramzi Yousef .
Ramzi , a master bomb maker later convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing , was also the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks , which his uncle Khalid Shaikh executed after Yousefs arrest in 1995 .
That story is fully documented in my first HarperCollins investigative book : 1000 Years For Revenge : International Terrorism
And the FBI ( The Untold Story ) .
The other two principal cell members were Abdul Hakim Murad , a pilot trained in four U.S. flights schools in 1991 - 92 who was to be the lead pilot in the planes operation and Wali Khan Amin Shah , aka  the lion ,  a veteran of the Afghan war against the Soviets who was beloved by bin Laden .
The PNP also suspected Khalifa of having contacts with Islamic extremist and fundamentalist groups . . . in Iraq , Jordan , Turkey , Russia , Malaysia , United Arab Emirates , Romania , Lebanon , Syria , Pakistan , Albania , the Netherlands and Morocco . 
More significant , he also had ties to al Gammaa Islamyah ( IG ) , blind Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahmans Egyptian - based terror group .
Khalifas business card was discovered in a search of the blind Sheikhs residence the year before ( 1993 ) and he was one of 172 unindicted co-conspirators named by prosecutors Patrick Fitzgerald and Andrew McCarthy in the Day of Terror case , which was about to get underway in the Southern District of New York in early 1995 .
At the time of his arrest in Morgan Hill , Khalifa was traveling with Mohammed Loay Bayazid , a.k.a.
Abu Rida al - Suri , a naturalized U.S. citizen who worked in the Chicago office of the Benevolence International Foundation , an al Qaeda NGO .
In the early 1990s , Bayazid , later identified as a founding member of al Qaeda , had attempted to obtain uranium for Osama bin Laden .
Further , although Khalifa was carrying a Saudi passport , hed flown into the Bay area from London carrying a Philippines Special Return Certificate indicating that he was heading back to Manila .
THE BIGGEST AL QAEDA FISH CAUGHT BY THE FEDS
With his direct connections to bin Laden , the blind Sheikh , KSM , Yousef and Wali Khan , Khalifa was the biggest al Qaeda fish the Feds had caught since Rahman himself in July 1993 .
 It s difficult to express just how many dots the FBI and Justice Department prosecutors could have connected with Khalifa , at the time of his arrest , given the contacts he had ,  says Paul Thompson , terrorist researcher and author of The Terror Timeline , who has compiled a database of more than 20,000 open - source al Qaeda - related articles and court pleadings on the non-profit website History Commons .
After serving a search warrant on Khalifa , the Feds found files in his Newton PDA which listed one of his aliases Abu Baraa .
That same name had been scrawled inside one of the bomb manuals carried by Mohammed Ajaj , a former al Fatah terrorist who had been convicted earlier in 1994 for the World Trade Center bombing .
Searching Khalifas belongings , the FBI and INS discovered Islamic literature tying him to IIRO .
Also in the PDA were Wali Khans beeper number , and a number in Pakistan that Yousef had used to call Manila .
Encrypted phone numbers tied to Khalifas NGO were later found on Yousefs Toshiba laptop , and when Wali Khan was finally arrested , he was found to be carrying multiple numbers for MJK .
Given his links to Yousefs cells in New York and Manila , Khalifa was the human linchpin who could have ultimately furnished the FBI with proof of Yousefs second intended attack on the World Trade Center which KSM carried out on  Black Tuesday . 
Moreover , Khalifa was motivated to talk .
At the time of his arrest in Morgan Hills , he was wanted in Jordan for a series of al Qaeda related bombings .
As a State Department cable after his arrest stated :  FYI , Osama Bin Ladens brother - in - law , Muhammad Jamal Khalifah [ sic ] , was arrested in California on 12/16 .
REFTEL ( reference telegram ) refers to Khalifa as a known financier of terrorist operations and an officer of an Islamic NGO in the Philippines that is a known Hamas front .
He is under indictment in Jordan in connection with a series of cinema bombings earlier this year . 
On the day of his arrest in mid-December 1994 , the State Department designated Khalifa a  Deportable Alien . 
A deputy assistant secretary of state issued a certificate of revocation for Khalifas visa for having engaged in terrorist activity . 
A week later , on December 23rd , Philip C. Wilcox , Jr. the State Departments coordinator for counterterrorism , wrote to advise an immigration judge that Khalifa had engaged in serious terrorist offenses  and that his release would endanger U.S. national security . ( PDF link ) .
He noted that in the last two days there has been a significant additional development in this matter .
On December 21st the State Security Court in Jordan found Mohammed Jamal Khalifah guilty of the charges for which he was indicted and imposed a capital sentence .
After a four - month trial involving twenty - five suspected terrorists , the Jordanians had condemned Khalifa ; and now in the safety of U.S. custody , he was facing execution if he returned to Amman .
The details on Khalifas Newton address book should have led the FBI directly to Ramzi Yousef , the worlds most wanted manwho , unbeknownst to the Feds , was responsible for a plot to blow up Philippines Airlines Flight 434 that went down just five days before Khalifas seizure , and who was now contemplating three mass - casualty terrorist attacks .
Further , for the two bin Laden offices or origin in New York , Khalifas web of associations should have underscored al Qaeda 's direct command and control of Yousefs New York and Philippines operations .
As to what the Feds could expect to get out of MJK , his death sentence in Jordan meant that he was motivated to talk , rather than risk extradition .
KHALIFAS EXTRADITION BACKED BY TWO TOP FEDS
Even if the Feds were savvy enough to see the value in questioning him , however , they never got the chance .
On January 5 , 1995 , a decision was made by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and supported by Deputy A.G. Gorelick , that arguably ranks as one of the most profound intelligence errors committed by any U.S. official in the years leading up to 9/11 .
 Jordan is aware of Mr. Khalifahs presence in the United States ,  Christopher wrote to Attorney General Janet Reno , and has asked for our assistance in sending him to Jordan so that he may be brought to justice .
To permit Mr. Khalifah to remain in the United States in these circumstances would potentially be seen as an affront to Jordan and at odds with many of the basic elements of our cooperative bilateral relationship [ and ] potentially undermine our longstanding and successful policy of international legal cooperation to bring about the prosecution of terrorists . 
Christophers legal theory seemed part of a determined effort by top officials at Justice and State to craft an exit for Khalifa .
Philip Wilcoxs letter of just two weeks before , and the certificate revoking MJKs visa had cited him for terrorist activity .
But according to Khalifas lawyer Marc Van Der Hout ,  They dropped that halfway through his bond hearing .
Then they [ substituted ] a charge that hadnt been used before enacted in 1990 that a person can be deported if the Secretary of State has reasons to believe the aliens presence or activities could have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences .
This is the first time they ever tried to use that statute . 
Christophers letter made no mention of Khalifas crucial value to the U.S. in its own terror fight .
Keep in mind that the FBI found evidence in his PDA linking MJK directly to Ramzi Yousef , the mastermind of the WTC bombing , who was , at that very moment the object of a worldwide manhunt .
That discovery alone should far have outweighed Jordans desire to punish Khalifa for a series of movie theater bombings .
GORELICK SENDS AN EXPEDITE  LETTER
Nonetheless , the very next day , Gorelick serving in Janet Renos absence as acting attorney generalsent an expedite letter in support of Christophers deportation request .
Strangely , Gorelick began the letter by noting that , pursuant to Federal law , " the deportation of an alien in the United States ... shall be directed by the Attorney General to a country promptly designated by the alien if that country is willing to accept him into its territory unless the Attorney General in his discretion concludes that deportation to such country would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States ( emphasis added ) .
It s difficult to fathom how it could have been in the interests of the United States to allow the deportation of Osama bin Ladens brother - in - law ; a man the State Department had just named as a terrorist .
But Gorelick went on record personally as supporting Christophers recommendation , concluding that should deportation be ordered , deporting Mohammed Khalifah to any country other than Jordan would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States and that he should be deported to Jordan pursuant to Section 243 ( a ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( INA ) . 
Rather than keeping him in the U.S. so that he could be debriefed by FBI agents , Gorelick was signing off on a decision first pressed by Christopher who was apparently feeling pressured from the Jordanians to extradite the accused terrorist financier .
CIA PERSONNEL RIPSHIT  OVER THE DECISION
 I remember people at CIA who were ripshit at the time over the decision , says Jacob L. Boesen , an Energy Department analyst then working at the CIAs Counter Terrorism Center .
 Not even speaking in retrospect , but contemporaneous with what the intelligence community knew about bin Laden , Khalifas deportation was unreal . 
From the time of his arrest , Khalifa maintained his innocence , contending that he was a legitimate businessman and philanthropist who had visited the Bay Area merely to meet with seed brokers as part of his import - export business , .
He categorically denied being a terrorist , and claimed that his conviction in Amman was the result of perjured testimony by a witness who had been tortured .
Khalifa was initially housed in the relatively low - security Santa Rita Jail in Alameda County .
Then , over the next few months , a curious series of events began to unfold .
Rather than cooperating with the Feds , Khalifa initially fought his extradition to Jordan .
He also filed a civil suit to get back the contents of his luggage , which included the coveted PDA and other computer files .
Astonishingly , the Feds complied .
On March 23rd , 1995 , in a response to Khalifas motion for return of property and an order unsealing his search warrant , assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen R. Freccero stated that  The United States has no objection to the unsealing of the search warrant [ and ] the return of the property seized .
So the treasure trove of al Qaeda - related intelligence went back to MJK .
Ironically after his extradition , Khalifa landed in Saudi Arabia where he ran a seafood restaurant in Jeddah for several years .
Arrested after 9/11 by the Saudis , he was later freed and openly condemned his billionaire brother - in - law bin Laden  criticism for which he may have paid dearly .
On January 31st , 2007 an armed group of some 20 men attacked his house in Madagascar and murdered him ; stealing his belongings and any trace that may have remained of his links to the Manila cell behind the 9/11 plot .
THE WALL  MEMO
The Khalifa case is worth studying in detail , not just because of the massive security loss that it represented for America , but because it may have led to the infamous March 1995 memo from Deputy A.G. Gorelick which sought to define how the FBI and Justice Department would investigate terrorism for years to come .
In this memo , written two months after her letter acquiescing to Khalifas deportation , Gorelick issued that Justice Department directive creating the infamous wall ,  instructing FBI agents and DOJ prosecutors to separate past criminal investigations , including the bombing of the World Trade Center and  the indicted case of United States v. Rahman , et al.  from Foreign Counter Intelligence ( FCI ) investigations of future terrorist acts .
In effect , Gorelick was ordering the breakup the Justice Departments war on terror into two separate camps .
( PDF link ) .
 Because the counterintelligence investigation will involve the use of surveillance techniques authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) against targets that , in some instances , had been subject to surveillance under Title III ,  she wrote , and because it will involve some of the same sources and targets as the criminal investigation , we believe that it is prudent to establish a set of instructions that will clearly separate the counterintelligence investigation from the more limited , but continued , criminal investigations . 
Since most of the Justice Departments body of knowledge on al Qaeda , Yousef , and the blind Sheikhs plots was contained in the files of FBI agents and SDNY prosecutors who worked those criminal cases , Gorelicks extraordinary edict had the potential legal effect of isolating them from the FCI agents trying to stop the next al Qaeda bomb from detonating .
Gorelicks memo also had a more personal effect :
It may well have helped to obscure her support for Khalifas extradition , at a time when prosecutors in the SDNY had recently commenced the epic case they were mounting against the blind Sheikh and his cohorts .
BEYOND WHAT IS LEGALLY REQUIRED
What made Gorelicks memo even more astonishing is that it wasnt legally necessary .
She even admitted in her order that these new procedures . . . go beyond what is legally required .
The 2004 disclosure of that memo by then Attorney General John Ashcroft , in his testimony before the 9/11 Commission , set off a firestorm of criticism since Gorelick was serving as one of the ten commissioners .
After Ashcrofts revelation , F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. ( R - WI ) , then chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , accused Gorelick of having an inherent conflict of interest and called for her immediate resignation , which never happened .
But the wall memo debate quickly degenerated into partisan finger - pointing after Ashcroft was forced to admit that his own deputy attorney general Larry Thompson had renewed the terms of the Gorelick memo in August 2001 , weeks before 9/11 .
Retired FBI Agent Joe OBrien sees it this way :  The wall memo was a disastrous move .
Because , as it turned out , all of these cases were related .
This was a bin Laden - New York show from start to finish . 
As one of the 9/11 commissioners , Gorelick supported a decision that limited the scope of the Commissions investigation with regard to the Department of Justice to the period 1998 forward .
That narrower field of inquiry insured that the Commission wouldnt look back at the disastrous Khalifa deportation , which Gorelick supported , or question whether she had used  the wall memo to keep prosecutors from connecting the dots on her actions .
 Theres no doubt that the Commission should have gone back at least as far as the first Bush Administration , in order to effectively measure the intelligence failures that led to the attacks ,  says Monica Gabrielle , a member of the core group of 9/11 victim families that campaigned for the creation of the Commission .
 But Gorelick was one of those who wanted to concentrate only on the last few years . 
Apparently she got her way .
In the entire 604 - page authorized edition of The 9/11 Commission Report , there is nt a word about Gorelicks role in supporting the exit of Mohammed Jamal Khalifa , or about the wall memo two of the most damaging moves the United States justice system took on the road to 9/11 .

On Tuesday afternoon , as I was working on another piece about president - elect Barack Obama tapping Colorado Senator Ken Salazar for Interior Secretary — this time about how Salazar ’s appointment to Interior wo n’t leave his successor much time to win over Colorado voters — I heard Jeff Brady report on National Public Radio that environmentalists were fuming over the Salazar appointment .
“ Fuming ? ” I thought to myself , “ maybe that ’s a bit of a mischaracterization . ”
So , as I will often do , I decided to share my thoughts with the Twitterverse and sent out the following message on Twitter :
In Brady ’s report ( and in his defense ) he cited an action last week , when more than 150 environmental groups signed a letter to Obama backing Arizona Congressman Raul Grijalva .
But I still thought the instant assumption that “ most environmentalists are fuming ” was hasty .
And then I got the following response from @ HuffingtonPost / @COindependent :
To which I replied ( and misspelled Grijalva ) :
Now , I follow @NPRPolitics on Twitter and I know they follow me back , but I really do n’t know if they caught any of this exchange , but the next time I heard Brady ’s report on NPR , he said something like “ many environmentalists are fuming , ” and the third time I heard the report it was something along the lines of “ some environmentalists are fuming . ”
So when I was pouring through my RSS feader this morning looking for all these fumes , they were few and far between ( i.e thus far , non-existent ) .
Instead , I found mainstream environmental groups showering praise , albeit measured , on the selection of Salazar .
Carl Pope of the Sierra Club wrote :
“ The Sierra Club is very pleased with the nomination of Ken Salazar to head the Interior Department .
As a Westerner and a rancher , he understands the value of our public lands , parks , and wildlife and has been a vocal critic of the Bush Administration ’s reckless efforts to sell - off our public lands to Big Oil and other special interests .
Senator Salazar has been a leader in protecting places like the Roan Plateau and he has stood up against the Bush ’s administration ’s dangerous rush to develop oil shale in Colorado and across the West .
“ Senator Salazar has also been a leading voice in calling for the development of the West ’s vast solar , wind , and geothermal resources .
He will make sure that we create the good - paying green jobs that will fuel our economic recovery without harming the public lands he will be charged with protecting .
“ Senator Salazar will inherit an agency that has suffered from a pervasive rot under the Bush administration due to widespread corruption , simple incompetence , and severe underfunding .
We are confident that Senator Salazar will work with President - Elect Obama to undo the damage of the Bush years and chart a course that will allow this vast agency to return to its proud legacy of protecting our last wild places , wildlife , and vast natural resources . ”
NRDC President Frances
Bienecke wrote an excellent piece about the tough job ahead for Salazar and expressed why she has hope he is the right person
“ Salazar ’s own connection to the land gives me hope .
Salazar is a fifth - generation Coloradan who grew up on a cattle and alfalfa ranch without running water or electricity .
His home was is in the stunning San Luis Valley , where rich ranching and farming land is banked by the wild San Juan and Sangre de Cristo mountain ranges .
As a senator , Salazar supported his state ’s efforts to limit the impacts to groundwater from the heavily polluting process of in - situ uranium mining and taken often lonely stands against oil shale .
Still , the challenges before Salazar are great , and he will need to be a forceful leader for change . ”
The New Republic ‘s Bradford Plummer sharply pointed out that Salazar wo n’t be breaking the ‘ iron triangle ’ ( read : old boys club ) of backdoor administrative rulemaking :
Salazar , for his part , is a relatively green pick .
He has an 81 percent lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters , and has been critical of the Bush administration ’s plans to expedite oil - shale drilling in Colorado and other Western states , on account of the environmental damage it would wreak .
He ’s reportedly close to Obama , which will bolster his effectiveness , as will his longstanding ties to the American West .
Pam Kiely of Environment Colorado was also pleased with the choice of Salazar , while recognizing his pragmatism :
“ In Washington , Sen . Salazar fought to protect our nation ’s treasures such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
He ’s championed wilderness for Dominguez Canyon , Browns Canyon , and Rocky Mountain National Park .
Sen .
Salazar has championed a cautious approach to oil shale to protect our public lands and water resources . ”
While this certainly does not exhaust the universe of reactions to the Salazar appointment , it just goes to show you that : A ) Environmentalists are not a homogeneous , and B ) You ca n’t believe everything you hear — even on NPR .

JANUARY 7-- In a remarkable screw - up , a Department of Justice official today accidentally distributed to the media a document containing the names of nearly 20 confidential witnesses interviewed during a federal probe targeting the operators of a fraudulent investment scheme .
In announcing felony charges against two men for their roles in an alleged $ 15 million Ponziesque swindle , the spokesman for Chicago U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald ( he of Rod Blagojevich - and Scooter Libby - prosecuting fame ) e-mailed reporters a 62 - page U.S. District Court complaint filed against John Walsh and Charles Martin , principals of the now - defunct One World Capital Group .
Included in the document was a one - page key that identified by name sources referred to in the complaint only by monikers such as ' Employee A , ' ' Customer D , ' or ' Individual F. '
The inadvertent disclosure of the sources -- former One World employees , customers , and ' other ' individuals who spoke with FBI and IRS agents -- caused Fitzgerald spokesman Randall Samborn to send an urgent follow - up email asking journalists to destroy the complaint due to the ' non-public information disclosing the identities of persons not named in the affidavit . '
A copy of the source key , which we 've strategically blurred , can be found here .

Software is going to be a tricky one to preserve , especially in the case of older data .
Information is produced at an insane rate worldwide ( think of all the blog posts , all the forums , all the art , all the image boards ) but it 's so ephemeral that it 's lost almost as quickly as it is produced - and that 's not even including the data that 's been crowded out by digital obsolescence .
Case in point :
How much data on wax cylinder has survived to our time and been converted over to a digital format ?
How much data on early records ?
How much on 8 - track , VHS , BETA , etc ?
Sure , we 'll always have Elvis and Sinatra , as well as the words of poets like Alfred Lord Tennyson recorded with the original Edison equipment , but what about all those other nameless artists and speech - givers whose last audiotape was eaten or recorded over with a grainy feed of Britney Spears ?
What about all those struggling musicians who worked so hard to get their album to 8 - track , only to have it go out of style like last - week 's breakfast ?
Some might say that in this fashion , digital obsolescence is an almost Darwinian force , similar to natural selection , where only the most popular survive .
Luckily , like with the advances in medicine we 've achieved over the decades , the odds for survival and growth of any given piece of information are getting better .
The internet is an incredible repository for data - it 's vast , nearly infinite , limited only by the amount of ones and zeros we can compress into a physical cubic inch , and as we , as a species , continue to see any data , be it blog posts or just random funny photoshops from an imageboard as being more important to preserve , the data available therein will only continue to grow .
In that case , consider the archaeologists of the future as data miners .
Digging through blogs and emails caught in the darker recesses of the internet might some day prove to be just the thing to unearth the facts needed to shake up the views of historians that look back on our time and reach whatever far - off conclusions they might be inclined to make about our society , our culture , and even our world as a whole .
The possibilities for centuries old blogs are endless - consider the impact the ramblings of a madman might have on our world today if they were uncovered engraved in an ancient clay tablet long forgotten in the bosom of Sumer .
Just because it 's ancient does n't mean it 's gospel , right ?
But is it really that simple ?
Now that the tendrils of the internet reach to almost every corner of the globe and information is archived as if it were everything but sacred , will archaeologists finally be able to look back and see the whole story without having to guess or draw assumptions ?
Maybe , but only in the best case scenario .
We are a great civilization , but great civilizations have fallen before , and the data we hold so dear is so ephemeral that it is almost as fragile as the ancient Grecian urn mentioned at the beginning of this piece .

it 's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests
So , here 's my offer .
If you happen to hit a deer ( or larger animal , although I do n't think we have many of those in southern Virginia ) , you can bring the animal to me , and I 'll carve it up for you , and split the meat 50 /50 .
I hunt , and I do my own butchering , so it does n't take too long for me , and I enjoy it .
Since hunting season is now passed , I 'd like something to occupy my time , while also filling my freezer .
There are rules though , like anything else in life : 1 . It has to be a deer or bigger .
I 'm not carving up a flat squirrel for you .
2 . It must be less than a day old .
God only knows what happens to the carcass after a day of sitting there .
3 .
You have to call the police after your accident .
The cops come out and issue you a permit so that you legally own the deer .
It 's quick , and it keeps it legal ( I 'm not carving up poached animals , and if you poach , you should rid the world of your sorry existence ) .
4 .
You bring the animal to me ( I'm in Suffolk ) , and I do the rest , and call you when its done .
If you live in Suffolk , or hit the deer in Suffolk , I could come to you , but I 'm not driving to VA Beach at 10 pm at night .
5 . I 'll cut up the animal and give half the meat to you in sealed bags .
I 'll even label it , so you 'll know what cuts you 're getting .
You eat it and enjoy !
Of course , you may feel odd eating roadkill .
I mean , that 's a redneck thing , right ?
Absolutely untrue .
For starters , you 're using meat that would normally be wasted , so its good for the environment .
Venison is leaner ( deer do n't sit on big farms eating corn ) , healthier ( no injected hormones here ! ) , and tastier ( there is no such thing as " gamey " meat .
That 's just anti-hunters trying to justify themselves ) than beef .
Plus , you get it for nothing ( except whatever your car insurance deductible is , if you decide to file a claim ) .
All these positive reasons are sure to impress your hippie friends , if you are unfortunate enough to have some .
Drop me an email ( I check it all the time , so replies wo n't take long ) when you hit a deer .
If you 're a police officer and want my phone number ( since you probably get calls all the time ) , you can email me and I 'll give you my cell number .
If its late , you can always temporarily store the animal at your house and bring it over when I get back to you .
Start enjoying the meat of your unfortunate labors !

Mayor Richard Daley ’s administration will announce plans Wednesday to close as many as five of the city ’s 12 mental health centers on Feb. 1 , citing a decline in state funding .
The 12 centers serve about 6,500 patients , and all will be given the option of going to the centers that will remain open , said Dr. Terry Mason , the mayor ’s health commissioner .
Staffing at the centers already had dropped to 114 employees from 260 due to layoffs and retirements , Mason said .
" We are trying to balance them across the remaining facilities as best as we can , " he said .
Public health advocates blasted the decision .
" A lot of people are going to be left in the cold , " said Badonna Reingold , a retired city social worker and activists with the Community Mental Health Board of Chicago .
" If the city can support the [ 2016 Olympic bid ] , they can come up with some money for the most vulnerable people . "
Mason will announce the cutbacks at city 's Board of Health meeting Wednesday morning .
Budget constraints made the closings inevitable , he said .
Mason called on new President Barack Obama to help his hometown deal with its budget crunch .
" I 'm hoping we 'll get some help out of Washington now that we have a new administration , " Mason said .
Here 's the list of centers City Hall plans to shutter , according to Mason :
* Back of the Yards , 4313 S. Ashland Ave .
* Beverly / Morgan Park , 1987 W. 111th St .
* Greater Grand / Mid-South , 4314 S. Cottage Grove Ave .
* Woodlawn , 6337 S. Woodlawn Ave .
The North River center , at 5801 N. Pulaski Road , also could close , Mason said .
BOGOTA , Colombia ( CNN ) -- Colombia's U.S. - backed security forces are engaging in " systematic and widespread " extrajudicial executions of innocent civilians as part of their counterinsurgency campaign , a top United Nations diplomat said Saturday .
Speaking in Bogota after a weeklong fact - finding tour , Navi Pillay , the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights , said the scale of the killings could constitute a " crime against humanity " under international humanitarian law , adding that international courts could intervene if the Colombian government was " unwilling or unable " to handle the investigations itself .
" An offense becomes a crime against humanity if it is widespread and systematic against the civilian population , " Pillay said at a news conference .
" We are observing and keeping a record of the number of extrajudicial killings [ in Colombia ] , and it does appear to be systematic and widespread in my view , " Pillay said .
Watch Pillay explain the investigation process »
The goal , she added , is to have the national authorities investigate these crimes " and prosecute the perpetrators .
It 's only when a country is unable and unwilling that the International Criminal Court , for instance , would have the power to intervene . "
Her comments come three days after Colombian President Alvaro Uribe fired 25 army officers and non-commissioned officers , including three generals and 11 colonels , for alleged involvement or negligence in a case involving the forced disappearance and summary executions of at least 11 young men from a poor Bogota suburb this year .
It was the biggest purge in Colombian military ranks for alleged human rights abuses .
Although Pillay welcomed the move , she said Saturday that she hoped it would be the start -- not the end -- of a thorough process to improve the human rights record of the Colombian military .
U.N. officials say they do n't keep comprehensive statistics of forced disappearances and summary executions blamed on the security forces .
But a U.N. source said the organization received between 200 and 300 such complaints every year .
A U.N. report published last year said the organization had seen " significant increases " in the number of cases .
Meanwhile , the government attorney general 's office says it opened close to 800 investigations into accusations of summary executions by the police and military between January 2003 and September 2007 .
Typically , according to the U.N. and the attorney general 's office , security forces will " disappear " or kill civilians and later present them to the media as leftist rebels or right - wing paramilitary fighters killed in combat .
Since 2000 , Colombia has received about $ 5 billion in mostly military aid from the United States to fight drugs and the guerrilla war .
Under the terms of the aid package , Washington is supposed to thoroughly vet the human rights record of Colombian military units .
If abuses are uncovered , Washington can suspend aid to the offending units .
U.S. authorities have not publicly said whether aid will be affected by the latest investigations and subsequent purge of the military high command .
None of the commanders fired earlier this week has been arrested or charged with any crime .
But Uribe has said criminal investigations are ongoing and promised that offenders would be jailed .

Following our series of quick tips , I will show you how to enhance a regular photo in Photoshop and make it look better .
Of course you can change the presets in order to make it look more subtle , my idea was to exaggerate a bit .
Also we will use the Shadows / Highlight adjustments showing how you can easily simulate a sort of HDR style .
Step 1
Open a regular photo in Photoshop .
I used a photo of a cat that I found on sxc.hu http://www.sxc.hu/photo/1069561
Step 2
Duplicate the layer and go to Filter > Other > High Pass .
Use 5 pixels .
Then change the Blend Mode of the layer to Hard Light .
Step 3
Duplicate the High Pass layer .
Keep the blend mode with Hard LIght .
Step 4
Duplicate the original photo and change its Blend Mode to Screen .
Then with the Eraser Tool ( E ) or with a Mask .
Delete the dark areas of the photo .
Leave just the light areas , the eyes , nose , and mouth .
Below you can see the areas I kept , the marquee selection .
Step 5
Group all layers and convert them to Smart Objects , Layers > Smart Objects > Convert to Smart Objects .
Or if you prefer just merge the layers .
Then go to Image > Adjustments > Shadow and Highlights .
Use the values from the image below .
With this adjustment you can edit how the shadows and highlights will be displayed , and you can simulate the HDR effect by increasing the Tonal Width and Radius on the Shadow and Highlights , and , also the Midtone Contrast .
Conclusion
This is just one way to enhance your photos , you can use the Unsharp Mask filter as well .
But I prefer the high pass with hard light , I think it gives a better result , however that will depend the photo you are working on .
The most important thing is test and play with the settings and of course add more techniques to your repertoire .
If you have a different quick tip , leave a comment sharing and explaining it to us ; ) .

Charles Barkley was arrested for DUI in Arizona early this morning after telling cops he ran a stop sign because he was in a hurry to get some oral sex .
The officer who wrote the report said :
“ He told me that he ran the stop sign because he was in a hurry to pick up the girl I saw get in the passenger seat . ”
“ He asked me to admit that she was ‘ hot . ’
He asked me , ‘ You want the truth ? ’
When I told him I did he said , ‘ I was gonna drive around the corner and get a b**w job .
He then explained that she had given him a ‘ blow job ’ one week earlier and said it was the best one he had ever had in his life . ”
The report says when Barkley was taken to the station , he told one of the employees :
“ I ’ll tattoo my name on your ass ” if he helped “ get him out of the DUI . ”
According to the report , “ He laughed and then quickly corrected himself and said , ‘ I ’ll tattoo your name on my ass ’ and then laughed again . ”
The report also says officers “ found a handgun in the vehicle ” which was immediately impounded .
The report does n’t say if the handgun was legal or not , and the only thing that we know for sure was loaded .
DAYUM !!
Israeli human rights group Yesh Din is calling for the ouster of the military ’s top rabbi , Brigadier General Avichai Rontzki over his messages to soldiers during the 22 - day military offensive in the Gaza Strip .
The primary concern was a booklet which , among other things , contained a rabbinical edict against showing mercy .
The booklet contains quotes from a nationalist rabbi which declares that showing mercy during the battle would be “ terribly immoral ” and quotes a medieval sage who cautioned Jews not to “ be enticed by the folly of the Gentiles who have mercy for the cruel . ”
Yesh Din says the booklet could have been seen by soldiers as official encouragement to act in violation of international law … an important issue as the Israeli government scrambles to defend itself against accusations of massive war crimes during the war .
Another pamphlet told troops that the civilian population of the Gaza Strip was not innocent , and urges them to “ spare your lives and the lives of your friends and not to show concern for a population that surrounds us and harms us . ”
Over 1,400 Palestinians were killing during the war , a large number of them civilians .
CAN SCIENCE HELP SOLVE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS ?
1 . The crisis and regulation [*]
The main cause of the financial crisis is instability in the financial sector including the firms , institutions and markets which comprise it .
To understand this instability , we have to begin with the legitimate primary purposes of the financial markets .
One is to provide capital , as equity and debt , to the goods and services economy to allow it to thrive and grow .
A second is to provide a stable repository for our collective savings .
And a third is to responsibly provide appropriate credit to individuals .
These legitimate functions have been hijacked by speculative behavior that was unchecked by regulatory structures .
The consequences of this threaten to disrupt the productive efforts of millions of ordinary people who go to work every day to make stuff and provide services to one another .
In the decades leading to this crisis , the shift in our economic thinking from the long - term view on Main Street to short - term speculation and gratification on Wall Street have not only brought us to the brink of economic collapse , but have also compromised a sufficient flow of capital to important long - term initiatives — economic sustainability , renewal of infrastructure , abatement of climate change , and development of alternative energy sources — all important to a vibrant and sustainable economy .
This has happened before in history — in Rome , in Spain , Holland and England .
More recently , in America , there were smaller crises before to the present one , perhaps early warnings — Black Monday , Long Term Capital Management , the dotcom bomb , and others .
Now that we live in a global economy , we cannot afford the next crisis , an order of magnitude larger , in which the world 's governments themselves will have to be bailed out .
Rather , we can only hope that these governments are collectively up to the task this time .
There is honor and service to society in inventing and building companies and products that make life better for people , which should be justly rewarded .
There is honor in architecting balanced financial regulation , to which we should dedicate careful attention .
There is honor for the important financial sector when it functions as it should for the collective good , and this too should also be justly rewarded .
Reasoned risk - taking by knowledgeable investors plays an important role in capital markets in providing support for initially risk innovations .
But there is no honor in abusing our regulatory and financial systems for reckless speculation ( i.e. gambling ) that has no productive value for our collective future and that of the generations who will follow .
Nonetheless , blame will not get us out of this situation .
We need to understand how and why the crisis happened and why warnings over the last years were not understood or heeded .
We need to use this knowledge to stop this crisis and get the economy functioning again .
In the longer term , we need to redesign and reregulate the financial system so that it performs its necessary functions without leading to periodic crises of global scale .
Two basic assumptions must guide any thinking as we undertake these tasks .
First , economies , financial institutions and markets cannot function without a context of rules and laws , which regulate them .
In a market , each participant tries to do the best they can for themselves .
In a properly architected and regulated market this contributes to the public good .
There is simply no place for an ideological discussion about regulation .
Stable systems in nature such as individual organisms and ecosystems are regulated .
So must ours be .
The only relevant question is do the regulations work or not , where work means that stable markets allow an orderly flow of capital to and from the goods and services economy and the people who comprise it .
Second , mathematics , physics and computers already play a major and necessary role in our economic affairs .
People with training in mathematical sciences play a big role on Wall Street designing and valuing complex investment instruments , and running sophisticated trading strategies .
There is no going back to the era before banks and funds depended on quantitative analysis and big computer programs , and the scientifically trained people to run them .
Along with economists with whom they work , other scientists and computer scientists now have a profound responsibility to see that their skills , the principles which they have found effective , and the tools they have wrought , are all used well and wisely .
2 . The crisis is at least partly due to shortcomings a certain theory of economics
" Those of us who have looked to the self - interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder 's equity ( myself especially ) are in a state of shocked disbelief . …
It was the failure to properly price such risky assets that precipitated the crisis .
In recent decades , a vast risk management and pricing system has evolved , combining the best insights of mathematicians and finance experts supported by major advances in computer and communications technology .
A Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of the pricing model that underpins much of the advance in derivatives markets .
This modern risk management paradigm held sway for decades .
The whole intellectual edifice , however , collapsed in the summer of last year because the data inputted into the risk management models generally covered only the past two decades , a period of euphoria . " — Testimony of Dr. Alan Greenspan , US House of Representatives Committee on Government Oversight and Reform , October 23 , 2008
When economists and other scientists study a complex system they begin by asking about what assumptions have been used previously in understanding it , and how well they have done compared to data .
So if we approach the crisis in this way , we have to begin by asking about the principles and assumptions that have been used to construct and justify the complex financial instruments whose use contributed to the present instability .
We want to know how these theoretical ideas have been tested , and whether or not the present crisis is evidence that the ideas that the financial system have been built on may need to be improved .
In fact , there is an economic theory that shapes much of our thinking , as well as the practices of investment banks and the decisions of economic policy makers .
This is called neoclassical economics .
It is based on the following assumptions : i. Most of the time markets are in or close to stable equilibrium .
ii .
Participants in markets act rationally to maximize fixed and known preferences described by definite and time independent utility functions .
iii .
Participants in markets have perfect knowledge of the information driving the markets as well as all other participants .
iv .
Prices are set by a deterministic process of joint maximization of the preferences of all involved in a trade .
v. Fluctuations in prices are small , random and uncorrelated .
vi .
There is perfect liquidity so all prices are well defined , and all markets clear .
vii .
There is no important difference between markets comprising a few individuals and those comprising millions , so simple models suffice to elucidate the principles that govern markets .
The neoclassical paradigm based on these ideas has had some undisputed successes .
At the same time , it appears to have led to the adoption of practices and recommendations , which are at least partly at the root of the present crisis .
These included the ideas that , i. Regulation is limited or unnecessary because markets find and stay close to stable equilibrium where they operate most efficiently , leading to maximally stable economic growth , whereas regulation only leads to slower growth .
But we face a potentially precipitous decline in economic growth and prosperity in the wake of some deregulation .
ii .
Everything has a value or price , at all times , that can be uniquely determined by some definite objective process .
This includes contracts that refer to prices of fluctuating variables at future times .
There is experience with futures contracts , which have prices which are set daily by their being actively traded .
But we are now seeing these values evaporate .
iii .
This trading experience may be generalized to a claim that complex financial instruments which oblige actions to be taken at future times based on conditions not known till then , still have definite values and prices even if they are never or rarely traded .
But part of the crisis is due to the fact that the balance sheets of banks and companies holding these contracts cannot be computed because they include instruments whose prices have been revealed as simply hypothetical and are now proving to be indeterminate [ 1 ] .
iv.
Stability can be increased by inventing and trading abstract complex financial instruments rather than principal contracts like stocks and mortgages .
Examples are derivatives .
Although these predate the birth of Christ and have been a factor in every economy of scale since , our markets have recently been flooded with a host of new ones which cleverly combine functions of different prices at different times into financial instruments whose values are purported to fluctuate less than the values of stocks making them up .
The theory behind the possibility of combining fluctuating variables into variables that fluctuate less is critically dependent on the above assumptions , especially that the fluctuations are small , random and uncorrelated .
But these assumptions have been shown to be false .
v.
It has been argued that these innovative instruments should not be regulated even as much as stock trading because they function as insurance to increase stability .
This was based on another false assumption that any mathematical function of the values of stocks at different times has a fixed and determinate value at any time .
vi .
Because price determination is a definite process of maximization of known preferences in an environment of perfect knowledge , and because all values are definite , it can be in some instances automated and carried out by computers programmed to trade under specified conditions .
But some markets thus operated have failed to function or clear trades .
Before we look more deeply into possible difficulties with the neoclassical paradigm , we have to also emphasize that it has been so influential because it does give important insight into how markets work in some circumstances .
Nor has it ignored the possibility that markets can have instabilities .
For example , there is a long list of well known market failures ( principal agent problems , moral hazard , public goods , menu costs , lemon markets , adverse selection , rent - seeking behavior , incomplete knowledge , incomplete markets , multiple equilibria etc . …)
So we do not want to ignore the successes of this paradigm or overlook the role that these well known understandings may play in understanding the current crisis .
But we also want to ask if there are alternative ideas , principles and methods of modeling economic systems which might also provide the basis for wise advice and policy .
As a result , in part , at least of belief in the neoclassical paradigm , a very technical approach to trading has come to dominate markets based on complex financial instruments and strategies that require mathematical scientists and computers to carry out .
Beginning as small speculative efforts , these now dominate markets .
In most markets including equities and credit , the value of derivative contracts now exceeds by an order of magnitude the total value of underlying contracts , which must be traded to fulfill those derived from them .
When physicists made the atomic bomb they realized what they had conceived and immediately felt a sober responsibility to help make the world safe from their invention .
At this time there is a responsibility for those with the knowledge and skills to understand the financial instruments involved in this crisis to help first to resolve this crisis and to next turn their attention to the design and regulation of a stable market system .
This will involve economists , mathematicians , physicists , biologists , computer scientists and others working together to make a more stable economic system .
In our view , the current crisis does suggest there are weakness in the paradigm of neoclassical economics .
In particular : i .
The big markets in the economy appear not to be in equilibrium .
Not now , and perhaps also not normally .
The fluctuations in the values of stocks , currencies , and commodities are often not random and uncorrelated and , as we have seen recently , they need not be small .
Some other paradigm is needed to describe the workings of real markets .
ii .
More generally , the theory of competitive general equilibrium is based on assumptions that appear to be too idealized .
These include the assumption that at equilibrium prices are set so that all markets will clear no matter how the future unfolds and the assumption that each agent has a view on the value of all possible dated contingent goods [ 2 ] . iii .
Participants in markets do not have fixed preferences , but the theory of competitive general equilibrium assumes that they do .
Preferences change in time unpredictably due to changing tastes and circumstances as well as in response to innovations which introduce new products and eliminate the needs for old products , and we should acknowledge this .
The unforeseeable aspects of innovations renders risk assessments problematic .
iv .
There has been an unjustified extrapolation from simple models of markets with two participants and two goods ( or something similar ) to real markets with millions of participants and thousands of goods , a mistake we should not repeat .
v. Participants in markets do not have perfect knowledge , indeed their knowledge and beliefs about the market conditions are sometimes false or unreliable and different participants have different knowledge and beliefs .
We should acknowledge this freedom because it is not the case , as sometimes assumed , that the lack of perfect knowledge by traders averages out as noise .
vi .
This has the effect that swings in belief can crash markets and hurt people even when much of the machinery of the goods and services economy is healthy and prepared to function well with an orderly availability of capital .
vii .
Increasing returns can lead to path dependence in the economy so that the evolution of an economy will depend on historical contingencies .
This makes prediction and risk assessment difficult .
viii .
There appears to be a basic lack of appreciation of the importance of relative scales .
This is because of the misapplication of the neoclassical paradigm that the markets operate near equilibrium .
Financial instruments such as derivatives indeed can do little harm except to those who use them , so long as they represent only a fraction of a market .
However , an extremely dangerous situation emerges when their use grows to the point where so much equity is pledged in the resulting contracts that a movement in the markets in a non-random direction can introduce an instability in which the contracts are called but cannot possibly be fulfilled .
Any meaningful discussion about whether a novel financial instrument requires regulation must involve the scale of its use .
3 ) Does science , including economics , offer an alternative basis for conceptualizing a theory of economic markets ?
The answer is yes .
For one thing , a critique of the neoclassical paradigm has been developing from within economics as well as from the study of complex systems for the last twenty years .
To this can be added other insights about how to describe markets which depart from neoclassical assumptions .
These can be combined to yield a new scientific conceptualization of economic systems .
This needs to be developed before it can yield precise detailed models of the economy of sufficient complexity to be reliable .
But it offers a lot of promise .
Key components of this view and the methodologies that underlie it include the following .
1 ) The economy is a physical system , involving flows of goods , information and energy , hence it might be useful to model an economy as a system in physics .
However , while there is a concept of equilibrium in neoclassical economic theory , the concept of equilibrium in physics is not applicable to economies because it applies only to particular kinds of systems called closed systems .
These are closed off from the outside world and have fixed unchanging amounts of the goods that compose them .
They have fixed amounts of energy , which can not be added to or subtracted from the outside .
Markets are not describable as closed systems , so the notion of their being in physical equilibrium cannot be applied .
2 ) Instead , markets are examples of systems physicists call open systems .
They do not have fixed amounts of goods or currencies .
They are situated inside larger open systems including the biosphere and energy and materials flows through them from the larger system that contains it .
3 ) Flows of energy and goods through an open system can drive its selforganization to meta - stable states .
These states are not like equilibrium in that fluctuations around them are neither small , nor random , nor uncorrelated .
4 ) Instead of being in equilibrium , markets can be understood as self - organized critical systems .
This is a theoretical construct that can be usefully applied to real markets .
It leads one to expect that in steady states markets are approximately scale invariant .
This implies a prediction for how certain quantities will be distributed in an economy , which includes wealth , income , sizes of firms , populations of cities , and total values of currencies .
The prediction is that these distributions are power laws and the prediction is observed in the real economy .
5 ) Complexity matters .
In neoclassical economics many conclusions are drawn from studying situations with two traders and two goods ( or similar simplifications ) .
The conclusions from modeling these and other simple systems are then applied to real economies with millions of participants and thousands of goods .
The new paradigm finds that the qualitative features of real economies cannot be correctly captured by such simple models , because basic features of how they work depend on their size and complexity .
6 ) Heterogeneity matters .
In the real world participants have very incomplete knowledge of markets and different players know different things .
Different players also have different strategies which persistently co-evolve and change as the market , partially engendered by those changing strategies , itself changes .
This renders risk assessment in financial instruments difficult .
This diversity cannot be modeled by neoclassical economics , but it can be modeled by new techniques such as complex adaptive systems .
7 ) Economic growth is driven by the development of cycles of materials , goods , energy and money , which are analogous to cycles which comprise ecological systems .
These cycles are understood as basic components of self - organized systems that are far from equilibrium .
Neoclassical economics studies flows that do not generally close into cycles and hence miss the key issues regarding stability and instability of an economy .
8 ) There is a lot of experience modeling ecological systems , which are similar to economies , in that they are open systems which self - organize due to flows of energy and material .
This gives us a methodological basis for theorizing an economy in a way in which the role of energy is intrinsic and issues such as what we do with the inevitable waste products of industrial processes necessarily arise .
9 ) Time scales matter .
Different functional cash to cash cycles have very different time scales .
Instabilities can be easily introduced by too strongly coupling processes on different time scales .
10 ) Complex systems can function in different phases , analogous to the different phases of matter : solid , liquid , and gas .
Some of these are more hospitable to us than others .
Transitions between phases can be abrupt and disruptive .
Regulators of economic systems would do well to keep track of measures that indicate proximity to phase transitions and act to avoid them .
11 ) There is a natural language for describing and quantifying departures from the conditions of equilibrium described by neoclassical theory .
These are important because these are conditions in which the assumptions that go into the design of many complex financial instruments such as derivatives cease to be reliable .
This physics , but their general importance to economics was discovered only recently by Pia Malaney and Eric Weinstein [ 3 ] .
This gives us a concept called curvature that measures how far a market is from equilibrium , how much markets fail to clear , how large arbitrage opportunities are , and the effects of changing preferences .
12 ) Economic markets can be described as networks of traders and transactions evolving in time .
There is a well developed theory of such networks , which provides a useful methodology and language for economic modeling .
For example , the notion of a small worlds network has been found to apply to economic systems as well as other networks in present use such as the internet .
Computer scientists have a lot of experience developing and using models of complex systems based on such networks .
13 ) The number of distinct goods and services , the kinds of companies , and the numbers of ways to make a living , have all grown dramatically over time .
This growth is driven by innovation and it in turn is a major cause of real economic growth .
Models such as neoclassical economics work with fixed baskets of goods and services and thereby miss the key driver of growth .
14 ) There is a limit to the accuracy of future predictions , because the innovations that drive the increasing diversity of the economy and economic growth generally cannot be reliably predicted .
But one can make an economy more or less hospitable to them .
These critiques of neoclassical economics point to the possibility of a new paradigm in economic theory and modeling .
Given that some of these points have been argued and studied for decades , by economists and others , it is pertinent to ask whether they have led to economic models , which have proved accurate in predicting the behavior of real markets .
There have been some successes , such as a model of the NASDAQ stock market [ 4 ] .
At the same time it cannot be said that the complexity point of view has led to a well developed economic theory that presently stands as a full alternative to the neoclassical paradigm .
For example , there has not been , to our knowledge , a large scale economic model built with these ideas which is presently up to the challenge of modeling the current complexities of the worlds financial markets .
So there remains much to be done to develop and test models based on these ideas and see how well they do applied to the real economy .
Nor do these new ideas necessarily invalidate the successes of neoclassical economics .
The conclusion we draw from this is that much more work has to be done .
The good news is that both the successful aspects of the neoclassical paradigm and the newer ideas based on complex systems offer much scope for development of economics as a science .
What is needed is an open - minded development of economic theory , as in any area of science , based on the development of detailed models , through which the applicability of different principles and hypothesis can be compared with real world data .
The real success of the American economy has been in its functioning well as an incubator for innovation in real goods and services .
This has given us expertise and technology , which has now led to the invention of financial instruments whose use , in a failed theoretical context , largely unregulated or comprehended , threatens to undo all the economic progress of the last decades .
The question in front of us is whether the same spirit of innovation can be applied to the principles of economic theory that governs financial markets so as to base the design and regulation of those markets on correct and verifiable principles and models .
4 ) What is to be done ? " … since the early 1980s … the way we train people to think … in main - stream economics … has left them almost unable anymore to distinguish the surface from the underlying reality .
Not only was it the age of Reagan and the beginning of market fundamentalism that came in the early 80s , and the rational expectations revolution and all the rest , but a fundamental break in how we actually train our students to think .
… Because the new kind of economic modeling , that won all the Nobel prizes said : you do n't have to understand the deep picture …
You do n't really have to know underlying mechanisms in the economy because the prices reflect the underlying mechanism . "
— Jeffrey Sacks , remarks at Earth Institute ( Columbia University ) , October 20 , 2008 .
Classical economic theory was a product of the enlightenment , invented by philosophers who wanted to contribute to the growth of liberal democracy .
They taught us how to construct societies conducive to human dignity based on a balance between cooperation and the freedom to pursue life , liberty and happiness .
The highpoint of the enlightenment was the mutual influence of Newton , Locke and Montesquieu , who in turn influenced the founding fathers to adopt principles of government they believed came from observations of nature .
It is in the spirit of their shared values and idealism that we today call for a renewal of the enlightenment approach to rationally understanding and governing human societies .
In the last century , science has developed new tools with which to understand complex and evolving systems such as the economy .
We ask economists , other scientists and policy makers to work together to develop a new approach to conceptualizing and modeling the economy that is reliable enough to serve as a guide for building and regulating stable markets .
How are we to bring about such a transformation in economic theory ?
Let us separate the discussion into the immediate , near and long - terms .
The economic crisis has to be stabilized immediately .
This has to be carried out pragmatically , without undue ideology , and without reliance on the failed ideas and assumptions which led to the crisis .
Complexity science can help here .
For example , it is wrong to speak of " restoring the markets to equilibrium " , because the markets have never been in equilibrium .
We are already way ahead if we speak of " restoring the markets to a stable , self - organized critical state . "
In the near - term , Eric Weinstein has spoken about an " economic Manhattan project " .
This means getting a group of good scientists together , some who know a lot about economics and finance , and others , who have proved themselves in other areas of science but bring fresh minds and perspectives to the challenge , to focus on developing a scientific conceptualization of economic theory and modeling that is increasingly reliable .
To accomplish this , research has to be done to develop a new paradigm for economic theory and modeling markets .
This research has to be carried out as the science it is , which is to say that assumptions must be tested against the real world , alternative theories must be developed and refined , and these must be compared with one another and tested again .
In all of this work economists , accountants and financial mathematicians should join forces with complexity theorists and other scientists with the goal of remaking economic theory and modeling so that it can offer reliable guidance for the organization and regulation of stable financial markets .
The research has to be carried out in an interdisciplinary and open spirit .
The goal of this research is a new scientific conceptualization of economics and economic modeling which can provide reliable advice in constructing , running and regulating financial institutions and markets so that they serve the purpose of growth and stability in the standard of living of all people .
Financial firms and markets must innovate to serve their larger purpose in providing efficient capital flows for the growth and innovation of real goods and services as well as a safe repository for our collective savings .
Innovation in methods of speculation that are unrelated to stable production of goods and services and the efficient flow of capital within the system must be recognized and discouraged .
If this research succeeds then a discussion of whether a given financial instrument should be allowed or how it should be regulated should not be a matter of opinion or ideology .
It should be based on detailed modeling and data taken from real world experiment and treated with the scrutiny brought to the introduction of a new airplane .
In the longterm , there needs to be an independent , non-partisan methodology for economic and financial modeling which involves globally agreed upon standards , as in the world of climate modeling .
As in that world , one can imagine an international commission of economic scientists who develop , test and benchmark economic models against each other , and against past data , so that there is a reliable understanding of what the best models are and how reliable they are for studying different kinds of problems and predicting the impacts of proposed new economic and financial regulation .
This will allow new proposals for innovative financial instruments or changes in trading rules or accounting rules to be tested in an open environment using best practices to understand their results .
An economy involves finding balance between long - and short - term objectives , acceptable distributions of wealth , and rewards for innovation and risk taking .
Different governments may embrace different social philosophies and may seek to establish economic and financial regulations to obtain somewhat different desired results .
The role of an independent , non-partisan scientific conceptualization of economics should be to provide these policy makers with a notion as to the likelihood that new economic and financial regulations they are considering will have the results they desire and that these will not involve unintended consequences to others .
One can also imagine that in the long term the software used to model markets and economies should be expected to be open , so that it can be critiqued and improved on by experts , whether they work in business , academia or government , and irrespective of the country in which they work .
Perhaps at this uncertain point it is good to end with a vision of what a broader scientific approach to modeling economic markets might lead to .
As a result of increases in airplane safety and rigorous application of risk management procedures there have been fewer and fewer crashes per mile flown over the last decades .
This has not damped innovation — new airplanes are regularly introduced incorporating improvements in engines , constructions and instrumentation .
What we can aim for is a financial system similarly designed and regulated according to sound and tested scientific principles so that crashes and crises once a decade or so become a thing of the past , and in which innovation of goods and services thrives in a stable economic environment .

An Ontario Superior Court judge has ordered a Toronto man to continue paying child support even though a DNA test shows he is not the biological father of his ex-wife 's twins .
In her ruling , Madam Justice Katherine van Rensburg decided that even though Pasqualino Cornelio did not father twins – now 16 – with Anciolina Cornelio , he must continue to pay child support because " he was the only father the twins knew during the course of the marriage . "
Pasqualino began paying child support in 1998 , after the couple separated .
In 2002 , the two agreed to joint custody , when they also settled that he would continue to provide monetary support .
But after Anciolina asked for an increase in payments and a reduction in the time he spent with the children , Pasqualino demanded a DNA test .
When the results showed Pasqualino was not the father , he asked to be excused from paying child support and demanded he be reimbursed for tens of thousands of dollars that he had paid in the past .
He claimed that their 2002 agreement failed to disclose that Anciolina had an affair while they were married , calling it an act of fraud or misrepresentation .
But according to van Rensburg , it should not be a question of whether he is the biological parent , but rather whether he was considered a parent by definition .
" Cornelio denies knowledge of who the twins ' biological father might be , " van Rensburg said .
" In fact , she claims to have no memory of an extramarital affair preceding their birth , which she attributes to the medication she was taking at the time . "
In the end , van Rensburg ruled in favour of Anciolina .
" The relationship that developed from the time of their birth was the natural relationship between a parent and his children , " she said .
" The fact of that relationship – even if it has now become strained – is sufficient to require Mr. Cornelio to continue to contribute toward the children 's material needs . "

Because Anciolina can't remember the affair , she claims she has no idea who the twins ' father is .
The judge concluded that the children should not suffer because of the parents ' wrongdoings .
A logic bomb allegedly planted by a former engineer at mortgage finance company Fannie Mae last fall would have decimated all 4,000 servers at the company , causing millions of dollars in damage and shutting down Fannie Mae for a least a week , prosecutors say .
Unix engineer Rajendrasinh Babubha Makwana , 35 , was indicted ( .pdf ) Tuesday in federal court in Maryland on a single count of computer sabotage for allegedly writing and planting the malicious code on Oct. 24 , the day he was fired from his job .
The malware had been set to detonate at 9:00 a.m. on Jan. 31 , but was instead discovered by another engineer five days after it was planted , according to court records .
Makwana , an Indian national , was a consultant who worked full time on - site at Fannie Mae 's massive data center in Urbana , Maryland , for three years .
On the afternoon of Oct. 24 , he was told he was being fired because of a scripting error he'd made earlier in the month , but he was allowed to work through the end of the day , according to an FBI affidavit ( . pdf ) in the case .
" Despite Makwana 's termination , Makwana 's computer access was not immediately terminated , " wrote FBI agent Jessica Nye .
Five days later , another Unix engineer at the data center discovered the malicious code hidden inside a legitimate script that ran automatically every morning at 9:00 a.m .
Had it not been found , the FBI says the code would have executed a series of other scripts designed to block the company 's monitoring system , disable access to the server on which it was running , then systematically wipe out all 4,000 Fannie Mae servers , overwriting all their data with zeroes .
" This would also destroy the backup software of the servers making the restoration of data more difficult because new operating systems would have to be installed on all servers before any restoration could begin , " wrote Nye .
As a final measure , the logic bomb would have powered off the servers .
The trigger code was hidden at the end of the legitimate program , separated by a page of blank lines .
Logs showed that Makwana had logged onto the server on which the logic bomb was created in his final hours on the job .
Makwana is free on a $ 100,000 signature bond .
His lawyer did n't immediately return a phone call Thursday .

Intriguing edges are created as the charged particles stream away , eventually losing energy as they interact with the pulsar 's strong magnetic field .
With more mass than the Sun and the density of an atomic nucleus , the spinning pulsar itself is the collapsed core of a massive star .
The stellar core collapse resulted in a supernova explosion that was witnessed in the year 1054 .

Boeing has shot down an incoming unmanned aerial vehicle using their new Laser Avenger system , which you can see in the picture .
According to Boeing 's VP for Directed Energy Systems , this is crucial :
Small UAVs armed with explosives or equipped with surveillance sensors are a growing threat on the battlefield .
Laser Avenger , unlike a conventional weapon , can fire its laser beam without creating missile exhaust or gun flashes that would reveal its position .
As a result , Laser Avenger can neutralize these UAV threats while keeping our troops safe .

The Laser Avenger is mounted on the kinetic - based Avenger air defense system .
However , no kinetic weapons were used in taking down the UAV .
Tested at the White Sands Missile Range - a 3,200 - square - mile rocket range in New Mexico , the largest military installation in the US - the Laser Avenger tracked three UAVs flying " against a complex background of mountains and desert " , shooting down one of the UAVs .
The test success comes after the company doubled the laser power and added acquisition and tracking capabilities to the original design .

First UK supermarket chain – and Britain 's biggest farmer – to prohibit chemicals implicated in the death of over one - third of British bees
The Co-op today became the first UK supermarket to ban the use of a group of pesticides implicated in billions of honeybee deaths worldwide .
It is prohibiting suppliers of its own - brand fresh produce from using eight pesticides that have been connected to honeybee colony collapse disorder and are already restricted in some parts of Europe .
The Co-op said it will eliminate the usage of the neonicotinoid family of chemicals where possible and until they are shown to be safe .
The Co-op has over 70,000 acres of land under cultivation in England and Scotland , making it the largest farmer in the UK .
Since 2001 , it has already prohibited the use of 98 pesticides under its pesticide policy .
Simon Press , senior technical manager at the Co-op group said : " We believe that the recent losses in bee populations need definitive action , and as a result are temporarily prohibiting the eight neonicotinoid pesticides until we have evidence that refutes their involvement in the decline . "
Laboratory tests suggest that one of the banned chemicals , imidacloprid , can impede honeybees ' sophisticated communication and navigation systems .
It has been banned in France for a decade as a seed dressing on sunflowers .
Italy , Slovenia and Germany banned neonicotinoids last year after the loss of millions of honeybees .
And the European Parliament voted earlier this month for tougher controls on bee - toxic chemicals .
Paul Monaghan , the Co-op 's head of social goals accused the UK government of failing to recognise that " pesticides could be a contributing factor " in the breakdown of nature 's number one pollinating machine .
Elliott Carnell , coordinator of Pesticide Action Network ( Pan ) Europe , said he hoped the Co-op 's pioneering stance would persuade the UK government to back the proposed European legislation .
" The government has fought against any attempts to protect bees , which pollinate a third of the average diet .
It argues that banning pesticides jeopardises crop yields , but if that was the case why would a leading food retailer be introducing this measure ? "
The pesticide ban is part of the Co-op 's 10 - point Plan Bee launched today , which includes £ 150,000 for research into the impact of pesticides on the decline of honeybees in England , where more than a third of hives were wiped out last year .
It will also give away bee - friendly wildflower seeds to Co-op members and customers .
After seeing the rapid rise of Tip'd , I figured it would be a good idea to interview Muhammad Saleem , a social media addict who knows social media both from site manager and site participant perspectives .
You can follow him on Twitter .
How did you get into social media ?
I got into social media by reading James Surowiecki's Wisdom of the Crowds .
I think it 's one of the best books written so far on the topic .
The lessons from that book and Gladwell 's The Tipping Point are essential for anyone who truly wants to understand social , collaborative media , and viral marketing .
Some friends I know who have been actively involved in social media got burned out quickly .
How do you keep it interesting after years of experience ?
I think its important to love the fundamentals of social media , be interested in the relationships and conversations , and the theory behind it .
If you 're genuinely interested then you wo n't get bored , in fact , I read 2 - 3 books a month on the topic and each one makes me appreciate it even more ( I'm currently reading Groundswell ) .
On larger sites is social media largely a game of reciprocal voting , or is there something deeper to it ?
I think a lot of people misunderstand what reciprocal voting really is .
Consider this , people that are friends usually have similar interests and preferences ( hence they bond and are friends ) , and when you have similar interests and preferences , of course there is going to be a large degree of voting for each others content .
Keeping that in mind , I really do n't see this as you rub my back and I 'll rub yours , it 's more like we share the same interests , we are friends , and naturally vote on each others submissions .
When there are thousands of people hunting for stories how do you manage to find new ones that have not yet been discussed ?
Do publishers give you exclusives ?
There are definitely people who message me and say ' Hey , do you think this story would do well on Digg ( or StumbleUpon , or ... ) , and since they are friends or acquaintances , if the content is good , I see no reason why it should n't get exposure .
Apart from that , I really do n't have to ' hunt ' for content much .
I usually find most of my submissions when I 'm just browsing my favorite websites and other social news sites .
From talking to friends it seems there is a lot of payola in social media .
What percent of the top 100 and top 1000 contributors to sites like Digg , Reddit , Propeller , and StumbleUpon engage in payola ?
There is quite a bit of payola that goes on but fortunately that 's all short - term because the sites and users get banned pretty quickly .
I routinely get some pretty spammy emails about payola and without exception I forward them to abuse@digg.com and let them deal with it .
How heavy is the user overlap amongst the big social media sites ?
The user overlap is pretty heavy in terms of registrations but it's not that heavy in terms of activity .
For example , most of the top users on Digg are also on StumbleUpon and Reddit , but Digg is their primary social news activity , and they participate much less on the others .
The same is the case for many top Stumblers and Reddit users , they will be on multiple sites but use them much less than their primary community .
How does a person decide if social media should be a core part of their marketing strategy ?
It all depends on what your conversion goals are and what vertical you 're in .
For example , if you 're trying to get affiliate sales , make money from advertisement , get newsletter ( or other ) subscriptions , and so on , social news is probably the worst place you could go because most of those users have adblock plus installed and have a severe case of banner blindness .
You should consider the following : your demographic , their social technographics profile , their interests and preferences , and your conversion goals before deciding if social media should be part of your online marketing strategy .
Even then , most people default to Digg - social news is just one aspect , do n't forget social networking , online video , online communities and forums , and so on .
What sort of marketing tips would you give to a person who said that their site simply did not fit existing social media sites ?
People focus too much on social media sites and often have too narrow a definition of the term ( i.e. social news - Digg ) .
First of all , I doubt that ' social media ' wont work for any niche , there is always rudimentary stuff like sharing content on microblogging or aggregator sites ( Twitter and FriendFeed ) or social networks ( Facebook ) .
And if that does n't work , go back to the basics and participate in your blogging community , which is something you should be doing anyway .
Work with other bloggers in your niche to increase both your audience and give them exposure .
When Tip 'd launched you got a lot of coverage from bloggers .
What was key to making that happen ?
Were you surprised with that level of coverage ?
We did n't hire a PR firm or write up an official press release .
Instead we reached out to people who we had relationships with and asked them if they could do a write - up , and only approached sites whose audience would enjoy the coverage .
Actually I was personally a bit disappointed with the coverage .
It seems I gave too much credit to some ' pundits ' and ' gurus ' who ultimately did n't have the foresight to appreciate why Tip'd is an important development in the social space .
What were some of the biggest keys to getting Tip 'd up and growing ?
There are several important considerations .
The site has to function properly and has to be simple enough so that Joe non-techie can use it but also robust enough that more tech - savvy users can enjoy it .
It has to score high on design , usability , and branding .
You need to have a good pitch to draw people in .
And finally you need to build relationships with publishers in the space .
We were able to avoid the ' chicken and egg problem ' of " no one wants to participate if there is no existing community , but you can't build a community if no one participates " by building and leveraging relationships with key players in the personal finance and financial news blogosphere .
What is the biggest mistake you feel you guys have made with Tip 'd so far ?
I do n't think we 've made any missteps so far .
If the is limited in anyway , it 's because we have decided to build , market , and grow it entirely ourselves and without taking funding from anyone .
Think about this , it is a bootstrapped operation that started with $ 25,000 in funding , took 3 weeks to launch , and did n't push for any pr .
Even with all that , our growth rate and the feedback is largely positive .
Just yesterday a marketer messaged me and said " even with 24 votes , a front page story on Tip 'd sent me 100 visitors , while with 75 votes on Mixx , they only send about 25 visitors . "
If a site with $ 25,000 in funding is already driving a larger audience than one with $ 3.5 million in funding and relationships with mainstream media , I think we 've come a long way in three months .
Many niche social news sites have come to market .
How many of these do you think will be successful and still around 5 years from now ?
What will separate those that succeed from those that fail ?
I do n't think even 25 % of them will succeed .
The problem , I believe , is that they are all self - centered and do n't have a forward thinking vision .
What will separate the successes from the failures is a focus on the site 's own community , but also relationships with publishers .
Community participation is one aspect of growth on social news sites , but people really underestimate how big a role online publishers and marketers play .
Like a Centre Pompidou of cinema , Watkins is forever laying bare the arti­fice .
Fiction and nonfiction merge : non-actors improvise roles in fictional accounts of factual events ( the effect is very reality - TV ) ; and the contrivance inherent in any media narrative is exposed as Watkins shows the cameras , the sets , his directorial technique .
His endlessly recursive gambits serve as a metatextual critique of how fact and fiction are just different ways to impose narrative — and yet they never seem like academic posing ; indeed , they carry an amazing emotional wallop .
It helps that he ’s able to extract remarkable performances from nonprofessionals .
In La Commune , the actors , many residents of working - class neighborhoods not dissimilar from the ones that bred the Communards , break character to discuss their roles .
In Punishment Park , a 1970 faux - documentary loosely inspired by the trial of the Chicago Seven , young activists who bear more than a passing similarity to the likes of Abbie Hoffman and Bobby Seale improvise their way through a story that ’s chillingly apposite to the age of Guantánamo and other black - box prisons .
Shot in the style of much of the Vietnam War coverage of the time ( shaky handheld cameras rushing through the underbrush , de- centered framing , panting newsmen ) , the movie follows two groups of prisoners who are allowed to race through the California desert in the hope of reaching an American flag 53 miles away , shadowed by county troopers and other uniformed goons .
Ostensibly a “ National Network ” TV - news account of an alternative - sentencing program for political dissidents , Park gets great mileage out of the way the vacant , macho police types and government officials emasculate the media observers , who are left sputtering at an injustice they can do nothing to stop .
( Hilariously , the officials have set up a catering tent in the desert — a poor man ’s Doha . )
But Park also helps clarify why Watkins is n’t more widely known .
His Village Voice–circa 1975 politics , which make parts of the film seem as dated as the most pretentious Lina Wertmüller , are at once sentimental and punitively moralistic — as if continuing in your bourgeois existence after watching one of his films is a form of ethical suicide .
Nobody likes a didact .
Or a martyr : Watkins reacted to his travails with the BBC like a delicate flower , too sensitive for this world .
The director , now 72 , repeatedly pursued self - exile : to Sweden , Lithuania , and Canada .
Featured in a major retrospective in Toronto in 2004 , he refused to attend after a Globe and Mail essay that called him a “ genius ” also took issue with his politics .
Stunts like these , and his allegedly shirty interactions with potential financial backers , have made it easy for the industry to find excuses not to support his work .
But the world his early films anticipated is the world we inhabit now .
Like no filmmaker before or since , Watkins captures the constant manipulation and counter­manipulation of the modern media , the push - pull of image projection and message management that has blurred the line between news and propaganda .
His films are testaments to central truths of the current media environment : that mere logic is powerless against a brilliant projection of personality , that self - conscious “ objectivity ” and truth - telling are very different things , and that compelling narrative is impervious to facts .
From the selling of the Iraq War to the selling of Sarah Palin , Watkins , like Orwell before him , shows how we are lied to , and how we lie to ourselves .
Well , it looked mor simpler than it iz ...

One banking expert said : " Barclays has spent the past few days insisting it has enough capital .
That would be fine in normal circumstances , but these are not .
The Government has made it completely clear that it will not allow the banks to fail and everyone knows that nationalisation is very much on the table . "
ATLANTA ( Reuters ) - Opposition to a massive Wall Street bailout plan has quickly emerged on conservative talk radio , with hosts and callers saying the rescue undermines principles at the heart of the Republican Party .
Radio show host Rush Limbaugh speaks at a forum hosted by the Heritage Foundation in Washington , June 23 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Micah Walter
Tens of millions of conservatives tune in to AM talk radio , trusting nationally syndicated hosts such as Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity , Laura Ingraham and Neal Boortz over media outlets they say have a liberal bias .
“ I really do n’t like this ( proposal ) , ” said Lance from North Carolina on the “ Today ’s Issues ” program broadcast on Christian radio stations across America .
“ This nation was ... built on individualism as far as profit and responsibility .
And with us bailing these banks out we ’re ... saying any time you get into trouble we ’re going to come bail you out , ” he said on Friday , in a view echoed by callers on several shows .
President George W. Bush has urged swift passage of the $ 700 billion measure .
But talks in Congress have stalled on the opposition of conservative Republicans , and both parties appear wary of fully backing a measure that could prove an electoral liability .
“ If this ( plan ) was so good , they ( Democrats ) should pass it .
They should brag about it .
They should take credit for it .
But the Democrats understand that this bill is dirty , ” said Limbaugh , the most popular of the talk show hosts .
Democrats are aiming to use talks over the rescue plan to get Republicans to repudiate their principles and reject their grass - roots supporters , Limbaugh said .
CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES
Talk radio in the United States features long monologues by the host and calls from listeners that often reinforce the host ’s opinion .
Several conservative talk show hosts argue that they are engaged in a long struggle to return the Republican Party to its guiding ideology of small government , low taxes and strong national defense .
Some view Republican candidate John McCain as an unreliable conservative who has made too many compromises with Democrats on crucial issues such as immigration reform and campaign finance .
Boortz , who calls himself a libertarian , said both parties were to blame for the financial crisis that started in the housing market by encouraging banks to make bad loans .
But he said Democrats now want to turn the bailout plan into a “ financial Christmas tree ” with goodies for left - wing community groups that could help them during November ’s election .
“ This situation ( on Wall Street ) does not arise without government participation .
It is not the excesses of the free market alone .
It is excesses of the free market that are enabled and supported by government action , ” said Boortz , whose program ’s slogan is “ The Truth Shall Make You Mad . ”
GINGRICH SPEAKS OUT
Conservative icon and former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich told Boortz the plan was a bad idea made worse by the intervention of liberal Democrats who wished to add provisions that would enrich lawyers and further weaken the economy .
Thankfully , conservative Republicans had put a stop to it , said Gingrich .
The plan puts conservatives in a bind , and that it was proposed by a Republican president further blurs distinctions , said Alan Abramowitz , a professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta .
Either they swallow it , violating free market principles they hold dear , or they oppose it and risk seeing confidence in the free market system evaporate .
“ This is an ideological problem .
If you are conservative and you believe in small government and the free market , if you fail that ’s your problem .
That ’s the way the market is supposed to work , ” he said .

Anger over the Israeli assault on Gaza spilled into Times Square on Saturday , as hundreds of protesters condemned the attacks in a demonstration that stretched four blocks and clogged much of the city ’s central tourist district for several hours .
The protest came as Israeli troops began a ground incursion into the Hamas - controlled territory in what officials described as an effort to end Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israel .
The land campaign followed eight days of Israeli airstrikes that have killed more than 430 Palestinians , many of them civilians .
News of the escalation came midway through the demonstration and cast a pall over the crowd as it was announced over loudspeakers and crept across the news tickers nearby .
But many protesters said they were not surprised , and some sounded a defiant note .
“ As organized as the Palestinian community is here in the United States , we already knew this was going to happen , and I think the Palestinian people in Gaza have expected it , ” said Linda Sarsour , 28 , a Palestinian - American social worker from Bay Ridge , Brooklyn , home to one of the country ’s oldest Arab communities .
“ Now it ’s time for Israel to come in and face the people on the ground .
It ’s all - out war now , and we ’ll see what happens . ”

Human beings tend to think they ’re rational creatures , and that they make sound decisions based on all the available facts .
They think their memory is an accurate record of things that have happened to them .
But the reality is that we all have a slew of cognitive biases that can alter our thinking … and even our memories .
Psychologists have names for all the different fallacies and biases that influences our thinking : cognitive dissonance , inattentional blindness , blind spot bias , better - than - average bias , introspection illusion , self - serving bias , attribution bias , representative fallacy , availability fallacy , anchoring fallacy , hindsight bias , and the one I ’ll be talking about here : framing effects
The way a question is “ framed ” often has an influence on how people answer that question , that ’s what the term framing effects means .
For example , look at this classic study done on framing :
Let ’s say you work for the Centers for Disease Control and there is an outbreak of a deadly disease called “ The Mojave Flu ” in a town of 600 people .
All 600 people in the town are expected to die if you do nothing .
Let ’s say you have come up with two different programs designed to fight to the disease : With Program 1 : 200 people in the town will be saved
With Program 2 : There is a 1/3rd probability that 600 people will be saved , and a 2 / 3rds probability that no people will be saved .
In the study , 72 percent of the subjects picked Program 1 .
Now consider the same scenario worded differently : With Program 3 : 400 people in the town will die
With Program 4 : There is a 1/3rd probability that nobody will die , and a 2 / 3rds probability that 600 people will die .
Now which do you pick ?
In the study , 78 percent of the subjects picked Program 4 , even though the net result of the second set of choices is exactly the same as the first set ( Programs 1 and 3 mean the same thing , and Programs 2 and 4 mean the same thing ) .
In Aldert Vrij ’s book Detecting Lies and Deceit , he describes an even more interesting example :
Participants saw a film of a traffic accident and then answered questions about the event , including the question ‘ About how fast were the cars going when they contacted each other ? ’
Other participants received the same information , except that the verb ‘ contacted ’ was replaced by either hit , bumped , collided , or smashed .
Even though all of the participants saw the same film , the wording of the questions affected their answers .
The speed estimates ( in miles per hour ) were 31 , 34 , 38 , 39 , and 41 , respectively .
One week later , the participants were asked whether they had seen broken glass at the accident site .
Although the correct answer was ‘ no , ’ 32 % of the participants who were given the ‘ smashed ’ condition said that they had .
Hence the wording of the question can influence their memory of the incident .
That example highlights an unsettling aspect of framing effects , the fact that they can actually influence our memories .
This concept is used in advertising all the time , but the most fertile ground for framing effects is politics .
Buzzwords and political terms are constantly changing and being invented to try to stay on the positive side of public opinion .
Frank Luntz is a well - known example of a political consultant who has tried to work with Republican candidates on framing various talking points and buzzwords to make them more appealing to the general public .
Among other things , Luntz is responsible for the re-framing of the term “ global warming ” to “ climate change ” .
Framing effects are powerful , they have a profound influence on people , but when we recognize that these biases exist , we can gain some measure of control .
We all have to understand how fragile our brains and memories are , and that will strengthen them .
If we know these biases exist , it ’s easier to try to avoid them .
So the next time you hear a politician speaking or an advertisement telling you to buy some product , listen closely to it , and try to decipher it ’s real content .
It ’s one more step toward the eventual goal of overcoming bias .
Pinal County supervisors Wednesday bid goodbye to photo enforcement .
Their vote to terminate their contract with Redflex , the company that operates the cameras , came at the recommendation of the county 's top law - enforcement official , new Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu .
" I 'm against photo speed enforcement completely , " Babeu said , walking the three - member panel through a detailed PowerPoint presentation .
" Here in Pinal , it 's failed miserably . "
Babeu said speed cameras created dangerous road conditions and offered little financial benefit for the county .
He plans to boost traffic enforcement through additional manpower .
Although Pinal County 's contract with Redflex was n't set to expire until Feb. 20 , two mobile speed cameras have not been in operation on Pinal roads since Babeu took office Jan .
1 .
The speed vans had been roadside in some of Pinal 's most populous areas , including Apache Junction , Gold Canyon and unincorporated areas near Queen Creek , since mid-2007 .
The county 's program is separate from the one operated by the Arizona Department of Public Safety on freeways statewide .
The supervisors two weeks ago had tabled a vote on the Redflex contract because they wanted Babeu to prepare a report on camera enforcement in Pinal , including the financial impact on the county .
He reported Wednesday that the two cameras were activated 11,416 times from September 2007 through last month .
Of those activations , 7,290 resulted in citations , but only 3,711 were paid .
Babeu said most of the total $ 134,199.43 in fines and fees from the paid citations covered administrative and operational costs , leaving the county with a net profit of $ 12,391.58 that Babeu dismissed as paltry .
Moreover , Babeu said , total motor - vehicle accidents increased by 16 percent in the same time period , and fatal collisions in the Queen Creek area doubled from three to six .
The sheriff said he could n't be certain that speed cameras were to blame for the crashes , but he believes they were a factor .
Collisions were said to be the reason Redflex was implemented on county roads .
Former Sheriff Chris Vasquez initiated the contract to minimize an increasing number of crashes on Hunt Highway , the main thoroughfare connecting north - central Pinal County with Maricopa County .
Babeu thinks that putting more deputies on patrol offers the best way to improve safety , instead of relying on cameras that " ca n't catch drunk drivers " or stop motorists involved in illegal or dangerous activities .
The sheriff has increased his traffic - enforcement unit from two to four deputies , and a fifth will join the team soon .
Babeu said the changes were made at no county cost as part of a departmentwide reorganization .
Babeu estimated that the volume of citations issued annually by the Sheriff 's Office would increase sharply as a result of having more deputies on the streets .
He said the five - member team alone could generate 10,400 to 20,800 citations a year .
Supervisor Bryan Martyn , whose district was the primary operating area for the speed vans , said he received a number of letters from residents who favored speed - camera enforcement , but he " does n't presume to tell the sheriff how to do his job . "
" He believes he has a better solution to this public - safety concern , " Martyn said .
" What he 's proposing is prudent and seems to make sense .
If it goes as sold , you may be praying for photo radar again . "
Babeu may answer those prayers in a different way .
He wants to bring red - light cameras to the county .
ROME ( Reuters ) - Pope Benedict ’s point man for justice and peace issues on Wednesday issued the Vatican ’s toughest criticism of Israel since the latest Mideast crisis began , calling Gaza a “ big concentration camp . ”
Cardinal Renato Martino , president of the Vatican ’s Council for Justice and Peace , made his comments in an interview in the Italian online newspaper Il Sussidiario.net .
“ Defenceless populations are always the ones who pay .
Look at the conditions in Gaza : more and more , it resembles a big concentration camp , ” Martino , whose informal title is Vatican “ justice minister , ” was quoted as saying .
Pope Benedict has made several general appeals for an end to the violence in Gaza but has not openly criticised Israel .
The pope is due to visit Holy Land sites in Jordan , Israel and the Israeli - occupied West Bank in May .
Rhodes is a new open source solution to bring Ruby development to mobile devices .
Even more : it allows to use a single Ruby source across many devices , currently iPhone , Windows Mobile and RIM 's BlackBerry , with support for Symbian and Android to follow soon .
The chance to deploy to the iPhone should be interesting , as it adds another option for iPhone development ( next to Objective - C ) .
Also : Rhodes and all it's necessary interpreters and libraries are open source , hosted at GitHub , a public bug tracker for Rhomobile 's projects is also available .
We talked to Adam Blum of Rhomobile about how exactly Rhodes works , and how they managed to get Ruby as a language for the iPhone .
The Platforms
The first question is of course about how Rhomobile made it possible to write Ruby apps on the iPhone .
Adam explains :
The answer is [..] we do bundle the developer 's app with our framework and a Ruby interpreter .
To be compliant on the AppStore app developers can't be downloading interpreted code on the fly from elsewhere .
It is the app developer 's responsibility to be abiding , and if they do want to be violating there are much simpler ways to do it than embedding a Ruby interpreter and downloading Ruby code from elsewhere .
The Ruby used on the iPhone is a recent Ruby 1.9 version .
Rhodes supports other platforms and plans to add more platforms where Ruby is available , for instance Symbian .
Supporting Rhodes and Ruby on the BlackBerry , where applications are written in Java , required a bit more effort .
Rhomobile chose an ambitious solution that uses XRuby .
XRuby is a Ruby version for Java which compiles Ruby code to Java class files .
Development of XRuby has slowed in the last year , but Rhomobile has taken XRuby , improved it , and is now using XRuby to run Rhodes applications on the RIM BlackBerry .
Adam also mentions :
We are working on Android , starting from our own Ruby that we did for the RIM implementation ( which is based on XRuby not JRuby )
Adam also mentions the need to keep the Ruby interpreters small , which has an effect on the supported Ruby libraries :
It 's definitely a subset .
This is part of the reason for the need to do our own framework .
We do a bunch of things to make it smaller and will continue to do more over time .
Some features , such as the eval ( ) are also not supported .
Since Rhomobile works with Ruby interpreters for mobile platforms , we asked Adam what he'd like to see to support that :
Hmm ... we 'd like to see Ruby implementors focused on making smaller implementations of Ruby plus more attention to the size cost of dependencies when people build useful add - on Gems .
But for now that 's sort of our job to do and that 's OK too .
How it works
Rhomobile aims to support many different mobile phone platforms , so they chose a way to build the cross platform applications Rhodes framework .
In short : Rhodes applications are web applications that run locally on the phone ( ie. the Ruby part of the application runs on the phone as well as the HTML GUI ) .
The GUI of these applications is defined as HTML and displayed using the browser component that 's available on all the phones .
Modern phones tend to have standard browsers , eg. the Webkit based Safari on the iPhone , which means that it 's possible to use normal web development methods to define applications , including using Javascript in the GUI .
Rhodes also takes care of making the GUI look like native GUI components on the individual platforms , eg. by using IUI on the iPhone GUIs .
But Rhodes adds another twist to this : some of the advanced features of modern smartphones are available to the Rhodes applications .
Currently available is geolocation information ; access to the accelerometer , camera and to the local PIM will be available in the next version due in January .
It 's possible to access these features with Ruby calls and as HTML tags in the HTML files , eg. :
< geolocation / >
will be shown as something like this :
37.3317° North , 122.0307° West ;37.331689;-122.030731
Starting work on a Rhodes application is as simple as with many other Ruby web frameworks , it starts with a generator :
rhogen app accountapp
This generates the basic application skeleton , with controllers and other apps .
More information is is available in the Rhodes Tutorial .
Another part of Rhodes is Rhom , an object mapper .
Rhomobile also has other libraries on GitHub , eg. Rhosync , which helps with synchronizing various data sources to the mobile phone .
Rhomobile 's projects are rather new - the current release is at version 0.1 , but a 0.2 release will be out by the end of the month with improved PIM access and GUI .
A 0.3 release is expected to be out by late January 2009 which should bring support for more platforms , access to more device features ( accelerometer , etc ) , as well as project hosting for Rhodes developers .
Finally it 's important to mention the Rhodes projects are open source and hosted at GitHub .
Rhomobile 's business model builds on dual licensing .
Rhodes applications are open source , but if a company wants to use Rhodes but keep its source closed , it can do so by getting a commercial license from Rhomobile .
Do you know of other cross platform solutions like Rhodes which offer a similar level of integration ?
Would you use Rhodes for writing an application ?
The Consumer Electronics Association ( CEA ) says that , if the Federal Communications Commission gives Hollywood a waiver on Selectable Output Control , 20 million HDTV sets will cease to function as they did when they were bought by U.S. consumers .
These controls limit the ability of consumers to send a broadcast to both their sets and other devices , but current FCC policy prohibits SOC use .
The request for a waiver from that policy comes from the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) .
The CEA is not pleased .
" The MPAA has not demonstrated why it should be permitted to disable the features and functionality of a consumer 's lawfully - purchased HDTV set , " three CEA Vice Presidents told the FCC in a meeting on Tuesday .
Might the 20 million figure be alarmist ?
Public Knowledge says the estimate is not high enough .
The advocacy group 's Gigi Sohn , Alex Curtis , and Jef Pearlman also met with the FCC this week , arguing that CEA 's figures do n't get at the extent of the impact .
" This number actually underestimates the size of the problem , " PK 's representatives charge , " because while none of those 20 million HDTVs will work if SOC is used to turn off analog outputs , an unknown number of additional home entertainment systems , DVRs , and other consumer electronics devices that rely on analog connections will also be effectively turned off , even if the TVs also have digital inputs . "
We 're too valuable
As Ars Technica has reported , the FCC launched a proceeding in June to decide whether to let video program distributors employ SOC , which the agency currently forbids , on behalf of the big movie studios .
The MPAA wants an exemption on that restriction for high - definition movies that are broadcast prior to their release on DVD .
Selectable Output Control allows a cable or satellite programming distributor to shut off analog and / or digital output on selected broadcasts , an option that MPAA says it wants studios to have if they begin to distribute early - run movies on cable .
The studios want to be able to close down the analog route and offer only digital content , which they see as more secure .
" The Petitioners ' theatrical movies are too valuable in this early distribution window to risk their exposure to unauthorized copying , " MPAA wrote to the FCC in May .
" Distribution over insecure outputs would facilitate the illegal copying and redistribution of this high value content , causing untold damage to the DVD and other ' downstream ' markets . "
Since then dozens of companies , content providers , and public interest groups have weighed in on the question — many charging that waiver request is vague and will give Hollywood and their cable partners too much power over home video equipment .
Meanwhile PK and CEA have been having a sort of statistical competition over how many consumer devices they think that this proposal will affect in some way .
Here 's how CEA gets its figures .
Its Market Activity Reports and Analysis ( MARA ) follows 30 product categories , in which it tracks factory - to - U.S. dealer consumer gadget shipments .
By this means , the trade group says manufacturers delivered almost 86 million HDTVs to U.S. stores from 1998 though September of 2008 .
29 percent of those receivers displayed HDTV content via a " component analog " connection alone ; that adds up to about 25 million sets .
CEA sets aside a fifth of those HDTVs to account for unused or dumped units .
That still leaves more than 20 million HDTVs affected by SOC — that is , " permanently incapable of receiving and displaying programming accessed via set - top boxes for which a content owner or distributor invokes Selectable Output Control . "
But wait , says Public Knowledge .
CEA 's estimate does not include DVRs and other devices that depend exclusively on analog connections .
" Further , because the waiver seeks the ability to turn off all existing analog and digital outputs , no current equipment is immune , " the group warns .
CEA recognizes some of this in a footnote to their filing .
Its 25 million figure does n't include home systems installed with analog connections , the trade group acknowledges .
Nor does it factor in " the large number of HDTVs with an insufficient number of digital interfaces to support multiple HD devices ( e.g. monitor , set - top box , DVR ) .
Consumers who purchased these HDTVs may be forced to buy expensive splitters in order to view SOC - triggered content . "
Beyond the question of how many devices will be affected by an SOC waiver , there seems to be a trust problem here , as evident from CEA 's concluding remarks .
MPAA promises " vaguely to distribute some unspecified type and amount of programming , somewhat earlier ( but how much earlier they refuse to specify ) than they are able to do so now , " CEA writes .
" This promise hardly amounts to an important public purpose . "
Cheaper than a babysitter
Ars Technica contacted various MPAA staffers about these concerns and got a bunch of e-mail auto - responder replies .
The intent of the studios is stated as being only to use SOC for the limited purpose of controlling the output for early run , pre-DVD release movies .
MPAA filings have argued that early run , pre-DVD release films will benefit consumers who can't afford or can't physically go to the movies .
" Consumers would be able to order from the comfort of their homes movies that are recently released in theaters , " the MPAA wrote to the FCC in its original Petition for Expedited Relief .
" At least some segment of nearly every demographic would find this option attractive when unable to go to the movie theater .
For example , physically challenged or elderly consumers who have limited mobility would have greater choice in movie viewing options .
It would similarly benefit parents who want to see a new movie , but who cannot find or afford a babysitter . "
It 's unclear when the FCC will decide this issue .
The formal deadline for comments and replies on the proceeding expired months ago .
Although the agency granted the MPAA 's request for an expedited comment period , making a call on this question does n't seem very high on the Kevin Martin administration 's list of priorities .
Ars can't predict what the next FCC will do with this potato .

The Real News looks into the case for prosecuting George Bush and Dick Cheney .
My thoughts ?
America will never recover from the Bush years unless they are held to account for the crimes they committed against the constitution :
An orphan instance is where you have a situation like this :
module
Foo where class
Foo a where foo :: a module Bar where newtype Bar = Bar Int module Baz where instance Foo Bar where foo = Bar 0
I.e. , a class is instantiated with a type in a module where neither the class nor the type was declared .
GHC issues a warning in this case , because it has to put that instance in a global table that is scanned for every compilation unit .
In non -orphan cases , it knows that the instance will be in scope , because at the point of usage , both the class an the type are in scope , so the instance came with one of them .
What happens if we change that warning into an error ?
No orphan instances allowed !
Wonderful things , that ’s what .
The most notable , in my opinion , being that the very common desire for superclassing is now perfectly acceptable ( modulo the many implementation concerns ) .
For example :
class Additive a where ( ^+^ ) :: a -> a -> a instance ( Num a ) =>
Additive a where ( ^+^ ) = (+)
The problem used to be that , let ’s say someone made a type Foo and instantiated it as Num and as Additive .
Which Additive instance do we use , the one here or the one they defined ?
This problem vanishes if we do n’t allow orphan instances , because Additive Foo and Num Foo would have to be instantiated in the same place , when Additive is in scope , and thus this superclass instance is in scope .
So the collision would be caught modularly at compile time ( that is , it ’s not when you just happen to use these two modules together that the universe explodes , it ’s precisely where the problem occurs ) .
The module that defined Foo would be informed that he is not allowed to define an Additive instance , because one was already defined for him .

BERKELEY , Calif . --
Pete Newell coached his last game nearly a half - century ago , but his impact on basketball is felt at the game 's highest level even today .
The beloved Hall of Fame coach , who won an NCAA championship and an Olympic gold medal and who later tutored some of the game 's greatest big men , died Monday .
He was 93 .
His death was confirmed by the University of California , the school Newell coached to a national title in 1959 .
Newell , who had been living near San Diego , had a serious lung operation in 2005 .
" I just do n't think anybody has contributed more to my life in more ways than Pete Newell did , " said Hall of Fame coach Bob Knight , Division I 's all - time victory leader , who coached three NCAA champions and also won Olympic gold .
" Jerry West and I had a very tearful conversation about an hour after Pete had passed away this morning and I think Jerry felt exactly the same about Pete as I did . "
Newell died at about 10:45 a.m. in Rancho Santa
Fe at the home of retired Dr. Earl Shultz , who played for Newell at Cal and had watched over him for the last several years .
Shultz said Newell had a meeting scheduled with West and a writer who was working on a book on West , who played for Newell 's 1960 U.S. Olympic basketball team .
Newell coached for 14 years at San Francisco , Michigan State and California before doctors advised him to give it up because of the emotional toll .
His final coaching job came in the 1960 Olympics , when he took a U.S. team led by Oscar Robertson , West and Jerry Lucas on a dominant run to a gold medal in Rome .
Newell later returned to prominence with his famous " big men " camps .
He instructed some of the game 's greatest stars , including Kareem Abdul - Jabbar , Bill Walton , Shaquille O'Neal and Ralph Sampson .
Among Newell 's biggest admirers was Knight , whose teams practiced Newell 's style of patient , disciplined offense and tenacious , hardworking defense .
" Pete was a second father to both Jerry and myself , and while I think that we 're awfully saddened by the passing I think that we can both feel extremely good about the relationship that we had with this basketball giant over most of our entire careers , " Knight said .
" Nobody contributed more to the game and its history than Pete . "
Newell was born in Canada but grew up in Los Angeles .
His mother envisioned an acting career for her son , and he appeared in several movies including " The Kid , " which made a star of Jackie Coogan .
He attended what is now Loyola Marymount University and served in the Navy during World War II .
Pete Newell was one of the few coaches to win NCAA , NIT and Olympic championships .

" He 's 93 .
He had a wonderful life , and it was just old age , " Shultz said .
" His health was not good , because they had removed two - thirds of his lung and he had smoked for many years .
It was starting to be a real struggle for him physically .
He was getting more weak and dwindling away a little bit . "
In 1946 he took a job at a small Catholic school , the University of San Francisco , coaching basketball as well as baseball , golf and tennis .
The Dons won the National Invitation Tournament in 1949 , when it was considered at least the equal of the NCAA tournament .
Following four seasons at USF , the last concluding with a return to the NIT , Newell moved to Michigan State .
His best season there was 1952 - 53 , when the Spartans went 13 - 9 overall and finished third in the Big Ten .
In 1954 , Newell was hired at California .
The Bears won four consecutive conference titles and made two trips to the Final Four , capturing the NCAA tournament in 1959 .
The starless Bears had to beat two future Hall of Famers on their way to the championship .
In the semifinals they defeated Robertson and Cincinnati 64 - 58 .
Then in the final , Cal beat West Virginia , which was led by West .
Showing it was no fluke , the Bears beat both teams again the following season with West and Robertson still in college .
Cal topped West Virginia 65 - 45 in a holiday tournament and knocked off Cincinnati 77 - 69 in the Final Four .
Cal lost the 1960 championship game 75 - 55 to Ohio State , which was led by Lucas , John Havlicek and Knight .
Emotionally high - strung , Newell lived on coffee , cigarettes and little else during the season .
He was told by doctors to leave full - time coaching , which he did in 1960 at age 44 .
His overall record was 234- 123 , and he beat UCLA 's John Wooden the last eight times they met .
Newell ended his coaching career in the Olympics , when the U.S. team won every game by at least 24 points .
" He probably impacted more people when he left coaching , " said Jeff Fellenzer , the former tournament director and president of the Pete Newell Challenge .
" He really reinvented himself .
He never took a dime working those camps .
He wanted to send a message to the NBA players it was n't about money . "
Newell served as athletic director at Cal from 1960 - 68 , a turbulent era on the Berkeley campus .
He worked for several NBA teams in a variety of capacities .
He was general manager of the Rockets when they were in San Diego and orchestrated the trade that brought Abdul - Jabbar to Los Angeles when he ran the Lakers .
He was later a consultant to the Warriors and a scout for the Cavaliers .
Newell is in part to credit for coming up with the " Golden State " name for the Warriors when they moved across San Francisco Bay to Oakland .
" This is obviously a very sad day for the game of basketball , whether you are associated with the NBA , college or high school ranks , " said Warriors coach Don Nelson , who knew Newell for more than 50 years .
" Pete was a great coach and a great man who had the ability to relate to players and people on every level , " he said .
" A countless number of coaches and players benefited from Pete 's tutelage over the years -- including those who attended his specialized camps each summer -- and will be indebted to him for the expertise and wisdom that he provided . "
Newell is survived by sons Pete Jr. , Roger , Tom and Greg , five grandchildren and a great - grandchild .
A Kentucky court order authorizing the seizure of 141 overseas domains has been overturned by the the Kentucky Court of Appeals .
The court ruled that the domain names , all related to online gambling , do not fall under the state 's definition of a " gambling device , " and therefore they can not be seized under that statute .
The original ruling came down in September of 2008 when a Franklin County Circuit judge issued an order giving the Commonwealth of Kentucky permission to seize control of some 141 illegal online gambling domains .
The court claimed that the state had the authorization to seize unlicensed and unauthorized " gambling devices , " and that Internet domains fell under that definition .
In order to regain control of their domains , site owners would either have to implement software to block Kentucky residents , or risk forfeiting their businesses .
Around the same time as the ruling , Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear ( who , incidentally , is the one who filed the lawsuit ) described Internet gambling sites as " a tremendous threat to the citizens of the commonwealth because of its ease , availability and anonymity . "
What he did n't point out is that it's a much larger threat to the state 's heralded horse - racing industry .
Two of the affected websites immediately appealed the decision , with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , ACLU , and the Center for Democracy and Technology joining them soon thereafter with an amicus brief to argue that the initial seizure ruling was flawed .
The organizations argued that the registrars that handle the domains are n't based in Kentucky and that the state had n't demonstrated jurisdiction over them .
They also pointed out that the ruling would allow Kentucky to effectively control commerce in other states and nations , which goes beyond the Constitution .
Finally , the organizations emphasized that the ruling could " chill " speech of all types .
" If the Kentucky order is upheld , no speech that conflicts with any law , anywhere in the world , would be safe from censorship , " stated the CDT 's John Morris .
" Just as Kentucky is trying to take down sites located around the world , any government seeking to stifle free expression could try to interfere with lawful speech hosted in the United States . "
The Court of Appeals , however , decided to overturn the decision based on a fairly simple argument .
" [ I ]t stretches credulity to conclude that a series of numbers , or Internet address , can be said to constitute a " machine or any mechanical or other device ... designed and manufactured primarily for use in connection with gambling , " reads the order .
The state of Kentucky has a vested interest in barring online gambling sites from being accessible there , as the state 's own revenue is highly dependent upon certain sanctioned ( and therefore taxable ) forms of gambling , such as the aforementioned horse races .
Because of this , it seems likely that Beshear will look for other ways to attack gambling sites and ultimately take them down — this could be done , for example , by amending the state 's gambling statute to include domain names .
The EFF notes , however , that even if the Kentucky legislature were to do this — an idea that is entertained in the Appeals Court order — it would still run into trouble attempting to seize those from outside the state because of lack of jurisdiction and First Amendment concerns .

COLOMBO ( Reuters ) - Nearly 100 civilians have been killed in artillery exchanges between Sri Lanka ’s military and Tamil Tigers since the weekend , a top government official working in the area controlled by the rebels said on Thursday .
Medical staff rush to treat to an ethnic minority Tamil child , who was injured by heavy combat between Tamil tigers and government military in Tamil rebel territory , at a hospital in Vavuniya , about 260 kilometres ( 160 miles ) north of Colombo January 22 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Stringer
The report of casualties came on a day the United Nations said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) had violated international law by stopping its local staff and their families from leaving the war zone in an aid convoy .
That echoed earlier complaints from human rights watchdogs that said the separatist rebels had forced civilians to stay in the war zone as human shields and forced conscripts .
The rebels , on U.S. , E.U. and Indian terrorist lists , deny that .
Sri Lanka ’s military has boxed the LTTE into an area of less than 400 square km ( 155 sq miles ) after the most successful campaign so far in the 25 - year war and is aiming to deliver a final blow to the last rebel redoubt , the port of Mullaitivu .
Aid agencies have warned that about 230,000 refugees are trapped and at risk of being caught in the crossfire .
“ Around 30 people died in the morning today .
Personally I saw that nearly 100 people have died from Saturday up to today .
More than 300 have been injured , ” Mullaittivu District Government Agent Emelda Sukumar told Reuters by phone .
Getting independent confirmation of casualties in the war zone is nearly impossible .
Sukumar , who spoke from Mullaittivu , is in charge of government services including humanitarian aid in the rebel area .
The national government pays her salary , but she is under the LTTE ’s watch and relies on them for her safety .
For that reason , the government has often said its agents are under duress and liable to publicly give a version of events favorable to the LTTE .
“ CANNOT ESCAPE ”
Sukumar said the army ceased fire after her office got in touch with them and the Red Cross , which arranged a convoy to ferry 46 sick and wounded people from a hospital near Mullaittivu to a government hospital in Vavuniya , far from the battle .
“ When people occupy particular places , the LTTE send shells from that area , and then army also targets the same area , ” she said .
“ So people can not escape from the shelling . ”
The military on Wednesday announced a 32 sq km safe zone near Mullaittivu and dropped leaflets urging civilians to go there .
On Thursday , pro-rebel website www.TamilNet.com reported that shelling had killed 66 civilians and wounded 176 in the past 60 hours in areas including the safe zone and the hospital .
Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara denied that .
“ Today we stopped firing and took 46 patients from that hospital through the Red Cross , so that kind of humanitarian operation is underway .
We did n’t fire into the safe zone because we wanted civilians to come , ” Nanayakkara said .
The United Nations in a statement said it had “ issued its strongest possible protest to the LTTE for their refusal to allow U.N. national staff and dependents ” to leave the war zone in a convoy on Thursday .
“ The LTTE ’s denial of safe passage is a clear abrogation of their obligations under international humanitarian law , ” it said .
The LTTE could not be reached for comment .
The LTTE say they are fighting to create an independent state for minority Tamils , many of whom complain of mistreatment by successive governments since the Sinhalese ethnic majority took over at independence from Britain in 1948 .
( CNN ) -- Sherry Johnston , whose son is having a baby with the daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , was arrested Thursday on drug charges , Alaska State Police said .
Bristol Palin , the eldest daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , and her boyfriend , Levi Johnston , in September .
Johnston 's teenage son , Levi , is the boyfriend of Bristol Palin , eldest daughter of the former GOP vice - presidential nominee .
Johnston was arrested in her home in Wasilla , Alaska , on six felony counts of misconduct involving a controlled substance , police said .
The warrant resulted from an undercover investigation that " had been going on for a while , " Alaska State Trooper spokeswoman Megan Peters said .
Peters would not describe the type or amount of drugs allegedly involved in the arrest , saying such disclosures " could hamper the investigation . "
Deborah Miller , supervisor of the criminal department in the clerk 's office in Palmer , Alaska , told CNN that Sherry Johnston was released on bail and is scheduled to be arraigned January 6 .
Palin spokesman Bill McAllister would not comment on the arrest .
" This is not a state government matter , " he said .

Near the old civil - war front line in the centre of Beirut stands a large digital clock with blood - red numbers .
It has almost reached the neat , round figure of 1,500 and represents the days since Rafiq Hariri was murdered .
You still hear people in Lebanon asking for " haqiqa " – " the truth " ; my driver Abed even has a slim , black sticker tied to the mirror of our car with the word in Arabic script .
The trouble is that as that figure on the digital clock goes on climbing , a lot of Lebanese are beginning to doubt they will ever know who murdered the billionaire and former prime minister – along with 21 others – on the Beirut Corniche on 14 February 2005 .
This St Valentine 's Day massacre was caused by an estimated 1,700kg of explosives , but despite a massive United Nations inquiry involving Irish police officers , judges from Germany , Belgium and Canada , and the setting up of an entire tribunal headquarters in The Hague , no one has been charged .
Four men are still in the grim prison at Roumieh , north of Beirut , on suspicion of involvement in the crime ; they are – or were – senior officers in the Lebanese security apparatus whose first loyalty was to Damascus rather than Beirut .
In the aftermath of the assassination , everyone from the then - president of France , Jacques Chirac , to the leader of the Lebanese Druze community Walid Jumblatt saw the hand of Syria .
Who else could plan such a massive explosion in one of the most supposedly secure parts of the Lebanese capital ?
Had n't the Syrian president Bashar al - Assad expressed his contempt for Hariri ?
And were n't the string of assassination victims that followed Hariri 's death all opposed to Syria ?
Sister Syria was the butler in the Lebanese manor house , and it was the butler what did it .
Perhaps .
But now that Barack Obama is arriving in the White House with a mission to start a " dialogue " with Syria – and since America desperately needs Syria 's help in preventing insurgents from attacking its troops in Iraq – it's not hard to imagine what form this " dialogue " will take .
Yes , the Americans need help .
Yes , Damascus will understand the need for a less confrontational approach to the Arab world from a US administration .
And yes , the Americans would like Syria to break off its relations with Iran – some hope !
– and with Hamas .
But , hem - hem , there may be a little matter of the Hariri tribunal to be discussed before the " dialogue " begins .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Hariri was always a problem for Syria .
While a friend of the Syrian regime – he built the presidential palace in Damascus as a gift – and a citizen of Saudi Arabia , to whom Syria has always shown respect , the Syrians always suspected Hariri wanted to restore Lebanon 's full sovereignty and free it from the overlordship of Damascus .
Fearful of a pro-Israeli regime in Beirut – which briefly occurred in 1982 after Israel 's massive invasion – Syria felt comfortable only when its own allies were in power in Lebanon .
Hence it " fixed " the Beirut parliament to contain more friends than enemies and ensured the Lebanese president would always show fealty to Damascus .
Hence Hariri's dangerous position .
Assad never believed there would be a UN inquiry into Hariri 's murder and it was only after I revealed in the Independent that there would be , that an astonished President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt rushed to his presidential jet and flew to Syria to warn Assad that he might be in very hot water indeed .
The first UN team was led by Irish Deputy Garda Commissioner Peter Fitzgerald , who discovered that the wreckage of Hariri 's six - car motorcade had – incredibly – been moved from the crime scene at midnight on the day of the killings and other materials not associated with the bomb placed in the massive crater .
The man responsible for doing so was General Ali al - Hajj , director general of the ( then Syrian - dominated ) Lebanese Internal Security Forces and one of the four men now locked up in Roumieh awaiting his day in court .
If there is a court .
Al - Hajj used to work for Hariri , as his bodyguard , but was removed from his personal retinue when Hariri discovered he was also working for Syrian intelligence .
He actually ' had the nerve to turn up at the Hariri family palace in Beirut 's Koreitem district to offer his condolences on the day of the murder .
I reported that night that one of Hariri 's young relatives had told him : " Your place is not here . "
She turned up at my home with some student friends 24 hours later to say I had misquoted her .
" What I said was , ' Your place is not here – you dog ! ' "
Well , I tried .
Also in Roumieh is the former head of Lebanese military intelligence General Raymond Azar , Brigadier General Mustafa Hamdan ( commander of the Presidential Guards Brigade ) , and the sinister figure of a certain Jamil Sayed .
I received a sharp example of where power lies in Beirut when I appealed to Hariri some years before his death to un-ban my book on the Lebanese civil war .
Hariri said it was not " the right time " to risk offending Syria .
But – strange as the ironies are in Beirut – the ban was immediately lifted after eight years of censorship following a one - minute phone call to Sayed .
Sayed was director - general of the General Security Department of the Lebanese interior ministry ; not a man you would choose to argue with .
But nor was Hariri .
Although he was an immensely wealthy philanthropist – he sent my driver Abed 's son through university ( he was at Essex ) , along with thousands of other Lebanese students – he could be a ruthless businessman .
He built hospitals and even tried to rebuild Beirut in the middle of the 1975 - 1990 civil war – then rebuilt it again after .
But bankers feared his power , especially when he began buying up square miles of real estate .
I once asked if he believed in God , and he said he did ( which I thought was true ) but when I asked him how much of Lebanon he had bought , he said he did n't know ( which I think was untrue ) .
A Lebanese businessman with whom he was involved in a ferocious row was wounded by the bomb that killed Hariri and thought at first that the bomb had been set off by Hariri to kill him .
But how was the bomb constructed ?
The second UN team to arrive in Lebanon believed it was in a truck driven by a suicide bomber .
Indeed , within hours of the murder the pro-Syrian information minister blurted out that it had been " a martyrdom mission " , which could have been a giveaway .
Surely the minister regarded Hariri as the " martyr " ?
Or did he not ?
The killings were followed by a series of macabre assassinations , which showed that the killers were still operational : the writer and journalist Samir Kassir blown up in his car outside his Beirut home ; the politicians George Hawi , also blown up in his car in west Beirut , and Walid Eido ( another car bomb , outside his favourite watering hole ) ; the newspaper editor Gibran Tueni , atomised by a car bomb on a lonely pine - lined road in east Beirut ; the MP Pierre Gemayel .
All these men had come out firmly against Syria 's involvement in Lebanon – Kassir had apparently been threatened by Sayed over the telephone when Hariri was still alive .
Then Samir Shehade , an army officer investigating the thousands of phone calls made in the hour of Hariri 's murder – he was the Lebanese military 's top cell - phone expert – was also killed by car bomb .
One of the calls he was investigating was allegedly made to the presidential palace where Émile Lahoud , a Damascus protégé , still ruled .
An official who took the call was told Hariri was dead .
He should have responded with shock , one might think .
What he asked was : " Are you sure ? "
Syria , it should be said , has always denied the killings .
When I asked Syria 's foreign minister in Paris who killed Hariri , he produced all the money in his pocket , put it on the table in the lobby of his palatial hotel and told me : " If you can tell me who killed Hariri , you can take all that ! "
The American journalist Seymour Hersh was with Assad when he received news of Hariri 's murder .
Hersh told me that although Assad had been deeply critical of Hariri and regarded him as a corrupt man , he appeared astonished at the news .
Yet the Druze leader Jumblatt , among the world 's greatest nihilists – I should explain that he rather likes this description – had no doubt that Syria was to blame ; indeed that Syria had murdered his father Kamal because he " refused ... Syria 's Anschluss " .
Jumblatt was at his Beirut home when the explosion that killed Hariri thundered across the city .
" I knew at once that it must be Hariri , " he told me .
" It was either going to be me or Hariri and it was n't me .
I felt I should go upstairs and put on a black tie , but that this was a way of killing Hariri and I hesitated .
Then I called his house at Koreitem and they said that all his mobile phones were dead ; then I knew , and went upstairs and put on a black tie .
At the American University Hospital , I knew one of the people in the morgue and he told me that Hariri was gone .
So I got one of his sons into the car with me and told him , ' The news is not good . ' "
The slaughter led to a UN Security Council resolution that demanded – and got – the withdrawal of Syria 's 14,000 troops from Lebanon .
They had first been sent to Beirut with US President Jimmy Carter 's approval to stop the civil war in 1976 – they failed , of course , but stayed on to police the country for another 29 years , with men such as al - Hajj and Sayed working for them .
After Hariri's murder the UN inquiries blundered on , sometimes arresting the wrong men and constantly promising " the truth " without providing it .
One UN report was released in New York with the names of Syrian security apparatchiks in the text .
It was hurriedly censored by UN secretary - general Kofi Annan – the first indication that Sister Syria might , after all , escape unscathed .
Jumblatt himself was so worried that the UN tribunal might be abandoned that he set off to Washington and secured a 35 - minute interview with George W Bush – only 10 minutes less than the Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert received – and spent even longer with the head of the CIA .
This was pretty suicidal stuff , an anti-Syrian Lebanese politician talking to the neo-conservatives of the US about the need for a tribunal to indict Syria .
President Chirac of France had joined the Americans in sponsoring the Security Council military - withdrawal call to Damascus , although the Hariri - Chirac friendship was said to be based on business as much as mutual admiration .
( When in Paris , Hariri lived in the old home of Gustave Eiffel and was widely believed to have helped fund Chirac 's presidential campaigns – a subject Chirac avoided on his visits to Beirut .
Chirac , who had wanted to be friends with Bashar , felt personally betrayed by Hariri 's murder . )
But Nicolas Sarkozy is no Chirac .
He wanted to restore France 's relations with Syria – not to mention Syria 's relations with the French Total oil company – and invited Bashar to this year 's Bastille Day bash on the Champs - Élysées .
Sarkozy was duly invited to Damascus , then popped across to Beirut to reassure the Lebanese that France was their best friend .
There is a suspicion in the Lebanese capital that all French presidents want , in their heart of hearts , to restore France 's prewar mandates over Lebanon and Syria – General Henri Gouraud created Lebanon out of Syria against the wishes of the country 's Muslim population and a young Captain Charles de Gaulle served that mandate in a villa which Hariri later restored .
It was a miserable story and one which Sarkozy has continued by supporting the Doha peace agreement , which effectively gave the pro-Syrian opposition in Beirut veto powers over cabinet decisions .
In other words , Syrian hegemony returned to Lebanon without its army .
All this while , the Hizballah militia – or " resistance army " , as it likes to call itself – remained a faithful friend ( or servant ) of Syria .
After Hariri's murder , its general - secretary , Sayed Hassan Nasrallah , said that he sometimes held secret meetings with Hariri to discuss the future of Lebanon .
But I remember Hariri expressing his anger at Nasrallah when he discovered that the Hizballah intended to bury some of their south Lebanese " martyrs " in front of Beirut International Airport – a step unlikely to encourage more tourists or businessmen to the country Hariri was trying to rebuild .
In Beirut , Hariri 's memory is safeguarded by his anti-Syrian son Saad .
But Saad 's power was brutally cut down when his ragtag militia failed to halt a virtual Hizballah takeover of west Beirut in which they seized Saad 's party headquarters and closed down his television station .
Jumblatt had warned Saad not to collect a militia because the Hizballah could overwhelm it .
But Saad went ahead .
He was wrong .
Jumblatt was right .
And so Rafiq Hariri 's reputation has been diminished by his son's failure .
The money is still intact , of course : the Hariris own parts of Houston , Texas , as well as Beirut and Paris ; and honest reflection by Beirut 's bankers – who are not always very honest – suggests that Hariri 's rise to financial prominence during the Syrian presence in Lebanon encouraged widespread corruption .
At one point , he ran two governments ; a dull , official one that reflected Syria 's views and a " shadow " government of technocrats paid by Hariri himself , which actually managed the country .
When he first became prime minister in 1992 , Hariri was worth about $ 1bn .
But he was primary shareholder in Solidere , the company that built ( and is still building ) downtown Beirut , which left him worth $ 16bn at his death , listed among Forbes ' top 100 wealthiest men and women in the world and the fourth - richest politician .
Solidere appropriated the wrecked centre of Beirut and compensated property owners with shares in the company that were sometimes worth 15 per cent of the value .
Money would be dispatched to government ministers to " minimize the inconvenience " of their offices – to use the words of Thomas Cromwell in Robert Bolt 's A Man for All Seasons .
Indeed , there was something of Henry VIII in Hariri , a man who – in the words of a colleague reflecting on his business activities – was overweight and ruthless but quite prepared to smile like a cat that had just eaten the family budgerigar .
Hence he became known as " Mr Lebanon " , a dangerous title in a land so soaked in blood .
The integrity of Lebanon 's internal quarrel remains intact despite its people 's intelligence and charm and kindness .
And the Hizballah have shown a side to this country that had never before been witnessed in Lebanon .
Seeing themselves as warriors rather than mere gunmen , they fought the Israeli army to a standstill in the summer of 2006 and may do the same this year when a new right - wing Israeli government might be provoked by Iran 's most valuable ally in Lebanon .
What would Hariri have said ?
He always believed Iran would try to play a major role in Lebanon 's internal politics .
The Iranians became convinced that he was killed by an off - shoot of al - Qa'ida from Iraq after holding a secret meeting with Iraq 's acting prime minister in Beirut .
Other stories suggested something had gone wrong in a Saudi - Russian arms deal which Hariri had negotiated .
Meanwhile , the UN tribunal has been given a home in The Hague – in a former Dutch intelligence headquarters – so that its work can begin in February .
Or March .
Or sometime this year .
Even in late 2007 , Serge Brammertz , who was then in charge of the inquiry , was talking about the " extreme delicacy " of his work because his investigation was " approaching a sensitive and complicated phase " .
Ho hum , said the Lebanese .
They knew what that meant .
Then in mid-December last year , the Canadian prosecutor Daniel Bellemare – the latest in a bewildering range of UN officials to become involved – announced that despite " difficulties " , the case of Hariri 's murder could be solved .
" Absolutely ! " he announced with Blair - like assurance .
The Lebanese were not assured .
Will there ever be a trial ?
And even if there is , will it merely be a UN façade – in which nameless murderers will be excoriated , Syria absolved from the crime and Hariri 's death remain unavenged ?
Will lawyers for the four Lebanese already locked up succeed in their petitions to obtain at least their limited freedom ?
Not once in more than three decades has a single political murder in Lebanon ever been solved .
Besides , just as the 2006 Israeli - Hizballah war overwhelmed all interest in the UN investigation , there will be more crises and , unfortunately , more violent conflicts in Lebanon to give Hariri 's murder yet further historical distance and – dare one say it – political irrelevancy .
The Lebanese would not agree with this .
But the world might .
A few metres from the spot where he died , a larger - than - life statue of Rafiq Hariri now stands on a plinth opposite the sea .
It 's a good likeness , the overweight ex-prime minister with his hands shoved into his pockets , his trousers curling slightly over his shoes , a proud , immensely wealthy , rather frightening man who stares out over the city he rebuilt .
Abed still keeps his label over the mirror with " the truth " printed on it .
But all of us in Beirut are beginning to wonder if we will ever know what that is .
The Absolute worst hotel in my history of hotel stays .
I have stayed in many hotels , mainly Westins , Marriots , Sheratons , Hiltons , many like those .
But this one takes the cake .
The place advertised cheap , renovated rooms , private baths and so on .
But they forget to mention they are filthy and grotesque !!!
The place itself is located right next door to a gentlemens club where strippers hang around outside all day .
As soon as you enter , you see neon lights and cheap old , chairs .
The men at the door who greet you are the only good thing about it .
The woman at the front desk was rude and inconsiderate .
She first told us we could n't go up to our rooms yet because it was about an hour before check in .
So we demanded and got our key .
We should have just turned back when she said it was too early .
But they do n't give refunds , AT ALL .
So we get on the elevator , poor excuse for one anyway , when we get off , it looks like one of those bad films shot in the worst neighborhoods of NY .
The hallways are barely big enough for two people to walk close to each other , the paint is chipped or gone , the floors are horrible , the lighting is scary and the door was aweful .
Looked as if I could break it down without much effort .
So we get into the room and we all drop our mouths .
YUCK !
Two double beds so close to each other there is practically no room to walk in between .
Carpet that has n't been cleaned in over 7 years , Curtains which looks like I bought it from a man standing OUTSIDE of the dollar store and the bed and " comforter " are so old your completely grosed out .
The sheets looked as if they were washed recently , but the rest of the place was so disgusting , that you didnt even want to take off your shoes , let alone sleep on the bed .
And the bathroom !!!
WOW , the bathtub is one of those that were painted so all the paint was off or chipped and the toilet was the same .
Someone had actually used the bathroom ( Number 2 ) right before we got there .
GROSS !
We stayed the night since we pretty much didnt have a choice .
After a long day of shopping and eating , we kind of didnt care anymore since we were stuck and it was only for one night .
But then at night , UGH !
There was this loud noise that sounded , at first like someone screaming , then later we figured out that it was n't , but we still do n't know that it definitely wasnt .
I offered to pay for a stay at the Sheraton , but we decided to stick it out .
The next day , we all had to use flip flops to shower with , and threw them away after , no one wanted to touch those things , let alone bring them back home .
And when we checked out , it was the same RUDE woman .
And they wouldnt even let us hold our bags there until actual checkout time since we got up early to shop some more .
OVERALL WORST HOTEL EVVVVVEEEERRRR !!!
DONT , I REPEAT DON'T EVER STAY HERE .
IT 'S NOT WORTH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY .
PAY THAT EXTRA AMOUNT AND STAY SOMEWHERE , ANYWHERE , ELSE !!!
PLEASE !!!!
I WISH WE TOOK PICTURES BECAUSE THE PICTURES THEY HAVE OF THIS HOTEL MUST HAVE BEEN WHEN IT OPENED .
SO DECEIVING !!!

It is a truth universally acknowledged that quantum computing must have entanglement .
“ Entanglement , ” Andrew White tells PhysOrg.com , “ is normally considered a non-negotiable part of quantum information processing .
In fact , if you told me a couple of years ago that you could do quantum computing without entanglement , I would have been pretty skeptical – to say the least ! ”
White says that he first heard the idea of non-entanglement quantum computing from Carl Caves .
“ I was intrigued when Professor Caves , on sabbatical here in Australia from New Mexico , mentioned that there were sober predictions that entanglement was n’t always necessary . ”
White leads a team of young experimental scientists at the University of Queensland in Brisbane , Australia .
Ben Lanyon , Marco Barbieri , Marcelo Almeida and White have been studying deterministic quantum computing with only one pure qubit ( DQC1 ) .
“ Entanglement is not the final story on what makes quantum information processing powerful , ” White insists .
The Australian team ’s results can be found in Physical Review Letters : “ Experimental Quantum Computing without Entanglement . ”
“ Normally , in order for quantum computing to work , ” White explains , “ we need to encode the information into quantum bits — qubits — which are in a noise - free pure state .
It ’s known that the entanglement between these is what makes standard quantum computing powerful . ”
He continues , “ With a DQC1 scheme , you only have to have one pure qubit , and the rest can be noisy or mixed . ”
The idea behind quantum information processing using entanglement is that noiselessness has to be applied in order to provide a substantial advantage over classical computing .
DQC1 , though , could potentially offer a more efficient and less resource - intensive method of quantum computing , since entanglement would no longer be a necessity .
“ For this demonstration , ” White says , “ we used the smallest possible example : a circuit with just two qubits , one pure and one mixed .
We ran a phase - estimation algorithm as a small example , and found in every setting there was zero entanglement , but that most of the states could n’t be described efficiently in a classical manner . ”
White points out that this is suggestive that there are other possibilities , beyond entanglement , that contribute to the power provided by quantum information processing .
“ We ’re still chewing through the implications , ” he says .
“ This is not a universal panacea , ” White admits .
“ For some problems and algorithms you just need pure qubits and entanglement , problems such as Shor ’s algorithm .
However , there are applications and problems where the DQC1 method will work quite well , and will be more efficient than trying to get qubits that are all pure . ”
With so many different architectures and schemes for quantum computing – all of them trying to create a system in which all the qubits are pure – it is rare to see a group looking to find applications for a quantum information system that makes allowances for impurity and the introduction of noise – insisting that entanglement is not necessary .
“ The fact is that certain classes of problems do n’t need entanglement , and they do n’t need all of the purity .
In some cases , all that is needed is one pure qubit and the rest could be mixed .
Really , with DQC1 , you do n’t have to work as hard as you think you do . ”
We are starting to build more complicated algorithms to get an idea of where this could go .
Regardless , the idea that entanglement may not be necessary for some types of quantum computing is big news . ”

DECEMBER 4--Meet Michael Campbell , before and after .
The Colorado man has a long rap sheet and prison history , though you probably could have guessed that based on the below mug shots .
In the " before " photos , Campbell is seen following a 2003 theft arrest in Jefferson County , Colorado .
The " after " photos were snapped about six weeks ago , when Campbell was again popped and jailed at the Jefferson County lockup .
Though he has been in and out of custody between 2003 and 2008 , Campbell , 33 , apparently used his infrequent time on the street to aggressively supplement his facial and neck art .
It is unclear , however , why his ears , to date , have been left untouched .
But that polka - dotted bow tie ( at least we think it 's a bow tie ) was a wonderful addition .

For the legendary chef 's birthday , we 'd like to share this archival interview with you again .
Make yourself something delicious this weekend .
Fat gives things flavor .
People are uncertain because they do n't have the self - confidence to make decisions .
The measure of achievement is not winning awards .
It 's doing something that you appreciate , something you believe is worthwhile .
I think of my strawberry souffle .
I did that at least twenty - eight times before I finally conquered it .
Playing golf with men can throw off your stroke .
I 'm all for hunger among the well - to - do .
For comfortable people , hunger is a very nice quality .
For one thing , it means you 're healthy .
And I love the anticipation .
Being tall is an advantage , especially in business .
People will always remember you .
And if you 're in a crowd , you 'll always have some clean air to breathe .
There is nothing worse than grilled vegetables .
Celebrity has its uses : I can always get a seat in any restaurant .
I was faced by my nieces and good friends and told I should n't drive my car anymore .
Actually , I find I 'm not quite as alert as I used to be , and it would be awful to kill somebody .
So now I do n't drive , and it is real hell , because you can't rush down to the store and get a bunch of parsley if you have the whim , or do something like that .
It 's just awful not driving , because you have to depend on other people .
You get used to it , though .
They have a bus here — I have n't tried it yet , but I shall .
A cookbook is only as good as its poorest recipe .
I hate organized religion .
I think you have to love thy neighbor as thyself .
I think you have to pick your own God and be true to him .
I always say " him " rather than " her . "
Maybe it 's because of my generation , but I do n't like the idea of a female God .
I see God as a benevolent male .
Tears mess up your makeup .
I 'm awfully sorry for people who are taken in by all of today 's dietary mumbo jumbo .
They are not getting any enjoyment out of their food .
Moderation .
Small helpings .
Sample a little bit of everything .
These are the secrets of happiness and good health .
You need to enjoy the good things in life , but you need not overindulge .
I went into a doctor 's office the other day and all the people — you know , the nurses and the receptionists and even the patients — were sort of short - tempered and not very nice .
And it made me think , I just want to bop them over the head .
It 's terribly important to keep a good temper .
I do n't eat between meals .
I do n't snack .
Well , I do eat those little fish crackers .
They 're fattening , but irresistible .
If you 're in a good profession , it 's hard to get bored , because you 're never finished — there will always be work you have n't yet done .
The secret of a happy marriage is finding the right person .
You know they 're right if you love to be with them all the time .
The problem with the world right now is that we do n't have any politicians like Roosevelt or Churchill to give us meaning and depth .
We do n't have anyone who 's speaking for the great and the true and the noble .
What we need now is a heroic type , someone who could rally the people to higher deeds .
I do n't know what 's to become of us .
You must have discipline to have fun .
Drama is very important in life :
You have to come on with a bang .
You never want to go out with a whimper .
Everything can have drama if it 's done right .
Even a pancake .
I do n't believe in heaven .
I think when we die we just go back to the great ball of energy that makes up the universe .
Hell only exists on earth , when you 've made mistakes and you 're paying for them .
I do n't think about whether people will remember me or not .
I 've been an okay person .
I 've learned a lot .
I 've taught people a thing or two .
That 's what 's important .
Sooner or later the public will forget you , the memory of you will fade .
What 's important are the individuals you 've influenced along the way .
Always remember :
If you 're alone in the kitchen and you drop the lamb , you can always just pick it up .
Who 's going to know ?

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Corrupt officials inside Mexico ’s security forces have leaked U.S. anti-drugs intelligence directly to drug traffickers to help them escape raids , a senior U.S. law enforcement agent said .

A recent anti-corruption sweep showed the infiltration of Mexican police forces had reached alarming levels , with several high - ranking investigators and a presidential guardsman arrested for selling information to drug cartels .
The U.S. agent said the arrests were an encouraging sign that Mexico ’s government is serious about stopping drug gangs from getting their hands on intelligence , some of which comes from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , or DEA .
“ There have been occurrences where we have shared information and then found that the information we shared was compromised , given , provided , leaked to the very targets that were being investigated , ” the official told Reuters late on Wednesday on condition of anonymity .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon has made fighting drug cartels his top priority , deploying thousands of soldiers and federal police to take on heavily armed traffickers , dominated by the Sinaloa federation and the Gulf Cartel .
The U.S. agent praised Calderon for fighting the drug gangs head on but said some operations have been frustrated as cartels flush with cash can pay massive bribes for information or use violence to intimidate police .
“ There is no infallible system when you are talking about a $ 65 billion enterprise .
Money talks , ” he said , referring to the estimated size of Mexico ’s drug trade .
Among those arrested last year were Mexico ’s liaison to Interpol as well as the country ’s organized crime chief Noe Ramirez , who is accused of taking at least $ 450,000 to pass secrets to crime gangs .
Mexican investigators could not comment on leaks of DEA information to cartels , a spokesperson from the attorney general ’s office said on Thursday , but one expert said it was a worrying sign .
“ This could have consequences in bilateral cooperation if the United States becomes less willing to share information with Mexico .
We are facing a crisis of confidence , ” Jorge Chabat at Mexico ’s CIDE think tank said .
U.S. AID IN DRUG FIGHT
The U.S. Congress approved $ 465 million in drug- fighting aid for Mexico and Central America in June , the first installment of a promised $ 1.4 billion package known as the Merida initiative to fund surveillance and detection .
“ Merida recognizes that there is this level of corruption , so the point is to tighten up the institutional capabilities , ” University of Miami drug expert Bruce Bagley said , adding that U.S. aid will help in vetting Mexican forces .
“ They will have urinalysis kits and lie detector tests ... they will also interdict government officials ’ phones , check out their bank accounts , because there has to be enhanced monitoring of all of the highest levels , ” Bagley said .
But even specially selected police units working directly with the DEA are not always immune to corruption .
“ With the specialized units , in effect , we are operating on islands of integrity in a sea of questions , but there are breaches from time to time , ” the U.S. official said .
Some 5,700 people died in drug - related killings in Mexico last year as drug gangs battled each other and government security forces , and the U.S. agent said violence has begun to spill over the border into the southern United States .
“ I believe if we do n’t turn around and do something we could see a tremendous degradation of security in our own country from these trafficking organizations , ” he said .

A version of this interview is available as a podcast .
Victoria Gould has led unusual parallel careers : not only has she been a successful actor , she is also a mathematician , working first as a researcher and now as a teacher and communicator of maths .
Recently she helped develop theatre company Complicite 's production ' A disappearing number ' , which perfectly brought together the mathematical and theatrical sides of her life .
We talk to Victoria about her life in mathematics , and her life in theatre , and how the two work together .
Victoria Gould
" I 've always known that I wanted to be an actor , and I 've always loved maths , " says Victoria .
" I felt like I had two brains ! "
But when Victoria was a teenager it did n't seem possible to pursue both mathematics and acting .
" At school I was quite pushed into the arts , and used to secretly go into book shops and read maths books when I should have been studying A level arts subjects .
It felt a bit like a guilty secret , that I was so interested in maths and that I found it rather comforting . "
When Victoria left school she formed a small theatre company with four other friends , called the Kangaroo Club .
" It was in the early eighties and there was quite a lot of public money around for arts projects . "
They toured a play around London , and then advertised for more members .
The company , then a group of around 15 actors , devised a completely original show .
It was based on their own experiences of going to clubs that were part of the New Romantic movement in the early eighties , and they performed the show in the clubs themselves .
" So we were part of that Steve Strange kind of scene .
[ The show ] was hugely successful and it was great fun .
We even managed to pay ourselves a little bit . "
There are some similarities between this early project , and her most recent work with Complicite .
" Looking at the work I do with Complicite , it 's interesting that I was into devised theatre at such an early point in my career . "
It felt a bit like a guilty secret that I was so interested in maths
But even while running the Kangaroo Club , Victoria continued her secret reading of maths , " in a furtive way ! " .
Many of us can relate to the thrill she felt from solving an equation or understanding a proof .
But there was a deeper attraction .
" I love the assurance of maths , I find it tremendously comforting , reassuring .
I love the patterns and I love the consistency .
I read a fantastic description of mathematics while researching the play [ A disappearing number ] , which was that the mathematical definition of maths is it's the set of all possible self - consistent structures . "
Acting gave Victoria confidence , and allowed her to express herself .
" I love acting because I love telling stories , and I really enjoy pretending to be someone else !
I think a lot of actors will tell you that .
I think I 'm essentially quite shy , which might be hard to believe , but if I 'm pretending to be someone else , I find that very liberating and exciting . "
But the very nature of performing as a career had a negative side too .
" The problem with being an actor , which any actor will tell you , is that you 're always living on someone else 's estimation of you .
So you are always at the mercy of the last person who saw your work or gave you a job .
Whereas in mathematics , the mathematics is there and it's always right , and it 's always solid . "

I continued my secret reading of maths books in a furtive way , until I suddenly ' came out ' as a mathematician
It was this aspect of acting , the feeling of having to constantly live in terms of other people 's judgement of her , that made Victoria " come out as a mathematician " .
She completed her maths , physics and engineering A levels in a year , and went on to a degree in physics at the University of Manchester .
Manchester , which had an excellent drama department , was the perfect place and Victoria finally had a chance to combine drama acting with science and maths .
" I had this wonderful three years of being in the physics department in the day , being tutored by the Astronomer Royal , going to Jodrell Bank , doing great experiments .
And then in the evening rehearsing plays .
I think I did 10 plays in my first year at university ! "
And not only did her degree start her mathematical career , Victoria went on to work as an actor with many of the people she met in the drama department .
Victoria continued straight from her Bachelor of Science at Manchester to postgraduate study in maths .
" I knew that I really ultimately wanted to act , but I did n't want to stop doing maths and physics .
So I went and did a masters in applicable mathematics , at Cranfield , " ( then Cranfield Institute of Technology , now Cranfield University ) .
The course involved a lot of linear algebra , applied computing including the concept of artificial intelligence , and signal processing .
" It was slightly different from anything I 'd done before , but it was extremely interesting . "
Her masters thesis was on the use of fractals in generating natural looking landscapes in computer imaging .
( You can read more about using fractals to mimic nature in Modelling nature with fractals . )

The postgraduate degree led to a series of research positions , first working on sonar image processing at Marconi Maritime Applied Research Laboratory in Cambridge .
This was during the early days of pattern recognition , and Victoria was working on techniques that would automatically spot wrecks on the sea bed .
" I then went to King 's College London , and worked in the physics department there on synthetic aperture radar , which I enjoyed a lot . "
This involved manipulating the signal received by an antenna mounted under an aircraft that is used to map the landscape below .
" To increase resolution , to get a better picture , you need a larger aperture , which would soon need to be bigger than the actual plane , so you synthesise , or create the effect of a real aperture by applying some complex processes to the data from the single antenna .
As the aircraft flies through space , you apply a complicated matrix of phase delays , and effectively focus the aperture mathematically as opposed to physically . "
Both research positions were essentially working in signal processing , using convolutions and the fast Fourier transform .
When Victoria had her first child , she took a break and moved to Brighton .
She soon returned to maths research at the engineering department at Sussex University , looking at algorithms for weather modelling to integrate with something called the Battlefield Sensor Simulator ( BSS ) , developed at RSRE Malvern .
This involved lots of partial differential equations and fluid dynamics , and quite a lot of chaos theory .
But she could n't ignore the pull of acting forever .
" In the middle of that I was offered a part in Hamlet on the West End by someone I was at university with .
I juggled the two for a little while , with the baby , doing research in the day and Hamlet in the evening in Covent Garden . "
Not surprisingly Victoria decided that this was too much , and she gave up the research to concentrate on acting again .
A producer saw her performance in Hamlet , and she was asked to audition for the television show East Enders , leading to her playing the part of journalist Polly for two years .
" I was catapulted into the weird world of soap land and infamy .
People really believe that those soaps are real and people actually believed that I was Polly from East Enders . "
The project with Complicite really brought the two halves of my life together , because we looking at really rigorous mathematical ideas to make a play
After periods of intensive mathematics study and research , and acting in theatre , radio and television , Victoria has now reconciled her two parallel careers .
" I now have quite a nice balance in my life .
I have an agent and I act as much as I can .
I do a great deal of theatre work and develop new writing .
But I also do some supply teaching of mathematics , and I read as much maths as I can .
And I also help children one - to - one with their maths , which I hugely enjoy .
I recently have been involved with this fantastic project with Complicite , which has really brought the two halves of my life together , because we were looking at some really quite rigorous mathematical ideas to make a play .
Which was absolutely fantastic and really exciting . "
The play was inspired by the collaboration of the English mathematician , G. H. Hardy , and the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan .
" It 's a very beautiful story about Ramanujan coming to Cambridge and collaborating with Hardy .
And that was really the kernel of the play that Simon [ McBurney - the director of Complicite ] wanted to make . "
But the show is set in the modern world , and tells a number of stories , including conveying an impressive amount of mathematics onstage .
" What we really did n't want to do was an exposition on maths .
We wanted to somehow embody the maths in the show , within the music and the rhythm and the space of the show .
We wanted it to be a mathematical experience as well as a theatrical one . "
The result is a show that not only conveys a very human side to mathematics , including portraying mathematicians as noble , romantic heroes , but also explores complex mathematical themes in an imaginative way , and even uses maths as a metaphor for the human condition .
( You can read more about the show in our review in this issue ... )
Mathematical provocations to spark creativity
As a result of the show , and continuing work she began as a maths teacher , she has been developing and taking maths and drama workshops with groups of people of all ages , from groups of adult maths and drama teachers , to A level students in England and India , and primary school students .
" We 've been looking at ways in which a group of people can collaborate together , in the same way a theatre company does , to explore mathematical themes , physically and emotionally . "
The workshops involve a standard theatrical technique which uses " provocations " to spark creativity , but in these workshops the provocations used are mathematical .
" Some are quite counter - intuitive , such as the irrationality of root two , while some are very simple , such as the ideas of multiples and factors . "
The group then explores these mathematical themes using the fact that the group is able to think , devise and move , either as a whole or each person independently .
" We might used something like partitions to choreograph a piece of theatre .
We would introduce the group to the idea of partitioning a number into the additive sum of its components , and we might look at the partitions of two , then three , then four . "
They are then asked to physically embody the partitions of five , exploring how many there are , and show them in terms of physical bodies , perhaps showing how you can partition five people .
" Then we might ask them to create a simple narrative , usually either in a restaurant or on a train , which actually tells a story , but where you have to be able to see all the partitions of five .
And I 'm quite rigorous , and say I 'm looking for them all and we 've got to see them all . "
Not only does this exercise help convey mathematical ideas , it also has the benefit of making acting less daunting .
" You have very quickly produced a scene , where , if you did n't know you were looking for the partitions of five you would n't know they were there .
It is a lovely way of helping people to get the idea of performing out of their heads , of having to instantly create a fantastic character , and instead using the maths as a way of focusing and being in the space . "
Even the simplest of mathematical concepts , such as shapes that are defined by incredibly simple rules , can create theatrical experiences .
" Once , when supply teaching , I was asked with no notice to run a Maths and Drama workshop with some ' challenging ' children .
In a panic I threw my keys into the centre of the studio space , and said I 'd like everyone to enter the room in silence and sit down so they are all in equal distance from the keys . "
Victoria used this idea to introduce loci and circles .
" And we do another one which is marvellous for movement .
Everyone in the room secretly chooses two other people , but does n't let them know who they are .
And when I say , make yourself into an equilateral triangle with those two people , of course it creates this fantastically chaotic movement because people do n't know who the other people are , and it's a great way of creating a very natural looking dynamic movement .
It 's another example of an incredibly simple rule creating very chaotic behaviour which is analogous to the weather , and movement of the solar system , and fractals . "
I approach making theatre in a very mathematical way
Choosing maths over acting , or acting over maths is not an option for Victoria .
" There have been various times in my life when I 've done one without the other , and it does n't work .
My brain needs to be doing both .
I 've been incredibly lucky to not only be able to pursue both of these things , but also to bring them together in the work that I 've done recently . "
In fact she uses many of the same skills in each job .
" I think they both are very much informed and helped by each other .
I think teaching is a performing job and a lot of the techniques for teaching a large class are very rooted in theatrical training , like the idea of stillness being more powerful than a lot of chaotic movement , that expecting good behaviour , by one 's own calmness , is much more powerful in terms of discipline in the classroom .
And I do find that I approach making theatre in a very mathematical way .
I have to plan quite carefully what I do . "
A scene from ' A Disappearing Number ' [ Copyright Robbie Jack ]
The process of devising the show with Complicite was in some ways reminiscent of mathematical research .
The process involved a long period of exploring the mathematical and personal concepts that inspired the play .
On and off for two years , Victoria and the rest of the company worked in a large rehearsal room with a huge variety of resources , such as sound designers , visual artists , musicians , dancers , mathematicians , costumes and props .
" We would talk about extraordinary things .
We would spend a whole day talking about the difference of two squares , and physicalising that . "
And out of the weeks and months of playing with ideas , not only did they create " huge amounts of complete dross " , but also moments of beauty , and it was these that were brought together to create the play .
" You get an enormous amount of rubbish , but when something is really right , and beautiful , you know .
And I know that Simon , when he makes theatre , he is looking for that moment when all the audience will come together , in terms of them having the same image in their heads , or the same sense of being in the room together . "
" For me that is very analogous to the way that mathematicians work .
Quite a lot of the time you 're doing stuff that is n't going to work , that is rubbish .
But when something is right you do know .
And for me it's about that idea of self - consistency , that when something is right , there is a consensus that it is right .
And when a piece of theatre is beautiful there 's a consensus in the audience , you can feel it in the air .
That is why I prefer theatre to film because everyone is breathing the same air , and that sense of coming together and rightness . "
There is an almost universal acknowledgement of beauty , whether in theatre or maths , and this can bring people together .
" Everybody likes the same things , everybody likes the same stories .
And I feel that about maths .
I think it is something that brings people together , it 's something we have in common , in the same way that a piece of theatre brings people together . "
And just as it did when she was at school , maths still brings Victoria relief and reassurance .
" When teaching or acting becomes stressful , I retreat to maths a lot for it 's calmness and its patterns .
I 'll quite often , in a stressful time , go off and do a bit of linear algebra or some trigonometric identities .
They 're hugely calming for me . "
Maths as stress relief ?
" Absolutely , it works every time ! "

Many brands of jelly include high - fructose corn syrup and mercury was detected in some brand 's flavors , including Smucker 's strawberry and Market Pantry 's grape , according to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy .

Almost half of tested samples of commercial high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) contained mercury , which was also found in nearly a third of 55 popular brand - name food and beverage products where HFCS is the first - or second - highest labeled ingredient , according to two new U.S. studies .
HFCS has replaced sugar as the sweetener in many beverages and foods such as breads , cereals , breakfast bars , lunch meats , yogurts , soups and condiments .
On average , Americans consume about 12 teaspoons per day of HFCS , but teens and other high consumers can take in 80 % more HFCS than average .
" Mercury is toxic in all its forms .
Given how much high - fructose corn syrup is consumed by children , it could be a significant additional source of mercury never before considered .
We are calling for immediate changes by industry and the [ U.S. Food and Drug Administration ] to help stop this avoidable mercury contamination of the food supply , " the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy 's Dr. David Wallinga , a co-author of both studies , said in a prepared statement .
In the first study , published in current issue of Environmental Health , researchers found detectable levels of mercury in nine of 20 samples of commercial HFCS .
And in the second study , the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy ( IATP ) , a non-profit watchdog group , found that nearly one in three of 55 brand - name foods contained mercury .
The chemical was found most commonly in HFCS - containing dairy products , dressings and condiments .
ON THE WEB : List of 55 foods from Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy But an organization representing the refiners is disputing the results published in Environmental Health .
" This study appears to be based on outdated information of dubious significance , " said Audrae Erickson , president of the Corn Refiners Association , in a statement .
" Our industry has used mercury - free versions of the two re-agents mentioned in the study , hydrochloric acid and caustic soda , for several years .
These mercury - free re-agents perform important functions , including adjusting pH balances . "
However , the IATP told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that four plants in Georgia , Tennessee , Ohio and West Virginia still use " mercury - cell " technology that can lead to contamination .
IATP 's Ben Lilliston also told HealthDay that the Environmental Health findings were based on information gathered by the FDA in 2005 .
And the group 's own study , while not peer - reviewed , was based on products " bought off the shelf in the autumn of 2008 , " Lilliston added .
The use of mercury - contaminated caustic soda in the production of HFCS is common .
The contamination occurs when mercury cells are used to produce caustic soda .
" The bad news is that nobody knows whether or not their soda or snack food contains HFCS made from ingredients like caustic soda contaminated with mercury .
The good news is that mercury - free HFCS ingredients exist .
Food companies just need a good push to only use those ingredients , " Wallinga said in his prepared statement .

Excellent provision in MN law requires election challenges settled before U.S. Congress is given jurisdiction over Senate seat
PLUS : Some free advice for Coleman 's election contest court challenge ...
Brad Friedman Byon 1/5/2009 , 2:28 pm PT
-- Brad Friedman , The BRAD BLOG
The state canvassing board in Minnesota has now certified Al Franken ( D ) as the winner over incumbent Sen. Norm Coleman ( R ) in the race for the U.S. Senate .
Barring a successful legal challenge , which has now been filed by Coleman , Franken will have won the seat by an astoundingly close 225 votes , out of some 2.9 million cast .
But there 's still a chance , albeit a slim one , for Coleman to reverse his fate .
A very good provision in MN 's law --- not found in most other states --- may delay Franken 's seating , meaning he will not be sworn in with rest of Congress at the beginning of the new session slated to start tomorrow .
Ultimately , however , the provisions should ensure that whoever is eventually sworn in to serve as the state 's Senator will not be forced to serve under a cloud .
The voters of MN deserve that much , no matter how long it takes , and thankfully , like its hand - count laws , the state 's provision requiring the completion of legal challenges before final certification is sent to Congress by the Sec. of State , is a model for the nation .
Would that all of the other states in the union had such a provision ...
Readers of The BRAD BLOG may well remember the brouhaha following the special election , in the Summer of 2006 , to fill the U.S. House seat vacated by Randy " Duke " Cunningham ( R ) after he was convicted on bribery charges .
The election between Brian Bilbray ( R ) and Francine Busby ( D ) in San Diego 's 50th Congressional district --- seen at the time as a bellwether for the impending fall elections --- was an embarrassment , as both federal and state law was violated in the race by the use of electronic voting systems which , due to San Diego 's election procedures , were effectively decertified for use .
With thousands of votes left still - uncounted by the electronic Diebold optical - scan voting systems ( used in violation of the law after they were sent home on unsecured " sleepovers " with poll workers for days prior to the election ) , Susan Lapsley , then Asst. Sec. of State under Republican SoS Bruce McPherson , faxed a hasty certification to the then Republican - controlled U.S. House of Representatives declaring Bilbray the winner of the race .
The Republican operative Lapsley 's certification was sent despite legal challenges being mounted to contest the results of the election .
Then , following a letter [ PDF ] sent to the judge presiding over election contest by the attorney for the Republican chair of the U.S. House Administration Committee , claiming the U.S. Constitution gave sole authority to Congress , and Congress alone , whether or not to seat Bilbray , the case was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds .
Neither the voters , nor the courts of California , it was decided , would be allowed to determine who actually won the seat under state law .
It was outrageous , but in apparent accordance with both state law and the U.S. Constitution ... at least according to the House Republicans who rushed to swear Bilbray in as soon as possible , and the state courts who , as is often the case , look for any reason to stay out of election - related matters .
The Republican Bilbray " won " the seat , essentially because CA 's Republican Sec. of State ( illegally ) rushed certification to the Republican - controlled U.S. House who claimed complete Constitutional jurisdiction to seat the member of their choice ( who just happened to be the Republican ) .
Thankfully , and with great respect to the voters of MN , the state 's law requiring the completion of legal challenges before final certification is sent to Congress , should help stave off such an outrage by avoiding the ability of a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate to be certified by a Democratic SoS ( the state 's Mark Ritchie ) , only to be seated by a Democratically - controlled U.S. Senate claiming absolute Constitutional authority over the seating of the candidate of their wishes .
The Republican candidate , and the voters of the state , deserve to see the completion of all all possible challenges to the result of the election before they are robbed of their jurisdictional rights over who represents them in Congress .
It 's a pity the same courtesy was not given to the voters of San Diego in the CA50 race , but at least --- barring any surprises --- that same outrage should not happen in MN .
If that means a further delay before MN has its new Senator sworn in , so be it .
At least once they get their Senator , every voter in the state should know that every reasonable doubt concerning the election of that Senator has been resolved legally by the voters and courts of the state itself , accurately and transparently .
Would that every voter in the U.S. was afforded the same courtesy in every race for the U.S. Congress .
By the way , as irony would have it , MN 's likely next Senator , Al Franken , was a radio host on Air America at the time of the Busby / Bilbray brouhaha in California .
And though Franken actually came to San Diego , to broadcast at DFA 's Democracy Fest that year , which happened to take place at the height of the scandal , he refused to discuss the issue substantively and even refused to have this reporter on air to discuss it , even though we happened to be in San Diego at the time , and had been the one to break the story originally .
The result : when the matter did come up during a live broadcast featuring a guest who was a so - called reporter from the Rightwing Union - Tribute , Franken was booed by the live studio audience , on live radio , for dismissing the matter out of hand .
Coleman 's Last Chance and Some Free Advice ...
Coleman will now have seven days , under Minnesota law , to file an election contest , now that the certification has been finalized by the state board .
While his attorneys have already signaled their intent to file such a contest , and challenge the counting of a number of improperly rejected absentee ballots , as well as several ballots that they contend may have been counted twice ( there is no such evidence that we 're aware of to back up their claim on that score ) , there are two other points the Coleman team may wish to bring to court with them .
This free advise is given , even though the Coleman camp ran an outrageous and offensive ( if ultimately unsuccessful ) FL 2000 - style post-election campaign to try and keep thousands of legitimate votes from being counted at all .
We 've pointed out both of these issues in more detail previously , but they are worth noting again since they 've a ) apparently been ignored so far by both Coleman and Franken and b ) could have a significant impact on all future elections across the entire country .
1 ) Coleman 's team should demand that all memory cards and hard drives from the flawed electronic voting systems used in MN be securely retained for a full 22 months under the federal law that requires the retention of all such election materials .
Memory cards and hard drives from such systems are routinely erased or deleted after results have been finalized , but they should not be .
If there are any questions for the next 22 months about the way the systems tallied votes , those elements of the system should be available to forensic investigators .
That they are not , is a gross oversight by election officials .
A court finding that such equipment should be kept security , as per federal law , following all elections would be a gift to the nation .
2 ) MN , and their Sec. of State Mark Ritchie , deserves much applause for fully transparent way in which their post- election hand - counts are carried out .
The state 's provisions for same are among the very best in the nation .
That said , the fact that reconciliation of unvoted ballots are not generally a part of any jurisdiction 's recount laws is a tremendous oversight in such procedures .
One of the likeliest ways to game a paper - ballot election is with the use of unvoted ballots , either using them to stuff the ballot box , or otherwise replacing legitimately voted ballots .
We 've previously called on both the Coleman and Franken campaigns ( along with any other party involved in a post- election hand - count ) to file public records requests for printer invoices of printed ballots .
The number of ballots , as shown as having been printed on those orders , should be exactly equal to the number of voted , spoiled and unvoted ballots counted after the race .
If they are n't , that may well signify a problem .
Unfortunately , most post- election counts do n't even bother to account for unvoted ballots , much less count them to make sure they are all there .
Coleman 's campaign , as any other challenging an election , would be well - advised to take the appropriate steps to assure proper reconciliation of all ballots printed for use in the race .
CORRECTION : We originally named Francine Busby 's Republican opponent in the CA50 House race as Vern Buchanan .
In fact , her opponent was Brian Bilbray , so we 've made the appropriate correction .
Buchanan was the Republican who was sworn in as a U.S. Congressman in Florida 's 13th district after 18,000 votes disappeared on ES&S touch - screen voting machines in Sarasota , FL in the 2006 general election .
The final margin of " victory " over his Democratic opponent Christine Jennings in that race was some 369 votes .
The BRAD BLOG regrets the error , and will strive in the future to keep our contested elections straighter .
Science is not clever and elitist – that 's the message the government wants to give young people , in order to attract more into studying science .
But that 's a lie .
This " action to bust myth of ' elitist ' science " is part of the government 's attempt to make science more accessible , and to show people that science affects everything in their daily lives .
The science minister , Lord Drayson , wants to challenge myths such as " the perception among many of our people that science is too clever for them or elitist in some way " .
If he is talking about public understanding of science , then I agree with him .
Helping everyone to understand some of the science that 's all around us is important , but this should not be confused with the attempt to get more young people to take science A - levels , or to aspire to becoming scientists .
Instead we should be truthful .
If you tell someone that something is easy and then they find they can't do it , they get demoralised .
If you tell them something is difficult they are more likely to work at it , if they have the incentive to do so .
People do n't climb Everest , train as pilots , or spend years practising the piano because it 's easy .
The truth is that science is difficult and challenging , understanding its concepts is hard , and you do need to be clever and dedicated , but then it can be hugely rewarding .
This is the message we should be sending out to young people – that science is wonderful and difficult and if you have the aptitude , the right encouragement , and you work really hard you can be part of it .
Lord Drayson 's fatuous claim made me think of Malcolm Gladwell 's recent bestseller Outliers .
With gripping examples from the Beatles to Bill Gates , Gladwell charts what has created success stories through the centuries .
His conclusion is absolutely at odds with the government 's pathetic approach to science education .
According to Gladwell , you need to be born in the right place at the right time , have the right aptitude or intelligence , get a lot of encouragement , and then you have to work really hard – in fact you have to do something like 10,000 hours of work at your chosen skill , whether that 's playing the piano , sport , computer programming , or science .
Gladwell amasses evidence that the outliers – those exceptional people who have done fabulously well – had just that combination of luck and hard work .
As an ordinary scientist I found his book inspiring .
It made me think long and hard about whether I had ever spent 10,000 hours doing anything .
I concluded that I 'm probably about there in writing about science , and about halfway there in meditation practice .
Reading this book , with its enormous challenges , did n't make me think " Oh I 'm not clever enough " or " I 'm nearly 60 , it 's not worth working so hard any more " .
Instead it inspired me to do more – to think " Wow , if I do keep going , and try really hard , and go on enjoying the tough self - discipline and long hours , then I will go on getting better at what I do " .
This is the encouragement we should be giving teachers , and schools and kids .
The government cannot control the genetic ability of kids , or the kind of home life they find themselves in , but it can provide an educational environment that says " If you enjoy a challenge , if you want to understand the way the world works , if you like asking questions about truth and reality , then work hard at your science lessons , overcome your fear of maths , take the opportunities we 'll give you , and work terribly hard , and then you too could become that great thing – a scientist " .
Do many kids today aspire to be scientists ?
One survey suggested that very few girls do , and another that most want to be celebrities – even though all the evidence tells us , again and again , that fame and riches do n't make people happy .
What does make people happy ?
As Gladwell points out , doing meaningful work in which effort is reflected in success is what makes people happy .
Science is one of many realms in which this can be true .
It 's meaningful , it 's important to the whole of society , it 's fulfilling and it's intellectually rewarding .
If you do reasonably well you can expect a life of interest and fulfilment .
If you work terribly hard , get the right breaks , and have the right aptitude then you can join that wonderful elite of great scientists .
You can have your work published in the very best journals , have everyone want to read your books , be made a Fellow of the Royal Society , or even go down in history .
Please let 's tell our kids the truth about science .
It is clever and it is elitist .
It 's worth working for .
It 's worth aspiring to .

The American people are sick and tired of the Bush era , and they are counting the days until Barack Obama is inaugurated .
The reasons for this are manifold , of course , but the one that concerns us especially here at Antiwar.com is the vital question of war and peace .
American foreign policy had become so relentlessly aggressive , and with such disastrous results , that John McCain ’s alleged national security credentials were moot .
Even if the economy had n’t tanked so spectacularly at a crucial point in the election season , I contend that Obama would ’ve won in a landslide anyway .
And it surely did n’t help when the author of our disastrous foreign policy , Vice President Dick Cheney , was wheeled out to issue his kiss - of - death endorsement : talk about the stab in the back !
In any case , what I really mean to say is that our crazed foreign policy was a major reason why Americans gave Obama such a stunning victory .
There ’s just one problem : our foreign policy is going to remain pretty much the same .
Say whaaaat ?!
That ’s right : you heard me .
No change in that department .
Why is that , you ask ?
The reason is because the War Party has a strategy perfectly suited to solving their major problem , which is that they lack any kind of popular support , as the McCain campaign discovered to its horror .
So instead of playing the game , they decided to rig it and greet the incoming Obama administration with a fait accompli .
The Bush administration is now engaged in the last throes of its torturous negotiations with the Iraqis , who have finally agreed to the terms of a status of forces agreement with the U.S.
What this means , in short , is that U.S. troops will be authorized to stay in the country until 2011 — way beyond what Obama promised .
Of course , this does n’t mean that they will stay in that long , necessarily , only that the new president has cover now to break his campaign promise , without much of a fuss being made by the Iraqis .
As for the Americans , Congress wo n’t mind , and if it comes to a vote the pro-war faction of the Democrats can always line up with the GOP , as they did in the Bush era .
In order to understand how the sellout happened , however , let ’s rewind the tape .
As luck would have it , the economy ’s collapse occurred just at the high point of the general election campaign .
This was a big break for the War Party : it meant , first of all , that the focus was taken off two losing wars — their gift to the new president .
It also meant that the incoming president would have his hands full with domestic issues .
People are losing their jobs , their homes , and their minds ; this is no time to worry about the fate of South Ossetia .
Indeed , the problems of the U.S. economy — and the global market — are so overwhelming , that certainly President Obama will have to make them his first and virtually sole concern from the moment he ’s sworn in .

The Best of Justin Raimondo
Regardless of the squabbles of whether Dead Space or Bioshock is the better game , there is not doubt that Bioshock is an incredible game , one that , on it ’s release , stunned the gaming world .
It was a game that had everything , slick visuals , intense atmosphere , Oscar - deserving story , it was beautiful .
We already know that a sequel titled , Bioshock 2 : Sea Of Dreams is in development and expected this year , but Christoph Hartmann believes that the titles could have five sequels .
Global President of 2 K Christoph Hartmann , in an interview with MCV , said that Bioshock has the potential to emulate the Star Wars series , but he promised fans that 2 K will not “ cash in ” on the title .
– ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW –
In the interview , Hartmann said :
“ Some of the mega - franchises we talk about only lasted ten years because companies took five years to ship a game .
Look at Duke Nukem .
It ’s been a great franchise for 20 years , because it seems like it ’s been in development for 20 years .
“ For Bioshock , because it ’s so story driven , the question obviously arises : how long can you do it without turning into The Matrix ?
The first Matrix was great , the second one was weird and the third one , you thought : ‘ Who [ making this ] is on crack and who is n’t ?’.
“ But , then again , look at Star Wars .
It ’s a fight between good and evil , just like Bioshock .
If we spin it the right way and get the right twist of innovation , we can make six parts of it , as Star Wars did .
“ But we have to be careful not to cash in .
I wo n’t name the company , but there was a great racing game years ago .
They brought it back year - on - year .
If you look at the scores , it ’s hard to believe what they ’ve done to it .
It ’s upsetting , actually . ”
Whilst I have high hopes for Bioshock 2 : Sea Of Dreams , if they plan to make that many sequels , they must be very careful and ensure that every single one is of the highest quality .
( CNN ) -- Russia 's Gazprom planned to resume gas supplies to Europe Tuesday , with lines to be reopened by 7 a.m. GMT ( 2 a.m. ET ) , Russian media quoted a Gazprom official as saying .
Naftogaz chief Oleg Dubina , left , and Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller reach a deal in Moscow Monday .
The heads of Russia 's Gazprom and Ukraine 's Naftogaz signed a new deal Monday to end a long , bitter dispute that has left many European countries running short of fuel during a frigid winter .
Russian gas could take 24 hours or more to reach Europe via Ukraine 's pipeline system due to the large distance the gas needs to travel , experts say .
The agreement came after meetings between the two countries ' prime ministers Sunday and Monday , negotiations Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko described as " difficult . "
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the 10 - year agreement would " provide long - term , stable and reliable gas deliveries . "
Both said they hoped the gas crisis would never be repeated and pledged to do everything possible to make sure Europeans start getting gas as quickly as possible .
Russia is a major supplier of natural gas to a dozen or more countries in Europe , with much of the supply moving through pipelines across Ukraine .
But Ukraine and Russia locked horns at the end of last year over Ukraine 's past payments for Russian gas and failed to agree on the terms for a new contract .
As a result , Russia turned off Ukraine 's gas but promised the supply of gas to Europe through Ukraine would be unaffected .
Despite the guarantee , European supply was brought to a halt nearly two weeks ago , something each side blamed on the other .
The gas shutoff left millions in Europe suffering from shortages in heating and cooking gas during an unseasonably cold winter .
Eastern Europe , in particular , is experiencing historic low temperatures this year .
An earlier European Union effort to broker a deal between Russian and Ukrainian gas companies failed to solve the problem .
An agreement was signed and the EU agreed to send observers to monitor gas flow , but gas supplies did not resume .
The EU subsequently called the problem a bilateral one that Russia and Ukraine needed to resolve .
The bloc has repeatedly said the longer the dispute drags out , the more damage it does to both nation 's credibility and reliability as energy suppliers .
Under the deal reached Sunday , Russia will give Ukraine a 20 percent discount on the price it charges Europe for gas .
In exchange , Ukraine will not hike the fees it charges Russia to transport gas onward to European countries .
Under the deal , Ukraine will pay $ 360 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas in 2009 , and charge Russia a transit rate of $ 1.7 per 1,000 cubic meters per 100 kilometers that it had been paying in 2008 .
But starting from next year , both countries will switch to the full European market gas prices , both for gas purchases and the transit .
The countries that faced the most serious problems were those that import a majority of their gas from Russia .
Lithuania depends on Russia for 85 percent of its gas ; Slovakia for 100 percent , and Bulgaria for 90 percent , according to figures compiled in 2006 by the European Council on Foreign Relations .

a modern - day hobo's journey across canada
by matthew power for blue : the adventure lifestyle
vol 3 , no .

( december 2000 - January 2001 )
Day One : Mile 0 , Vancouver , British Columbia
Today is the day .
It 's early August , but this far north the summer is waning fast , and I am ready to begin the long trip from Vancouver to New York City .
The plan , hatched around a campfire on the beach a week previous , is to ride the Canadian Pacific rail line 3,000 miles east , across half a dozen mountain ranges and the vast wheat ocean of the great plains .
I wake up to a gray dawn on Wreck Beach at the western edge of Vancouver , wrapped up in a tent fly that has kept out none of the night 's drizzle .
A mist rises off the Georgia Strait revealing Vancouver Island in the distance .
I wake up Pike , my traveling companion since we met several weeks before in Southern Colorado .
He 's from Clearwater , Florida , with a bushy beard that does n't hide a babyface .
Pike is a much more experienced trainhopper , who I hope will serve as a fitting guide for our a trip .
Neither of us has ever been on this line , and are n't really sure what we 're in for .
All we have to guide us are a few notes cribbed from some trainhoppers in Eugene , Oregon , and a diner placemat printed with a rough map of Canada .
But greater journeys have been undertaken with less .
After packing up our gear , we ride a bus to the eastern edge of the city where the yard of the CP lies hidden behind a row of warehouses .
We stock up on supplies for what could be a five - day ride : trail mix , granola bars , dried fruit and as much water as we can carry .
We walk several miles to the yard , and the long low sound of a train whistle grabs our attention .
The trains from this yard , according to my rough notes , are only going one way .
Although Canada is the second largest country in the world ( after Russia ) , it is remarkably linear ; 90 percent of the population lives within 200 miles of the US border , and freight lines only run where they are needed .
The Canadian Pacific line shadows the Trans - Canada Highway , the main artery running 3,000 miles from Vancouver to St John 's , Newfoundland , in more or less a straight shot .
We 're catching out to go all the way home .
We find a hidden spot in the trees about twenty yards from the tracks to sit and wait .
It is a truism with riding freight that you spend as much time sitting around and waiting for the train as you do actually riding it .
Even with a tip from a friendly worker about when the train is pulling out , you are a nonpaying customer and on the railroad 's schedule .
Pike lectures me as we sit in the shade .
" What we want is a hotshot , high priority freight that 's going express from the coast to Toronto .
Usually they 're pulled by four units .
That 's gonna take us four days non-stop , except for crew changes every eight hours or so .
It 'll be loaded with mixed freight : car carriers , piggybacks , gondolas , forty - eights .
Tankers are unridable .
There might be some grainers , which are good to ride in , but try and pick a double - holed grainer over a single .
There 's more room .
Do n't get in a gondola that 's carrying anything .
The freight tends to shift , and it can squish you like a bug .
And always throw your bag off first when you get off .
If we get in an empty boxcar , make sure you stick a railroad spike in the door to hold it open , because if that door closes with you in it , they might not find you for months .
But we probably are n't gonna ride any boxcars .
They 're only on junkers .
Oh , and if we go in a tunnel , wet a cloth and cover your nose and mouth . "
I get him to explain to me that a unit is the train 's engine , a piggyback is a truck trailer loaded on a flatbed , a gondola is an open - topped cargo container , and a forty - eight is a double - stacked cargo container that can go on a boat , train or truck .
Tankers are sealed oil cars with no place to ride , and grainers are for carrying dry freight like grain and fertilizer .
A junker , which we want to avoid , is a low - priority train that stops to let hotshots by and probably is n't going very far .
There 's a whistle , and the low thunder of a train taking up its slack as it heads out .
I feel like I 'm going to puke from sheer terror at the thought of running up after a moving train and climbing on .
From where the rails vanish behind a copse , the rumbling gets louder and , in what seems like slow motion , the first engine bursts into view .
I can see the engineer , leaning out the window , his forearm on the sill .
I swear he looks straight at me , even though he 's 50 yards away and I 'm well hidden .
Three more engines pass and Pike is throwing his pack on .
I follow his lead , feeling drunk , blood roaring in my ears along with the clacking of the train as it slowly begins to pick up speed .
" Come on ! " Pike screams .
" It 's just gonna get faster ! "
So he starts running , his pack bouncing up and down like it's got a kangaroo in it , and I follow .
We scramble up the embankment by the tracks , the train speeding up .
" Pick your ride ! " he shouts .
The cars going by are long grain cars , with ladders and short covered porches , maybe four feet by eight , on both ends .
I jog alongside the train , trying to keep up , the gravel giving way under my feet and the cars sliding by .
I place one hand on a ladder rung and the train jerks ahead , but I hold on .
The sensation is like having a large dog tugging on its leash .
But this dog weighs thousands of tons .
Hanging on , I try to put one foot on the bottom rung .
It wo n't reach , so without thinking I put my foot on the hub around which the flashing silver wheel turns , just behind the ladder .
Visions of dismemberment flash through my head .
Stupid , stupid , I think .
I step up onto the bottom rung with my other foot , leaving the ground and trusting my full weight to the train .
The disembodied sensation of taking off in an airplane pales compared to catching hold of a train and not letting go .
It 's like grabbing the landing gear as the plane taxis up the runway .
Suddenly , all the nausea of anticipation is gone .
I am flying .
I get both legs up on the ladder , and swing around , stepping onto the small porch at the front of the car and see Pike jumping on two cars back .
The train is going over a highway overpass .
Dozens of cars pass under me , and I wonder which one is going to call the Mounties on a cell phone .
An opening , at the back of the porch , is about the size of a manhole cover .
Inside is a little crawl space , just big enough for me and my pack .
Everything is covered with a thick coating of diesel dust and rust .
I squeeze through the hole .
Darkness .
The violent shaking of the car .
A cacophony of the thousands of pieces of steel that make up the car rattling staccato .
It smells of pigeons .
I turn like a breech birth to get my head back out the hole and see the countryside flying by : sun dapple through leaves , fields of hay , orchards a month from harvest .
The sound of the grainer is almost musical , the thunderous boom of the empty hopper traveling back to the wheat fields of Saskatchewan after hauling tons of grain to the coast , the falsetto of a braking wheel against the track , the machine - gun crackle of the slack being taken up in a mile of railcars as they begin to roll .
Instantly we are in the absolute black of a tunnel .
The world closes in around me and I cover my mouth and nose with my shirt .
I can't tell if I 'm hyperventilating from fear or asphyxiating on diesel fumes .
It seems endless , and I shine my flashlight along the rough - hewn walls only a foot away from the train 's sides .
The tunnel seems haunted , dug and blasted by ghosts a century earlier .
It is an enormous relief when we burst back out into the light and clean air .
The Canadian Pacific Railway was derided in Canada 's parliament in 1871 as an " act of insane recklessness . "
After approval , it took 14 years to complete and was one of the most intense building projects in history .
It served to unify Canada as a country , to tie a psychological knot between St John's , Newfoundland , and Victoria , British Columbia , 4,000 miles apart .
The railroad was built by Scots , Irish , French Canadians , and some 8,000 Chinese coolies ( a phonetic pronunciation of k'u li , " bitter strength " ) .
Some 800 men died building it , in rockslides , avalanches and tunnel collapses .
They also died of scurvy and pneumonia .
Men would stumble carrying ten - gallon drums of nitroglycerine and blow themselves to pieces .
They drove the railway through some of the most impenetrable country on earth for a dollar a day , and now Pike and I are borne along it , reading the marks they left behind like hieroglyphs .
In the tunnels you seem to hear the echoes of picks and the calls of the work gangs .
The sun sets as we pass beneath the shadow of the Coast Range , a line of rainforest - cloaked , glacier - capped peaks marching up the west coast all the way to the Tongass of southeastern Alaska .
Soon the lush coastal forests give way to a drier landscape and the train snakes up along the Fraser River Gorge , the milky gray water swirling in great eddies as the train rumbles over trestles spanning tributaries hundreds of feet below .
Twilight falls and a crescent moon rises .
A hundred yards ahead , the engine is a fire - breathing dragon casting a beam of light against the immense stone walls as it rounds bends .
On an island in the middle of the raging river hundreds of feet below , a group of people stands around a bonfire , their rafts pulled onto the shore .
We see them , but they have no idea that Pike and I exist .
I stand there for hours , unable to take my eyes off of the passing scene .
This rolling connection with the landscape is travel reduced to its purest essence .
When night falls , we roar through an anonymous lumber town , a huge conical scrapwood burner erupting red - hot sparks a hundred feet into the air until they wink out among the cold blue stars .
I am standing on the porch with a hand on the ladder .
If I fell off out here , no one would know .
There 's the argument that trainhopping is illegal and dangerous .
Absolutely true .
We are facing a CAN$ 600 fine and extradition back to the States if we 're caught .
And it is risky , the train jerking violently , making sudden stops , rattling over trestles hundreds of feet in the air .
A moment of inattention would leave either of us a pile of carrion for the black bears and eagles .
Still , the risk seems to fall behind when your feet leave the ground .
Pike tells me about two girls hopping together .
One lost both legs and her friend had to drag her to the highway by her backpack straps .
The Federal Railroad Administration reported over 500 train - related fatalities in 1999 , but does n't keep separate statistics for the number of these that were hopping .
The Transportation Safety Board of Canada reported 109 train - related fatalities in 1999 , over half of which are attributed to trainhopping .
The risk is real , but on that car with the moon over the Fraser Gorge , there seemed to be nothing more beautiful .
The towns , farther and farther apart , pass by in moments .
In the middle of the night the train shudders to a stop in a darkened yard .
Pike and I huddle in the crawl space , wrapped in sleeping bags .
Suddenly there are footsteps in the gravel right next to us , and voices .
An icicle of fear goes through my heart .
We 've been caught already !
The footsteps get closer , they 're right outside the hole .
Just when I 'm about to come out with my hands up , I hear the telltale rattle of a spraypaint can being shaken .
My fear melts instantly and I stifle a laugh .
A bunch of kids tagging a train in the middle of the night .
Pike sticks his head out of the hole and says " Hey , what town are we in ? "
The kids take off running , despite Pike 's crying after them " It 's all right , we 're just hobos ! "
We have become ghosts to the stationary world .
The anonymous artists never finished their tags , but the raiI system in North America has a rich history of hobo graffiti , itinerants marking their date and direction on the vast web of the rails , with a whole set of symbols devised to communicate and help each other out .
Names like Flange Squeal , The Artful Dodger , Bag Man , Broke Toe and XLR8 adorn cars from Vancouver to Miami .
The hobo population boomed as industrialization displaced workers and a mobile workforce was needed to do the labor of westward expansion .
The railroads were the only way to circulate this large mobile workforce .
They followed harvests , camped in " jungles " on the edges of cities , and moved to wherever there was work .
The Depression swelled their numbers to millions , whole families rode the rails in search of opportunity , and the hobo subculture in North America hit its apex .
An extraordinary amount of American history has flowed along the rails that cross the continent .
After World War II , the primacy of the automobile led to a decline of the railroads .
There were mergers and closures of many of the independent lines , and massive government bailouts .
With the decline of railroads the hobo culture went underground .
Most people consider it a thing of the past .
Why should you hop trains when you can take a Greyhound ?
But a small and thriving tribe of people still do it .
Most , like the hobos of the Depression , are the displaced who have been left on the margins of our thriving economy : refugees from Mexico and Central America , homeless vets , alcoholics , anyone who does n't fit into the tidy box of capitalist culture .
And of course there are people like Pike , who do it for the unalloyed sense of freedom it provides .
That 's why I 've joined him .
Stealing a ride in the belly of the beast that carries fertilizer , televisions , oil , nuclear waste and cows to slaughter all across our continent is liberating because it comes in under the radar of the market .
It ca n't be bought or sold .
There are no Extreme Trainhopper sneakers to purchase .
Unless you get caught , trainhopping does n't cost a dime .
Day Two : Mile 363 , Revelstoke , British Columbia
All the next day we wind slowly into the Rockies toward the Great Divide , through fields of wildflowers and bright blue glacial streams .
The palette of colors is impossibly bright , with glaciers looming thousands of feet above us like great pieces of sky fallen on the mountaintops .
Our train dead - ends in Field , BC , the engines disconnect .
Now we have to get to the next crew change spot to try and catch another train .
We hitch 100 miles to Calgary and so bypass the famous spiral tunnels outside Field , where the train does two consecutive loops inside the mountain as it climbs .
I do n't mind not having to spend 20 minutes in that black , fume - filled hole .
At Calgary the mountains end and the plains begin an uninterrupted flow across the continent .
" You can see Regina from here , " our ride tells us .
There are 500 miles of treeless prairie between us and there .
Day Three : Mile 614 , Calgary , Alberta
An oil rig roughneck rides us through a hundred miles of sagebrush and pumpjacks bobbing their heads like awful metal birds drinking oil from the earth .
He lets us off in the town of Red Cliff , where a long grain train happens to sit sided by the road .
We jump down , shoulder our packs and run through the grass to the rail bed , climbing on just as the train pulls out .
A litany of towns pass by : Medicine Hat , Maplecreek , Gull Lake , Antelope , Swift Current .
We never know exactly where we are , figuring out by random signs and landmarks where the train is taking us .
In the unendurable expanse of the plains , east is all that matters for the moment .
A tiny wooden sign , surrounded for miles in every direction by nothing but waving wheat , informs us that we are in Saskatchewan .
Over two hundred square miles and a million people , two - thirds in cities , Saskatchewan exudes a loneliness that makes me think of the Russian steppes .
Many of the towns are known only from the names on grain elevators .
Their only reason for existing is to provide a place to load the millions of tons of wheat a year hauled to the urban centers and coasts .
They loom up out of the plains like skyscrapers , a beautiful weathered functionality that inspired the international style of Le Corbusier .
In the flaming red sunset we roll past a doe splayed by the side of the tracks after being hit by our train .
We pass a flock of migrating pelicans in a lake at dusk .
The sound of the train fades into the background , and I sing Woody Guthrie 's " Hobo 's Lullaby " off - key to Pike , but he 's already sleeping .
Day Four : Mile 1030 , Moose Jaw , Saskatchewan
We wake up in Moose Jaw , an outpost in the middle of the endless wheat fields .
The train shudders to a full stop and we sneak off through a drainage ditch of cattails .
A lift tells us that Moose Jaw is what the Indians thought this bend in the river looked like , or maybe what the first settler used to repair his wagon wheel .
An hour later , in Regina , we walk to the railyard , climb a fence and wait for a train to pullout .
A bull drives back and forth in his white pickup .
A string of grainers starts edging out of the yard and we scramble on , diving into a hole before we 're seen .
I 've gotten much more adept at climbing on a moving train now .
I look back out from the hole and I 'm greeted by two smiling faces sticking out from the back hole of the car ahead .
A boy and a girl , maybe 15 and 16 , all dreadlocks and bright smiles .
Suddenly , the train takes a sharp left going out of the yard and the kids across shout , " Jump ! this train 's going to Saskatoon ! "
Saskatoon , 350 miles to the northwest , is the last place I want to go .
We throw our packs off and jump , landing running in the loose gravel .
By some miracle and a little grace , I 'm the only one who does n't face plant .
The kids are returning to Winnipeg after a rave in Regina , neither has a car or money and hitching in Saskatchewan is difficult , especially with dreadlocks .
That pretty much leaves freight riding as the only option .
Another train is pulling out , two bright red units pulling mixed freight .
The engineer looks right at us .
My heart drops .
The boy , whose name I do n't even know , walks right up to the engineer and they gesticulate over the roar of the engine .
The boy runs back , grabs his pack and gestures us to follow him as we climb up the ladder into the second engine .
" What did you say to him ? " I ask .
" I said , ' Are you going to Winnipeg , eh ? ' " he replies with a smile .
Canadian Pacific has provided us with hydraulic chairs , a computerized readout of speed and weight , a bathroom and a refrigerator .
We patch up our cuts with the first aid kit and sit back for the 12 - hour ride to Winnipeg .
The engineer gets on the intercom from the lead engine and says to us , " Stay down until we 're out of town .
And do n't touch anything . "
The number one rule of riding trains is to never damage rail property .
We know he 's putting his job on the line by giving us a ride .
If we get caught , he 'll just pretend he did n't know we were there .
We speed through the night , sleeping splayed on the chairs , on the floor , watching the dark prairie tear by out the open window .
Day Five : Mile 1428 , Winnepeg , Manitoba
In the morning , the sun rises like a new penny .
The vast roll of wheat fields gives over to stands of poplar and cottonwood , and we pull into the huge switchyard of Winnipeg .
A dozen tracks wide , trains are being broken down and built up , trains emblazoned with names of forgotten rail lines , companies swallowed up by mergers , their rolling freight rusting reminders of a time when rail freight was the only game in town .
Now the Trans - Canada Highway carries a huge share of the cargo .
As the train creeps through the yard , a flock of pigeons bursts from the darkness of an open boxcar , flashing silver in the morning light .
This train is the hotshot , a high priority freight train to Toronto that we 've wanted all along .
But now we have to get off because the crew is switching shifts and we do n't want our guy to get in trouble .
We go to a diner near the tracks and in the bathroom I see how filthy I am .
I 'm covered in rust and oil , like AI Jolson with a big Cheshire cat smile on my face .
For some reason it makes me happy , and I do n't want to clean up .
Bruised and worn out from the trains , Pike wants to try hitching again .
We are in the Kenora yard at nightfall , a light rain is falling .
We 're worn out and arguing over trains or hitching , and both refusing to compromise .
I decide to wait for a train no matter what .
Pike decides to sleep by the highway , believing he 'll have better luck hitching alone .
This is where we split up .
Pike will head south to Florida , I will go over the top of the Great Lakes to New York .
He walks away into the darkness .
A beautiful loneliness washes over me .
I sit all night under a bridge in the rain , waiting for a train .
Everything sounds like a train : the downshifting of trucks on the Trans - Canada , car horns , distant thunder , my own heart beating .
I can't sleep .
I 'm feeling sordid , sitting in the weeds by the track 's edge , five days out of Vancouver .
Whenever a bull drives by , I duck down .
In the middle of the night the roar of a passing train wakes me up .
I look up and see it's a westbound hotshot , rolling right past an eastbound hotshot on the secondary track .
Heart racing , I throw everything in my bag , throw the bag on my back , grab the ladder and step up .
In a moment I 'm sitting on the porch of a forty - eight , going through the predawn chill at 60 miles an hour .
The stars wheel overhead , tracing our arc over the top of Lake Superior .
Day Six : Mile 1800 , Thunder Bay , Ontario
As the sun rises I pass through a country of abandoned cabins , jack pines and birches in a sea of muskegs , still black lakes with clinging mist .
The bogs of northern Ontario were as much a technical challenge in building the railroad as was going through the Rockies .
It was like building a house on a sponge .
Engineers would try to fill in the swamps with gravel to lay the rail bed down , and the soupy mud would swallow the tracks whole .
We come out on bluffs above Lake Superior , which stretches like a black ocean away to the southern horizon .
I feel like this train is the only place I belong .
I slip easily into the habit of hiding when we roll through towns , I feel the rhythms of the wheels as a function of my own body .
The train shudders to a stop with a rattle of slack action .
The sounds of the forest , previously veiled by the train , rise up in an instant chorus .
There is no town , maybe they are just waiting for a switch signal to side for another train .
I hear frogs , bees , birdsongs , wind in the leaves .
And there by the tracks , not ten feet away , is a heavily laden raspberry bramble .
The train is at a dead stop .
I jump off and grab raspberries by the fistful , scratching my arms , the sweet juice running down my neck through the rust and oil .
Maybe only bears have ever eaten here , I think .
Maybe I am the first human ever to eat from this patch , a hundred miles from the nearest town .
The berries are perfect .
I am nowhere near home .
The train is waiting for me , it has n't pulled out yet .
All the ghosts of the workers who built this railroad , all the people who have knowingly or not helped me across the huge continent , all swirl around me in those few moments .
This is a great secret of trainhopping .
And this is what it means to be alive .

LAS VEGAS , Nevada ( CNN ) -- Former gridiron great O.J. Simpson will serve at least nine years in prison for his role in an armed confrontation with sports memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas hotel in 2007 .
O.J. Simpson told the judge Friday that he was sorry for what he did but did n't think it was wrong .
Simpson was sentenced to a maximum of 33 years with the possibility of parole after nine .
Before the sentence , he offered a rambling , emotional apology in which he told District Judge Jackie Glass , his voice shaking , that he was sorry for his actions but believed he did nothing wrong .
Glass , however , brushed his apology aside , saying his actions amounted to " much more than stupidity , " and calling him both arrogant and ignorant .
" Earlier in this case , at a bail hearing , I said to Mr. Simpson , I did n't know if he was arrogant , ignorant or both , " Glass said .
" During the trial and through this proceeding , I got the answer , and it was both . "
She stressed that the sentence was not " payback for anything else , " apparently referring to Simpson 's acquittal 13 years ago in the slayings of his former wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend Ron Goldman .
Watch the judge say the sentence is n't about the past »
Grimacing , Simpson was escorted from the courtroom in shackles .
Defense attorneys said Glass ' sentence was appropriate .
" It could have been a lot worse , " Yale Galanter said , noting that Simpson and co-defendant Clarence " C.J. "
Stewart both could have been sentenced to life in prison .
A jury convicted Simpson , 61 , and Stewart , 54 , on 12 charges including conspiracy to commit a crime , robbery , assault and kidnapping with a deadly weapon stemming from a September 13 , 2007 , incident at Las Vegas ' Palace Station hotel and casino .
Prosecutors alleged that Simpson led a group of men who used threats , guns and force to take sports memorabilia from dealers Bruce Fromong and Al Beardsley .
Simpson claimed that he was attempting to recover items that belonged to him .
All the men except Stewart made deals with prosecutors in exchange for their testimony .
" We 're happy that this case is coming to an end , " Clark County district attorney David Roger said .
" We 're satisfied that we presented a good case to a jury , that the jury listened to all the evidence , particularly the audiotapes , and came to the resolution that we asked them to come to . "
He said he thought the sentence was fair .
Simpson 's conviction came October 3 , the 13th anniversary of his controversial acquittal in the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman .

Glass said , " I 'm not here to sentence Mr. Simpson for what 's happened in his life previously in the criminal justice system .
...
The jury decided .
There are many people who disagree with that verdict , but that does n't matter to me . "
Goldman 's father and sister were in the courtroom for Friday 's sentencing .
" The back of his head looks the same as it did every day that we watched him in the criminal case , and we feel very proud of our efforts , " Kim Goldman said .
" We feel very strongly that because of our pursuit of him for all these years , that it did drive him to the brink of this . "
Although Simpson was acquitted in the deaths , a civil jury later found him liable , slapping him with a $ 33 million judgment .
Attorneys for the Goldman family have doggedly pursued Simpson 's financial assets to pay the judgment .
In sentencing Simpson on Friday , Glass noted that he can be heard on tapes of the incident referring to the Goldmans as " gold - diggers " and saying he does n't want them to get his property .
See how his sentence breaks down »
" If that pushed him over the edge , great , " Fred Goldman said afterward .
" Put him where he belongs . "
Watch Fred and Kim Goldman react »
Galanter said he thought the Goldmans ' presence was " inappropriate . "
" I do n't think they should have been here , " he said .
" It reminded us all how the criminal justice system can run afoul , because the only thing Simpson should have been judged on is what happened here in Nevada . "
Denise Brown , the sister of Nicole Brown Simpson , issued a statement on the sentence saying , " It is very sad to think that an individual who had it all , an amazing career , beautiful wife and two precious children , has ended up like this .
" Allowing wealth , power and control to consume himself , he made a horrific choice on June 12 , 1994 , which has spiraled into where he is today . "
Brown said she was saddened that the couple 's two children " once again face the tragedy of yet another parent absent in their lives . "
In the statement , she asks for prayers for the children , Sydney and Justin , and the Brown family .
Before being sentenced , Simpson told Glass he was " sorry , somewhat confused , apologetic . "
He said the items he was trying to recover were his late ex-wife 's wedding ring for his daughter and family photos for his son .
Watch Simpson 's apology »
" I just wanted my personal things .
I was stupid .
I 'm sorry , " Simpson said .
" I did n't know I was doing anything illegal .
I thought I was confronting friends .
I thought I was retrieving my things .
I did n't mean to hurt anybody , and I did n't mean to steal anything . "
But Glass rejected those statements in imposing the sentence .
" When you take a gun with you and you take men with you ... in a show of force , that 's not just a ' Hey , give me my stuff back , ' " Glass said .
" That 's something else .
And that 's what went on here , and that 's why we 're all here .
" I have to tell you , it was much more than stupidity .
...
You went to the room , you took guns -- meaning you and the group -- you used force , you took property , whether it was yours or somebody else 's , and in this state , that amounts to robbery with the use of a deadly weapon . "
The judge said Simpson 's contrite words in court were not as powerful as his angry words , as caught on tape , during the confrontation .
" Everything in this case was on tape , " Glass said .
" The evidence in this case was overwhelming . "
Simpson 's attorneys asked that he be sentenced to no more than six years .
A presentencing report recommended an 18 - year term .
Stewart received a sentence similar to Simpson 's but will be eligible for parole in 7 ½ years .
" I am as happy as someone could be when they know their client is going to reside for at least seven years in a cage , " said Stewart 's attorney , Brent Bryson .
Defense attorneys for both Simpson and Stewart have said they will appeal .
On Friday , Glass denied motions asking that both defendants be allowed out on bail while the appeal is pending .

All About O.J. Simpson • Nicole Brown Simpson
The US economy shed 533,000 jobs last month as the worst employment figures since 1974 underlined the scale of the economic crisis gripping the country .
The shock data for November far exceeded economists ' most pessimistic estimates as it was revealed that 1.9 million people have lost their jobs since the world 's largest economy entered a recession last December .
The FTSE 100 index fell 2.7 % as it closed down 114 points at 4049 on the news but Wall Street rallied , with the Dow gaining 259 points on the hope that falling oil prices will boost consumers and businesses .
The US unemployment rate is now 6.7 % , up from 6.5 % in October , its highest level since 1993 .
Nigel Gault , chief US economist at forecasting firm IHS Global Insight , said the economy was now destined for its worst recession since the second world war .
" These are just absolutely disastrous numbers , " he said .
The figures will increase the expectation on the incoming president , Barack Obama , who is planning an economic stimulus package when he takes office in January .
Some experts have called for an injection of at least $ 700 bn ( £ 380 bn ) into the US economy and Obama has pledged to create 2.5 million new jobs over his first two years in office .
Obama warned today that " there are no quick or easy fixes " to the crisis as he again avoided giving specific details on how he will jump - start the economy , preferring to outline his programme when he assumes office on January 20 .
He added : " At the same time , this ... provides us with an opportunity to transform our economy . "
Today 's announcement brings the jobless total to 10.3 million people out of a total workforce of 154.6 million .
Economists believe the unemployment rate will peak at between 8.7 % and 9.8 % over the next two years .
" We are going to see the labour market remain very , very weak throughout the remainder of this year and 2009 .
It hinges on the monetary and fiscal response , " said Ryan Sweet , senior economist at Moody 's economy.com .
The Federal Reserve Bank will consider the latest jobs figures when it discusses interest rates , currently at 1 % , on December 16 .
Economists said the US central bank could be encouraged to cut rates further amid confirmation today that inflation is a vastly diminished threat , with the spot price of Brent crude oil falling to less than $ 40 , against a record high of $ 147 earlier this year .
Hourly employee earnings also posted a modest month - on - month rise , up 0.4 % to $ 18.30 , underlining the lack of upward pressure on wages .
However , economists warned that the hourly earnings figure did not bode well for consumer spending , which accounts for more than two - thirds of US economic activity .
The employment data also points to a severe contraction in the world 's largest economy in the final quarter of this year , with many forecasts indicating a decline in gross domestic product of 4 % following a fall of 0.5 % in the previous three months .
The US economy tipped into recession in December last year , a panel of experts declared earlier this week .
Wachovia , the Charlotte - based banking group , said it now expected the US economy to decline by 5 % because the downturn , driven by a credit shortage that is reining in consumer spending , has spread to nearly all sections of the economy .
" Over the last year , the breadth of industries adding jobs has dropped sharply suggesting broad weakness in consumer spending and dismal consumer confidence , " said John Silvia , chief economist at Wachovia .
Today 's jobs data showed job cuts in every sector barring healthcare , education and the government .
The service industry suffered the heaviest job losses in November , shedding 370,000 posts .
Within that total , retailers axed 91,000 jobs and professional and business services , which includes the financial sector , made 136,000 people redundant .
The goods - producing industries lost 163,000 jobs with 82,000 jobs going in construction and 85,000 in manufacturing .
Companies that shed jobs last month included Toy firm Mattel , electronics retailer Circuit City and Citigroup , the banking giant .
The bleakest forecasts had predicted job losses of up to 500,000 .
Today 's number for declines in non-farm payrolls easily outstripped mid-range forecasts of less than 400,000 and is the worst since December 1974 , when 602,000 people lost their jobs .
The jobless rate in the 1980 to 1982 recession peaked at 10.8 % , the worst since the Great Depression .
The current US recession is expected to match its post - war predecessors in terms of length .
According to the National Bureau of Economic Research , which called a recession this week , the downturn is 12 months old and needs to last five more months to outrank the 1973 - 1975 and 1980 - 1982 recessions .
The figures for September and October also saw sharp upward revisions , meaning almost 200,000 more jobs were lost than had initially been thought .
The original estimates for September were 284,000 and 240,000 in October , however those have been revised upwards to 403,000 and 320,000 respectively .
The news comes in the same week retailers confirmed that consumer spending is in full - scale retreat with major stores announcing November sales declines of more than 10 % .
Retailers traditionally hire more workers for the peak shopping season but the November sales figure indicates that December could be a dire month for jobs as well .
" We are going to see weak seasonal hiring in the retail sector and there are very few sectors that are adding jobs , " said economy.com 's Sweet .

State building new death chamber / Lawmakers accuse governor of hiding San Quentin project
2007-04-13 15:38:00 PDT
Sacramento -- Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's administration has quietly begun building a new execution chamber at San Quentin State Prison , prompting angry lawmakers who just learned about the construction this week to accuse the governor of hiding the project from the Legislature and the public .
Prison officials began construction in January after concluding it would cost $ 399,000 -- just under the $ 400,000 price tag that would have required legislative approval , according to an administration document obtained Friday by the Chronicle .
The new death chamber is being built as the state 's use of capital punishment is under review by a federal court and lawmakers have yet to authorize a larger construction project to revamp the prison 's entire Death Row .
" To sneak a project like this through is just outrageous , " said Assemblyman Jared Huffman , D - San Rafael , whose Marin County district includes San Quentin .
" We will find out what kind of creative accounting they 've done . "
A spokesman for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said the new execution chamber , being built near the site of the current chamber at San Quentin , was part of Schwarzenegger 's response to a federal judge 's ruling in December that the state 's haphazard method of lethal injection could be unconstitutional .
" This is part of the attempt to bring the lethal injection process up to the level the judge has requested , " said Seth Unger , press secretary for the department .
U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Fogel ordered Schwarzenegger in December to come up with changes .
Among the concerns that Fogel cited , which included the administration of the drugs used for executions , was the dimly lit and cramped space the state used as its execution chamber for lethal injections .
Schwarzenegger filed a response to Fogel 's ruling in January that said he would enact changes by mid May , although he did not say he would build a new death chamber .
A Jan. 23 memo from corrections officials to the Department of Finance described the new construction project , saying the state had been directed by the judge to create a new chamber -- an assertion that appears to be untrue .
The memo also notes the project 's price tag would be $ 399,000 and therefore would not require legislative approval .
No one outside the administration knew about the construction until this week , when staffers with the Legislative Analyst 's Office were on a routine tour of the prison and were shown the project , which is expected to be finished by early May .
Construction workers are renovating an exisiting structure at the prison to use as the new execution chamber , will include separate rooms for the condemned inmate , the media and other visitors .
The Legislative Analyst's Office -- a nonpartisan agency that provides financial advice to the Legislature -- is seeking information from the administration about the project , including how it arrived at the price tag .
State law allows departments to make minor capitol improvements such as repairs without notifying the Legislature as long as the cost is less than $ 400,000 , according to Brian Brown , who works on corrections issues for the analyst 's office .
Any project that costs more than $ 400,00 requires legislative approval .
Lawmakers questioned the price of the project .
Assemblyman Mark Leno , D - San Francisco , calling the secrecy of a project involving such a high - profile issue " insulting . "
" Why not $ 399,999.99 ? "
Leno asked facetiously .
" The question is , was this price tag a coincidence ? "
Unger said the department was under a tight timeline to make changes that did n't " allow the normal budget process . "
" Our facilities managers were able to construct it for that amount of money and so we chose to go with that process , " Unger said .
He noted the department intended to inform the Legislature of the project in an upcoming quarterly report that lists all minor construction projects that cost less than $ 400,000 .
Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata , D - Oakland , said the cost was " suspicious , " and said he would demand that corrections officials explain the project at a public hearing .
Perata noted that two of his aides were at San Quentin earlier this month and were not shown the new building .
He said the revelation about a new death chamber could slow negotiations between the governor and lawmakers on other prison issues .
" He is asking us for the authority to build $ 10 billion in new prison beds , " Perata said about the governor 's proposal to address prison overcrowding .
" But if we can't trust them on something like this , why should we trust them at all ? "
Huffman said he was particularly angry because he recently held a meeting with Schwarzenegger 's top corrections secretary , Jim Tilton , about a proposal to rebuild the entire Death Row at San Quentin and Tilton did not mention the new execution chamber .
The Schwarzenegger administration has proposed a $ 337 million project that would build new cells for Death Row inmates , who are currently living in old , cramped quarters .
The project has been proposed for years and met with opposition in Marin County , where some local officials have called for closing the 155 - year - old prison .
The new Death Row proposal is 53 percent more expensive than one proposed in 2003 , and a recent report by the Legislative Analyst 's Office recommended that lawmakers deny the project .
" Why on earth would you spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on something when the whole Death Row project is in question and we 're not sure our form of capital punishment will meet constitutional muster ? "
Huffman said .
While administration officials said in the memo initiating the project that they had been directed by the court to create a new execution chamber , there is no court order suggesting they do so .
Fogel asked the administration to come up with proposed fixes , which he plans to review after they are submitted in May .
An attorney for Michael Morales , the Death Row inmate who sued the state over its use of lethal injection , said he was not aware of the administration 's project and did not believe the governor had notified the court that it was building a new chamber .
The attorney , David Senior , noted that Schwarzenegger had requested an unusual court order that would have allowed the administration to keep its deliberations about revamping death penalty procedures under seal , which would have made it far more difficult for defense lawyers or the media to obtain any documents related to the issue .
The Chronicle and other news organizations argued against the court order , and Fogel agreed with the media in a February ruling .
" The failure to disclose what they 're doing and how they 're doing it ( at San Quentin ) meets squarely with their refusal to provide transparency throughout this process , " Senior said .
The SD Card Association has announced its next generation SD format , called SDXC ( SD eXtended Capacity ) .
The new format uses the same SD card connectors but increases the maximum storage capacity from 32 GB to 2TB .
It also increases the read / write speed , reaching a maximum of 104MB per second in 2009 with an eye toward reaching 300 MB per second in the future .
Prototype / mockup SDXC cards
– will offer up to 2TB of storage
and 300 MB per second transfer speed
These improvements should allow consumer devices using SDXC cards to store up to 100 high definition movies , 480 hours of high definition recordings , 136,000 large photographs , and many thousands of songs or audio books .
The increased read / write speeds should also allow improved frame rates in digital cameras and allow consumers to shoot professional quality video on their home equipment .
According to the SD Association , the speed of an SDXC card will not decrease as the memory capacity increases , as is often the case with current memory cards .
The card will leverage Microsoft ’s exFat file system , a file system that significantly decreases the overhead used by resource files and similar files required by the system .
Originally designed for Windows Embedded CE 6.0 and incorporated into Windows Vista Service Pack 1 , there is no information currently available concerning interoperability with other operating systems although current devices using the file system are not compatible with computers running Macintosh or Linux operating systems .
It is not clear at this time if the SD Association has a solution for users running these operating systems .
SD Association SD and SDXC roadmap
The formal specification for SDXC was released on January 7th 2009 .
Support for the higher capacity and speeds will also be integrated into other SD - related specifications including the SDHC , SDIO , and embedded SD specifications , although no timetable is available for these modifications .
Cards and devices supporting the new format will lag the specification release by a minimum of several months ( some estimations predict SDXC supported cards and devices will begin to appear near the end of 2009 or early in 2010 ) .
The SD Association expects the first SDXC cards to be 64GB with larger cards to follow later on .
In CES 2009 the SD Association showcased mockups of upcoming SDXC cards up to 2TB and discussed its roadmap for the speed increase of the SDXC format up to 300 MB per second , which should happen somewhere early in the next decade .
TFOT has reported on other memory cards and memory card formats including the A - Data Class 6 SDHC card designed specifically for use in Asus Eee PCs and the Toshiba 32 MB embedded NAND flash chip compatible with the embedded SD specification .
We have also reported on various USB drives including the OCZ Throttle , which adds External Serial ATA connectivity to a conventional USB drive , the Pretec i-Disk Bulletproof USB drive , and the Yego , which combines a USB drive with a two port USB hub .
The lorry hangs out of the ferry doors
A ferry bound for Northern Ireland has returned to Stranraer in Scotland after a lorry was discovered hanging out the back of the Stena Voyager .
The vessel was not long at sea when a loud bang was heard by passengers .
" The ship then almost came to a standstill , " Peter McCrory from Dungannon told BBC News .
" However , we discovered on looking out the rear doors there was a lorry hanging out through the back , it had burst the rear doors . "
Mr McCrory said while it had been a frightening experience , " if the boat had taken in water , it could have been a tragedy " .
He said passengers had been told that heavy - lifting equipment was needed to lift the lorry away and it could be morning before those on board could disembark .
He said that he had spoken by telephone to Ingibjorg Gisladottir , the foreign minister and head of the junior party in the ruling coalition , and there would be further talks on the timing of the election .
Drink Better Beer
Otter Creek Brewing – Stovepipe Porter
5.4 abv ( not bad , esp. for a porter )
It ’s refreshing to have a nice dark beer , since I ’ve been drinking a lot of pale ales lately , as you can tell from my recent reviews .
Porter is a very dark beer brewed with dark malts , the stout style was actually originally called a stout porter , because it is simply a strong porter .
The porter originally got it ’s name from it ’s popularity with London ’s street and river porters .
Stovepipe Porter has a dark almost black color with a roasted chocolaty flavor indicative of the style .
It is a very smooth beer and if you ’re a porter fan you ’ll like this beer .
According to their site :
“ Stovepipe Porter is made in the traditional porter stlye , and is a favorite with all porter lovers .
Ruby - black in color , Stovepipe Porter has a rich palate and a roasted , hoppy aroma .
It is delicious on its own or with a meal , and tastes great with chocolate . ”
Otter Creek Brewing is a Vermont company who is proud to brew in a very environmentally friendly manner , they also brew a line of Organic beer known as Wolaver ’s Certified Organic Ales .
They have an online brewery tour posted on their site , which provides a good look at the brewing process .
According to their site :
More than 50 years ago , aerospace engineers spent over $ 1 billion — in 1950s money — designing atomic - powered airplanes in the hope that such superfast jets could remain aloft for 15,000 miles ( 21,150 kilometers ) at a time .
They expected one pound ( half a kilogram ) of nuclear material would eliminate the need for refueling stops .
An intriguing concept , but nuclear aircraft were grounded before the end of the Cold War due to , among other things , concerns about passenger and crew exposure to radiation .
As airlines grapple with the high cost of petroleum and the growing demand for a cleaner form of fuel , might it be time to take another look at nuclear ?
Between 1946 and 1961 the U.S. Air Force and the now - defunct Atomic Energy Commission ( whose regulatory duties were taken over by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , or NRC in 1975 ) oversaw the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion ( ANP ) program .
But ANP engineers and management were mired in debate over reactor technologies , how best to transfer nuclear power to a conventional engine , and the best material to shield the crew from radiation .
Ultimately , they retrofitted the Convair B - 36 , a hybrid prop / jet - engine bomber weighing more than 400,000 pounds * ( 181,435 kilograms ) and with a wingspan of 230 feet ( 70 meters ) , to house an air - cooled reactor in the aft bomb bay .
Up front , the plane was outfitted with a 12 - ton lead - and - rubber - shielded crew compartment .
The atomic version of Convair 's plane , called " Peacemaker , " made 47 test flights over Texas and New Mexico between July 1955 and March 1957 .
But by the end of the decade , advances in conventional aircraft and engine design outmoded the atom - powered B - 36 and the public became concerned about the dangers of a nuclear reactor flying overhead .
The program also failed to yield a commercial aircraft due to its steep cost ( hundreds of millions in today 's dollars , says Stephen Schwartz , editor of The Non Proliferation Review , published by California 's Monterey Institute of International Studies ) , prompting Pres. John F. Kennedy to cancel the ANP in 1961 .
The U.S. government promptly redirected much of the project 's resources toward space exploration and the race with the Soviet Union to reach the moon .
Recently , however , the search for cleaner fuels has once again raised the specter of such airships .
Ian Poll , professor of aerospace engineering at the Cranfield University in England , in a recent lecture covered by the Times of London called for a " big research program to help the aviation industry convert from fossil fuels to nuclear energy . "
Poll , head of technology for the British government–funded Omega Project , a division of Manchester Metropolitan University that partners with industry to study the environmental impact of aviation and offer possible solutions , pointed out the need for nonkerosene - powered aircraft
" I think nuclear - powered airplanes are the answer beyond 2050 , " he said , concluding , " If we want to continue to enjoy the benefits of air travel without hindrance from environmental concerns , we need to explore nuclear power .
If aviation remains wedded to fossil fuels , it will run into serious trouble . "
Sharing the friendly skies with a nuclear reactor is probably enough to keep even the most seasoned travelers awake throughout an overnight flight , but nuclear power would have a few advantages .
In addition to not needing to refuel between flights , a nuclear - powered airplane in theory would not pollute the environment as long as the radioactive waste from its reactor could be contained ( the Air Force 's project never progressed far enough to come up with a practical way to address this ) .
Nuclear reactors are routinely used by the U.S. Navy to power its aircraft carriers and submarines .
The U.S. commissioned the first of its nuclear sub fleet , the USS Nautilus , in 1954 , and continues to rely on them today as part of its nuclear war deterrent .
The U.S.S.R. reportedly built 245 nuclear subs during the Cold War , according to the Monterey Institute of International Studies 's Center for Nonproliferation Studies .
Poll proposes nuclear - powered airplanes using reactors with engines on the wings .
" The risk of reactors cracking open in a crash could be reduced by jettisoning them before impact and bringing them down with parachutes , " he told the Times of London , adding that , in the worst - case scenario , if the armor plating around the reactor was pierced " there would be a risk of radioactive contamination over a few square miles . "
Poll declined to be interviewed for this article .
But many nuclear physicists and engineers are not on board with nuclear airplanes , especially in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 , attacks during which terrorists plowed jumbo jets into the World Trade Center and Pentagon .
" We 've been worried since 9/11 about how to protect against bad guys hijacking an aircraft and crashing it into a nuclear power plant upwind of a heavily populated area , " says David Lochbaum , director of the Union of Concerned Scientists 's Nuclear Safety Project , a group that monitors the performance of nuclear plants and the NRC , which regulates them .
" Let 's now put the nuclear reactor in the plane itself , so they can target big cities without a nuclear plant upwind , " he adds , with sarcasm .
" What a Christmas present for the terrorists of the world . "
Lochbaum worries that terrorists could hijack and use jets as nuclear missiles or take them apart for materials to build their own so - called dirty bombs .
No matter how well shielded , crew and passengers would still run a high risk of exposure to radiation ( on top of cosmic radiation that all travelers are exposed to simply from taking to the skies ) .
What 's more , the planes would have to be so large — about twice the size of a 747 — that airports would have to build special docking stations apart from their existing terminals .
Nuclear planes are " not good for anybody , " says Theodore Rockwell , founder of Radiation , Science & Health , Inc. , a non-profit organization in Chevy Chase , Md. , that advocates for objective review of low - level radiation science policies .
During World War II , Rockwell worked a program at the U.S. Department of Energy 's Oak Ridge National Laboratory , where he helped develop new materials and designs for radiation shielding .
Although a supporter of nuclear power , he draws the line at using it to fuel aircraft .
In addition to the potential passenger dangers , he says that pilots could only fly a limited number of flights to prevent overexposure to nuclear radiation , noting that after a few flights , they would have been exposed to far more radiation than nuclear power plant workers .
" Power has to be predicable to be useful , " he says , " and nuclear is by far easiest to predict on Earth . "
A more promising green fossil - fuel alternative is biofuel .
Richard Altman , executive director of the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative ( CAAFI ) , a consortium sponsored by the FAA that promotes the move away from petroleum - based jet fuel .
CAAFI favors " drop - in " fuels that work within existing infrastructures — that is , they are interchangeable with fossil fuels and require no alterations to aircraft or airports .
These alternatives include liquids from both renewable ( plants ) and nonrenewable ( coal and natural gas ) sources that are better than an oil refinery on a greenhouse gas ( GHG ) life - cycle basis .
They have the same safety and density as fossil fuels , Altman says , and would not alter planes ’ performance , range , or capacity to carry passengers .

Printer Friendly Wendy McElroy - Friday 23 January 2009 - 11:08:30 - Permalink Ken Gregg 's commentary upon viewing the assembly line of coffins returning home from Iraq has as much validity today as when he penned it two years ago .
Obama 's Presidency may bring the continuing insanity and tragedy of America 's occupation of Iraq to an end ... but I doubt it .
Obama appears to be Bush - lite re : foreign policy .
If so , you can merely substitute the name " Obama " whenever Ken mentions " Bush " because similar coffins will be returning under Obama 's watch .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama is ready to issue orders on Thursday to close Guantanamo prison and overhaul the treatment of terrorism suspects , in a swift move to restore a U.S. image hurt by charges of torture .

A draft executive order obtained by Reuters on Wednesday sets a one - year deadline to close the controversial U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , where foreign terrorism suspects have been detained for years without trial .
Obama , who was sworn in as president on Tuesday , is expected to issue the order on Guantanamo on Thursday .
He will also ban abusive interrogations and order a review of detention policies for captured militants , said congressional aides and a White House official .
White House counsel Greg Craig and other officials briefed congressional representatives and staff on the plans on Wednesday , the aides said .
Obama pledged during his election campaign to close Guantanamo , which became a blot on the human rights record of the United States and a symbol of detainee abuse and detention without charge under the Bush administration .
“ It ’s exactly the kind of bold action that is necessary , ” said Elisa Massimino , executive director of the Human Rights First advocacy group .
“ Both the speed and the content will send a clear message to our own people and the rest of the world that what he said ... he meant . ”
The draft order would require an immediate review of how to deal with the remaining Guantanamo prisoners .
The military commissions set up to try detainees would also be halted pending a study .
A military judge on Wednesday suspended the cases of five suspected plotters of the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States and of a young Canadian man at Guantanamo , a day after Obama sought a 120 - day suspension of pending cases .
ABIDING BY THE MANUAL
Another presidential order would ban CIA use of “ enhanced ” interrogation methods by making all U.S. agencies abide by the Army Field Manual , which bans techniques such as waterboarding , a form of simulated drowning the CIA says was used on three terrorism suspects .
Outgoing CIA chief Michael Hayden has defended the harsh techniques and called the Army manual too restrictive but says the agency would abide by limitations .
The CIA declined comment on the reports .
Obama is also expected to order a review of all U.S. detention policies .
The Guantanamo draft specifies the camp “ shall be closed as soon as practicable , and no later than one year from the date of this order . ”
Prisoners still in detention would be returned to their home country , released or transferred to a third country or other U.S. facility .
Attorneys representing Guantanamo detainees said the time frame was too long .
“ It only took days to put these men in Guantanamo , it should n’t take a year to get them out , ” said Vincent Warren of the Centre for Constitutional Rights , which has organized representation for the prisoners .
But an influential Republican congressman said dangerous suspects could be relocated to the United States and possibly be freed there in court challenges .
“ Closing Guantanamo Bay poses significant national security concerns to the American people , ” said Lamar Smith of Texas , the top Republican on the House of Representatives judiciary committee .
Former President George W. Bush has said many countries that criticized the United States were unwilling to take any detainees .
But the draft order says diplomatic efforts by the Obama administration could lead to new locations for a “ substantial number ” of current detainees .
The United States still holds about 250 men at the U.S. naval base in Cuba and wants to try about 80 of them on terrorism charges .
Two al Qaeda suspects have been convicted by the military commissions at Guantanamo and one pleaded guilty .
Two of the men have already returned to their home countries .
Washington has cleared 50 detainees for release but cannot return them to home countries because of the risk they would be tortured or persecuted there .
Around 500 others have been freed or transferred to other governments since 2002 .
For centuries , human beings have been entranced by the captivating glimmer of the diamond .
What accounts for the stunning beauty of this most precious gem ?
As mathematician Toshikazu Sunada explains in an article appearing in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society , some secrets of the diamond 's beauty can be uncovered by a mathematical analysis of its microscopic crystal structure .
It turns out that this structure has some very special , and especially symmetric , properties .
In fact , as Sunada discovered , out of an infinite universe of mathematical crystals , only one other shares these properties with the diamond , a crystal that he calls the " K 4 crystal " .
It is not known whether the K 4 crystal exists in nature or could be synthesized .
One can create an idealized mathematical model of a crystal by focusing on its main features , namely , the atoms and the bonds between them .
The atoms are represented by points , which we will call " vertices " , and the bonds are represented as lines , which we will call " edges " .
This kind of network of vertices and edges is called a " graph " .
A crystal is built up by starting with a building - block graph and joining together copies of itself in a periodic fashion .
Thus there are two patterns operating in a crystal :
The pattern of edges connecting vertices in the building - block graphs ( that is , the pattern of bonding relations between the atoms ) , and the periodic pattern joining the copies of the graphs .
One can create infinitely many mathematical crystals this way , by varying the graphs and by varying the way they are joined periodically .
The diamond crystal has two key properties that distinguish it from other crystals .
The first , called " maximal symmetry " , concerns the symmetry of the arrangement of the building - block graphs .
Some arrangements have more symmetry than others , and if one starts with any given arrangement , one can deform it , while maintaining periodicity and the bonding relations between the atoms , to make it more symmetrical .
For the diamond crystal , it turns out that no deformation of the periodic arrangement can make it any more symmetrical than it is .
As Sunada puts it , the diamond crystal has maximal symmetry .
Any crystal can be deformed into a crystal with maximal symmetry , so that property alone does not distinguish the diamond crystal .
But the diamond crystal has a second special property , called " the strong isotropic property " .
This property resembles the rotational symmetry that characterizes the circle and the sphere :
No matter how you rotate a circle or a sphere , it always looks the same .
The diamond crystal has a similar property , in that the crystal looks the same when viewed from the direction of any edge .
Rotate the diamond crystal from the direction of one edge to the direction of a different edge , and it will look the same .
It turns out that , out of all the crystals that are possible to construct mathematically , just one shares with the diamond these two properties .
Sunada calls this the K 4 crystal , because it is made out of a graph called K 4 , which consists of 4 points , in which any two vertices are connected by an edge .
" The K 4 crystal looks no less beautiful than the diamond crystal , " Sunada writes .
" Its artistic structure has intrigued me for some time . "
He notes that , although the K 4 crystal presently exists only as a mathematical object , it is tempting to wonder whether it might occur in nature or could be synthesized .
This is not so far - fetched as it may sound :
The Fullerene , which has the structure of a soccer ball ( technically called a truncated icosahedron ) , was identified as a mathematical object before it was found , in 1990 , to occur in nature as the C 60 molecule .
Sunada 's article , " Crystals That Nature Might Miss Creating " , is appearing in the February 2008 issue of the AMS Notices and will be posted online January 3 .

MONROVIA ( Reuters ) - Swarms of army worms have attacked crops in a food - producing district of Liberia , forcing the West African state to declare a state of emergency in the area at the weekend , the Ministry of Agriculture said on Monday .
Army worms , which can grow to around 5 centimeters ( two inches ) in length , are moth caterpillars and when present in large numbers can destroy swathes of vegetation and crops .
“ We are calling for international assistance to combat these insects .
They have affected over 19 villages in Bong county , ” Agriculture Minister Christopher Toe told Reuters .
In earlier comments quoted by local media , Toe said the army worms were consuming crops and polluting running water sources with their droppings in Bong county ’s Zota district , which borders on neighboring Guinea .
The minister met local and foreign experts on Monday to try to coordinate a response .
Local residents reported the caterpillars were also infesting buildings and homes in their search for food .

WASHINGTON  The State Department ’s inspector general has warned in a new report that Blackwater Worldwide , the security contractor , may not be licensed by the Iraqi government to continue to protect American diplomats in Baghdad next year , forcing the Obama administration to make new security arrangements .
The report says that if State Department contractors lose their immunity from criminal prosecution under Iraqi law , as many officials expect , employees of Blackwater and other contractors may choose to leave Iraq or demand higher pay .
Five Blackwater guards were indicted this month in a 2007 shooting in Baghdad that killed at least 17 Iraqis .
Unlike some American contractors in Iraq , Blackwater does not have a license , but it has applied for one .
Iraqi authorities have allowed it to operate while officials consider the application .
The inspector general ’s findings were first reported Wednesday by The Associated Press , and The New York Times obtained a copy of the report .
The animals may have eaten contaminated feed All pork products made in the Irish Republic since September have been recalled over fears they are contaminated with a toxic substance .
The action was taken after dioxins were found in slaughtered pigs thought to have eaten contaminated feed .
Tests showed some pork products contained up to 200 times more dioxins than the recognised safety limit .
The UK's Food Standards Agency said it did not believe at this stage that UK consumers faced any " significant risk " .
Food safety expert Professor Hugh Pennington told the BBC the health risk was " very , very low " .
He said : " You have to have a lot of these compounds .
You have to eat a lot of them , enormous amounts to have any visible effect . "
But consumers and retailers in the Irish Republic have been warned to destroy all Irish pork and bacon products bought since 1 September as a precaution .

Q&A : The recall of Irish pork Bacon , ham , sausages , white pudding and pizzas with ham toppings are also included in the withdrawal of stocks .
A spokesman for discount supermarket Lidl said half of its stores had removed " own - brand " black pudding and pork belly products sourced from the Irish Republic from their shelves .
He added that half of Lidl 's stores had stocked these products and refunds are being offered to people who had bought the products .
Waitrose said all of its fresh pork was British so it was unaffected .
Other supermarkets , including Tesco , contacted by BBC News said they were continuing to check their supplies but many believed they did not stock pork products imported from the Republic of Ireland .
Banned substance Dioxins are formed during combustion processes , such as waste incineration , and during some industrial processes .
Suspicions over contamination were first raised on Monday as a result of the routine testing of pigs , which indicated the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) - banned in the Irish Republic since the 1970s - in animal feed .
Restrictions were placed on a number of pig farms and tests on pork samples confirmed the presence of dioxins on Saturday afternoon .
Chronic long - term exposure to dioxins can have serious health effects , including causing cancers , but Irish officials said the recall would ensure consumers only had minimum exposure to it .
The country 's chief medical officer , Dr Tony Holohan , said anyone who had eaten pig meat did not need to seek medical help .

An Irish government spokeswoman said : " Investigations involving the Department of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food ( DAFF ) and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland are continuing to determine the extent of the contamination and to identify the processors and products involved . "
The source of the contamination is believed to be a licensed mill which manufactures animal feed .
The Irish minister for agriculture , Brendan Smith , said the problem was confined to 47 farms .
He said : " This includes 38 beef farms .
This is the total number of farms identified as having received possible contaminated animal feed .
There is only one feed supplier involved . "
The FSAI 's chief executive Alan Reilly said : " The levels in the feed were very high .
The levels in the pork itself were in the region of about 80 - 200 times above the safe limits . "
' Absolute disaster ' Labour Party spokesman on agriculture and food , Sean Sherlock , said the government 's priority had to be consumers , but action had to be taken to " save the Christmas pork and ham market " .
He said : " The announcement amounts to a threat to the overall viability of our food industry as great as , if not greater than , the outbreaks of BSE and of foot and mouth . "
Padraig Walshe , president of the Irish Farmers ' Association , described the recall as " an absolute disaster " for the pig farming sector , but said fewer than 10 % of products on the market had been processed since 1 September .
" It will be possible to have fresh product - and totally safe product - on the shelves within a couple of days , " he said .
Mr Walshe said up to 70 % of Irish pork was consumed within the country itself - " a larger proportion " of the rest goes to the UK .
About 7,000 people are employed in the Republic of Ireland 's pig industry , which is worth more than 250 m euros ( £ 216 m ) a year .
The British Pig Executive said that between April - July this year , the UK imported 230,000 tonnes of pork and bacon , with up to 15,000 of those from the Republic of Ireland .
A spokeswoman for Defra said it was " keeping in close contact with the FSA as they evaluate any potential implications for Britain " .

New research into language evolution suggests most Pacific populations originated in Taiwan around 5,200 years ago .
Scientists at The University of Auckland have used sophisticated computer analyses on vocabulary from 400 Austronesian languages to uncover how the Pacific was settled .
" The Austronesian language family is one of the largest in the world , with 1200 languages spread across the Pacific , " says Professor Russell Gray of the Department of Psychology .
" The settlement of the Pacific is one of the most remarkable prehistoric human population expansions .
By studying the basic vocabulary from these languages , such as words for animals , simple verbs , colours and numbers , we can trace how these languages evolved .
The relationships between these languages give us a detailed history of Pacific settlement . "
" Our results use cutting - edge computational methods derived from evolutionary biology on a large database of language data , " says Dr Alexei Drummond of the Department of Computer Science .
" By combining biological methods and linguistic data we are able to investigate big- picture questions about human origins . "
The results , published in the latest issue of the journal Science , show how the settlement of the Pacific proceeded in a series of expansion pulses and settlement pauses .
The Austronesians arose in Taiwan around 5,200 years ago .
Before entering the Philippines , they paused for around a thousand years , and then spread rapidly across the 7,000 km from the Philippines to Polynesia in less than one thousand years .
After settling Fiji , Samoa and Tonga , the Austronesians paused again for another thousand years , before finally spreading further into Polynesia eventually reaching as far as New Zealand , Hawaii and Easter Island .
" We can link these expansion pulses to the development of new technology , such as better canoes and social techniques to deal with the great distances between islands in Polynesia , " says Research Fellow Simon Greenhill .
" Using these new technologies the Austronesians and Polynesians were able to rapidly spread through the Pacific in one of the greatest human migrations ever .
This suggests that technological advances have played a major role in the spread of people throughout the world . "
The research was funded by the New Zealand Royal Society Marsden fund .

Sun Microsystems has been showing off it knows how to build an eco-friendly , efficient data center in the hope it can scare up a little business helping other companies cope with their own inefficient centers .
The server and operating system company has done this as it moves and consolidates a center that it inherited through its $ 4.1 bn StorageTek acquisition four years ago .
If this is n't eating your own dog food , then is at least living in its own dog house .
And , not coincidentally , it 's trying to get out of the dog house with Wall Street by cutting costs and moving in the direction of profitability .
StorageTek was founded in the suburbs of Denver , Colorado , in a burg called Louisville , and Sun just coincidentally had offices of its own a little bit down the road in Broomfield .
Both companies had about 4,000 employees in the area , according to Mark Monroe , director of sustainable computing at Sun , with the facilities about two - thirds full .
By using teleworking , Sun was able to fill up the Broomfield campus .
( There have , of course , been some layoffs that create room too ) .
StorageTek had its big data center in Louisville , which was used to run its operations as well as for development and testing of its disk and tape products .
Sun could not leave the data center there because it sold the facility to oil giant ConocoPhilips a year ago in order to raise cash - $ 58.5 m in this case .
ConocoPhilips will be using the Louisville campus as an energy research center focusing on for fuel cell , solar , wind and clean diesel power .
In the past eight months , the StorageTek data center , which was weighed in at 496,000 square feet , was consolidated onto three floors of an office building in Broomfield .
This is the largest data center consolidation project Sun has ever done , according to Monroe .
The StorageTek facility had 165,000 square feet of raised floor space , and by ditching old servers that require raised floors , Sun was able to compress this down to 700 square feet .
The raised floor part of the data center is necessary to support some mainframes and big Sparc iron .
Sun squeezes into Broomfield
The new Broomfield data center has been equipped with Sun 's latest Sparc and x64 servers , including T2000 and T5440 ( Niagara ) , X4600 M2 ( Galaxy ) , and M5000 ( Fujitsu ) servers and its 7000 series of unified storage servers .
The density of these boxes has allowed Sun to cram all the computing that the storage division needs into 126,000 square feet of space .
About 11,000 square feet of that is to run applications that are part of Sun 's back office operations ; the rest is for development and engineering work .
Sun says that building as much raised floor space as StorageTek had would have cost it $ 4 m in the Broomfield center , which it characterized as savings .
But if you think about it , Sun did n't really save that money because as Sun so correctly demonstrated , modern servers do n't need raised floors .
The data center has a seven megawatt capacity that can be boosted to 10 megawatts if needed .
If you 're not in the habit of checking the country of origin on fruit and vegetables to minimise food miles , you may not have noticed just how much Israeli produce is in our shops and supermarkets .
At the moment , there are piles of new potatoes ( though it 's hard to see why anyone with a scrap of environmental awareness would buy these when our indigenous main crop spuds are still firm and abundant ) , and that 's just for starters .
If you go out today and buy avocadoes , sweet potatoes , tomatoes , peppers , Medjoul dates , sharon fruit ( persimmons ) , chillies , oranges , pomegranates , grapefruit or fresh herbs , it 's extremely likely that they will be Israeli .
Most of this produce carries country of origin labelling or is branded as Carmel , Bio -Top or Jaffa .
In the herb category , there 's room - intentional or otherwise - for confusion .
Increasingly your dill , tarragon or basil may be labelled as ' West Bank ' .
This is not a Palestinian alternative to the Israeli option ; it comes from Israeli settlements in Palestine 's occupied territories .
Israel 's agricultural exporting company , Carmel Agrexco , is one of the biggest suppliers of fresh produce to the UK .
As the company puts it :
Israel 's sunny climate enables Agrexco to tap the resources of its Carmel growers most of the annum .
By lining up other complementary supply sources – such as fruit , vegetable and root crop growers located in countries in the Mediterranean basin , South America , and Africa – the Carmel label is available year - round
An expert in air - freighting with a base near Heathrow , Agrexco supplies the UK with everything from sweetcorn , rocket and radishes through to melons , strawberries and kumquats , so delivering the ' permanent global summertime ' of horticultural produce that food retailers have educated British consumers to expect .
As a business , it 's impressive , but I do n't intend to buy any of it .
For people aware of the recent horror that unfolded in Gaza and the emerging evidence of the scale of destruction , this cornucopia of fruit and vegetables represents a ready - made target for taking personal action in our daily lives to express disapproval at Israel 's ongoing aggression against the Palestinian people .
We can use the same tactic against Israel that was so effective in showing up South Africa as the apartheid state it once was .
The parallels with South Africa are striking .
Writing in the Guardian , Naomi Klein recently reminded us of the words of Ronnie Kasrils , a prominent South African politician , who said in 2007 that the segregation he saw in the West Bank and Gaza was " infinitely worse than apartheid " .
So what , exactly , is he talking about ?
While we have been munching our way through its avocadoes , Israel has demolished Palestinian homes , evicted their occupants and expropriated their land and water resources .
It has illegally colonised productive Palestinian land with waves of settlers .
A boycott of Israeli fruit and vegetables , as opposed to other sorts of boycott ( academic , sporting ) , is particularly apt because horticulture has been a major plank of Israeli expansion .
Medjoul dates in the Jordan Valley , for example , base their operations on confiscated Palestinian land , in contravention of international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention .
As if that was n't enough , Israel has effectively imprisoned Palestinians with checkpoints , an illegal wall and an oppressive system of travel permits and colour - coded identity cards , so scuppering Palestinian economic development .
As OXFAM told the House of Commons International Development Committee ( pdf ) , costs for Palestinians who want to export products are up to 70 % higher than for Israelis .
Settlers in the West Bank get direct access to markets in and through Israel without the disruptive road blocks and transfers faced by the Palestinians who are obliged to rely on Israeli intermediaries .
The revenue from taxes and customs goes to Israel , which costs the Palestinian economy 3 % of its GDP a year .
Left to develop its agricultural economy , Palestine could be a fertile and productive land .
Olive oil used to be a profitable export crop but according to the Applied Research Institute in Jerusalem , over 500,000 ancient olive trees have been bulldozed and cut down since 2000 ( see zaytoun.org ) to make way for the construction of Israeli settlements , settler - only roads and the Separation Wall .
Yet in recent years , and despite all the odds stacked against them , marginalised Palestinian growers have produced good extra virgin olive oil , recently gaining organic status for some of their production .
Palestinian growers tenaciously produce the Nabali green olive ( pickled in the Palestinian tradition with olive oil , water and salt ) tree - ripened black olive , the Middle Eastern favourite Za'atar ( a herb and seed mix of wild thyme , toasted sesame and sour - tasting sumac berries ) , Medjoul dates from Jericho , and the celebrated large , sweet ' Om Al - Fahem ' almond grown in Jenin .
All this is available through the ethical business , Zaytoun .
It also used to sell couscous from a women 's co-operative in Gaza , but even before the latest bombardment , Israel 's tightening seige of Gaza made any type of export from that area impossible .
With intractable political conflicts , sometimes it's hard to see how individual action can make even the slightest difference .
But fruit and vegetable exports to Europe are crucial to the Israeli economy , representing 80 % of that country 's total exports .
The UK is its largest market , eating up a 60 % share .
Carmel Agrexco itself is 50 % owned by the Israeli state , so a consumer boycott of agricultural produce exerts direct economic pressure where it matters .
By refusing to buy Israeli produce , ethically - minded consumers can be part of the wider Boycott Israeli Goods campaign ( BIG ) and add to the international condemnation of Israel 's tactics in Palestine .
The reasons for a boycott precede the most recent open conflict and are ever - more important .
Even if the current shaky ceasefire holds , Gaza will still be an open prison and Palestine will still be a country whose food economy is actively sabotaged by its powerful neighbour .
Just at the moment , many people do n't have any appetite for Israeli produce .
A boycott gives us something to do about it .
Google 's Chrome browser has been marred by yet another vulnerability , this one allowing attackers to impersonate websites of groups like the Better Business Bureau , PayPal or , well , Google .
Researcher Liu Die
Yu of the TopsecTianRongXin research lab in Beijing says the spoofing vulnerability is the result of faulty code inserted by programmers from the Mountain View , California search behemoth .
" I do n't see Apple Safari vulnerable in the same way , " he writes in an email to The Register .
" They share the same engine ( webkit ) . "
As his proof of concept demonstrates , it is in fact possible to send Chrome users to a page under his control while causing the browser 's address bar to display the domain name bbb.org .
A Google representative says Chrome 's spoofing vulnerability is a " known issue " that will be fixed in an update that will be pushed to end users soon .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Iraq will not grant an operating license to security firm Blackwater Worldwide , an Interior Ministry official said Thursday .
Heavily armed Blackwater guards scan downtown Baghdad , Iraq , from a helicopter in 2003 .
Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf said the ministry denied the request mainly because of a September 2007 shooting incident in which security guards employed by Blackwater fired on a crowd and killed 17 Iraqis , according to the government .
A U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad , who asked not to be named , confirmed the report .
" We have been informed that Blackwater 's ... operating license will not be granted , " the official said .
" We do n't have specifics about dates .
We are working with the government of Iraq and our contractors to address the implications of this decision . "
Blackwater has one of the biggest security contracts in Iraq .
The U.S. State Department , which contracted the company to protect American diplomats and other employees , is also " looking at the implications " of the decision , said Robert Wood , the department 's acting spokesman .
Wood did n't say what specific plans the State Department has to protect its employees , but he told reporters that State will encourage contractors to abide by Iraqi law , as required under the recently approved U.S. - Iraqi security agreement , and will make sure its personnel are protected .
" We 're formulating how to go forward , " he said .
Watch report on Iraq 's refusal to grant license to Blackwater »
Wood refused to say whether two other security companies working in Iraq , Triple Canopy and Dyncorp , would take over security operations , but did say those options were being considered .
Earlier this month , five former Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from their involvement in the September 16 , 2007 , shootings in a Baghdad square .
A sixth former security guard has pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter .
Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after they were attacked by armed insurgents , but an Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation .
The company does not face any charges .
But the Baghdad incident exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life .
The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act ( MEJA ) .
The act was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services " in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas . "
A security agreement approved in December 2008 specifies U.S. civilian contractors will no longer be immune from Iraqi prosecution for crimes committed in Iraq .
Iraq has required the licensing of private security companies since 2004 , but the provision was not strictly enforced .
Last year , the State Department renewed Blackwater 's contract over strong objections from the Iraqi government .
Starting January 1 , the Iraqi government has mandated that all contractors obtain licenses to operate .
CNN 's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report .

Most of the time when I talk to people about this I run into a problem because they just do n't get it .
They look around , and instead of seeing anything to worry about they see things are getting cheaper , government economists and banksters are speaking with optimism and confidence .
Unless they 're already in serious financial hardship , things are looking up in the eyes of many Americans .
A refinance might be in their plans for 2009 since interest rates are falling .
Gas seems almost free after the high prices of last summer .
People smile as they fill their tanks … but yet they are n't spending as frivolously as they did a year ago … just in case .
I 'd guess that upwards of 95 % ( minus the number already in financial hardship … whatever that is ) of working Americans believe this blip in the economy will pass without causing them personal hardship .
They look at me as if I were Chicken Little .
I 'm used to it .
I 've been perceived by some as Chicken Little since I started buying gold in 2002 .
I intend to be prepared for the real - world consequences of our current trends to a degree sufficient to allow me to be able to capitalize on the future opportunities resulting from this business cycle .
The opinions others may have about the situation and about my preparations are irrelevant .
I always figure that personally derisive opinions speak volumes about those who hold them and say nothing about the person such opinions target .
Lately though , some of my hecklers have been asking questions about things I 've said over the past few years .
It is funny how family and friends will completely ignore you until you start getting things right that the “ experts ” obviously have gotten wrong .
When their portfolios are down 45 - 65 % while mine went up 24 % last year , it gets their attention .
When my colleagues are nearly all in a funk over their 401K losing 30 % or more while I talk about having closed out my 401K 2 years ago to safeguard my gains , it gets their attention .
While they wonder how they will live if they lose their job I wonder if they wish they could get back $ 15 - $ 30 K in mortgage interest over the past year …or the $ 60 K over the past two years …or if they wish they could sell one of the homes they scooped up when things were hot ?
I wonder if the value they get from driving vehicles with monthly payments larger than my mortgage payment is really that much more than I get from my old , paid for , vehicles ?
I suppose it comes down to priorities .
I make having choices my priority so I steadfastly avoid boxing myself in financially or intellectually .
I try to make sure both debt and labels find it impossible to stick to me .
Regarding the stock market , this dead cat too will bounce ; a lot of people will rejoice in their belief that the good times are returning … those who are still employed that is .
People who are looking for work today will not rejoice if the market bounces 20 - 30 % because no new jobs will be created by that bounce .
Profits taken during a dead cat bounce are not typically invested in increased production .
Rather , they are usually applied to cover risky positions in other areas or to facilitate belt - tightening efforts .
Of course , some fools will return to the market and , if the bounce lasts long enough , some fools will resume risky investing practices .
The market serves one major function in both good times and bad : Mr. Market exists to separate fools from their money .
Certainly , there is the chance in the short - term that the market could unite some fools with money from other fools .
No fool has pockets deep enough to exhaust Mr. Market 's patience .
Very patient the market is , especially relative to the lack of patience exhibited by most fools with money to lose .
In in the long - term , the market will grind all fools into oblivion .
That is the market bottom .
We are not even close to that today as you can tell by looking around .
Far too many fools still have money to lose .
You will not know anyone like that when we 've reached the bottom .
I 'm in the business of selling very high ticket software packages to fortune 1000 companies .
In the past 5 months I have n't talked to a single buyer who is certain they have budget for 2009 .
The end of this downward spiral is no where to be seen .
The accelerating downward forces will crush the dead cat rally , wipe out jobs and savings , and increase our vulnerability to violence initiated both from inside and outside our country .
I may not have a job tomorrow , or next month , or next year .
No problem .
I 'm prepared because I have no prideful restrictions on how I earn my income and no unsustainable accumulation of debt or depreciating assets .
Today I sell software but in the past I have shoveled manure for pay .
I can still work a shovel with the best of them .
There was a headline over the holiday that said something like most people feel 2008 was the worst year they can remember .
I believe history will show 2008 as one of the best years for a long time to come .
Maybe not in the stock markets , those losses are what they are and the worst may be behind us .
However , for the general population , living standards will only get worse for the foreseeable future .
( I also believe that 2009 will see the market below 6000 but in a government - manipulated market such as ours one cannot depend on market forces to be allowed to function – eliminating the dead wood from our economy – so I would n't bet on any predictions here . )
I do n't expect to see a bottom in the decline in living standard until after 1 in 4 to 2 in 5 people are unemployed , until dollars are worthless and defunct and until electronic commerce has ceased to be available for individuals completely .
I expect to see food riots in our cities , police brutality promoted as patriotism and the US military deployed on domestic ground to carry out deadly operations against US citizens .
Only then will things begin to be bad enough for people to think of revolution and change …initiated by them , personally , not by “ someone else ” .
The natural business cycle cannot recover once we are saddled with Obama 's Giant New Deal Socialism .
It will take a bloody revolt to affect any notable change once that rot is in place .
I have planned not to be part of the decline nor part of the revolution .
My plan is to watch and write ; living my life as I choose due to provisions I 've been putting in place for years .
I 'll remain too comfortable to fight for the next 10 - 15 years while the rest of my fellow Americans come to the awful realization that they need to actually do something to change their condition .
By the time the masses are ready to stand up and restore liberty , I 'll be too old to fight .
I plan to just watch and write …with the hope that someday someone will again be able to understand what I have seen and , more importantly , why I bothered to write about it after every warning went unheeded .
So , if what is coming actually resembles what I 've described , how much of what you get will you deserve ?
How much of what your spouse and children get will they deserve ?
The answers to those questions are the stakes in any gamble that things are going to be just fine .
Now that the stakes are clear , the choices are obvious : sleep well or get busy .
I figure only the super rich and the hopelessly ignorant will sleep easy with those stakes on the table .
Guess what , if the rest of us get busy , turing more of our resources from consumption to production , it may help stave off some of the worst .!
Cool huh ?
I just love the objectivist optimism underlying acting in one 's own best interests .

brackenb says : Tansi came from a friend whose cat had a litter of four .
She was the most adorable kitten -- you can see why she chose me !!!
Her name is actually that of a flower spelt the Welsh way .
It does n't really mean anything , I just liked the name .
Tansi has grown into the most beautiful cat .
She likes attention on her terms only and tolerates her companion Dee-dee .
She is not a lap cat , preferring to spend her time either outside or curled up in some secret corner of the house .
Her character is as colourful as her coat and I love her dearly .

In the shadows of Mount Redoubt , Alaskans are calmly waiting for the volcano to erupt -- an event that could occur at any time .
Alaska 's Mount Redoubt volcano spews ash and steam during an eruption in 1989 .
" The level of seismic activity " has " increased markedly " in recent days at the 10,197 - foot peak located about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage , the state 's most populous city , according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory .
" We do n't have a crystal ball , " said Peter Cervelli , a research geophysicist with the observatory , which is aggressively monitoring the volcano .
But " we expect based on the past behavior of this volcano that this activity is going to culminate in an eruption . "
The activity has consisted " of a combination of discrete , relatively small earthquakes and periods of more continuous volcanic tremor , " Cervelli said .
Scientists raised the alert status Sunday to a " watch " level , the second - highest , based on seismic activity detected January 23 .

The " watch " status means the " volcano is exhibiting heightened or escalating unrest with increased potential of eruption , time frame uncertain , or eruption is under way but poses limited hazards , " according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
Maureen Burke , 29 , a coffee shop manager in Anchorage , said she remembers the last eruption and is n't too worried this time .

She said living in Alaska and being close to nature , residents just laugh such events off , dealing with them as they come .
Falling ash is a potential problem .
The best way to protect yourself from the harmful showers of ash is to wear a mask , Missy Moore , 33 , said .

As an administrator and supervisor of Starbright Early Learning Center in Anchorage , Moore said , " it 's really not anything to worry about just yet . "

If Mount Redoubt covers nearby cities with ash , Moore said the school will adhere to the public school district 's guidelines .
" If the [ public ] school district closes schools , our school closes too .
The city of Anchorage advises citizens to stay indoors , " Moore said .
" The ash can get into your engines and mess up your car . "
Shana Medcoff , 17 , a barista in Kenai , about 50 miles from the volcano , said residents are encouraged to buy air filters for their cars .

Mount Redoubt last erupted nearly 20 years ago , in December 1989 , and that lasted until April 1990 .
Geologists think there could be an eruption " similar to or smaller than the one that occurred in 1989 - 90 . "

That eruption spread ash in Kenai and Anchorage , where it disrupted air traffic operations .
Cervelli said the ash plumes caused engine failure on a jet .
" It 's not the closest volcano to Anchorage , " Cervelli said , but " it has the potential to disrupt air traffic at Anchorage . "
The 1989 - 90 volcano also spurred volcanic mudflows , or lahars , that flowed east down the Drift River .
The ash fall was seen as far away as Fairbanks and the Yukon Territory border .
The observatory has set up a Web camera near the summit of the volcano and another within Cook Inlet .
It plans to do continuous visual surveillance , measure gas output and analyze satellite and weather - radar data .

Compared to the current job market , IT professionals should recall the collapse of the dot - com bubble with a fondness for the good ol ' days .
That 's according to the latest bi-annual IT salary survey from management consultant Janco Associates , which has painted a dreary picture for tech workers .
The firm called current conditions " a perfect storm " of company closures , layoffs , cost cutting , outsourcing , and retirees returning to work .
That massive surplus of IT talent is matched by what the firm reckons is the lowest hiring demand it has observed in the 15 plus years it 's conducted the salary survey .
The study said that extensive layoffs , cost - cutting and hiring freezes have eliminated higher - priced positions , and in some cases lowered wages .
For " mid- size enterprises " , the mean salary for all IT staff positions has dropped 0.75 per cent to $ 60,279 compared to a year ago .
The mean salary across all mid-sized enterprise IT positions has dropped 2.91 per cent to $ 73,607 .
For " large enterprises " , IT staff position wages have dropped 0.89 per cent to $ 65,956 .
Mean salary across all IT positions have dropped 1.2 per cent to $ 81,128 .
Many companies have also reduced benefits such as health care provided to IT professionals .
While these benefits are still available , workers are now paying a greater portion of costs .
For the second time in less than 10 years , retirements are being put off because of the downturn in the stock market .
Positions with high layoff and outsourcing potential for smaller companies include software engineer , network technician , network services admin , director of IT planning , manager of technical services , and disaster recovery admin .
Positions that still have a high level of demand include database manager , internet systems manager , database specialist , and systems programmer .
" The job market for IT professionals is one of the worst that I have seen since the late 1970s .
There is a surplus of IT talent and companies are in a cost - cutting mode , " Janco Associates chief executive Victor Janulaitis said in a statement .
" The dot - com bubble was a cake walk compared to this job market . "
A summary of the survey is available here .
The firm said its data is collected throughout the year from business throughout the US and Canada with more than 50,000 workers polled . ®
It was always expected to end like this .
If there 's anything much going on with the water currently on Mars , chances are good it 's happening at the poles , so NASA directed its latest lander , the Phoenix , to that region of the planet .
Unfortunately , that inevitably meant that the lander would run short on sunlight to power its solar panels once the long , cold Martian winter set in .
About an hour ago , Phoenix 's Twitter page broke the news : " From Phoenix mission ops : Phoenix is no longer communicating with Earth .
We 'll continue to listen , but it 's likely its mission has ended . "
Power for the lander had been getting short , and it was taking longer to recharge its batteries ; the loss of contact was a sign that the batteries had fully run down .
There was never really a chance that the lander would run long past its expiration date ( unlike the rovers , which operate in sunnier climes ) , but the exact date of its demise had been anyone 's guess .
In its time on the red planet , Phoenix had a good view of the polar weather , but its work focused on the chemistry of the polar regions .
Right off the bat , the lander 's robotic scoop appeared to hit solid ice just below the surface , and scientists were rewarded with time - lapse images of ice subliming into the thin Martian atmosphere from one of the trenches it dug .
Images : NASA / JPL - Caltech / University of Arizona / Texas A&M University
We 'll have a better sense of what precisely Phoenix has found when the scientific papers start coming out , but the lander had already made one key discovery : the public 's really interested in the prospect of life on Mars .
Back in August , rumors about a major discovery with implications for life on Mars became so intense that NASA had to hold a press conference to dispel them .
It turns out they 'd discovered lots of a compound that contains chlorine but , as of last check , they were still unsure what it was .
Phoenix is one of those rare cases where NASA got exactly what it had planned on : spotless operation in precisely the place they intended to land it .
Unfortunately that location ensured that , no matter how well - engineered the hardware was , the winter would bring its operation to an end .

PARIS , France ( CNN ) --
Four armed robbers -- two of them men disguised as women -- walked into a luxury jewelry store in Paris and swiped an estimated € 80 million ( U.S. $ 101 million ) in jewels , the Paris prosecutor 's office said .
Robbers dressed in drag stole more than $ 100 M worth of jewelry from a Harry Winston store in Paris .
The incident , which lasted about 15 minutes , took place Thursday around 5:30 p.m. at the Harry Winston store near the famed Avenue des Champs - Elysees , around the corner from a police station .
The case has been turned over to the unit in charge of handling organized crime cases , said Isabelle Montagne , assistant to Paris prosecutor Jean Claude Marin .
No shots were fired and no one was wounded , she said .

After they entered the store , the four thieves pulled out their weapons , forced the customers and employees -- about 15 people in all -- into a corner , and grabbed jewels out of display cases and safes , the prosecutor 's office said .
The robbers seemed to know the locations of secret hiding places for jewels and called some employees by their first names , it said .
The group then fled the store , which is located on a wide street near subways and other public transportation .
French state radio reported that it was not immediately clear how the robbers left the area .

Investigators believe it was the work of a highly professional group , and that the culprits were French or from elsewhere in Europe , state radio reported .
In a written statement , the Harry Winston company said , " We are cooperating with the authorities in their investigation .
Our first concern is the well - being of our employees . "
The same shop was robbed of millions of euros worth of jewelry just 14 months ago , in October 2007 .

“ My brother will love these .
It ’s the first time he has had a home in four years .
Thank you so much . ”
He smiled , gave me a big , musky , hug , and drove away .
I was n’t sure if I had just done a good deed , or been hustled by a Craig ’s List scam artist .
This story actually begins months before – so let ’s go back to the beginning .
This is a true story , with names changed by request .
My New Beginning
We were poor graduate students sharing a tiny one bedroom apartment in what you could kindly call a “ less desirable ” neighborhood .
That summer , my roommate and I parted ways as we both moved on to new places to live .
All I owned was my mattress , guitar , computer and some clothes .
“ Here , ” he said “ take these .
You ’ll like them – my new roommates already have a full kitchen . ”
He handed me a pair of rusty frying pans , some tupperware , random mismatched utensils and spatulas .
It was n’t much , but then I was n’t much of a cook .
And it was better than nothing .
Presents From Mom
The next month , I visited my parents and told my mom how I rarely cooked , and about the mismatched items in my kitchen .
My mom was not amused and , being about as “ mom ” as they come , decided to go through her spare ( and not so spare ) cookware to fill out my kitchen .
She picked out some Cutco knives , Circulon pans , a large pot for boiling , a Vitamix Blender ( which lasted me about 12 years before it died ! ) and various other high quality kitchen items that were far too nice for my little apartment .
I protested that my old kitchen stuff was fine .
I never was very successful at winning arguments with my mother …
So it was with a heavy heart , and heavy duffle bag , that I headed home with a literal “ mother lode ” ( hah ! ) of kitchen goodies .
Time To Clean
Months later , and short on storage space , it was time to throw things out .
I dug around in the kitchen and found my old rusty pans which I never used anymore ( Anymore ?
I hardly used them at all ! ) .
I felt bad throwing them in the trash , so I decided to put them on Craig ’s list for free to see if anyone wanted them .
I could n’t imagine anyone would , but why not ?
If nobody picked them up in a couple days , I ’d just throw them out – and at least my conscience would be clear that I had tried .
The ad read “ FREE – Rusty Pans .
Use at Your Own Risk . ”
Perhaps I could have used a more enticing headline .
Enter Carlos
Within hours of me posting , I had an email from someone asking if the pans were still available , and if he could pick them up that afternoon .
Carlos drove up in a beat up white truck filled with random junk – chairs , a plastic table , empty flowerpots .
He saw me waiting outside , with two rusty pans in my hands , turned off the engine and stepped out .
He looked a little dirty , smiled and appeared happy to see me .
I wondered how safe I was here with this stranger .
“ Here ’s the pans ! ” I said , and practically shoved them in his face .
He took them carefully from me and gently looked them over .
You would have thought my rusty pans were works of art .
“ They ’re perfect ! ”
I asked what he was going to do with them .
Enter Juan
Carlos explained to me that his brother , Juan had been living on the street , and had been disowned by his siblings , parents , friends – everyone but Carlos , who never gave up believing in him .
Carlos drove an hour each day after work to Venice where Juan was staying , and every day he ’d walk around , find Juan , spend time with him , and take him to get some food – often his only meal that day .
On days that he could n’t find Juan , Carlos would go home worried that something had happened .
His words struck me as sincere , and I was moved by his story .
Carlos told me he had been driving around all day collecting items for Juan ’s tiny studio apartment ( which of course he was renting with money Carlos was loaning him ) .
He excitedly showed me the flower pots , chairs and ratty old plastic table .
I was n’t sure how successful Juan would be , but I decided it was n’t my place to judge .
I was very touched by Carlos ’ dedication , and wanted him to succeed .
“ Just a second , ” I heard myself saying “ I think I may have more upstairs . ”
I walked up the steps and was n’t sure what I was looking for .
I knew I did n’t have any other rusty pans .
As I reached my apartment , I decided if I really wanted to make a difference , perhaps I should try giving him something that would last .
I picked out a couple of Cutco knives , and a fancy spatula that I had never used .
I wrapped the knives in paper towels and headed back outside .
I went back to Carlos and handed them to him .
“ Be careful , I do n’t have a sheath for the knives , they are very sharp . ”
He beamed as he looked them over .
“ My brother will love these .
It ’s the first time he has had a home in four years .
Thank you so much . ”
He smiled , gave me a big , musky , hug , and drove away .
The End ? Not Really …
Over the years , I told this story countless times to family , and friends .
We enjoyed speculating how it turned out and discussing whether I had actually helped someone in need – or was taken in by a con artist .
Did Juan manage to keep his apartment ?
Did he end up back on the streets ?
Did Carlos just hustle me out of my expensive cookware ?
We thought we would never find out what really happened ( read on and you ’ll find out ) , but it was always fun to debate – and it was a great story about how no matter how useless you may think your junk is , someone on Craig ’s List will take it .
A Strange Phone Call
Years later , I received a strange phone call from a blocked number .
Sometimes it is my family , and sometimes blocked numbers are telemarketers .
I answered cautiously .
Them : “ Hello ? ”
Sid : “ Hello ? ”
Them : “ Is this Sid Savara ? ”
It was n’t my family .
“ Telemarketer ” I thought , irritated .
Me : “ Who wants to know ?
Who is this ?
I am very busy right now ”
There was a moment of silence and then .
Them : “ I am sorry , I did n’t realize you were busy .
Is your email address still _____ ? ”
Me : “ Yes , who is this ?
By law you have to tell me if I ask you . ”
( I do n’t know if this is true , but it sure sounds good ! )
Them : “ Sorry to disturb you , I will email you . ” [ Click ]
I waited to see if they would call again .
Nobody called , and nobody emailed .
I carried on life as usual , and went to sleep , having forgotten the phone call .
How The Story Finally Ends
The next morning when I woke up , I received an email titled “ He Is Getting Married ! ”
I was confused .
I did n’t recognize the name – and with a bogus headline like that , how had it gotten past my spam filters ?
I opened it up – and learned how this story , which started over five years ago , finally ended .
Yes – Juan did manage to finally hold down a job !
And he managed to keep that same little studio apartment !
Now , finally , he was getting married – to a woman named Eva .
But the best part of the story was what Carlos explained later in the same email …
Eva ’s Brother Ivan Has Suspicions
His fiancee , Eva , had asked Juan many times to tell her friends and family his story – because she was so proud of his past and that he had managed to make something of himself .
How he had survived living on the street , and how his brother had driven all over town to pick up free items from Craig ’s List to furnish the tiny apartment when he finally started to pull his life together .
The ugly flower pots , the ratty table , the old rusty frying pans .
One day Eva , Carlos and Juan were sitting in his apartment and talking with Ivan , Eva ’s brother – who not only disliked Juan , but believed him and Carlos had made the whole thing up because Eva had a soft spot for such stories of overcoming odds .
Ivan did n’t believe Juan , and had never thought he was good enough for his sister .
Ivan felt he was a liar trying to take advantage of her generosity and naïveté , and did n’t want them to be married .
During this particular evening , Ivan ’s snide remarks escalated to shouting and he let loose with all his accusations .
He called Carlos and Juan scoundrels , that there was no way such a far fetched story could be true , and told them he would do everything in his power to convince Eva to leave Juan .
Juan was angry and practically in tears .
He kept repeating “ What else can I tell you ?
This is my life , this is who I am . ”
Ivan was not having it .
Ivan wanted proof .
Unfortunately , by then so many years had passed that over time Juan ( with help from his family ) had replaced the furniture and random household items that strangers had given him .
The studio no longer was just thrown together hand me downs – it was a small , comfortable home .
Ivan started pointing things out in the apartment – “ Did your brother pick up this couch ?
How about this table ?
The chairs we are sitting on ?
No ?
How can I believe your story ? ”
Ivan went inside the small kitchen and began again – “ Look how new this toaster is .
Look at this nice microwave . ”
The yelling between Ivan and Juan continued , as both Carlos and Eva tried to plead with them to stop .
Neither would back down .
Ivan threw open the cabinets , he pulled out random food items , water bottles , – and suddenly ….
he stopped .
He stepped back , and looked at Juan , and back at Eva .
Juan had kept his home relatively clean , but in all those years had n’t cleaned out the cupboards .
Perhaps he had not done much cooking either in the studio ’s little kitchenette area .
Ivan reached in the back of the cupboard , moved aside some containers , and pulled out two old , rusty frying pans .
My old , rusty frying pans .
Frying pans that helped change a man ’s life , and now cemented an engagement .
And that was why Carlos had called me .
The End. Really .
The moral of the story ?
“ Love and kindness are never wasted .
They always make a difference . ”
– Helen James
And I would add …sometimes they make a bigger difference than we can imagine .
If you do want to take away some actionable advice from this , I would say the moral of the story is this :
Give away something on Craig ’s List ( or a Salvation Army , or Goodwill , or your local classified equivalent ) that is just taking up space and not doing you any good – who knows what kind of difference it might make in someone ’s life .
Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas .
Take care of yourself , and take care of each other .

WASHINGTON , Jan. 9 ( UPI ) --
Fans of outgoing Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean say it 's no accident he was n't at the podium when his successor was named .
It was a lack of respect for Dean by President - elect Barack Obama 's team , they told Politico .

Obama named Virginia Gov.
Tim Kaine as the new DNC chairman Thursday and recognized the work Dean has done during the last two election cycles to boost Democratic wins on a national and state level .
However , since the Nov. 4 election , Dean has been fairly quiet and apparently is n't being considered for a post within Obama 's administration , the Washington publication said .
When Obama named Keane , Dean was in American Samoa doing DNC work ,
" If he had been asked to go to that event , he would have been there , " Jim Dean , the chairman 's brother , told Politico .
" The snub ( Thursday ) was no accident , " one Dean ally said .
" I guarantee you he would have rescheduled his trip if asked to attend . "
Asked about Dean 's absence , Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt noted that the chairman was out of town and noted that Obama had praised Dean for his accomplishments .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
A man distraught because he could not find work shot and killed his mother - in - law , his wife and three sons and then killed himself inside a home in an upscale San Fernando Valley neighborhood , police said .
Police say Karthik Rajaram left suicide notes taking responsibility for the murders of his family .
Authorities said the man had an MBA in finance but appeared to have been unemployed for several months and had worked for major accounting firms , such as Price Waterhouse .
The two - story rented home is in a gated community in Porter Ranch , about 20 miles northwest of Los Angeles .
The shootings were discovered after 8:20 a.m.
Monday , after a neighbor called police to report that the wife had failed to pick her up to take her to her job at a pharmacy , Deputy Chief of Police Michel Moore said .
Ed Winter , assistant chief from the Los Angeles County Coroner 's Office , identified the suspect as Karthik Rajaram , 45 .
Winter said the victims included Rajaram 's mother - in - law , Indra Ramasesham , 69 , and his 19 - year - old son Krishna Rajaram , a Fulbright Scholar and honor student at UCLA .

Also dead were Rajaram 's wife , 39 , Subasari Rajaram , and their two other sons , 12 and 7 .
Some of the victims had been shot more than once , and their identities were not immediately confirmed , he said .

" Due to the nature of their injuries , it 's been a little difficult , " Winter said , adding that there were no signs of a struggle .
Police first found the mother - in - law shot in her bed in a downstairs bedroom , Moore said .
Upstairs , the couple 's eldest son was shot in the master bedroom ; the wife in another bedroom with a gunshot wound to the head ; the two younger sons in the bedroom they shared , both shot in the head .
The 12 - year - old was on the floor and the 7 - year - old in bed , Moore said .
Watch more on what police had to say about tragedy »
The suspect was also in that bedroom , a gun still in his hand .
The killings are thought to have occurred after 6 p.m. Saturday , when the man was last reported seen , Moore said .
Inside the house , police also found three letters , one to law enforcement acknowledging responsibility for the killings , a second to friends and relatives and a third that appears to be the suspect 's will , Moore said .
" He attests to some financial difficulties , and he takes responsibility for the taking of the lives of his family members and himself as a result of those financial difficulties , " Moore said .
Neighbors , family and friends told police that the suspect , who had not worked for several months , had said in recent days he was having had extreme financial difficulties , Moore said .
One of the letters , intended for friends and marked " personal and confidential , " detailed his financial transactions that resulted in " an unfortunate , downward spiral , " Moore said .
" His narrative is one of talking about this tragedy befalling him and his contemplation of an available exit or solution , " Moore said .
" One is taking his own life and the other is taking the lives of his family and himself .
...
He talked himself into the second strategy , believing that was , in effect , the honorable thing to do . "
Moore said the several - page narrative appeared to have been written over a period of time .
" This was something that was not a spur - of - the - moment type of event , " he said .
Moore said it was clear to police that the family members were close and " had an affection for each other . "
He said the parents had given up their master bedroom to their eldest -- who was spending the weekend home from college -- " out of respect . "
" This is a perfect American family behind me that has absolutely been destroyed , apparently because of a man who just got stuck in a rabbit hole , if you will , of absolute despair , somehow working his way into believing this to be an acceptable exit . "
No neighbors reported having heard gunshots , and there was no sign of forced entry at the house , Moore said .
Rajaram was involved in a financial holding company as part owner " at least , " Moore said .
There is no evidence he had had any history of mental difficulties , nor was there an indication he had sought counseling , Moore said .
Neighbor Trish Harrison , who lives three houses from the crime scene , said the family had lived in the community for about a year , but kept to themselves and had little interaction with neighbors .
The parents were from India , she said .
The Los Angeles Unified School District was making arrangements for crisis counselors to visit the schools attended by the two younger sons .

All About Los Angeles
It is impossible to know how many women in New York or nationwide try to end their pregnancies themselves , but in the vibrant , socially conservative Dominican neighborhoods of Upper Manhattan , the various methods are passed like ancient cultural secrets .
In a study of 610 women at three New York clinics in largely Dominican neighborhoods conducted eight years ago , 5 percent said they had taken misoprostol themselves , and 37 percent said they knew it was an abortion - inducing drug .
Doctors and community leaders say they have not seen any signs of the phenomenon disappearing , which they find worrisome because of concerns about the drug ’s effectiveness and potential side effects .
Sold under the brand name Cytotec , misoprostol is approved to induce abortion when taken with mifepristone , or RU - 486 ; doctors also sometimes use it to induce labor , though it is not approved for that use .
A spokesman for Pfizer , which manufacturers Cytotec , declined to comment beyond saying that the company does not support the off - label use of its products and noting that the label includes “ F.D.A. ’s strongest warning against use in women who are pregnant . ”
That warning , in capital letters , also notes that the drug “ can cause abortion . ”
But it does not always do so , not least because notions of how best to use it vary from inserting several pills into the vagina to letting them dissolve under the tongue .
The side effects can be serious , and include rupture of the uterus , severe bleeding and shock .
“ We do worry because we do n’t know where women are getting the instructions from , ” said Jessica Gonzalez - Rojas of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health , which was also a partner on the Ibis study .
“ We imagine that there is misinformation on how to take it , which is why it could be hit or miss . ”
In 2007 in Massachusetts , an 18 - year - old Dominican immigrant named Amber Abreu took misoprostol in her 25th week of pregnancy and gave birth to a 1 - pound baby girl who died four days later ; a judge sentenced her in June to probation and ordered her into therapy .
In South Carolina in February , a Mexican migrant farm worker , Gabriela Flores , pleaded guilty to illegally performing an abortion and was sentenced to 90 days in jail for taking misoprostol while four months pregnant in 2004 .
A Virginia man , Daniel Riase , is serving a five - year prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2007 to slipping the pills into his pregnant girlfriend ’s glass of milk .
Researchers studying the phenomenon cite several factors that lead Dominican and other immigrant women to experiment with abortifacients : mistrust of the health - care system , fear of surgery , worry about deportation , concern about clinic protesters , cost and shame .
“ It turns an abortion into a natural process and makes it look like a miscarriage , ” said Dr. Mark Rosing , an obstetrician at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx who led the 2000 study , which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Women ’s Association .
“ For people who do n’t have access to abortion for social reasons , financial reasons or immigration reasons , it does n’t seem like this horrible thing . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Members of the Republican National Committee elected their first African - American party chief Friday , choosing former Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele to chair the organization after six tumultuous rounds of voting .
Michael Steele was chosen Friday as the first African - American leader of the Republican Party .
The often contentious race for the chairmanship came down to a choice on the final ballot between Steele and Katon Dawson , the South Carolina GOP chairman who secured strong support from party insiders after former RNC leader Mike Duncan dropped out of the race earlier in the day .
Steele emerged as the winner on the sixth ballot , winning 91 votes to Dawson 's 77 .
" We 're going to say to friend and foe alike , we want you to be a part of us , " Steele told party members in his victory speech .
" And to those of you who will obstruct , get ready to get knocked over . "

For the duration of his campaign , Steele fought suspicions that he was too moderate to lead the party because of his blue state roots and his former membership in the Republican Leadership Council , a group that sought to curb the influence of social conservatives in the party .
" I 'm proud to say I 'm a conservative , have been , always will be , " Steele told CNN this month .
" So this notion that I 'm a moderate is slightly overblown and , quite frankly , a lie . "
Steele was similarly hampered by the perception that he was too much of an outsider to run the 168 - member committee , but he was able to demonstrate momentum in the final days of the campaign by rolling out a cluster of endorsements .
He also boasted the help of some of the country 's top political consultants :
At a closed - door question - and - answer session with members late Thursday , Steele told the crowd he had spent more than $ 200,000 on the race , more than any other contender .

The new chairman brings a national profile to the committee , having shot to fame in the political world during an underdog Senate bid in 2006 distinguished by a series of clever TV commercials .
He has since become a fixture on cable talk shows , experience that boosted his reputation as the most able communicator in the field of candidates .
During the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minnesota , last summer , Steele made a splash by coining the phrase " Drill , baby , drill , " which quickly morphed into a rallying cry for the GOP base at campaign rallies around the country .
After Friday 's final vote , Steele assembled a news conference and said the GOP needs to fix its " image problem " by focusing on " issues that touch the fabric of people 's lives . "
" We have been misdefined as a party that does n't care , a party that 's insensitive , a party that is unconcerned about minorities , a party that is unconcerned about the lives and the expectations and dreams of average Americans , " Steele said .
" Nothing could be further from the truth . "
Steele promised that the party will be run as a bottom - up organization and that the RNC will be " moved into the grass - roots . "
But he offered few specifics on his plans to re-structure the party , saying only that he hopes to get fresh ideas from state parties .
" My expectation is that they 're going to come to me with a plan , a strategy , " he said of the states .
Steele 's victory capped off a tumultuous day that saw six arduous rounds of voting and an acknowledgment of defeat from Duncan , who stepped aside after the third ballot , having bled support throughout the voting process .
" Obviously , the winds of change are blowing here at the RNC , " Duncan told party members , who gave him a standing ovation .
On the fourth ballot of the day , with many members no longer having to consider their loyalty to Duncan , Dawson rocketed into the lead with 62 votes , putting him ahead of Steele 's 60 .
But Dawson 's short burst of momentum was blunted minutes later when former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell quit the race and surprised the audience by throwing his support behind Duncan .
On the subsequent ballot , Steele picked up 19 votes , while Dawson gained just seven .
Michigan GOP Chairman Saul Anuzis , whose support topped out at 31 votes , dropped out after the fifth round of voting but did not endorse a candidate .
Most of his supporters then backed Steele on the final ballot .

Three Palestinian Qassam rockets left smoke trails in the sky as they were launched toward Israeli civilian targets from Gaza .
Since the Israeli air offensive began last Saturday , Hamas has deployed longer - range rockets capable of hitting Israeli cities over 20 miles away .
Hamas officials said that more missiles were fired on Friday .
There were no new reports of Israeli casualties .

Antarctica is on average the coldest , driest and windiest place on Earth .
98 % of Antarctica is covered by ice , which is on average 1,6 kilometers ( 1 mi ) in thickness .
As there is little precipitation , the interior of the continent is technically the largest desert in the world , but a frozen desert .
As for the temperature , scientists recorded the world ’s lowest temperature : − 89 °C ( −129 °F ) .
Though it ’s fifth - largest continent in area , its population is about 1000 , at the same time there are no permanent human residents , only those conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent .
But there are lots of penguins , fur seals and cold - adapted plants .
Maybe Antarctica is so beautiful , because there are not many people , it has no government and belongs to no country .
Enjoy beautiful pictures of the coldest place on Earth .

She delivered this commentary during the " Cutting through the Bull " segment of Wednesday night 's broadcast .
CNN 's Campbell Brown says the new treasury secretary wants to hire a former lobbyist as a top aide .
( CNN ) --
Unfortunately , we are again asking the president to explain why exactly he announced , with great fanfare , new ethics rules if he had no intention of abiding by them .
The Obama administration is yet again asking for a waiver to its very own rules about hiring lobbyists .
This time , it is the new treasury secretary , Tim Geithner .
He wants a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs to be his top aide at the Treasury Department .
My view is simple : Mr. President , if you want to hire former lobbyists because you think they are the best people to do the job , then hire former lobbyists .
Just do n't hold a big news conference first to tell us how your administration is going to be so different from previous administrations in that you wo n't be hiring lobbyists .
Do n't make your disdain for lobbyists and your pledges that they wo n't wield influence in your administration a centerpiece of your campaign .

You know what I ’m talking about : those direct marketing ads that offer products you ’ve never imagined ( and probably do n’t really need ) for $ 19.95 ( and if you call now , you ’ll get two of ’em ) .
Every now and then , one of these catches my attention … in the sense that “ Hey … that ’s kind of green . ”
Now , do n’t get me wrong : I ’m not calling any of the products listed below “ green ” ( nor am I endorsing them at all … from what I understand , caveat emptor always applies with these products ) .
That would require some time - consuming due diligence to assess the products manufacturing process , materials , and lifecyle .
But , in each case , the product ’s selling proposition is based on conservation : use less of another product , make other products last longer , or use less energy , water , etc .
These products do show that conservation sells … even if it ’s not called that .
Without further ado …

The ShamWow : “ Holds 21 times its weight in liquid ! ” I have n’t tested that ( or the product itself , for that matter ) , but the ShamWow could also nearly eliminate paper towel use if it works as well as the marketing claims .
The greenest option for eliminating paper towels may be the rag bag , but , c’mon , this is pretty cool ( but , yes , that spokesman guy is scary as hell ! ) .
Questions still to be answered in assessing “ greeness ” : material ( a “ rayon type of material ” according to the website ) , manufacturing processes , end of life .
The reviews are definitely mixed .
Save a Blade : “ Save Hundreds on Razor Blades ! ” OK , that make take some time ( though disposable blades are n’t cheap ) .
But sharpening disposable blades to get up to 200 shaves … that makes financial sense , and also cuts back on blades in the trash .
Given the ugly environmental impact of razor production , that ’s a good thing .
Questions still to be answered in assessing “ greeness ” : materials , manufacturing processes , energy use , origin of the product ( I ’m guessing “ Made in China ” ) , and end of life .
Also gets mixed reviews .

And if anyone can explain how the Neosocket could possibly help people save gas , I ’m all ears .
Am I having a little fun here ?
You betcha !
I will give it to the direct marketing folks , though : they know how to seize on opportunities , and consumers are clearly looking for ways to save money by reducing waste .
That ’s something I can get behind in concept … of course , if these products are crap , that does no one any good .
Looking forward to hearing what you know … fire away !

Not sure how they intend to accomplish this , and the WaPo story suggests they ’re not sure either :
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner issued new guidelines yesterday aimed at eliminating the influence of lobbyists on the $ 700 billion financial bailout program by restricting their contact with officials who are reviewing applications for money and deciding how to disburse it .
Treasury officials also will seek to limit political influence over the funds , saying they will use similar restrictions that forbid such influence in tax matters as a model .
The department ’s Office of Financial Stability will be required to certify to Congress that each government investment is based solely on objective criteria .
As part of that effort , only banks recommended by their primary regulator will be eligible for capital investments .
Great , so lobbyists wo n’t have any more influence over TARP II than they will over our tax code .
I feel better .

Frankie 's owner thinks he has been sneaking into neighbours ' houses to take the loot from their pets , and says he is always very proud of what he brings back .
S ince I ’ve received no education in philosophy whatever , it is no doubt very rash of me to make a broad generalization concerning the subject , but I shall risk it nonetheless : that in the whole history of philosophy not a single important philosophical problem has ever been solved beyond all possible dispute .
I know that the late Sir Karl Popper claimed to have solved the problem of induction not merely to his own satisfaction , but also to the satisfaction of all rational men ; alas , I do not think that all rational men have reciprocated by agreeing with him .
Pace Popper , the philosophy of science is not now at an end , any more than is mental , political , or moral philosophy .
Unless
I am much mistaken , the metaphysical foundations of aesthetic and moral judgment have not been established with anything like the certainty with which , say , the circulation of the blood has been established .
I know that it is fashionable to state that all scientific knowledge is provisional , and itself rests upon metaphysically uncertain foundations .
Perhaps in the abstract this is correct ; yet I do not think anyone seriously expects a future researcher to discover that the blood does not in fact circulate .
Evidently , there are degrees even of scientific tentativeness .
If every moral judgment is metaphysically uncertain , unsupported by any philosophical lender of last resort , it appears to some people that the only answer to the question of how people ought to behave is a complete relativism , possibly backed up by some version of John Stuart Mill ’s principle that everything is permissible that does not harm another person .
This conclusion is strengthened by the observation , first made by Herodotus , I believe , that what men have thought good ( or for that matter beautiful ) has been infinitely various , or nearly so ; and since there is no reason to believe that any group of men has become either better or more intelligent than men in Herodotus ’s day , our judgment of what we consider good ( or beautiful ) is arbitrary , or aleatory , that is to say contingent upon such matters as when and where we are born , into what social class , with what mental apparatus , etc .
Nothing is good or bad but thinking makes it so ; and beauty is in the eye of the beholder .
What we think and see in matters of moral and aesthetic judgment is to a large extent determined by our circumstances ; for neither goodness nor beauty is out there in the world awaiting discovery , like the planet Pluto , by men armed with telescopes and mathematical equations .
Now let us , for the sake of argument , grant that this is so : that we can not place any moral or aesthetic judgment on firm , which is to say indubitable , metaphysical foundations ; and that as a matter of observable fact men have formed very different judgments about the good and beautiful over the ages and in different regions of the world .
Does it follow that the only resort left to us is a kind of multiculturalism in which each ego is an entire culture of its own ?
I do not think so .
Men can no more avoid making moral and aesthetic judgments than they can avoid eating :
It is built into their very nature to make such judgments .
Accordingly , there is no human society that has no concept of the good or of the beautiful , even if it is only pre-philosophical , which is to say implicit rather than explicit .
Of course , what societies believe to be good or beautiful may vary , as their diet does ; but judgment is as inescapable as nutrition .
Even the popular desire to make no judgment is based on a judgment , that it is wrong to make a judgment .
I remember a patient of mine who told me proudly , with the unmistakable smile of the anointed , that her greatest virtue was that she was non-judgmental ; more recently , in response to an article I wrote , I received an email which denounced me as a judgmental illegitimate .
Now men , as I suppose I do n’t have to tell you , live in societies , unless they are anchorites in the Syrian desert subsisting on honey and locusts ( and even then they usually came from societies , the general rule being no societies , no anchorites in the Syrian desert ) .
In order to rub along , more or less , men must put limits or boundaries upon their own behavior ; and it certainly helps them to do so if those limits or boundaries are backed by some kind of moral principle , though the articulation between boundary and principle may be loose or contentious .
What is new about the current relativism , it seems to me , is not that it contends the positioning of boundaries , for such positioning has , I think , always been contentious :
It is always possible , after all , to argue that any given boundary contributes more to the misery than to the happiness of man .
Rather , the current relativism contests the very need for boundaries itself , or at any rate has the effect , once it filters down from the intelligentsia into the general population , of destroying the appreciation of the need for boundaries .
And if no boundaries are needed , then any attempt to impose them is without legitimacy .
Only what comes from the self is legitimate .
R ecently I read in a French newspaper the obituary of a novelist of the 1960s and 70s who was quoted as saying that sex and the state ought to have nothing whatever to do with one another .
In other words , he was arguing not that what was legally permissible should be extended in such and such a way , the boundaries set there rather than here , but that everything should be permissible , and boundaries abolished altogether ; and on his principle , it is hard to see how public authority could intervene in sexual activity short of Jeffrey Dahmer’s .
Under his dispensation , even rape would be just common assault , no worse than , say , a slap on the face .
Readers will not be altogether surprised , perhaps , to learn that the novelist in question died alone , and that his body was not discovered until a month after his death .
The increasing unwillingness of the population , at least of the British population , to accept any boundaries — that is to say , any that they have not laid down for themselves in their individual capacity — is illustrated by the abolition from below , as it were , of the age of consent to sexual relations .
In Britain , the age of consent is sixteen .
Before that age , no child can legally consent to sexual relations .
Now it might be argued that this age limit is not realistic and ought to be changed , that it takes no account of the fact that puberty has been occurring one year earlier every decade for the past three or four decades , which is to say that children mature sexually much earlier than once they did .
It also does not recognize the fact that untold numbers of children do have sexual relations before the age of consent , and surely no one would want to criminalize so many youngsters for doing what they want to do and what their hormones urge them to do .
There is no doubt also that , when it comes to sex below the legal age of consent , British society faces in at least two directions at once ( reminding one rather of the records of Italy , Hungary , and Romania during the Second World War ) .
While expressing a horror — to the point of hysteria , given the actual statistical risk — of pedophilia and sexual predation on boys and girls , it routinely enjoins doctors to prescribe contraceptives to girls for several years before the age of consent without telling the parents of the girls what they have done .
Futhermore , the great majority of the content of magazines produced for a readership of ages ten and eleven is highly sexualized .
You might as well produce literature extolling the pleasures of alcohol for children of that age and expect them not to want to drink .
It is true that a number of men are still sent to prison ostensibly for having had sexual relations with underage girls , but in reality it is more likely that they have gone to prison not for having had sexual relations with these girls , but for having stopped having sexual relations with these girls , who have not only disguised their own ages , as some young men did when trying to enlist for the World Wars , from their lovers , but have acted with the full knowledge and apparent complaisance of their parents .
Only when they are angry with their lovers for breaking off the relationship do they go to the police , and so the law becomes more an instrument of personal revenge than an upholder of principle or — more to the present point — a guardian of boundaries .
It might be supposed that if this particular boundary were shifted to a more “ realistic ” place , that is to say to one which recognized the way people were already behaving , if the age of consent to sexual relations were reduced to , say , fourteen , the problem would evaporate .
But this is clearly not so because , if you talk to parents and children about the age of consent , as I have done on many occasions , they will almost invariably argue that the age is arbitrary and therefore intellectually indefensible and unjust .
Can anyone really suppose , they ask , that a child acquires the maturity necessary to consent to sexual relations on his or her sixteenth birthday , that he or she did not have when he was but 15 years and 364 days old ?
Can a day really make all that difference ?
Obviously , from the empirical point of view , this is ridiculous .
The law is therefore an ass , an idiot .
The argument , however , is not directed at the specific age of consent that the law lays down because it can be used against any other age that the law might lay down .
In effect , it is demanding the same of the law that the relativist demands of any moral principle , that it should be founded upon something impervious to doubt .
But nature does not divide reality into nice neat categories for us , ready - made for us to assign a name to : just as there is no single grain of sand that transforms a collection of grains into a pile , so there is no precise moment at which all human beings are sufficiently mature to decide for themselves whether or not to have sexual intercourse .
Indeed , even discounting the variation between people , there is no single moment in anybody ’s life when this transformation takes place ; it is vain to seek it .
I n fact , the world is full of continua , and in most cases , except when we wish to be free of the moral and legal limits that we feel unjustly restrict us , we do not experience any difficulty in accommodating them to our ways of thought .
When we describe someone as tall or fat or short or thin , we are not claiming that there is a precise measurement at which people become what we describe them as being .
We should think a doctor very odd who denied the existence of anemia and refused to treat it on the grounds that the measurement of the level of hemoglobin in the blood is on a continuum , and therefore that anemia can not be said truly to exist .
Of course , the conventionally accepted cut - off point at which anemia is diagnosed may change ( indeed , the mean corpuscular volume of the red cells that is accepted as normal in Britain has shifted in the direction of larger red cells because , as people drink more , mean volume rises ) , but no change of convention will alter the fact that if a person ’s level of hemoglobin is sufficiently low , he will suffer certain symptoms as a consequence .
It is only in the continua of moral significance that the relativist is interested , of course .
There he becomes as ferocious in his demand that boundaries should correspond to actual limits in nature as any taxonomist of the plant or insect world .
And if the law does not satisfy this demand , as of course it cannot , because words are being asked to bear too heavy an ontological burden , he demands the right to fix the boundaries , if any , for himself .
He believes he can do a better job of it than the law , though he is sometimes rather taken aback to discover that other people do not accept his definition of the boundaries either .
In the ensuing battle for hearts and minds , he who proposes the most latitude usually wins .
And so with the spread of relativism , we see , at least in Britain , an increasing unwillingness to accept without contestation boundaries of public and private behavior .
The argument that I heard frequently in my youth , that something is not done , cuts no ice ; indeed , if offered as an argument , it is likely to provoke a severe reaction , like an inflammatory chemical upon the skin .
In a world in which the word “ conventional ” has become a term of almost automatic disapprobation , even of abuse , and where dumb insolence is often taken as a principled resistance to the arbitrary demands of convention ( no photo of a rock or rap star , for example , would be complete without it ) , it is hardly to be expected that the argument from a code of manners will triumph .
What people want now is a knockdown argument , derived syllogistically from an indubitable first principle , as to why they should behave , or refrain from behaving , in a particular way : absent which , anything goes .
It is not altogether surprising , then , that ( again referring to Britain , which is in many ways in the forefront of undesirable developments ) we hear increasingly of disputes that sometimes turn violent over comparatively trivial matters , such as the volume of music played or the refusal to adhere to the etiquette of standing in line at the bus stop .
I t is interesting , and perhaps even important , to speculate upon the reasons for the comparatively sudden triumph of relativism in everyday life .
Fifty years ago , practically no one was a relativist , apart from a few social anthropologists of the functionalist school , who would have argued that the reduction of grandmothers into soup evidently served a useful function for those persons inclined to do it .
The first reason for the triumph is that anything that flatters or promotes egotism is likely to prove popular , unless counteracted very strongly .
The second reason is the loss of power , and therefore of cultural confidence , of the Western world , particularly ( of course ) of Europe in the face of the rise of Asia , which it cannot resist .
People who are brought up to expect that they will inherit power , but find that it is dashed from their hands when they are ready to accede to it , are bitterly inclined to reject the society and culture that has so misled them and given them false expectations .
The third reason is the effect of the spread of tertiary education .
I am not arguing that the aggressive young men and women who disregard the priority of old ladies at bus stops are themselves recently trained moral philosophers , who have come to the conclusion after deep study that , nothing in metaphysics being certain , it is therefore as permissible for them to push in front of the old ladies as it was for Raskolnikov to murder his landlady , but with the spread of tertiary education , both in the numbers of educated people and by their prominence in the media of mass communication , rumors of relativism are bound to have become more insistent .
Young people may not know the date of the Battle of Hastings , but they know that you cannot derive an ought from an is .
Fourth is the inexorable rise of self - importance and self - esteem , that psychological Congressional Medal of Honor , Order of Merit , and Grand - croix de la Légion d’Honneur which is awarded automatically to everyone for the heroic feat of drawing breath : a rise that is itself consequent upon the extension of the right to the pursuit of happiness to success in the pursuit .
Everyone knows , of course , that the liberty of the individual is essential to happiness ; and they also know that boundaries limit freedom , in the way that educationists know that teaching children the grammar of standard English limits their freedom to express themselves .
It follows , therefore , that boundaries are an impediment to happiness .
He who is unhappy is immiserated by boundaries , as Gulliver was tied down in Lilliput .
He who imposes boundaries is a tyrant , and he who accepts them is a slave .
Where exactly inalienable human rights fit into a world in which everything is relative is something into which one is not supposed to enquire .
( When I asked one girl who wanted to be a human rights lawyer where human rights came from , whether they lay buried in the earth in distant parts until found and brought back by intrepid explorers , for example , or whether they were necessary fictions for a creature such as man who could not explain himself to himself — rather as was Original Sin — she replied , with more vehemence than any Grand Inquisitor , “ You ca n’t ask me that . ” )
Be that as it may , the philosophical circle is successfully closed : moral judgment being relative , contingent , and arbitrary , and every man having the right to pursue his happiness in his own way , no authority , whether governmental or informal , has any business interfering with anyone ’s mode of life or behavior , which is by definition his way of seeking happiness and being happy .
Unfortunately , the solipsistic pursuit of happiness by people who live in close proximity to one another can , indeed often does , result in conflict .
And thus it is that we come to create a hostile environment for ourselves :
for the world , which seems
To lie before us like a land of dreams ,
So various , so beautiful , so new ,
Hath really neither joy , nor love , nor light ,
Nor certitude , nor peace , nor help for pain ;
And we are here as on a darkling plain
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight ,
Where ignorant armies clash by night .

Many aspects of this graphic can apply to the rest of the Big Three but I focused on GM since they are in the most dire position .
GM has many woes , the least of which is a shortfall of money , so why do people think that an infusion of cash will do anything but prolong the agony ?
Stop waiving all the flags .
So here it is , a visual guide to why GM wo n’t be around much longer .
Unless ofcourse they can actually form a game plan to get some of these metaphorical shipping containers off their backs .
Another thing I wanted to stress is that the conversation about the decline of General Motors involves singular finger pointing .
“ It ’s the unions ” , “ It ’s management ” .
Bottom line is you will need a lot of fingers because the root causes are plenty and the cumulative effect is what ’s taking this ship down .
In this season ’s eighth episode , Boston Legal – the relentlessly liberal ABC dramedy starring William Shatner and James Spader – lobbed an absolute bomb at those of us on the pro-choice side of the Roe v. Wade question .
The bunker - buster was posed , predictably enough , by Crane Poole & Schmitt ’s resident conservative , the gleefully Republican Denny Crane , portrayed by Shatner .
BL fans know Crane to be positively Cheney - esque in his politics ( although he did finally cross the aisle to vote for Obama because even he could n’t stomach four more years like the last eight ) , and he routinely plays the straw man for the passionate liberalism of Spader ’s litigator par excellence , Alan Shore .
This time , though , Crane ( who ’s battling through the early stages of Alzheimer ’s ) breaks through to a moment of pristine , Emmy - worthy clarity .
In a brilliantly crafted scene , he explains to Shore that
You pro-choice people , you need Roe vs. Wade .
You ’re desperate for it .
Not because you ’re sure of your opinion , but because you ’re not .
You need to cling to that ruling as moral validation for a position you ’re not entirely comfortable with , deep down .
Denny Crane , indeed .
There ’s more than a grain of truth in Crane ’s accusation .
Pro-lifers have the luxury of absolute moral certainty , you see .
Life begins at conception , they insist , and therefore abortion is murder .
Period .
And life is the most sacred thing on Earth .
Is this formulation without its problems ?
Of course not – it ’s about as inane as are all incredibly simple answers to incredibly complex questions .
But it is simple , and if you ’ve ever been to a pro-life rally you understand that this crowd is not inherently drawn to complexities .
Pro-choicers ?
Well , the pro-choice side of the argument is a tad more complicated because it ’s not really about abortion at all .
Let ’s be clear on something : pro-choice does not equal pro-abortion .
I have never in my life met a single human being who was pro-abortion .
Not one .
Such a person may exist – we ’re a nation of over 300 million people , after all , so somewhere out there a freak - fringe analogue to Fred Phelps may be running loose .
But so far I have n’t met this person .
( My fellow Scrogue , Dr. Wendy Redal , advises me that Warren Hern of the Boulder Abortion Clinic may come close to fitting that bill , at least in the eyes of some . )
So while the two camps disagree violently on what the law should be , they have one very important thing in common : pro-lifers and all pro-choicers hate abortion .
Just about all of them .
The problem is that the pro-choice camp is forced to confront complexity .
While abortion is bad , how do we legislate against individual freedoms ?
More to the point , whom do we trust to so legislate ?
This is where the rubber hits the road .
The truth that we do n’t talk about very often is that a number of folks on the pro-choice side of the street are extremely conflicted .
Many , I suspect , are uneasy with the proposition that abortion , in all contexts , should be treated as a simple matter of choice .
However , they recognize the pro-life movement for what it is – an insidious theocractic wedge into governance – and they believe it to be worse , on the whole , than abortion .
It ’s probably safe to say that a healthy majority of pro-choicers think this way about the anti-abortion crowd .
Some of us perhaps know a thoughtful , conscientious pro-life advocate who has arrived at the position without the aid of reactionary theology and who craves a solution that does n’t trash our individual liberties .
But if we do , this person is the rarest minority .
In point of fact , nearly 100 % of the visible opposition to Roe v. Wade in America emanates from socially conservative evangelical Christianity .
I ’d probably be overreaching were I to suggest that most of these people would gladly subjugate the Constitution to their ministers ’ various interpretations of the Bible ( however ill - informed they may be ) , but by the same token you ’d be naive to pretend that there is n’t enough of that very dynamic to concern those of us who think Jefferson meant what he damned well said about the wall between church and state .
Bottom line : there are a lot of pro-choicers in America whose positions have very little , if anything at all , to do with abortion per se .
Instead , they “ cling to that ruling ” because they do not , cannot , will not trust those on the other side of the police line with their liberties .
Nor should they .
Those who would legislate based on facile , tragically misunderstood , millennia - old mythologies must not , under any circumstances , be emboldened in their quest to legally codify America ’s status as a Christian nation – not as they define “ Christian . ”
What I believe .
Sort of .
To this point I have been speaking , perhaps too generally , on behalf of others .
So let me talk more directly about what and how I think .
First , do I believe that abortion is wrong ?
Maybe , but “ wrong ” is a loaded term .
Wrong by whose standards ?
I believe abortion is usually a very bad thing , because at the bare minimum it exacts a lasting toll on the woman having it .
There are n’t any occasions I can think of where an abortion is a cause for celebration .
The only times I ’d count abortion as “ not so bad , on the whole , ” are in cases of rape or incest , or where the woman ’s life is threatened or where the fetus proves to have some form of birth defect .
Yes , I ’m generally okay with abortion in the case of certain kinds of physical and mental defects .
Each day children are born under circumstances guaranteeing that their lives will be miserable .
I find that abhorrent .
Life is a remarkable thing , but a life of torture is worse than death .
Mercy , and an enlightened sense of responsibility toward those doomed to suffering , this is a higher value , I believe .
I certainly do not believe that abortion is a sin , though , primarily because I reject the foundations from which the current use of the word “ sin ” arises .
By now I hope I ’m clear on this subject : your religion and your conscience are yours , but you have no right whatsoever to export your religious beliefs onto others .
If you have reasoned yourself to a pro-life moral position , I respect that and we can talk about it in good faith .
If you believe it because somebody told you that ’s what Jesus thinks , we have nothing to talk about , and you absolutely should not be allowed anywhere near a policy - making apparatus .
Do I believe that life begins at conception ?
No .
At least , not in any way that ’s relevant or actionable from a policy perspective .
Depending on how you define things , life may begin before conception – I mean , eggs and sperm are alive , right ?
Is this really a road we want our various legislatures wandering down ?
What I ’m a lot more concerned about is viability – at what point is the fetus capable of living outside the womb ?
Do I have a problem forbidding the aborting of a viable fetus ?
Well , unless we ’re talking about one of the instances I note above , maybe not .
But these kinds of procedures are far more rare than most pro-lifers would have you believe .
In any case , I ’m not a scientist , nor am I a physician .
I ’m willing to take guidance on this question from those who are experts in the study of physiology and medicine .
And yes , I do think it ’s possible to have this conversation productively and in good faith .
So , I do believe we should get rid of abortion , then ?
Well , I think we ’d all be better off if there were so few abortions that the subject pretty much never came up , and that when there was an abortion the circumstances surrounding it were wholly uncontroversial .
But overturning Roe v.
Wade would no more accomplish this than the volumes of statutes currently on the books are preventing murders , robberies , rapes , child abuse and jaywalking .
So How Do We Get Rid of Abortions ,
Then ?
We Americans have a bad habit of addressing the symptoms instead of curing the disease .
Unfortunately , you ’re never going to treat a sucking chest wound with a band - aid .
The first steps to eliminating abortion in America – assuming that ’s really what you ’re after – require us to address the actual causes : poverty and sub-standard education .
Levitt and Dubner do a nice job of examining the socio-economic conditions surrounding abortion in Freakonomics , and let ’s simply note here that if abortion is a scourge in the United States , it ’s not the educated and well - off neighborhoods that are bearing the brunt of the damage .
To be sure , privileged girls from the best schools in the lily - whitest gated communities in America ’s most respected and white - flightest suburban enclaves do get themselves into the family way on occasion , but there are few more effective prophylactics , if you will , against unwanted pregnancy than the family and communal stability engendered by top - notch education and a clear sense of opportunity in life .
Unfortunately , we ’re coming off what may prove to be the eight dumbest years of governance in our history .
The decade of the 2000s will not be remembered for advancing learning in our society , and it ’s hard to find a better example of educational malfeasance than “ abstinence - only ” sex ed .
Bush and his social conservative henchmen have pushed the hell out of this particular anti-educational affront to coherent policy - making , and at this stage the only controversy remaining is whether abstinence - only makes no difference or whether it makes things worse .
I expect that , upon his inauguration , we ’ll see Barack Obama confronting these issues in his social and economic agendas , although whether his administration will genuinely work toward a level playing field and universal opportunity or if it will simply settle for a few cosmetic nips and tucks around the fugly spots remains to be seen .
However , if we get serious about making the most of every mind and turning some of our rhetoric about how all children can grow up to do whatever they set those minds to into actual reality , then we will see dramatic drops in the abortion rate ( along with corresponding decreases in all kinds of anti-social and criminal behavior ) .
And for our pro-life readers : that ’s what you really want , right ?
Right ?
The Real Argument
This whole thesis is one I ’ve been carrying around for quite some time .
It has long been obvious that our nation ’s most violently divisive argument was n’t really about abortion at all , and the basic dishonesty of this , of our collective willing suspension of disbelief , has griped me to no end .
To be clear : there is no disagreement in America today , nor has there ever been , about abortion .
There is almost nothing that we agree on more unanimously , in fact .
Instead , abortion is the field on which a battle is being waged .
It ’s as though we ’ve confused the turf at the Meadowlands with the game of football .
Put another way , the abortion “ debate ” is about abortion in roughly the same way that the Civil War was about real estate in Manassas , Gettysburg and Chattanooga .
What we call the abortion debate is better understood as a conflict over human rights .
More deeply , it is about Modernity vs. Fundamentalism .
Are we a nation governed by reason and law , or are we a nation governed by the priesthood ?
Do we believe that individuals are endowed with certain inalienable rights , or do we trust TV preachers to tell us what rights God wants us to have ?
Will we insist on a system that adapts and evolves as our society grows and learns , or will we cling desperately to a system that refuses to acknowledge that change even exists ?
Put bluntly , will we live in the 21st Century or the 16th ?
I ’m willing to have debates , so long as they ’re conducted intelligently and in good faith .
But for too long we ’ve been conflating things , tangling ourselves up in rhetorical sucker plays and refusing to acknowledge what ’s really on the agenda .
That has to change if we ’re ever to make any progress toward resolving our fundamental differences in a way that allows us to move forward together .
I ’m game , but I wonder how many are with me .
Change We Can Live With
Obama will take office on the promise of “ change we can believe in . ”
He promises that things will be different , that we ’ll step past the partisan divisions that have set us at each other ’s throats for so long .
So maybe this is the moment .
Maybe this is our opportunity to find a way of addressing abortion in a way that is legitimately about abortion – that is , to discuss it in terms of science and the deeper social conditions that underlie it instead of in terms of reactionary , fear - driven theology .
Before this can happen , though , President Obama will need to restore government ’s respect for the Constitution , a document that has suffered tremendous abuse in recent years .
Governmental research functions will need to be returned to the control of actual researchers and we ’ll have to stop pretending that anti-science is actually science .
No more fundamentalist litmus tests , no more faux “ debates ” about facts that are settled , no more obeisance to those who think that Leviticus is a peer - reviewed journal .
Maybe now is the time for this .
Or … maybe not – I mean , how hopeful should I be as long as Obama is still taking Rick Warren seriously ?
( For a wonderfully detailed look at the … ummm , quagmire … facing Obama , see Sarah Posner ’s new American Prospect analysis on “ The Truth About Abortion Reduction . ” )
I believe that when these things are accomplished , we ’ll all be surprised at how many people are willing to sit down at the table and honestly discuss their opinions about issues that have heretofore not been open to discussion .
Denny Crane was right : many of us are uneasy about being forced into an absolutist position over something we know to be nuanced and complex .
I , for one , hope the time is approaching when intelligent people can begin untangling those complexities in an environment that ’s free of suspicion and fear .
A man has been arrested after running down a Mount Isa street wearing only his underpants and with exploding fireworks taped to his head .
Police say the unusual show unfolded when they were called to a street in the CBD at about 11:00 pm yesterday .
Sergeant Chris McLoughlin said the fireworks were exploding and the man could have posed a public safety risk .
" He had a bicycle helmet strapped to his head and on that helmet he had some duct tape with several boxes of fireworks , " Sergeant McLoughlin said .
" Certainly the gentleman was bursting with obvious flair and he was making a bit of a spectacle of himself , but in the end we must take some sort of action and the gentleman 's been taken from the roadway . "
The 23 - year - old man has been charged with public nuisance and is due to appear in court next month .
Olbermann refers to Bush 9/11 ' lies ' as ' Insult the Dead - gate ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday December 19 , 2008

As the departing Bush administration frantically attempts to shore up its place in history , MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann stands ready to kick the props out from under it again .
A renewed claim that " no one could have anticipated " the attacks of 9/11 attracted his scorn in particular on Thursday 's Countdown .
" This is a White House talking point still , even though your average three - year - old could disprove it using an etch - a - sketch . "
Olbermann sneered on Thursday , over the heading , " Insult the Dead - gate . "
Olbermann 's specific target was White House press spokesman Tony Fratto , who responded to a Fox News interviewer 's suggestion on Wednesday that before 9/11 , " nobody was thinking that there 'd be terrorists flying 767s into buildings " by agreeing , " No one could have anticipated that kind of attack -- or very few people . "
" Yeah , well , it ai n't true , " Olbermann remarked , with open contempt dripping from his words , " and out of respect for the people who died that day you damn well better stop saying it . "
Olbermann then ran through a list of pre-9/11 warnings of potential al Qaeda hijackings , noting , " A president 's daily brief as far back as December 1998 said bin Laden was ' preparing to hijack US aircraft in hopes of trading hostages for jailed radicals . ' ...
The August 6 , 2001 brief , of course , told President Bush -- if he read it -- that there were ' patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings . ' "
Olbermann did not mention either the use of airplanes as weapons by the Japanese kamikaze suicide pilots during World War II or the abortive al Qaeda plot of the 1990's known as Project Bojinka , which would have involved both blowing up airliners and crashing a plane into CIA headquarters in Virginia and which may have been the inspiration for 9/11 .
" That Mr. Fratto 's employers might not have been expected to know the exact hour of these attacks , " concluded Olbermann , " does not give him or anybody else the right to perpetuate the lie that 9/11 was impossible to conceive .
Clearly , many inside this nation 's government anticipated it .
It was Mr. Bush and his gang who chose to ignore them . "

Olympen entrance
Not long ago , my advice to anyone wanting to try Norwegian microbrew in Oslo would have been to buy bottles from the Wine Monopoly stores and drink them in the hotel room .
Not very appealing , of course , but the alternative would have been to hit the two or three pubs that carried a couple of such beers each , where you would have had to argue with the waiters in the hopes of perhaps persuading them to sell you one .
( To be fair , Bar & Cigar could be relied on to not just have some , but to also sell them . )
And since the Wine Monopoly only carries a very limited selection of Norwegian microbrew beer enthusiasts living in Oslo had a hard time getting hold of new Norwegian microbrews , and especially the most interesting one - offs and experiments .
A group of us in Oslo would gang together and use all kinds of tricks in order to perhaps get hold of a single bottle to share between us .
Today , that 's all history , since the Oslo beer scene changed completely in the course of 2008 .
The main change is due to Olympen , a historic pub in the district of Grønland , immediately east of the city center .
The pub first opened in 1892 , and seems to have had a rather checkered history as a kind of cabaret scene and so on .
In the early 30s it was redecorated , and became too fancy and modern for the tastes of the previous clientele .
From that point on , it seems to have gone slowly downhill .
First draft pint of Nøgne Ø being pulled
The last years it 's been famous as one of the brownest of the brown pubs in Oslo , the interior covered with a layer of nicotine seven decades deep .
The entertainment was mostly Bulgarian dance bands playing a mix of rock covers and the musical monstrosity known as Swedish dansband .
The clientele would consist of rather tired and drunk locals , but also fancily dressed ( though equally drunk ) outsiders .
Overall , it was an interesting place to spend the last couple of hours before closing time , provided you made sure to have enough to drink .
Then , all of a sudden , it closed for renovation , and stayed closed for almost a year , until it reopened in late 2007 .
Now , it seems , history has repeated itself .
Olympen has suddenly become fancy again , and the former clientele have relocated to the brown pub next door .
Personally , I 'm very happy with the redecoration .
Some of the spirit of the place has been kept , and especially the huge historic paintings covering the walls , which date from the 30s redecoration , but show the district as it was in the late 19th century .
Olympen had a decent beer menu right from the reopening , but in late 2008 it suddenly expanded the beer menu dramatically , to include about 10 Nøgne Ø beers , 10 Haandbryggeriet beers , plus additional beers from the Små Vesen and Ægir breweries , and a good selection of imports .
Then , a couple of weeks ago , they installed a tap tower carrying two Nøgne Ø beers .
At the same time , interesting new Nøgne Ø beers started showing up in addition to what 's on the menu .
And , amazingly , Olympen is not alone in this .
Several fine restaurants in Oslo now carry Norwegian microbrew , and a number of pubs have started stocking some .
Draft towers for Nøgne Ø have been installed at Beer Palace and Bar & Cigar as well , and Bar & Cigar runs cask beer from Nøgne Ø or Haandbryggeriet about once a month .
So , suddenly , you can have a pub - to - pub walk in Oslo and drink only Norwegian microbrew , some of it draft , and you can even find the new experimental beers .
So , finally , visiting beer enthusiasts have better alternatives than drinking microbrew in their hotel room in the evening , and it 's beginning to look like Norway could just possibly be on the verge of its own microbrew revolution .
( Strictly speaking , you could say that it 's happened already .
The current state of affairs is certainly a revolution compared to how things were as recently as 2002 . )
Our alcohol legislation will probably limit how far it can go , but still , for the first time it 's beginning to look like Norway might , in some limited way , see something like the microbrewing revolution that 's swept Denmark .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Financially speaking , Web 2.0 has been a total bust .
Social - networking companies such as MySpace and Facebook have loyal fan bases , but they 're not exactly minting money .
MySpace 's projected $ 600 million revenue in 2008 falls far short of parent News Corp .'s ( NWS , Fortune 500 ) billion - dollar sales target for the site .
Messaging service Twitter has no business model .
Video - sharing site YouTube was the only big sale ; Google paid $ 1.65 billion for it two years ago but still has n't figured out how to make much money off it .
Social media 's champions hoped 2008 would be a watershed year for Web 2.0 .
( That 's the term tech publisher Tim O'Reilly coined four years ago to describe a new wave of Internet innovation that let users publish and share content . )
Instead , the past 12 months have been a disappointment .
Almost no new game - changing companies have emerged since Twitter burst on the scene in 2007 , and while it 's true existing sites have changed the way we interact on the web , they 've failed to deliver new ways to cash in the way their Web 1.0 predecessors , such as Amazon and Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) , did .
One reason is that the economic climate for today 's web startups is a lot chillier than it was during the first dot - com frenzy .
The door for initial public offerings has all but closed : Just six U.S. venture - backed companies went public last year , and none were web outfits .
And potential acquirers - from Internet companies like Yahoo to traditional media conglomerates like CBS ( CBS , Fortune 500 ) - have big problems of their own .
Not that being bought is a panacea for social - networking firms .
Few of them have seized on a viable business model .
Most rely on display advertising - a .k.a. banners - to make money .
But marketers have cooled to display ads on the web , and they 're especially skeptical of such advertising on social - networking sites .
Fact is , when you 're looking at photos from last night 's holiday party on Facebook , you 're probably ignoring that teeth - whitening ad .
And with all the user - generated content , these sites have so many page views that Web 2.0 companies can't command the same rates as , say , portals .
Yahoo's news site , for example , can charge more than 30 times as much as Facebook for a banner ad .
Most industry watchers bet on Facebook to develop the silver bullet for advertising on these sites .
In fall 2008 CEO Mark Zuckerberg debuted Beacon , first billed as a " social ad " strategy that would monitor and distribute information about a user 's e-commerce preferences to his friends .
Zuckerberg caught flak from the privacy police , and Beacon was significantly downplayed .
The site recently launched Facebook Connect , which lets users access other sites with their Facebook log - in .
Web publishers are excited about it , but for now , the company still relies heavily on " traditional " slow - growing forms of web advertising .
Revenues for 2008 are expected to be about $ 275 million this year , according to several sources , and it is still not profitable .
Accel Partners ' Jim Breyer , the largest outside investor in Facebook , remains optimistic .
" Thus far the home - run outcomes have not yet appeared , but I firmly believe we will see them over the next couple of years , " he says , explaining he thinks these companies are still in their infancy .
In fact , Accel just announced two new funds , totaling a billion dollars , dedicated to investing in early - stage social - media companies .
Indeed , the Facebooks and MySpaces of the world could still grow up to be economically powerful .
Consider that Amazon ( AMZN , Fortune 500 ) once was just an online bookstore , and that Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) started out simply as another search engine .
But today 's Web 2.0 companies may find themselves transformed or even eclipsed by yet another wave of web innovators .
New companies are cropping up to expand the utility of the web , creating location - based services and financial payment systems that can be bolted onto existing sites .
Often bootstrapped , they are frequently profitable and may get acquired quickly .
Even in today 's tough environment , these upstarts are the ones raising money and trying to score a life - or business - altering hit .
Welcome to Web 3.0 .
More Polar Bears Going Hungry
The number of malnourished bears is rising because of warmer temperatures .
Jan. 3 , 2009  --
Warmer temperatures and earlier melting of sea ice are causing polar bears to go hungry .
The number of undernourished bears has tripled in a 20 - year period .
Seth Cherry of the University of Alberta , Canada , and colleagues monitored the health of polar bears in the ice - covered Beaufort Sea region of the Arctic during April and May in 1985 , 1986 , 2005 and 2006 .
They immobilised the bears using tranquilliser darts and measured the ratio of urea to creatinine in their blood .
A low ratio means that nitrogenous waste material is being recycled within the body and indicates the animal is fasting - a state which usually only occurs temporarily in males during the spring breeding season .
In 1985 and 1986 the proportion of bears fasting was 9.6 and 10.5 per cent respectively .
By 2005 and 2006 this had risen to 21.4 and 29.3 per cent .
Cherry 's team believes that the increase in fasting bears is explained by warmer temperatures and earlier spring melts .
Polar bears use sea ice as a hunting platform , catching seals by sitting next to their breathing holes and waiting to pounce .
Spring is usually a time of feasting for polar bears , filling up before summer when the ice retreats .
" It is clear that the changes in the sea ice are affecting the hunting opportunities available to the bears , " says co-author Andrew Derocher of the University of Alberta .
What 's more , the early melting may also be resulting in a lack of prey .
Sea ice is important to seals because they build dens for their pups in the overlying snow , explains Cherry , so their numbers may have dropped .
Anecdotal evidence backs up the team 's conclusions , with many more sightings of polar bears swimming in open water and resorting to eating other food , such as fish .
Previous work has also indicated that melting ice is drivingpregnant polar bears onto land to build their birthing dens .
" If the ice continues to contract , which seems inevitable , polar bears will become even more nutritionally disadvantaged .
The study proves polar bears are in serious trouble , " says Rick Steiner , a marine conservationist at the University of Alaska in Anchorage .

Britain must rethink plans for a database holding details of every email , mobile phone and internet visit , Europe 's human rights commissioner has said in an outspoken attack on the growth of surveillance societies .
Thomas Hammarberg said that UK proposals for sweeping powers to collect and store data will increase the risk of the " violation of an individual 's privacy " .
Plans for the database of emails , phone calls and internet visits are to be published by the Home Office in January .
These proposals have already been described by the Government 's own terrorism - law watchdog as " awful " and attacked by civil liberty groups for laying the basis of a Big Brother state .
Mr Hammarberg , the Council of Europe 's Commissioner for Human Rights , told The Independent that surveillance technologies are developing at breathtaking speed .
In a direct criticism of Britain , he said : " It is therefore worrying that new legislation proposals intend to expand the authorities ' power to allow personal data collection and sharing .
Although safety measures are foreseen , the adoption of these measures would increase the risk of violation of individuals ' privacy .

" The retention and storing of data is delicate and must be highly protected from risk of abuse .
We have already seen what a devastating and stigmatising effect losing files or publishing lists of names on the internet can have on the persons concerned .
This is particularly relevant to the UK , where important private data has been lost and ended up in the public domain . "
The commissioner was critical of the way the UK collects and keeps DNA from people cleared of any crime .
Last month , the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the indiscriminate collection of DNA was illegal .
" Following the judgment of the Strasbourg Court , " Mr Hammarberg said , " the UK will have to review whether keeping details of all these individuals breaches their right to respect for privacy .
The UK might choose to follow the example set by Scotland , where the DNA data of unconvicted persons is only retained in limited circumstances , namely adults who have been charged with violent or sexual offences , and even then , for three years only , with the possibility of a further extension for two years with the consent of a sheriff . "
The Home Office is still considering the impact of the judgment before deciding how to address the concerns raised by the court and the commissioner .
But the Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , says she wants to press ahead with bringing in powers to monitor email and internet traffic to help fight terrorism and crime , although ministers would not seek the right to see the content of internet communications .
Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrat spokesman on home affairs , supported Mr Hammarberg 's criticism , saying : " A major database for email , mobile phone calls and the internet would be an astonishing and Orwellian step .
1984 was supposed to be a warning , not a blueprint . "

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Archaeologists have discovered what they say is the oldest surviving human brain in Britain , dating back at least 2,000 years to the Iron Age .
A representation of the skull generated from the CT scans taken at York Hospital .
The remains of the brain were found in a skull unearthed during excavations at York University in northern England , a statement from the university said Friday .
The dig site was described by investigators from York Archaeological Trust as being in an extensive prehistoric farming landscape of fields , track ways and buildings dating back to at least 300 BC .
They believe the skull , which was found on its own in a muddy pit , may have been a ritual offering .
Rachel Cubitt , who was taking part in the dig , described how she felt something move inside the cranium as she cleaned the soil - covered skull 's outer surface .
Peering through the base of the skull , she spotted an unusual yellow substance .
" It jogged my memory of a university lecture on the rare survival of ancient brain tissue .
We gave the skull special conservation treatment as a result , and sought expert medical opinion , " she said in a statement on York University 's Web site .
A sophisticated CT scanner at York Hospital was then used to produce startlingly clear images of the skull 's contents .
Philip Duffey , Consultant Neurologist at the Hospital said : " I 'm amazed and excited that scanning has shown structures which appear to be unequivocally of brain origin .
I think that it will be very important to establish how these structures have survived , whether there are traces of biological material within them and , if not , what is their composition . "
Dr Sonia O'Connor , Research Fellow in Archaeological Sciences at the University of Bradford added : " The survival of brain remains where no other soft tissues are preserved is extremely rare .
This brain is particularly exciting because it is very well preserved , even though it is the oldest recorded find of this type in the UK , and one of the earliest worldwide . "
According to York University , the find is the second major discovery during archaeological investigations on the site of the University 's $ 745 million campus expansion .
Earlier this year , the skeleton of a man believed to be one of Britain 's earliest victims of tuberculosis was discovered in a shallow grave .
Radiocarbon dating suggests that the man died in the fourth century late - Roman period .
Bush added loophole to Wall Street bailout provision Change removed ways to review executives ' pay
WASHINGTON — Congress wanted to guarantee that the $ 700 billion financial bailout would limit the eye - popping pay of Wall Street executives , so lawmakers included a mechanism for reviewing executive compensation and penalizing firms that break the rules .
But at the last minute , the Bush administration insisted on a one - sentence change to the provision , congressional aides said .
The change stipulated that the penalty would apply only to firms that received bailout funds by selling troubled assets to the government in an auction , which was the way the Treasury Department had said it planned to use the money .
Now , the small change looks more like a giant loophole , according to lawmakers and legal experts .
In a reversal , the Bush administration has not used auctions for any of the $ 335 billion committed so far from the rescue package , nor does it plan to use them in the future .
Lawmakers and legal experts say the change has effectively repealed the only enforcement mechanism in the law dealing with lavish pay for top executives .
" The flimsy executive - compensation restrictions in the original bill are now all but gone , " said Sen.
Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee .
The modification reflects how the rapidly shifting nature of the crisis and the government 's response to it have led to unexpected results that are just beginning to be understood .
The Government Accountability Office , the investigative arm of Congress , issued a report last week about the financial industry rescue package that said it was unclear how the Treasury would determine whether banks were following the executive - compensation rules .
Michele Davis , spokeswoman for the Treasury , said the agency is working to develop a policy for how it will enforce the executive - compensation rules .
She would not say when the guidance would be issued or what penalties it might impose .
But she said the companies promised to follow the rules in contracts with the department .
The Bush administration at first opposed any restrictions on executive pay , congressional aides said .
The original bailout proposal presented to lawmakers in September contained no mention of such limits .
Under pressure from Congress , the Treasury issued regulations in October on executive compensation and applied tax - deduction limits to all companies receiving bailout funds , although the legislation did not require it for firms that received direct capital injections .
But the Treasury did n't issue guidelines requiring the Internal Revenue Service or any other agency to enforce the rules , and it did n't explain how the restrictions would be enforced .
Senators on the Finance Committee are now considering whether they should amend the law to apply the enforcement mechanism to all firms participating in the bailout .
LA PAZ , Jan 25 ( Reuters ) - Bolivia ’s new leftist constitution was approved on Sunday with the support of 55 percent of voters , according to a quick count for ATB television that earlier had said the result was too close to call .
The pollster conducting the quick count said he was projecting a win based on a tally of 80 percent of his sample .
Two other broadcasters said their exit polls showed an even wider win for the constitution .

The green band trailer for Black Dynamite is not quite the same as the Red Band Trailer we originally got , but it is still classic .
Black Dynamite will debut at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival
When “ the man ” kills his brother , pumps heroin into the local orphanage , and floods the ghetto with a secret weapon disguised as Anaconda Malt Liquor , there is only one brother bad enough , strong enough , and brave enough to take them on : the legendary Black Dynamite .
Black Dynamite is a throwback with an attitude .
Hilarious , campy , hot , and sexy , it plays with every cliché from 1970s film and television , with a few new ones thrown in for color .
Director Scott Sanders does n’t need to show his hand to get his point across , making it even more fun to watch .
He has miraculously assembled a huge cast that all perfectly tread the line between satire and spoof .
Crazy kudos need to go to our leading man , played by Michael Jai White , who offers a pitch - perfect performance in every take .
Art direction and costumes are flawless , and the flocked wallpaper holds it own against the faux fur and poly - blend wardrobe .
Black Dynamite has something for everyone : chase scenes , gunfights , a house of ill repute , some karate action , and a star with a killer body who takes on bad guys with — and without — his shirt on .
And if this is n’t enough , Sanders does the near impossible : he sustains the comedy while taking a nice big sucker punch at the underlying politics of our time .

Explanation :
At sunset , Monday 's western sky showed off stunning colors and dramatic clouds reflected in Brisbane Water on the Central Coast of New South Wales , Australia .
It also featured the remarkable conjunction of the crescent Moon , Venus , and Jupiter forming a twilight smiley face .
While the gathering of the two bright planets and Moon awed skygazers around planet Earth , astronomer Mike Salway reports taking special pains to record this gorgeous view , braving mosquitos and rain squalls along a soggy shore .
His southern hemisphere perspective finds brilliant Venus at the highest point in the celestial grouping .
For now , a bright pairing of Venus and Jupiter continues to dominate the western horizon after sunset but the Moon has moved on and tonight is near its first quarter phase .
DOTHAN , Alabama ( CNN ) --
Given the stereotype of the Deep South as the Bible Belt , Rabbi Lynne Goldsmith 's glowing , Chamber of Commerce - like endorsement of Dothan , Alabama , is not what you might expect to hear .
Larry Blumberg put up $ 1 million to help relocate 20 young Jewish families to Dothan , Alabama .
" If you need a robust Orthodox community , we do n't have it , " Goldsmith said .
" But if you want a community where your neighbors are friendly ; where people smile at you in the grocery store even if they do n't know you , then Dothan 's for you . "
There 's a reason Goldsmith , who has been in the city a year , is encouraging people to relocate :
She 'd like to see more Jews in Dothan .
The city of 60,000 sits in the southeastern corner of Alabama , near the state 's borders with Georgia and Florida .
The Jewish community in Dothan was never one that would wow anyone with its size .
At its height , about 100 families worshipped at Temple Emanu - El .
Today , temple membership is about half that number .
As the faithful arrived on a recent Friday for 7 p.m. services , it was evident that there are not very many members , and most are older .
The congregation recently decided that it needed to bring in some younger families , and they felt they had to do it with flair .
" We felt like it needed to be something that had enough sizzle that would get attention , and it really has , " temple member Larry Blumberg said .
Blumberg put up $ 1 million to help relocate 20 young Jewish families to Dothan .
The congregation took out ads in Jewish newspapers offering up to $ 50,000 per family .
Rob Goldsmith , the rabbi's husband , is director of the relocation project .
He says the response has been beyond expectation .
" American Morning " CNN's John Zarrella finds out how the Jewish community in Dothan , Alabama , is recruiting Jewish families on " American Morning . "
Thursday , starting at 6 a.m. ET see full schedule »
" We 've had 275,000 hits on our Web site , several hundred phone calls and e-mails .
We 've really gotten the attention , " Rob Goldsmith said .
Interest in the program has come from as far away as China , Cuba , South America , Israel and all over Europe .
The group 's Web address is http://www.bfjcs.org/.
Out of all the Web site hits and e-mail inquires , Rob Goldsmith says , only about 25 are " promising . "
For many of applicants , their incomes were too high .
Others were from outside the U.S. or -- for one reason or another -- their inquiries were not taken seriously .
To qualify , there are some strict criteria .
Besides being a Jewish family with children , candidates will have to sign a five - year agreement and pass criminal background and credit checks .
Net assets can't exceed $ 100,000 , and according to Rob Goldsmith , people wo n't just be handed a check for $ 50,000 .
The money must be used to cover housing and relocation costs , as seed money to start a business or on education expenses for children .
Depending upon need , it may add up to something less than $ 50,000 .
The Jews in Dothan have no problem using dollars as an incentive , says Lynne Goldsmith .
" We do n't want to die . "
Rob Goldsmith says small southern towns are rapidly losing their young Jewish populations as young people go off to college and do n't come back .
" We need to , like so many small towns , reinvigorate and not close and lock the doors like so many Jewish communities in the South , " he said .
" It 's not gonna happen here . "
Dothan prides itself on being progressive and different from the stereotype of the Deep South city .
" There 's ignorance everywhere .
There 's ignorance in Dothan , " Mayor Pat Thomas said .
" But ... you have a great community here , and you have a community that 's open to all faiths .
And I think that 's a great strength . "
The Jewish families say the city practices not just religious tolerance but religious acceptance .
" Being a Jew living in Dothan for 20 years , I have never experienced any anti-Semitism , " said Daryl Shapiro , who moved here after graduating from Auburn University .
Dr. Marty Margolies and his wife , Abbie , moved to Dothan more than 30 years ago from New York .
Preconceived notions of the South are just wrong , he says .
" We had apprehension when we came , " Shapiro added .
" This turned out to be a wonderful community , as are most of the communities in the South we 've been in .
And all those preconceptions just evaporated . "
The Jewish community is hoping to move four families a year to Dothan over the next five years .
Members hope the first two families will be living there by Hanukkah , in December .
Margolies believes that it's a wonderful opportunity .
" You have to open your eyes .
You have to look .
You have to be a little adventuresome , and I do n't think you 'll be disappointed .
I have n't been , " he said .

This artist ’s conception shows the dwarf planet Eris , also known as 2003UB313 , at the lonely outer fringes of our solar system .
Our Sun can be seen in the distance .
Eris is rather larger than Pluto and about three times farther away from the Sun .
It was first spotted in 2005 ( Image : R Hurt ( SSC / Caltech ) / JPL - Caltech / NASA )
These three panels show the first detection of the faint distant object dubbed “ Sedna ” .
Imaged over three hours , Sedna was identified by the slight shift in position noted in these three pictures taken at different times .
Later observations , at longer time intervals , provided the information necessary to deduce the nature of Sedna ’s 10,500 year orbit around the Sun ( Image : Caltech / NASA )

If we know enough to say the solar system is a filigree construction , we might reasonably assume we know where all its bits are .
But lurking in the solar system ’s dark recesses , rumour has it , is an unsighted world – Planet X , a frozen body perhaps as large as Mars , or even Earth .
Planet X would be the most significant addition to the solar system since the discovery of Pluto , the now notorious non-planet , in 1930 .
When the International Astronomical Union voted to downgrade Pluto to dwarf planet status in 2006 , they established three criteria for a fully blown planet in our solar system : it must …
A recent newspaper headline asked a question that ’s presently on the minds of many Americans : “ How long will the economic plunge go on ? ” Depending on the person answering the question , one might among other things hear “ when taxes are reduced ” or “ when housing recovers . ”
Both answers are surely appealing , but then it ’s also true that the U.S. economy has boomed with tax rates much higher than those at present , not to mention that even in its weakened state , prices today point to a housing market better than the one Americans experienced when this decade began .
Perhaps a better question to ask might be what the federal government is doing right now to make the economy worse , or what the government could stop doing so that the economy starts growing again .
In this case , the answers to our present economic difficulties are many .
At first blush it should be said that economies grow when the ideas of entrepreneurs are matched with capital .
Joseph Schumpeter wrote that entrepreneurs “ disrupt ” , but in order for them to do so they must first have access to existing economic assets in order to render them more productive .
When we consider the above , it ’s fair to say that the federal government ’s present proclivity to bail out anything and everything is anti-entrepreneur .
Indeed , it is when companies are allowed to fail that the intrepid among us are able to snap up human and physical assets on the cheap in order to deploy them more profitably .
So the first positive step from our federal minders would be for them to let markets reward the winners , all the while allowing the failed commercial combinations to go out of business .
Outgoing Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson seems to reinvent the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) on a daily basis , but one of his foremost desires remains a reflation of sagging banks .
In this instance he would like them to issue more credit cards so that individuals start consuming again .
This sounds intriguing at first glance , but then economies never lack consumption so long as there is production .
Bringing the entrepreneur into the equation once again , if TARP is tied to aiding the flagging consumer , eager new business entrants will suffer on the margin for capital being consumed rather than loaned to them with future growth in mind .
On the housing front , there ’s seemingly a bipartisan consensus among economists that a healthy housing market is the path to our economic resurgence .
The thinking here is backwards .
A vibrant housing market does n’t so much grow the economy as it ’s the consumptive result of an otherwise productive commercial setting .
Simply put , strong property markets in New York City and San Francisco are n’t the driver of either economy ; instead the housing markets in both are the fortunate result of robust economic activity in both cities .
So when the federal government seeks to use monies taxed or raised from the private sector in order to reduce mortgage rates and mortgage payments , it is in fact authoring our economy ’s continued decline .
This is surely the case if we yet again put the entrepreneur at the center of any presumed economic reawakening .
To the extent that the government is reorienting capital away from the innovative sector , there is surely a smaller pool of capital available for innovators to bid for .
But perhaps the most paralyzing governmental activities when it comes to future growth are the efforts being made by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to ease what many deem a “ credit crunch . ”
When markets tighten with regard to credit , this is an essential market signal telling sidelined investors that returns will be high for the investor willing to take big risks .
In the above sense , start - ups in Newark ( NJ ) and East St. Louis regularly face tight credit conditions , but at the same time courageous investors are frequently rewarded for taking those risks .
To the extent that rates of interest are presently high even for what many would consider safe investments , it ’s essential that the rate signals be true as a way of attracting the very capital and growth that will eventually bring borrowing rates down once again .
While difficult credit conditions right now might paint a bleak picture for entrepreneurs , even worse for the latter is the process whereby the federal government blurs the price of credit , and in doing , drives investors away altogether .
Capitalism is in the end reliant on the efficient deployment of capital , and when the blunt hand of government distorts this process , the certain result is less capital for all manner of new business entrants .
Schumpeter ultimately made plain that without access to capital , the entrepreneur “ cannot become an entrepreneur . ”
And so as long as the federal government expropriates capital while distorting the market for same , the agents of growth eager to divert down - and - out assets to higher uses will lie in wait .
In short , the answer to these difficult times is n’t more government , but instead a humble government that simply allows producers to produce .
I was just pointed to this wonderful essay by Nassim Nicholas Taleb , author of The Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness .
First Quadrant : Simple binary decisions , in Mediocristan : Statistics does wonders .
These situations are , unfortunately , more common in academia , laboratories , and games than real life — what I call the “ ludic fallacy ” .
In other words , these are the situations in casinos , games , dice , and we tend to study them because we are successful in modeling them .
– Edge : THE FOURTH QUADRANT : A MAP OF THE LIMITS OF STATISTICS By Nassim Nicholas Taleb
It ’s not the only ludic fallacy I can think of .
Recently I had a discussion with a management and leadership consultant , and we were discussing the generational characteristics of Millenials versus Gen X in the workforce , and we were talking about how a gamer mentality may have affected the way Gen Y behaves in the workplace : more likely to follow the rules , more likely to work in teams , more needful of reassurance , less creative and risk - taking , less likely to see the full scope of irreversible consequences of a choice , and less likely to see things in shades of gray .
In a way , these sound like thinking trained by games .
I ’ve talked in the past about whether games are , because of their inherently mathematical nature , limited in conveying certain types of information .
But I think it is also worth asking whether the scope of their models is effectively misleading , or even actively lying , about how the world works .
In Taleb ’s books , the bogeyman is the extremely rare event with a high impact , which he calls a black swan .
These are historically visible , but exist on timeframes long enough that we consider them arbitrarily rare : essentially , a non-event in our planning .
Yet they also have a highly disproportionate effect on the environment in which they occur .
In the article he offers this example :
There is a measure called Kurtosis that indicates departure from “ Normality ” .
It is very , very unstable and marred with huge sampling error : 70 - 90 % of the Kurtosis in Oil , SP500 , Silver , UK interest rates , Nikkei , US deposit rates , sugar , and the dollar / yet currency rate come from 1 day in the past 40 years …
This means that no sample will ever deliver the true variance .
I am reminded of an article I read recently about the San Diego river , which is an “ upside - down ” underground river almost all of the time .
It runs through a beautiful valley in San Diego — or would , except that there is no sign of water .
But the Mission Valley area is still in a 100 - year flood plain , and we silly humans built a mall there and a whole bunch of hotels .
It ’s on record that the flooding once reached the steps of the mission — which is on a hill above the valley ( by Qualcomm Stadium ) .
It ’s been 92 years since that flood .
Are we worried yet ?
Humans have mental trouble with a lot of aspects of statistics .
One of the commonest ones mentioned is that people tend to extrapolate linearly , not exponentially , so out gut instincts on rates of change are typically wrong .
Core to Taleb ’s reasoning is the notion that we can live more safe and secure lives by being incredibly pessimistic and always planning for the absolute worst .
By always making decisions based on the potential downside , rather than the potential upside , you end up with a far more conservative , but also more successful investment portfolio over the long run , whereas people who make decisions based on upside end up at a very high risk of losing everything in a dramatic day .
Games have characteristic difficulty ramps that have little to do with real - world statistical distributions .
For example , we are most familiar with linear curves , Gaussian and Poisson distributions , exponential curves , and the new modern classic , the punctuated curve .
This last one is the difficulty curve of a typical game these days , which rises linearly or exponentially to a peak , then falls back somewhat , then rises again , in order to provide an extra challenge at a boss , followed by a breather .
It is , of course , also the classic graph of tension in a novel or other form of dramatic writing .
What would a game with true black swans look like ?
It would throw something unpredictable and monstrous at you .
Well , why could n’t Tetris occasionally drop a monster block ?
Just one time in a thousand .
Why could n’t Fallout 3 occasionally deliver a randomly rolled instantly fatal death blow ?
Because it ’s not fair ! ”
“ Because it would make the game less fun ” ?
Perhaps , but the game might more accurately be reflecting reality , and thereby teaching better strategies .
In fact , we have seen this in action — in early Everquest , there were high level mobs that were aggressive and roamed the newbie areas .
They slaughtered newbs who simply had no ability to fight back .
Successful players during this period learned to be conservative in terms of how they moved around the zone .
And it may be that the reason why multiplayer PvP games always come back up as an idea is their sheer unpredictability .
Other humans are pretty good at providing black swan events , as UO demonstrated over and over again , and as EVE and Shadowbane continue to demonstrate today .
In light of today ’s Pew report in which we learned that more adults game than do n’t , it ’s worth asking what other lessons games are teaching .
Games have relatively finite palettes , because they exist on the basis of providing complete models — even if they are not NP - complete in the strict sense .
They do n’t tend to surprise , but rather reveal the expected , in many ways , because that is what signals to the player that they are mastering the problems presented .
I have mentioned before that one of the possible great strengths of games is that they can present complex problems as being amenable to analysis .
… games are by definition tractable .
They teach you to chunk up , to chop apart , to disentangle .
Perhaps this is where games can most change society : a way to look at the problems so that we no longer throw up our hands … — Games for Change , closing address
But when we look at that list from the top , about Millenial workplace attitudes , it ’s hard not to draw the analogy to a generation raised in a system where there are always rules , always correct answers , where you geta pat on the head every time you do something right , and curves are always easily projected .
[ Edit : it was pointed out that all this sounds like I am slamming Millenials ; in fact , I did write a whole book about how good games are as teaching tools , so let me point out the clear benefits of gamist thinking as reflected in Millenials : team - oriented practices , clear goal orientations , high self - confidence , a firm belief that things are solvable , a lack of the cynicism and skepticism common to GenX … it ’s not all bad ! ]
Rather than just bemoan this , I ’ll instead issue the challenge : what is the fun game that features black swans , phase transitions , and the catastrophic 100 - year flood ?
How do you sculpt a system that does this without chasing away the newbies ?
Because it is they , above all , who need to know that their job and bank are far from being institutions — a lesson everyone is learning at a rapid pace these days ; that yes , even something like the Fashion Valley Mall can end up underwater .
That would be turning a feature of games against themselves , and making the medium — and our players — more robust .

Writing this column only really scares me because I wonder whether everything else in the media is as shamelessly , venally , manipulatively , one - sidedly , selectively reported on as the things I know about .
I ’m not going to go on about MMR again .
But this week the reality editing was truly without comparison .
On Tuesday , the Telegraph , the Independent , the Mirror , the Express , the Mail , and the Metro all reported that a coroner was hearing the case of a toddler who died after receiving the MMR vaccine , which the parents blame for their loss .
“ Toddler ‘ died after MMR jab ’ ” ( Metro ) , “ ‘ Healthy ’ baby died after MMR jab ” ( Independent ) , you know the headlines by now .
I would n’t want you to think the MMR story had died , just because a few kids have died of measles .
On Thursday , the coroner announced his verdict : that the vaccine played no part in this child ’s death .
So far , of the papers above , only the Telegraph have had the decency to cover the outcome .
The Independent , the Mirror , the Express , the Mail , and the Metro have all decided that their readers are better off not knowing .
Compare here and here .
Tick , tock .
Does it stop there ?
No .
Moron amateur physicians have long enjoyed speculating that MMR and other vaccinations are somehow “ harmful to the immune system ” – whatever that means – and responsible for the rise in conditions like asthma and hay fever .
Doubtless they must have been waiting some time for evidence to appear , either supporting or refuting their claim .
This month a significant paper was published by Hviid and Melbye in the December 1 issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology .
They examined the experiences of 871,234 childre in a Danish birth cohort , comparing asthma in those who had MMR against those who did n’t .
MMR - vaccinated children were massively and significantly less often hospitalised with an asthma diagnosis , and used fewer courses of anti-asthma medication than unvaccinated children .
This “ protective ” effect of the MMR vaccine was more pronounced for hospitalisations with severe asthma diagnoses .
Those results are n’t just incompatible with an increased risk of asthma following MMR vaccination , they actually support the hypothesis that MMR vaccination is associated with a reduced risk of asthma in young children .
Tick , tock .
And most astonishing of all is the tale of the “ the Uhlmann paper “ , or the “ O’leary paper ” ( journalists were often careful not to mention that Andrew Wakefield was a co-author , I ’ve no idea why ) : this came out in 2002 and claimed to have found evidence of vaccine measles virus in tissue samples from children with autism and bowel problems , to massive media acclaim .
As I ’ve said previously , two similar papers , by Afzal et al and D’Souza et al , in 2006 found negative results on almost the same question , and were unanimously ignored by the media ( even though D’Souza actively went out of their way to show how O’Leary et al got false positives ) .
Stephen Bustin is Professor of Molecular Science at Barts and the London .
He examined the O’Leary lab for the court case against MMR , as an expert witness for the drug company defendants ( look how I was nice and told you that , if you ’re a moron , you ’ll use it to allow yourself to cheerily ignore everything he found ) .
The case collapsed , and he was unable to discuss his findings .
Then he was called to give evidence in the american “ autism omnibus ” case against the vaccine .
The anti-vaccine movement did their best to prevent this .
They knew what he had found : it appears to be incontrovertible evidence that the lab was detecting false positives .
Now Bustin has finally been able to write about what he found in O’Leary ’s lab , on this crucial paper from 2002 .
He published this month .
Nobody who covered the original O’leary paper has written about it .
Not a soul will .
Measles cases are rising .
Middle class parents are not to blame , even if they do lack rhetorical panache when you try and have a discussion with them about it : they have been systematically and vigorously misled by the media , the people with access to all the information , who still choose , collectively , between themselves , so robustly that it might almost be a conspiracy , to give you only half the facts .
Today , I have merely given you some small part of the other half , and next week I will move on : but know that nobody else has .

Post it in the comments below .
Caroline Kennedy last night withdrew from consideration to replace Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton – just two months after she rocked the New York political landscape by throwing her hat in the ring , The Post has learned .
“ I informed Governor Paterson today that for personal reasons I am withdrawing my name from consideration for the United States Senate , ” Kennedy said in a statement released hours after the Post first broke the story .
Kennedy ’s move reshuffled the deck of contenders for Gov. Paterson , who will chose her replacement .
The seat officially became vacant after Clinton was confirmed nearly unanimously by the Senate as secretary of state yesterday .
State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , who has polled higher than Kennedy in public - opinion surveys , was seen as rising on the list of possible replacements .
Kennedy had been the apparent front - runner , with a slew of high - profile backers – including Mayor Bloomberg and , by some accounts , President Obama – and had been pushed strongly by her uncle , Sen .
Ted Kennedy , sources said .
Late last night , The Associated Press reported that Kennedy had renewed “ determination ” to get the seat , after “ wavering ” on whether she should take on a new job when her uncle , who ’s battling brain cancer , suffered a seizure shortly after Obama ’s inauguration .
But no member of Kennedy ’s team issued an official statement saying what her plans were , and aides could n’t be reached for comment .
Paterson has said he is not yet sure who New York ’s new senator will be , but he plans to announce his decision by this weekend .
The press conference at which he ’ll name his pick is expected Saturday in Albany .
On Tuesday , shortly after Obama was inaugurated , Paterson acknowledged for the first time he is considering Cuomo for the slot .
The attorney general has not said whether he ’s interested in the job , but has not tamped down speculation that he ’s making a play for it .
Kennedy ’s decision caught even some close to her by surprise , and there were conflicting versions last night of what transpired .
Sources close to Kennedy said she had decided to bow out for “ personal ” reasons .
But others said she made her move after it became clear Paterson was n’t going to pick her for the seat .
Several sources said the governor , who has sole power to replace Clinton , was unimpressed with the daughter of John F. Kennedy in media interviews and in private sessions with various officials .
Two sources said Paterson had conveyed to Kennedy on Tuesday that she was n’t likely to get picked .
Kennedy also was at Obama ’s inauguration , but kept a low profile and was barely seen .
Paterson has offered conflicting comments about where he stands in the process – sometimes suggesting that he had made up his mind , sometimes that he had n’t .
Several Democratic sources came away from the inauguration believing he was leaning toward Kennedy and she was his expected pick .
Kennedy ’s entrance into the bidding for Clinton ’s seat was intended to have the effect of clearing the field , forcing other contenders to see her as the inevitable choice for the seat once held by her uncle , Robert F. Kennedy .
Bloomberg privately backed her and publicly praised her abilities .
His top deputy , Kevin Sheekey , worked the phones aggressively on Kennedy ’s behalf , and set her up with powerhouse consulting firm KnickerbockerSKD .
But the rollout of her Senate bid received stiff criticism , as she ducked press questions during her first trip upstate and fared poorly in her initial round of media interviews .
Several critics said the 51 - year - old novice politician lacked a clear rationale for her candidacy .
The decision leaves a crowded field of about 15 people , mostly elected officials , vying to replace Clinton – including Cuomo , Rep. Steve Israel of Long Island , Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi , upstate Rep. Kirsten Gillibrand , Manhattan Rep. Carolyn Maloney and teachers union President Randi Weingarten .
Kennedy ’s brief foray into politics lasted less than two months , starting when she said shortly before Christmas she was interested in the seat .
She had campaigned aggressively for the new president in 2008 .
Her endorsement infuriated Clinton ’s loyalists .
Kennedy ’s relationship with Obama was cited often by her boosters as an added value to New York if she had been picked .
Several sources said Obama was pulling for Kennedy as the choice , and Kennedy herself said the president had been “ encouraging ” about her pursuit of the post .

I recently did a Googlebomb post over on the Google Public Policy Blog .
I ’ve talked about Googlebomb phenomenon before ( also see more Googlebomb background here ) .
Just as a reminder , a Googlebomb is a prank where a group of people on the web try to push someone else ’s site to rank for a query that it did n’t intend to ( and normally would n’t want to ) rank for .
Typically these queries tend to be unusual phrases such as “ talentless hack ” that do n’t really have any existing strong results .
Danny Sullivan asked a good question in this most recent round of coverage about Googlebombs :
Obama no longer ranks for “ failure ” on Google .
The White House has n’t changed anything .
The link data that Google has been using to rank the Bush page — data inherited by Obama ’s page — has n’t changed .
So the Googlebomb fix for this that has n’t worked since earlier this month just happens to kick in a few hours after I post this article ?
That ’s going to kick off another round of questioning over how “ automated ” that fix really is …
I wanted to address that question .
The short answer is that we do two different things — both of them algorithmic — to handle Googlebombs : detect Googlebombs and then mitigate their impact .
The second algorithm ( mitigating the impact of Googlebombs ) is always running in our productionized systems .
The first algorithm ( detecting Googlebombs ) has to process our entire web index , so in most typical cases we tend not to run that algorithm every single time we crawl new web data .
I think that during 2008 we re-ran the Googlebomb detection algorithm 5 - 6 times , for example .
You can think of it like this :
The defusing algorithm is running all the time , but the algorithm to detect Googlebombs is only run occasionally .
We re-ran our algorithm last week and it detected both the [ failure ] and the [ cheerful achievement ]
Googlebombs , so our system now minimizes the impact of those Googlebombs .
Instead of a whitehouse.gov url , you now see discussion and commentary about those queries .
Israel prepares to escalate its war on Gaza
By Peter Symonds
12 January 2009
As the Palestinian death toll climbed to 869 on Sunday , the Israeli military was poised to launch a major escalation of its one - sided war against Gaza .
The third phase — following the aerial bombardment and the initial ground invasion — involves an all - out assault on the densely populated Gaza City , home to more than 400,000 people .
Early yesterday morning , the Israeli army advanced into Gaza City from three sides .
Fierce fighting erupted in the southwestern district of Sheik al - Ajlin as Israeli troops , backed by tanks and helicopter gunships , battled Hamas militiamen armed with rifles and mortars .
Israeli forces withdrew after several hours of what appeared to be a probing operation in preparation for a full - scale attack on the city .
The fighting sent a new flood of people fleeing their homes in search of refuge .
The Israeli military dropped leaflets on Saturday over Gaza City and Rafah warning that its forces would escalate operations in the Gaza Strip and to stay away from Hamas .
But in Gaza , there is no safe place to go .
Residential blocks , shelters and mosques have all been targetted .
On January 6 , Israeli shells killed at least 40 people , including women and children , sheltering in a UN - run refuge at the al - Fakhora school .
Further Israeli atrocities took place during the weekend .
On Saturday , at least seven members of the Abed Rabbo clan were killed when their grocery store in a village just east of the Jabaliya refugee camp was shelled .
Ambulance driver Zaid Barquouni told the Los Angeles Times that neighbours told him that the shelling had come from an Israeli tank several blocks away .
According to the Associated Press , four members of one family died when a tank shell hit their home near Gaza City .
By midday yesterday , at least 20 people had been killed .
As the death toll climbed over 860 , health authorities in Gaza reported that the victims included 270 children , 93 women and 12 paramedics .
The World Health Organisation put the casualties among medical staff even higher — at 21 killed , 30 injured — and the number of ambulances hit by Israeli fire at 11 .
Fresh allegations surfaced over the weekend of the Israeli military 's use of white phosphorus in breach of international humanitarian law .
Palestinian medics told the BBC that phosphorus shells had been fired at Khouza , killing a woman and injuring at least 60 people .
" These people were burned over their bodies in a way that can only be caused by white phosphorus , " Dr Yousef Abu Rish said .
The US - based Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) issued a statement on Saturday condemning the Israeli military 's use of white phosphorus as illegal .
" White phosphorus can burn down houses and cause horrific burns when it touches the skin , " senior HRW analyst Marc Garlasco said .
" Israel should not use it in Gaza 's densely populated areas . "
While Israeli authorities deny breaking international law , the use of white phosphorus is only permitted under international law as a smokescreen , not as a weapon of war or in civilian areas .
In the crowded conditions of Gaza , death and injuries are all but inevitable .
As the HRW statement pointed out , the danger has been greatly amplified by the technique of air - bursting shells that send out scores of phosphorus wafers over wide areas .
The humanitarian crisis in the besieged Gaza Strip is worsening .
The UN estimates that two thirds of the 1.5 million people are without electricity and half have no running water .
The British - based Independent pointed out that a three - hour pause in the fighting on Saturday was insufficient to allow aid groups to distribute food , and medics to reach casualties .
Salam Kanaan of Save the Children said that in previous lulls the agency had reached just 9,500 people out of the 150,000 people it served .
Conditions in hospitals are appalling .
At Shifa hospital , Gaza 's largest , about 70 patients in the intensive care unit only survive because of four electricity generators .
The hospital itself has been without power for the past seven days because Gaza 's only power plant has stopped functioning due to the lack of fuel .
" How terrible it would be if our patients survive the attacks and then die because of the lack of electricity , " the hospital 's director , Dr Hassan Khalaf , told the Independent .
Israel bluntly rejected last Friday 's UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire , declaring it to be " unworkable " because it failed to meet Israeli demands to seal the border between Egypt and Gaza and prevent the firing of rockets into Israeli territory .
Prior to a cabinet meeting yesterday , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert declared that Israel was nearing its goals .
What was under discussion , however , was not an end to the war , but its further escalation .
The only hesitation in launching " phase three " of the operation — an assault on Gaza City — is the potential for heavy Israeli military casualties in street fighting , which could provoke opposition in Israel .
The Israeli death toll since December 27 is just 13 — nine soldiers and four civilians .
Any Israeli invasion of Gaza City would require the deployment of tens of thousands of reservists who were called up for active service in the first days of the war .
In another indication that troops will be sent into Gaza City , the Haaretz newspaper reported yesterday that Israeli reservists began entering Gaza for the first time .
Israel 's escalation is being encouraged by the support of the US as well as the complicity of the European powers and the venal Middle Eastern regimes .
In a vote last Friday , the US House of Representatives passed a motion by 390 to 5 expressing " vigorous support and unwavering commitment " for Israel and repeating the lie that Israel was waging a war of " self - defence " .
A similar motion previously passed the Senate unanimously .
Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on countries around the world to " lay blame both for breaking the ‘ calm ' and for subsequent civilian casualties in Gaza precisely where blame belongs , that is , on Hamas " .
Israel 's criminal war against the largely defenceless population of Gaza was , however , planned well in advance .
Hamas 's firing of rockets was the pretext for an offensive aimed at imposing Israeli control in Gaza and bolstering its strategic position throughout the Middle East .
The European powers and Middle Eastern regimes have supported talks being held in Egypt on a French - Egyptian plan for a ceasefire .
Like the US , the proposal implicitly blames Hamas for the war and ensures that all of Israel 's demands are met , for an end to rocket attacks and to cross - border smuggling via Egypt .
Israel has called for the presence of international monitors along the border , which Egypt to date has refused .
If talks fail , Israeli officials told the New York Times that it was likely that the " third phase " of the war would begin .
As well as occupying Gaza City , Israeli troops would seize a strip of land at least 500 metres wide inside Egypt — an act of war that threatens a wider conflict .
Israeli war planes have been intensively bombing the border in a bid to destroy cross - border tunnels and , in doing so , frequently infringing Egyptian air space .
Yesterday , Israeli air strikes near the Rafah border crossing wounded three Egyptian policemen , two seriously , as well as two children .
Sections of the political and military establishment are pressing for an even more aggressive approach to stamp Israeli control over Gaza .
Retired general Avigdor BenGal told the Times : " We need to conquer the Gaza Strip and put the Hamas military and political leaders on a French ship to leave Gaza for good , just as we did with [ former Palestinian leader Yasser ] Arafat in Beirut in 1982 .
We 've already conquered a bigger Arab city than Gaza [ namely , Beirut ] , our army is trained and fit for the mission .
The politicians should give the order . "
Ominously , unnamed Israeli officials have hinted to the media that the current military offensive potentially has a planned " phase four " — the full reoccupation of Gaza and the toppling of the Hamas regime .
CHEYENNE , Wyoming ( CNN ) --
While Washington gears up for Inauguration Day , Republicans in Wyoming are taking stock of their future and assessing Barack Obama .
From left : Janet Anderson , Dicky Shanor , Cindy Hill , Jack Mueller , Ted Mueller are cautious about Barack Obama .
" I 'm afraid that so much of the responsibility of individuals is being transferred to Washington , " says Jack Mueller , a 67 - year - old retired state government worker .
" Big Brother is going to be telling us what to do over and over and over again . "
Mueller and a handful of other Republicans sit in the coffee shop of the historic Plains Hotel on this windy January morning , chatting about the incoming administration and their mixed feelings .
These are back - to - basic Republicans .
They want small government , strong national defense and an emphasis on individual liberties and accountability .
" I wish President [ - elect ] Obama well , but I do not wish him success in the things he is proposing , " says Ted Mueller , 57 , an insurance salesman .
Ted is not related to Jack , but they share concerns about what they see as a federal government on the brink of a huge expansion .
" I do n't want the federal government to give away our individual rights .
I do n't want them to take over our business .
I do n't want them to take over our religion . "

Janet Anderson , 57 , returned to Cheyenne after a career in the oil business in Texas .
She worries about the federal government bailing out businesses .
" The Obama administration is taking consequences out of our nation . "
She says , " If you go make a bad business decision and you lose your shirt , you just go to the government and get some money . "
Cindy
Hill is an assistant principal of a junior high school .
She is afraid the Obama administration will dismantle No Child Left Behind and worries that his administration will leave behind huge debt for her son 's generation .
" He 's only 20 years old -- and the decisions being made right now , the deficit and how were approaching solving problems -- are going to impact his generation significantly . " she says .
Only 33 percent of Wyoming 's voters cast their ballots for Obama , but they are concerned about the future of the Republican Party outside the state .
" We really need to decide to define our party and what we 're going to be in the future , " says 26 - year - old Dicky Shanor , a Cheyenne attorney .
" We need somebody on the federal level to step up and define us .
I do n't know who that 's going to be . "
" It 'd be great if we could have another leader like Ronald Reagan -- that strength of leadership , the strength of character , " says Ted Mueller , " I do n't see it right now , but there 's always hope .
Somebody will rise up . "
These Wyoming Republicans share a respect for the office of the president , even if they have doubts about the man .
" As an American , obviously I want him to succeed .
He is my president , " says Jack Mueller .
" I hope that he will do well . "
" I truly hope that he succeeds .
You have to respect the office , I do n't care who 's in it , " says Janet Anderson .
" If Barack Obama earns my respect , I will respect the man . "

The Connex spokeswoman said trains were not running between Flinders Street and Elsternwick stations .
Passengers requiring stations before Elsternwick were advised to catch a route 67 tram from Swanston Street , she said .
Those wishing to travel further on the Sandringham line could catch Pakenham , Frankston or Cranbourne trains to Caulfield where buses will take passengers to Elsternwick .
The Connex spokeswoman said railway track metal expanding in the heat had caused some cancellations , with broken air conditioning units also hitting services as trains would not run if the cooling was n't working .
Morning commuters were warned to check again tomorrow for cancellations as Melbourne braces for an uncomfortable night with a maximum of 39 degrees tomorrow before a cool change in the afternoon .
You know what we just noticed ?
The ' Bernie Madoff Robs Everyone and Alienates His Family ' story is kind of similar to that of the Bluth family from the brilliant - but - canceled Arrested Development .
Let 's do a who 's - who comparison !
Bernie Madoff : Clearly the elder Madoff is George Bluth , Sr. , the patriarch of a once - proud family that now lies in tatters because of his highly illegal wheelings and dealings .
Of course in Madoff 's case it was just a sad old Ponzi scheme , whereas with George it was lots and lots of fraud and lying and maybe selling of things to the Iraqis .
And now Madoff is on house arrest in his fancy apartment just like George was !
Ruth Madoff :
Not exactly a drunken , scathing Lucille Bluth type , Ruth is actually maybe more like Dr. Tobias Funke , who frequently has funny ideas about what he wants to do for work ( Blue Man Group ! ) .
Because , you know , Ruth does wacky things like writing kosher cookbooks !
Plus , you can totally tell that she 's a never - nude .
The Sons , Mark and Andrew Madoff :
These fellas probably ( hopefully ) have a little Buster , Gob , and Lindsay in them , but right now they mostly seem Michael - esque .
Frustrated and angry with their crime - doing father , they have chosen to basically ignore any needs he might have , like a bail bond .
Heck they even turned their guilty papa in to the police which — gasp !— also happened on the show .
We hope that a Steve Holt , a Kitty Sanchez , and a Lucille Austero are all lurking in the shadows , waiting to spice up the Madoff story even more .
The legal battle between IBM and Apple over the hiring of Mark Papermaster has come to an end , as Papermaster has been cleared to begin work at Apple starting on April 24 , 2009 .
The legal dispute between the two tech heavyweights began this past October when Apple hired away Papermaster from IBM , where he was an important executive and top manager .
Apple initially hired Papermaster to take over its iPod and iPhone division , a position which opened up after Tony Fadell , also known as the father of the iPod , left the company to spend more time with his family .
Others have reported , though , that Fadell left as a result of key differences regarding the initial design and future direction of the iPhone .
In any event , IBM did n't take too kindly to Apple poaching some of its top talent , and commenced litigation to prevent Papermaster from leaving and working for Apple .
Papermaster was well - known and respected as a server expert and chip guru , and IBM asserted that in his position as a top executive and manager , Papermaster was privy to a significant amount of confidential and proprietary information about IBM 's processors and server technology .
As such , IBM was fearful that Papermaster would help Apple develop rival products , and that the trade secrets Papermaster acquired as a high level employee at I.B.M would necessarily come into play in his role as head of Apple ’s iPod and iPhone division .
In defense of its stance , IBM noted that Papermaster was subject to a covenant not to compete agreement that he signed as part of his contract with IBM .
The covenant not to compete agreement specifically forbade Papermaster from working at a competing company for one full year after leaving IBM .
Papermaster soon countersued IBM , and counter - claimed that Apple was in no way a direct competitor to IBM , and that under IBM 's broad view of what constitutes a competitor , Papermaster would effectively be barred from working at any technology company at all .
In disputing IBM 's claims , Papermaster asserted that he would not disclose any proprietary information about IBM 's processors and server technology , and noted that he was primarily hired by Apple for his managerial skills than for his technological expertise .
Nevertheless , a court ruled in IBM 's favor , and held that Papermaster working for Apple might , in fact , cause IBM irreparable harm , and issued a preliminary injunction preventing him from working at Apple .
The ruling stated in part ,
It is likely that Mr. Papermaster inevitably will draw upon his experience and expertise in microprocessors and the ‘ Power ’ architecture , which he gained from his many years at IBM , and which Apple found so impressive , to make sure that the iPod and iPhone are fitted with the best possible microprocessor technology and at a lower cost .
Appreciating the fact that Papermaster was left in a position where he was unable to work anywhere , the court put the case on the fast track , with a trial scheduled to begin in February of 2009 .
IBM and Apple , however , recently settled their dispute out of court , and in a press release issued today , Apple announced that Papermaster would begin work at Apple on April 24th .
Papermaster will head up Apple ’s iPod and iPhone hardware engineering teams , and his official title is " senior vice president of Devices Hardware Engineering " , a position that reports directly to Steve Jobs .
As part of the settlement between Apple and IBM , Papermaster will have to sign a sworn affidavit twice in 2009 where he represents that he has not disclosed any proprietary information about IBM to Apple .

According to a Gallup Poll released yesterday that asked Republicans and Republican - leaning independents who they wanted to see nominated for president in 2012 , the number one pick was Sarah Palin .
Just thinking about Palin as president makes my eyes wobble .
Of course , such polls are meaningless — polls just a year ago showed that most Republicans wanted Rudy Giuliani to be their nominee , but he could n’t even win a single state in the primaries .
For further analysis .
George W. BUSH : One of the major theaters against al Qaeda turns out to have been Iraq .
This is where al Qaeda said they were going to take their stand .
This is where al Qaeda was hoping to take —
Martha RADDATZ : But not until after the U.S. invaded .
BUSH : Yeah , that ’s right .
So what ?
President Bush ’s interview on ABC News in Baghdad , December 15 .
Sgt. Evan Vela Carnahan , 25 , has served roughly one year of a ten - year sentence at the Ft. Leavenworth Military Prison .
In November 2007 , he was convicted of murdering an Iraqi civilian named Genei Nasir Khudair al - Janabi , whom he killed with a single shot to the head from a 9 mm sidearm .
The killing took place just a few hundred feet from Janabi ’s home , which is located in a Sunni - dominated neighborhood in Baghdad near Iskandariyah in a region sometimes called the “ Triangle of Death . ”
Evan admits that he killed Janabi in compliance with a direct order issued by his squad leader .
The squad leader — who was acquitted of a murder charge — admits that he gave the order , and stated under oath that he would have killed Janabi himself except for the fact that Evan was the one with the pistol in his hand .
During the past six years , the Bush Regime has followed an inverted Nuremberg formula — call it the “ Abu Ghraib Doctrine ” — under which the legal accountability for war crimes resides only with those at the bottom of the chain of command .
To palliate public opinion in Iraq , a handful of low - ranking soldiers were sent to prison after the Abu Ghraib atrocities were made public .
Evan Carnahan was sent to prison for much the same reason :
The killing of Janabi , which took place on May 11 , 2007 , came just as the much - heralded “ surge ” began , a program in which U.S. occupation commanders pacified the Sunni Triangle by bribing the leaders of the Sunni insurgency .
Curtis Carnahan , Evan ’s father ( and a close personal friend of mine from High School ) , told Pro Libertate that “ the Iraqi Human Rights Minister was present at every session of Evan ’s military trial , which the Army insisted on holding in Baghdad … .
The trial did n’t begin until November [ of 2007 ] , after Evan ’s unit had returned to Alaska .
They could have brought Evan back to the United States , and we repeatedly filed motions to have the trial moved stateside .
Instead , the Army , at great unnecessary expense , held the trial in Iraq , under the constant scrutiny of Iraqi officials .
It ’s clear to me that Evan was being used as a scapegoat , as a political sacrifice , in order to appease Iraqi government officials . ”
Evan was part of a five - man sniper team that had implanted itself in a “ hide ” behind an earthen berm .
Over the previous four days the team had been able to sleep no more than 3 — 4 hours during each 24 - hour cycle , and what sleep they had was divided into fifteen - minute segments .
This was typical of the 56 missions Evan ’s team had carried out under Staff Sergeant Michael A. Hensley , an Expert Marksman tasked to increase the “ kill rate ” of suspected “ insurgents ” in the area .
Hensley — described in an Esquire story as a twitchy , tattooed collection of eccentric mannerisms and nihilistic opinions — was one of the most proficient snipers in the U.S. Army , a “ natural - born killer . ”
Evan was adopted by Curtis ( who runs a printing business in eastern Idaho ) as a child .
The Army insists on calling him Sgt. Vela because of a clerical matter involving his Social Security Card .
He was , by all accounts , an exemplary soldier who did not check his conscience at the door when he left for combat .
Before shipping out for Iraq , Evan expressed his ambivalence about killing Iraqis to his LDS ( Mormon ) Bishop .
The spiritual counsel he received , as encapsulated in a videotape prepared by church authorities , was that he would not be held accountable by God for shedding the blood of Iraqis as long as he went to war “ in a spirit of love . ”
This is anodyne advice of no practical or moral value in a war of aggression in which every U.S. soldier who kills in self - defense is actually committing murder .
Since the U.S. government had no moral right or legal authority to invade Iraq , U.S. military personnel in that country are the equivalent of robbers suddenly confronted by an armed homeowner :
A robber in that situation has no right to defend himself by force .
This is n’t to say that every American serviceman in Iraq intended to behave like an armed robber , or that they deserve to be killed .
It is to say that they should n’t have been sent there in the first place , and that justice requires not only that we totally withdraw from Iraq but also prosecute and punish of those responsible for planning and ordering the invasion .
Evan ’s case offers a particularly poignant example of the multi-layered injustices that have blossomed from the Bushling ’s unnecessary war .
Early on the morning of May 11 , Evan — who had been assigned guard duty , but ( given his human limitations ) inevitably found himself dozing off — awoke to find himself staring into the startled face of Genei al - Janabi , who had stumbled onto the sniper squad ’s “ hide ” on his way to fetch water .
The squad soon awoke , and Janabi was taken prisoner .
Shortly thereafter , Janabi ’s teenage son materialized and was likewise taken into custody .
Hensley now confronted a predicament .
His squad had been sent to ferret out suspected insurgents in what was , at the time , a very active battle zone .
Their position had been compromised , and the elder Janabi , understandably terrified , began to thrash and cry out for help .
Helmsley decided to release the son .
As soon as the teenager had departed , Hensley turned to Evan and ordered him to kill Janabi .
Evan did as he was ordered .
Immediately thereafter , Hensley ordered the squad to plant an AK - 47 on Janabi ’s dead body .
He also began to concoct cover story ; this involved multiple spurious radio calls to Lt. Matthew Didier at the squad ’s patrol base describing concerns about a suspected insurgent and requesting permission to kill him .
The killing of Janabi , Hensley later explained , “ is legitimate to me ; it ’s not legitimate to the law .
So I [ had ] two choices .
I can do something illegal , like put a gun on him , or I can go to jail for murder .
I do n’t know where you stand ethically on all of that , but that is what it is .
And if doing something that is a little dishonest keeps me and my men from going to jail one day , I am going to be a little dishonest .
If the law causes my men to get killed , the law will be broken .
If lying prevents me from going to jail , I ’m going to lie . ”
Al - Janabi , Hensley insisted , had to die because he was “ making too much f*****g noise ” and thus imperiled the lives of his men .
As a field commander , Hensley decided that the Iraqi , who was in his own neighborhood , looking for water on his own property , “ had no right to be there , he was a bad guy , he deserved to die . ”
So he ordered Evan Carnahan to shoot the man in the head .
And Carnahan , trained by the military to obey reflexively , and taught by his church leaders that obedience to authority expunges the taint of criminal actions , pulled the trigger , believing that his action was legally sound and morally right .
After the Sunni Buy - Out — aka “ Surge ” — began , the shooting of Janabi became a local political controversy , and the Army sicced the Criminal Investigative Division on Hensley and his squad .
Hensley , whose conscience is as flexible as a Cirque du Soleil performer , brazened out the interrogation .
Evan broke down under questioning .
He was offered immunity to testify against Specialist Jorge Sandoval and S. Sgt. Hensley .
Both Sandoval and Hensley were acquitted of murder and convicted of lesser offenses .
Both of them were given sentences equivalent to time already served in pre-trial detention .
Despite his immunity agreement , Evan was brought to trial .
Hensley — who , having been acquitted of murder , had nothing to lose — testified on Evan ’s behalf .
He eagerly , perhaps even giddily , admitted to being the instigator of Janabi ’s death , describing Evan ’s role as merely that of carrying out what the soldier believed to be a lawful order .
Curtis Carnahan , who made three long , expensive trips to Baghdad for Evan ’s pre-trial hearings and criminal trial , told me that the eight - member trial panel who heard the case “ was hand - picked by General Rick Lynch , ” the appropriately surnamed commander of the 3rd Infantry Division , whom Carnahan describes as “ a smug , narcissistic son - of - a - bitch . ”
Lynch ’s priority at the time was to placate Iraqi officials .
This was necessary , in turn , to ensure the “ success ” of the “ Surge , ” which itself was intended to neutralize growing American antipathy toward the war .
Given all of these considerations , someone had to be fed to the wolves , and Evan happened to be the only suitable candidate .
A Father seeks justice : Curtis Carnahan ( right ) during one of his trips to Baghdad on behalf of his son , Evan .
According to Curtis , the Army had a file on Janabi suggesting that “ he was a bad guy .
And several people with detailed knowledge of the region have developed intelligence confirming that the al - Janabi tribe was either active in al - Qaeda , or collaborating with them . ”
Of course , just days after Janabi was killed , collaborating with suspected al - Qaeda operatives became official U.S. military policy in Iskandiriyah .
It ’s also worth recalling the exchange quoted in the epigram above , in which George W. Bush , when confronted with the charge that it was his invasion and occupation of Iraq that resulted in Iraq becoming infested with al - Qaeda , replied : “ So what ? ”
Bush infused those two syllables with his proprietary blend of bellicose ignorance and arrogant dismissiveness .
Yes , he was admitting , the invasion created a morass of guerilla violence and a breeding ground for terrorism where none previously existed — but that ’s not important .
The implicit question is :
If this is n’t important — if there were no WMDs , and the invasion actually enhanced the terrorist threat — why did the U.S. invade Iraq ?
An observation offered Curtis Carnahan is suggestive of an answer .
“ Everything I saw while I was over there suggests that they ’re not going to pull out , ” Curtis told me .
“ There was construction going on everywhere — more buildings , more concrete , more everything at Camps Victory and Liberty .
They ’re definitely settling in for a long haul . ”
This underscores the fact that the invasion and occupation of Iraq was pure military colonialism .
It was n’t intended to “ liberate ” a country long ruled by a U.S. - installed surrogate thug , much less to protect the United States and its inhabitants from any “ threat ” posed by that tiny , insignificant country .
The objective was always to seize control over Iraq and use it as a staging base to assert military and political control over the region ’s energy resources — an objective that will be followed irrespective of the new agreement with “ independent ” Iraq .
Curtis , as I mentioned earlier , is an old friend of mine ( he was , in fact , my vice president when I was president of the Madison High School Class of 1981 ) .
He sees the war in starkly different terms than I do , insisting that the correct approach is to “ cut off their heads and crush them — we should be acting like a conquering army , forcing them to submit to our will . ”
Like many other people I know , including many I love and respect , he does n’t appear troubled by the prospect of living under a government capable of exercising powers of the sort he describes .
But due to what his son has experienced , Curtis does have a better understanding of the incurable corruption that infects every element of the Regime that rules us .
To justify an act of murder , Hensley fixed the “ facts ” around his decision to justify the killing .
This was perfectly in harmony with the conduct of his Commander - in - Chief .
When that decision created a local public relations problem , the soldier who pulled the trigger was offered as a sacrifice to political expediency ; this , too , is perfectly in accord with Mr. Bush ’s priorities .
Among the clear lessons taught by this abhorrent case is this :
Those who understand and cherish individual liberty should never allow themselves to become the agents of another person ’s will .
Evan Carnahan is merely one of countless thousands of fundamentally decent Americans whose earnest patriotism led them to participate in a world - historic crime .
Unlike most of them , however , Evan is now in prison while those who used him to carry out that crime are free — and his only hope for freedom , at present , is an act of clemency from the War Criminal in the White House .
The Best of William Norman Grigg
Of all of our 28 prime ministers since Confederation , we really remember just two : John A. Macdonald and Pierre Elliott Trudeau .
This does n't mean that all the others ( actually , fewer than 28 in all because several served twice ) are forgotten .
Wilfrid Laurier will always be admired for his elegance and eloquence .
Mackenzie King always gets a high rating for leading Canada through the transition from an agricultural society to an urbanized , industrial one and for creating a modern civil service .
Lester Pearson will never be forgotten for his achievements in peacekeeping , with the Maple Leaf flag , and , far from least , for winning the Nobel Peace Prize .
Even if John Diefenbaker disappointed , a memory endures that he stirred up a somnolent country and dared to challenge it with a northern vision .
Macdonald and Trudeau , though , stand apart from the rest .
Both , in a certain sense , are still alive .
Both still stir emotions , of all kinds : admiration and anger , love and hate , respect and condemnation .
We are interested in both and feel strongly about both .
Each is that Canadian rarity – a hero .
Each is also , to quite a few Canadians , a villain ; Macdonald for executing Louis Riel , Trudeau for imposing the War Measures Act .
About Trudeau , the finest insight about him was that observation by authors Christina McCall and Stephen Clarkson : " He haunts us still . "
Of Macdonald , it could be said : " He taunts us still . "
Every good portrait of him captures the amused , sardonic look with which he gazes outward while calculating how to manipulate and seduce anyone watching into becoming a Conservative .
There are parallels between their careers .
Each lost just one election and then was returned to office at the first available opportunity by an electorate relieved to get their hero / villain back .
Neither could be fitted into the formula of a typical Canadian .
With Trudeau , this was more obvious :
He always seemed as if he would be happier talking to some incomprehensible European intellectual , or to a silent Buddhist monk than to any actual Canadian .
Macdonald broke an even more important Canadian rule .
He had no interest in pretending to be respectable and proper .
He not only drank but he did so openly and unapologetically , once putting down a heckler by saying – quite correctly – that voters preferred , " John A. drunk to George Brown sober . "
There were parallels in their policies .
The purpose of each was to build Canada .
For Trudeau , this meant patriation of the Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms , bilingualism and multiculturalism .
For Macdonald , this meant Confederation itself , and afterwards the national policy of high tariffs to foster manufacturing , creating the NorthWest Mounted Police ( today , the RCMP ) and , above all , his impossible dream of a transcontinental railway .
Besides building Canada , both were determined to save it .
Trudeau 's life - long mission was to ensure that Quebec did not leave Canada .
Macdonald 's equivalent was to make certain that Americans did not take over Canada , or – an equal threat as he saw it – that Canadians did not slip southward by reaching for cross - border free trade before Confederation had , in his phrase , " hardened from gristle into bone . "
Of the pair , time has actually been kinder to Macdonald than to Trudeau .
Both were widely loved in their day and the funerals of both were occasions for national mourning .
Trudeau , though , remains a controversial figure in contemporary terms while Macdonald stirs kindlier thoughts and a readiness now to revel in his humour and his humanity ( academic historians do tend to be censorious about him ) .

Macdonald 's birthday – the evidence is unclear whether it actually was on Jan. 10 or Jan.11 – will be celebrated this weekend in places as far apart as his hometown of Kingston and Vancouver .
After writing this piece I will go down to Hamilton to talk to a group now staging its third annual event , while a fellow biographer , Charlotte Gray , will be doing the same in Orillia .
Elsewhere , quite a few individuals across the country will , on the 10th or the 11th , raise a glass to Macdonald .
More of us ought to do the same for Trudeau ; except , of course , he drank very little .

Blackwater Guard in Secret Deal to Testify in Massacre Case Five others surrender to FBI on charges in 35 count indictment .
December 8 , 2008  --
One of the Blackwater guards involved in the shooting deaths of at least 14 Iraqi citizens has agreed to testify against five other guards as part of a secret plea deal negotiated last month but approved and filed last Thursday .
In a stunning admission of his own wrongdoing made public today , Jeremy Ridgeway , 35 , agreed to plead guilty to one count of manslaughter , attempt to commit murder and aiding and abetting .
The five other Blackwater guards surrendered to the FBI today in Salt Lake City , Utah to face charges in a 35 - count federal grand jury indictment announced by the Department of Justice in Washington , D.C.
Their arraignment has been set before District Judge Ricardo Urbina of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Jan. 6 , 2009 .
Click here to read the full indictment .
Justice officials revealed shocking new details of the attacks at a DOJ press conference today , which they said included shooting a grenade into a nearby girl 's school and the killing of an Iraqi man who has his hands up in the air .
All of the victims were unarmed and none were insurgents , officials said .
" Many were shot while inside civilian vehicles that were attempting to flee from the convoy , " said Jeffrey Taylor , the U.S. Attorney .
Taylor said the guards knew that they were not allowed to use suppressive fire , engage in offensive military action , or " exercise police powers . "
In documents filed in connection with his guilty plea , Ridgeway acknowledged killing at least one civilian , a female doctor , with " multiple rounds " into a vehicle .
Ridgeway , in the document , acknowledged the government evidence would prove he and the others " opened fire with automatic weapons and grenade launchers on unarmed civilians . "
He agreed none of the civilians " was an insurgent , and many were shot while inside of civilian vehicles that were attempting to flee . "
Ridgeway also admitted one victim was shot in his chest " while standing in the street with his hands up . "
Ridgeway also admitted to prosecutors " there was no attempt to provide reasonable warning " to the driver of a vehicle that was first targeted .
Prosecutors said the guards could face a mandatory 30 - year prison sentence if found guilty of the " unjustified shootings " of unarmed civilians with machine guns .
The guards told U.S. State Department agents they began to shoot because they were under fire from insurgents and felt their lives threatened .
Witnesses at the scene said there was no hostile fire .
The Blackwater company was not charged by the grand jury .
The five former guards indicted by the grand jury were Paul Slough , Dustin Heard , Evan Liberty , Nicholas Slatten and Donald Ball .
Outside the courthouse in Salt Lake City , lawyers for the men said they " were innocent and we 'll prove it in court . "
Blackwater " Disappointed " With Guilty Plea But Continues to Support Other Guards
Prosecutors said only six of the 19 Blackwater guards at the scene of the shooting at Baghdad 's Nisoor Square were charged because the others acted " professional and responsibly . "
In a statement , Blackwater said it " is extremely disappointed and surprised to learn that an individual independent contractor has said he committed wrongdoing related to his activities on September 16 , 2007 . "
Blackwater also voiced its continued support of the other guards indicted , saying it believes " these individuals acted within the rules set forth for them by the government and that no criminal violations occurred . "
U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D - IL ) , a member of the House Intelligence Committee , said Blackwater should also be held accountable for " creating a culture that breeds this type of reckless and illegal behavior . "
" These contractors could spend the rest of their lives in jail if they are convicted , but Blackwater will probably not even receive a slap on the wrist for its role in this and other incidents , " Schakowsky said in a statement .
" Today 's indictments do nothing to solve the underlying problem of private security contractors performing critical government functions . "
The bloody incident occurred in September 2007 .
Civilians at the scene and relatives of the dead told U.S. investigators there was no hostile fire and the shootings were unprovoked , sparking widespread outrage in Iraq over what many considered trigger - happy American security guards who shot at civilians with impunity and no fear of consequences .
Blackwater maintained its guards fired in self - defense after coming under fire as they protected a diplomatic motorcade , and some of the defense lawyers have said their clients , all former decorated members of the military in their 20's , are being used as scapegoats to quell anger at the U.S. in Iraq .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Barack Obama painted a bleak economic picture of the country Saturday , hours before he met with his economic team .
President Obama delivers his weekly radio and Internet address , which focused on the economy .
" We begin this year and this administration in the midst of an unprecedented crisis that calls for unprecedented action , " he said in his weekly radio and Internet address .
" Just this week , we saw more people file for unemployment than at any time in the last 26 years , and experts agree that if nothing is done , the unemployment rate could reach double digits , " Obama said .
The president pleaded for urgent action , saying , " If we do not act boldly and swiftly , a bad situation could become dramatically worse . "
Watch Obama 's weekly address »
Obama 's remarks came as he is lobbying for quick congressional passage of an $ 825 billion stimulus package to pump up the economy .
Watch the partisan politics involved »
The president revealed more details of his stimulus package , which he said would add more than 3,000 miles of electric lines to transport alternative energy across the country .
Obama also said the plan would save taxpayers $ 2 billion by making three - quarters of federal buildings more energy efficient and would " save the average working family $ 350 on their energy bills by weatherizing 2.5 million homes . "
The White House also released a report on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan , which calls for greater investment in Pell Grants for college students , a $ 2,500 college tax credit for 4 million college students and the tripling of the number of fellowships in science to help spur innovation .
Obama promised full accountability for government spending .
After a stimulus bill is passed , a Web site , www.recovery.gov, will show taxpayers how their money is being spent , he said .
In the Republicans ' response , Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers criticized the Democratic plan .
Watch the GOP radio address
" The $ 800 billion plan largely ignores the fact that we cannot keep borrowing and spending our way back to prosperity , " said McMorris Rodgers , R- Washington .
" Instead of letting American families keep more of their hard - earned tax dollars , this plan proposes to spend additional money -- billions -- on such programs as new government cars , global warming studies and a billion extra dollars for the U.S. Census . "
Balancing the budget and enacting tax cuts " are central to moving our economy forward , " she said .
Watch what Republicans want »
The president is calling for the plan , which he hopes will create up to 4 million jobs over the next two years , to be passed by Congress and at his desk for signing by February 16 , which is Presidents Day .

Germany Unleashes World 's Toughest Wind Turbines
January 24th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
The first turbines designed specifically for offshore wind energy are finally ready for deployment in Germany after 10 years of development .
Areva ’s turbines are waterproofed , light , and have a simplified design — meaning they are easy to install and maintain .
At full power , each 5MW turbine can supply enough energy for 5,000 homes .
The 120 m blades are reinforced with carbon fiber to make them as light as possible , and all of the mechanisms needed to change their position are encased to prevent damage from sea air .
In case of technical failure , sensors and power management systems are installed in duplicate .
Additionally , the turbine ’s generator and engineering components are hermetically sealed .
Areva plans on installing 6 of the 90 m tall turbines as part of Germany ’s first offshore wind project , located 45 km off the island of Borkum .
The turbines should be completed by the end of this summer .

コンピュータ囲碁の世界でモンテカルロ法という確率的な手法が成功を収めていることは前も書いたが、今号の情報処理学会誌に「プロ棋士対コンピュータ:FIT2008における囲碁対局報告」と題して村松正和さんが記事を書かれており、最近の様子が(棋譜付きで)書かれているのでおもしろかった。
結論から言うとプロ棋 士( 4段 ) に8子置いて勝った(実力的にはアマ2-3段程度)というけっこうすごい話で、自分ではもう平手では勝てないところまで来てしまったのかなぁ、という感じ(自分はアマ2級くらいだった)。ここで使われた
Crazy Stone というプログラムは第1回 UEC 杯コンピュータ囲碁大 会( 2007年12月開催) で優勝したプログラムである。
モンテカルロ囲碁の特徴について同記事でいくつか書かれている(pp.70-71)ので引用すると、
Crazy Stone も含め，モンテカルロ囲碁の打ち方には非常に特徴があり，時にそれは「非常に弱いのではないか」という誤解を招くことがある．それは次のようなものである．
1.常に全局を見渡して着手を決定する．
人間の場合には，局所的なヨミと全局的な判断を組み合わせて打つ場合が多いと思うが，モンテカルロ囲碁ではそのような概念はなく，常に全局を見渡して着手点を計算している．その結果，局所的には甘いと思われる手を結構打つ．
2.定石を知らない．
これも上と同じことから起きる．特に序盤では，手筋ではなく，茫洋とした手を打つことが多い．
3.常に半目勝ちを目指す．
モンテカルロ囲碁では，終盤になればなるほど打つ手が正確になる．その結果，たとえばコンピュータが１目半勝っていれば，それを保って終局するのではなく，自陣に手を入れて半目勝ちにすることを躊躇しない．逆に負けていると，半目負けに甘んずることなく勝負手や無理手を連発して自滅していく．
1番目のポイントのように全体を見た手を打てるというのはなかなかすごいことで、割と局所だけ見てなにをするか決めるのは自然言語処理でもよくあるストーリーで(最近は全体を見て最適化しないとね、という流れになりつつあるが)、囲碁だと全局的な判断はコンピュータには難しいから人間には当分勝てないと思われていたのが覆されてきたのは画期的である。
2番目に関しては(実際にこの記事に書いてある棋譜を見てもらえるといいのだが)単純には序盤は定石(棋譜データベース)とのマッチングをして手を決め、中盤から終盤にかけてはモンテカルロで探索するというハイブリッド方式にすればいいんじゃないかと思うのだが、どこで切り替えるのかとかいろいろと面倒くさそうではある。人間と同じにやる必要はないのだが、人間も序盤はそんな考えていないように思うので、えいやとそれっぽい手を打てるようにすればいいんじゃないかなぁ。
最後の点は( これがちょっと指摘されるまで盲点だったのだが)、勝つ目の数ではなく半目でもいいからとにかく勝つことに関して最適化されるモンテカルロ囲碁の特徴が出ているな、と思う。マージン最大化みたく勝つなら勝ち幅を最大にするような手を選択したほうがいいように直感的には思ってしまうのだが……。歴史的には最初勝ち幅を最大化するようにしていたらすごく弱かった(GNU
Go に対して勝率1割)が、勝率を最大化するように改良したら勝率が跳ね上がった(GNU
Go に対して勝率6割)そうなので、囲碁特有のなにかがあるのだと思うけど……
王銘琬9段と9路盤、置き石なし(!)で戦った自戦記を読むと、割と王9段はコンピュータ囲碁の特徴も研究して(18路盤で8子なら9路盤は2子くらいが普通だそうだが、それでは危ないと思って置かせないようにしたそう)いるようだが、それでもきっちり半目負かされた、というのが意外。
ということで、モンテカルロ囲碁も最初の(単に乱数を使って交互にランダムに石を置いていく)ナイーブな手法は(当然ながら)そんな強くなかったらしいが、パターンを用いるようにしたらだいぶよくなったという話を聞くと、あとはどれだけうまいパターン(テクニック)を教え込めばいいのか、そういう段階に来ているのかなーと思ったりする。
統計的かな漢字変換でも( と強引に話を振ってみるが)コーパスさえあれば(国語学に詳しくなくても)変換がそこそこできるようになるのは一時的な話で、研究開発が進んで機械学習を用いたランキング学習するようになると、やっぱり言語学的知識というか専門家の知識(こういう書き方をしたらここはこう変換する、みたいな)も必要な時期がまた来るのではないかな?
ヒューリスティックに基づく手法と統計的手法との両者の間には断絶があるように見えるけど、実はそんなに断絶もない、というか、本当に断絶があったらみんな(キャズム的表現を借りると early adopters と early majority 以外 ) 乗り換えないんではないかな ?
なかなかおもしろい記事なのでコンピュータ囲碁・将棋など興味ある人はどうぞ。

Shia LaBeouf Cover Up ( Photos )
and a friend decided to stroll the streets of Glendale , California on Thursday .
In an attempt to fool the paparazzi , they fashioned brown paper bags to cover their heads .
LaBeouf , in a cagey move , even wrapped a plastic bag around his hand cast .
The photographers were sharp enough to notice the wrist tattoo on one of the masked dudes .
Shown in photos below , the tattoo depicts the years 1986 - 2004 .
LaBeouf once showed the tattoo to Diane Sawyer and told her it signified the date span of his childhood .
He told the morning show host that he and his father were street performers who dressed up as clowns and sold hot dogs out of a cart .
He got the tattoo because he wanted to be reminded of how he got his start in the performance arena .
Be sure to check out a video of Sawyer on GMA earlier this week - drunk .

( CNN ) --
A childhood illness that has mostly been curbed through vaccinations has killed one child and sickened four others in Minnesota , health officials said Friday .
Authorities recommend that those younger than 2 years be vaccinated against 14 diseases , including Hib .
The five children were infected with a bacterial infection known as Hib : Haemophilus influenzae type b .
Three of the affected children had not received any vaccinations , including the 7 - month - old who died , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
" The situation is of concern , " said Dr. Anne Schuchat , director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease at the CDC .
" It could be happening elsewhere , and of course it 's tragic that one of the children actually died from a preventable disease . "
Hib primarily affects infants and children under 5 years of age .
The vaccine prevents pneumonia , epiglottitis ( severe throat infection ) and meningitis , which is an infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord , caused by the bacteria .
One in 20 children infected with Hib dies , according to the CDC .
And survivors of the disease can become deaf ; 10 to 30 percent have permanent brain damage .
" Parents may not realize the importance of this vaccine , " Schuchat said .
" The disease is still around . "
People tend to " think it 's gone because it has not been seen for a while .
Clearly , the bacteria is in the community in Minnesota , and babies that have n't gotten their vaccines are at risk , " she said .
Before vaccines became widely used , about 20,000 Hib cases were reported each year in the country .
After children began receiving the vaccinations in the early 1990s , CDC officials said , there was a 99 percent drop in cases .
A shortage of the Hib vaccine is also causing concern , officials said .
One of the two companies that produce the vaccine , Merck Inc. , recalled more than a million doses in December 2007 because of contamination .
The recall left a unit of Sanofi Aventis as the only vaccine supplier , creating a shortage .
Under normal circumstances , the first series of the Hib vaccine is administered to children when they are 2 , 4 and 6 months old .
A booster shot is administered between a child 's 12th and 15th month .
Because of the vaccine shortage , the CDC recommended that the primary series for infants should get priority and that older children , who have stronger immune systems , should defer the booster shot until the supply situation improved .
Officials said the supply should be back to normal by this summer .
The vaccine shortage did not cause the infection of the five Minnesota children , federal and state health officials said .
Three of the children had not received any vaccination because of their parents ' decisions , not because of a vaccine shortage , officials said .
One of the infected children , a 5 - month old , had not completed the three - dose series of the vaccination , and a 15 - month old child had received all doses but had an immune deficiency .
The cases are not related and were in different counties , said Dr. Ruth Lynfield , Minnesota state epidemiologist .
But the shortage may be having an effect in the community .
" When there are high immunization rates , there is herd immunity , " Lynfield said .
" It may be that because of the shortage , that herd immunity has dropped .
That first manifests in unimmunized children . "
Some parents do n't vaccinate their children because of claims that childhood vaccinations cause autism .
Health agencies say there is no evidence linking vaccines to autism .
" For parents that are wavering about whether they need the vaccine , they need to know it 's an important vaccine to protect their child from serious infection , " Schuchat said .
The Minnesota cases have alarmed health officials because " this is the highest number of cases that we have had since 1992 , when vaccines became widely used , " Lynfield said .
In 1987 , the national rate of Hib meningitis was 41 cases per 100,000 children under the age of 5 .
After the Hib vaccine was introduced , the rate had fallen to 0.11 per 100,000 in 2007 , according to the CDC .

R.I.P. Dr. Dobb's
In the busy - ness of the holiday season you may have missed the quiet passing of Dr. Dobb 's Journal .
The official story is that the magazine is evolving into a section within InformationWeek , but that 's just spin .
Dr. Dobb's is gone .
I suppose this was inevitable .
I 've been writing for several years about the decline of print publications for developers .
Like most of them , this one has been looking thin and sickly for quite some time .
Sadder still , their final issue featured a huge grammatical error on the front cover .
I 'm sure this was not the way the DDJ staff wanted things to end .
Still , the passing of this magazine is rather historic for our young industry .
Dr. Dobb 's first started publication in 1976 , about the same time that Microsoft and Apple were founded .
A significant slice of today 's programmers were n't even born yet .
For many people , the last few years of 64 - page issues are all they have ever seen of DDJ .
They do n't remember that Dr. Dobb's Journal was a pretty great magazine back in its day .
It really was .
The US Airways plane that crashed in the Hudson River is thought to have flown into a flock of birds and ingested them into the engines .
This is a normal test that is performed on jet engines to qualify them , and normally the engine stays operating .
I recently had to test output that consisted of a long list of dicts against an expected set .
After too many long debugging sessions with copious print statements and lots of hand - comparison , I finally got smart and switched to using Python 's builtin difflib to give me just the parts I was interested in ( the wrong parts ) .
With difflib and a little pprint magic , a failing test now looks like this :
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " C: \Python25\lib\site-packages\app\test\util.py " , line 237 , in tearDown self.assertNoDiff( a , b , " Expected " , " Received " ) File " C: \Python25\lib\site-packages\app\test\util.py " , line 382 , in failIfDiff raise self.failureException , msg AssertionError : --- Expected +++ Received @@ - 13,4 +13,3 @@ {'call ' : ' getuser101 ' , ' output ' : {' first_name ' : ' Georg ' , ' gender ' : u' Male ' , ' last_name ' : ' Handel ' , ... }} {'call ' : ' getuser1 ' , ' output ' : None} {' call ' : ' getuser101 ' , ' output ' : {' first_name ' : ' Georg ' , ' gender ' : u' Male ' , ' last_name ' : ' Handel ' , ...}} - {'call ' : ' getuser101 ' , ' output ' : {' first_name ' : ' Georg ' , ' gender ' : u' Male ' , ' last_name ' : ' Handel ' , ...}}
... and I can now easily see that the " Received " data is missing the last dict in the " Expected " list .
Here 's the code ( not exactly what I committed at work , but I think this is even better ) :
import difflib from pprint import pformat class DiffTestCaseMixin ( object ) : def get_diff_msg( self , first , second , fromfile= ' First ' , tofile= ' Second ' ) : " " " Return a unified diff between first and second . " " " #
Force inputs to iterables for diffing .
# use pformat instead of str or repr to output dicts and such # in a stable order for comparison .
if isinstance ( first , ( tuple , list , dict ) ) : first = [ pformat (d ) for d in first ] else : first = [ pformat ( first ) ] if isinstance ( second , ( tuple , list , dict ) ) : second = [ pformat (d ) for d in second ] else : second = [ pformat ( second ) ] diff = difflib.unified_diff ( first , second , fromfile=fromfile , tofile=tofile ) #
Add line endings .
return ''. join ( [d + '
' for d in diff ] ) def failIfDiff ( self , first , second , fromfile= ' First ' , tofile= ' Second ' ) : " " " If not first == second , fail with a unified diff . " " " if not first == second : msg = self.get_diff_msg( first , second , fromfile , tofile ) raise self.failureException , msg assertNoDiff = failIfDiff
The get_diff_msg function is broken out to allow a test method to call self .
fail ( msg ) , where ' msg ' might be the join 'ed output of several diffs .
Happy testing !

Honorable mention : TorrentSpy
In 2006 TorrentSpy was more popular than any other BitTorrent site , but this changed quickly in August 2007 , when a federal judge ordered TorrentSpy to log all user data .
The judge ruled that TorrentSpy had to monitor its users in order to create detailed logs of their activities , and hand these over to the MPAA .
In a response to this decision – and to ensure the privacy of their users – TorrentSpy decided that it was best to block access to all users from the US .
This led to a huge decrease in traffic , but still , it managed to make out top 10 list last year .
March 2008 TorrentSpy owner Justin decided to shut down completely , and in May his company was ordered to pay a $ 110 million fine , which it will appeal .
Deputy takes man's Xbox during traffic stop David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The known hazards of " driving while black " may have to be amended to add those of driving while black , dreadlocked , and toting an Xbox .
When Kenyatta Hillman and a friend were pulled over by a Orange County traffic cop for speeding outside Orlando , FL , the deputy claimed to smell marijuana and searched the car .
No drugs were found , but the deputy did spot an Xbox and eight games and seized them from Hillman , alleging they might have been stolen .
Even after the deputy checked the serial numbers and nothing came up , he insisted he wanted to hold onto them in case they were reported later .
Hillman told WFTV
News , " He said , ' When you 've got your receipt and your box and stuff , call me and we 'll meet someplace , and you show me the receipt and I 'll give you your game . '
I did n't understand him . "
Hillman believes he was targeted because of his clothing and his dreadlocks .
" It 's probably the neighborhood , it 's probably looking at me because of my hair , I 've got gold in my mouth , probably the way I dress . "
Hillman later went to the sheriff 's office with the original receipt and packaging , but staff were unable to find his Xbox and games .
" They was actually saying , ' We do n't know what 's going on , ' " Hillman explained .
" ' It was n't no arrest , it was n't no police report filed , it 's no case number , we can't find it . ' "
The Orange County Sheriff 's Office told WFTV there had simply been a miscommunication and the gaming system had not yet been transferred to the evidence room .
Hillman later reached the supervisor , who said he had the system and could return it , but not before the end of the week .
" ' I ca n't do anything this week , ' " Hillman said the man told him .
" ' I 'll call you Friday and I 'll meet you Friday and then give you your Xbox back . ' "
Ironically , Hillman heads a rap band called " Central Flawda 's Most Wanted . "
On the band 's MySpace page , Hillman says of himself :
" Born and raised right here in the ' O ' and this is where I 'm gonna die at ( ya feel me ) I was raised in these streets and had to adapt to them .
so I do I what I say and I say what I do .
And when I say it I speak the truth .
And I also had to face changes .
Some trials and tribulations but you have to go through that type of stuff some times in order to become a better person so I guess why I am who I am ........ Orange County stand up . "

Wherein ' voter fraud ' no longer matters to Republicans ...
Brad Friedman Byon 1/28/2009 , 4:07 pm PT
While former radio talk show host and author Al Franken is consistently described in corporate media reports as " comedian Al Franken , " it seems it 's the legal team of former Senator Norm Coleman who are providing the laughs in the first days of the U.S. Senate election contest up in Minnesota .
When even the unapologetic , rightwing , " Franken is stealing the election ! " nutcases and conspiracy theorists at Powerline describe Coleman 's legal case as being of " Three Stooges quality , " you know these guys must really be falling apart .
Such seems the case again on yesterday 's Day 2 of the trial , following the disastrous Day 1 when the 3 - judge panel tossed out doctored evidence , as submitted by Coleman 's team .
Today 's Day 3 does n't seem to be going much better for them , either .
Yesterday , two of the six voter / witnesses called by Coleman , to testify how they were disenfranchised when their absentee ballots were rejected , actually admitted that their ballots were properly tossed because they were , in some way , incorrectly --- or even fraudulently --- cast ...
The Uncounted
TPM 's excellent on - the - scene coverage from Eric Kleefeld describes the comedy of errors on the stand yesterday :
ballot was his own , even if admitted dishonesty was involved in getting the ballot .
One of the voters was Douglas Thompson , who admitted under oath that his girlfriend filled out his absentee ballot application for him , signing his name with her own hand and purporting to be himself .
His ballot was rejected because the signature on his ballot envelope ( his own ) did not match the signature on the application ( his girlfriend 's ) .
The Coleman team 's argument appears to be that he is still a legal voter in Minnesota , as the signature on thewas his own , even if admitted dishonesty was involved in getting the ballot .
Keep in mind : Thompson 's story came up during the direct examination by Coleman lawyer James Langdon .
So the Coleman camp fully knew this information and decided to make him into a witness .
Another one of the voters , an older man named Wesley Briest , initially responded that he voted at the polls --- not by absentee .
Then Coleman attorney James Langdon showed him his absentee ballot envelope , reminding him that he did not go to the polls , too .
So one of the six voters called by Coleman to testify admitted his ballot should have been rejected , since his signature was forged by his girlfriend , while the another could n't remember whether he'd voted at the polls or via absentee .
Nyuk , nyuk , nyuk , wheeee !
Doink !
The latter voter went on to admit , under cross , that " his wife , who served as the witness on his ballot , did not fully complete the witness section of the absentee ballot . "
So yup , that would disqualify the ballot , according to the rule of law .
Now we 've made the case in the past that absentee ballots are rejected too easily , everywhere , particularly in the cases where signatures are thought to be mismatches from the voter 's registration form .
We concurred with San Diego election attorney Ken Karan , who wrote via email following the questionable rejection of ballots in a contested election in CA that " It should not be as simple to discard a ballot because the signatures do n't match after a subjective comparison of signatures by people without any recognized expertise in the recognition of handwriting . "
" Furthermore , if the signatures do n't match , " Karan added , " then that should mean that someone is trying to vote someone else 's ballot .
Now , that is voter fraud .
Every questionable ballot should either be verified with the voter whose registration signature is at issue , or it should be the subject of a criminal prosecution . "
A case in point is that of 75 - year - old Gerald Anderson , one of the witnesses also presented by Coleman .
In Anderson 's case , he is " a septuagenarian who says his signature on the ballot envelope did n't look right because he is now too blind to fill things out perfectly , " according to Kleefeld .
" Perhaps my signature is not quite as good as it once was , " the Star - Tribune reported Anderson saying on the stand .
" Things have changed a little bit . "
" My vote 's worth nothing anymore .
Maybe I 'm worth nothing --- I do n't know , " he continued .
" I 'm entitled to my vote . "
It 's outrageous that a voter like Anderson should not have his ballot counted , yet it 's unlikely that his case is particularly unusual .
Indeed , the Strib notes a couple of the other witnesses had similar stories .
We 've noted ourselves previously , that , due to a persistent " blogging injury " that has left our right wrist in a splint for months , it 's quite likely that our own signature today would n't match that on file from our voter registration form as filled out years ago .
So Coleman 's arguments about the rejection of such ballots might otherwise be valid , but for the fact that he spent the bulk of the pre-contest , post- election hand - count period --- when he believed he was winning --- arguing to reject thousands of the very same ballots that he's now arguing should be included ... now that the state canvassing board has certified the results giving Franken a 225 vote victory out of some 2.9 million ballots cast last November .
That Was Then ,
This is Now
During a press briefing , Coleman 's attorney Ben Ginsberg ( yes , that Ben Ginsberg , of Bush v. Gore FL - 2000 fame , the one who built the strategy of fighting to not have votes counted ) , admitted " Both campaigns have taken positions in the past that are not entirely consistent with what they are now .
That is frankly irrelevant . "
No , it 's not , Ben .
As Franken 's attorneys were all too happy to point out in today 's proceedings .
The Franken team 's arguments , as summarized by Kleefeld :
• Coleman 's attorneys previously maintained that ballot rejections carry a presumption of regularity by the local officials .
They now argue that every ballot is entitled to a de novo review , independent of what the local official thought .
Coleman 's attorneys previously maintained that ballot rejections carry a presumption of regularity by the local officials .
They now argue that every ballot is entitled to areview , independent of what the local official thought .
•
They said that the Equal Protection Clause did not mandate a review of absentee ballots .
They are now arguing that wrongful rejection , and any administrative variations across the state , violate Equal Protection .
•
They previously argued that including previously - rejected absentee ballots would violate Equal Protection , by watering down the votes of people who filled out their documents correctly or voted at the polls .
They are now saying that minor errors in ballot forms should be forgiven .
•
They argued that absentee - voting is a legal privilege , and not a right , and therefore not entitled to an extra benefit of the doubt for ambiguous envelopes .
In Coleman attorney Joe Friedberg 's opening arguments this past Monday , he said that the privilege / right question carried no meaningful legal distinction .
So while the Coleman team spent the bulk of the hand - count period arguing to not count ballots , their change of heart --- and leading PR line , that all votes should be counted , even if they are n't 100 % legal --- is n't terribly moving .
" You know there 's been so much discussion about process , but today we saw the human side of this , and that 's what this is really about , " Coleman told the media yesterday , after his disastrous witnesses .
" For me it was heartwarming to be here to see Minnesotans come forward and be so passionate , so passionate , about the right to vote and be counted . "
We may need a bucket , if this trial goes on much longer .
( Along those lines , see Coleman 's Every - vote - should - be- counted Democracy Fest with fellow convert Sean Hannity from last night Hannity right here .
If you 've got a strong stomach , anyway . )
Blame the Supremes
It should be noted here that the opening for this entire argument about counting / not - counting absentee ballots was created by the MN Supreme Court themselves when they made , last month , the single worst decision during an otherwise quite orderly , transparent , and by - the - books post - election process .
After MN SoS Mark Ritchie had , appropriately , given strict , standardized orders for all counties to go back and review all rejected absentee ballots to make sure they were properly rejected , as per state law , the court responded to a challenge from Coleman 's team by ordering that the SoS , as well as both campaigns , had to agree on which improperly rejected ballots would be counted .
That terrible --- seemingly unprecedented --- decision by the court , allowing campaigns to decide which ballots would and would n't be counted , shamefully opened the door to this entire brouhaha .
For the record , following that decision , Franken called for all such improperly rejected ballots to be counted , Coleman was allowed veto power over most of them ... which he now wants counted .
Indeed , four of the six witnesses Coleman called to the stand yesterday , Franken 's team contended , were not even among those whose ballots Coleman had originally wanted counted , following the MN Supremes terrible decision allowing the campaigns to decide what would be counted and what would n't .
The Old ' Equal Protection ' Ploy
Finally , the Coleman team 's fallback legal argument ( one illustrated in the Coleman / Hannity interview linked above ) goes back to Ginsberg 's old tried and true , cynical , desperate --- yet , ultimately effective --- FL - 2000 Bush v. Gore " Equal Protection " argument .
That argument , it should be noted , is valid only for Republicans , by the way , and only on an as - needed ( such as when you 'll likely go all the way to a Supreme Court which bought into it last time ) basis .
Keefeld summarizes the strategy nicely :
The focus of the Coleman team 's case is not simply human error but human variation --- that is , the recount rules may have been uniform statewide , but the human beings administering the rules applied them differently --- and this constitutes a violation of the Constitution 's guarantee of equal protection .
For example , an absentee ballot might be rejected as having a bad signature or wrong information about the voter --- but it 's really a matter of sloppy handwriting that an election official in one corner of the state would recognize and let slide , while someone elsewhere would n't let it pass .
What a mess .
But but to paraphrase the favorite chant of later - day street protesters :
This is what democracy --- mixed with cynical gamesmanship and partisan desperation --- looks like .
Sam Smith , Shadows of Hope , 1993 -
Encomiums to the wonders of market forces fill speeches and media reports .
One National Public Radio reporter even went so far as to describe a form of government called market democracy , apparently a blend of the Bill of Rights and the Wall Street Journal editorial page .
In fact , most free workers in this country were self - employed well into the 19th century .
They were thus economic as well as political citizens .
Further , until the last decades of the 19th century , Americans believed in a degree of fair distribution of wealth that would shock many today .
James L. Huston writes in the American Historical Review : " Americans believed that if property were concentrated in the hands of a few in a republic , those few would use their wealth to control other citizens , seize political power , and warp the republic into an oligarchy .
Thus to avoid descent into despotism or oligarchy , republics had to possess an equitable distribution of wealth .
" Such a distribution , in theory at least , came from enjoying the " fruits of one 's labor " but no more .
Businesses that sprung up did n't flourish on competition because there generally was n't any and , besides , cooperation worked better .
You did n't need two banks or two drug stores in the average town .
Prices and business ethics were not regulated by the marketplace but by a complicated cultural code and the fact that the banker went to church with his depositors .
Although the practice was centuries old , the term capitalism -- and thus the religion -- did n't even exist until the middle of the 19th century .
Americans were intensely commercial , but this spirit was propelled not by Reaganesque fantasies about competition but by the freedom that engaging in business provided from the hierarchical social and economic system of the monarchy .
Business , including the exchange as well as the making of goods , was seen as a natural state allowing a community and individuals to get ahead and to prosper without the blessing of nobility .
In the beginning , if you wanted to form a corporation you needed a state charter and had to prove it was in the public interest , convenience and necessity .
During the entire colonial period only about a half - dozen business corporations were chartered ; between the end of the Revolution and 1795 this rose to about a 150 .
Jefferson to the end opposed liberal grants of corporate charters and argued that states should be allowed to intervene in corporate matters or take back a charter if necessary .
With the pressure for more commerce and indications that corporate grants were becoming a form of patronage , states began passing free incorporation laws and before long Massachusetts had thirty times as many corporations as there were in all of Europe .
Still it was n't until after the Civil War that economic conditions turned sharply in favor of the large corporation .
These corporations , says Huston : . . . " killed the republican theory of the distribution of wealth and probably ended whatever was left of the political theory of republicanism as well .
. . .
[ The ] corporation brought about a new form of dependency .
Instead of industry , frugality , and initiatives producing fruits , underlings in the corporate hierarchy had to be aware of style , manners , office politics , and choice of patrons -- very reminiscent of the Old Whig corruption in England at the time of the revolution -- what is today called ' corporate culture ' .
" Concludes Huston : " The rise of Big Business generated the most important transformation of American life that North America has ever experienced .
" By the end of the last century the Supreme Court had declared corporations to be persons under the 14th Amendment , entitled to the same protections as human beings .
As Morton Mintz pointed out in the National Law Journal , this 1888 case ignored the fact that " the only ' person ' Congress had in mind when it adopted the 14th Amendment in 1866 was the newly freed slave . "
Justice Black observed in the 1930s that in the first fifty years following the adoption of the 14th Amendment , " less than one - half of 1 percent [ of Supreme Court cases ] invoked it in protection of the Negro race , and more than 50 percent asked that its benefits be extended to corporations .
" During this period the courts moved to limit democratic power in other ways as well .
For example , the Supreme Court restricted the common law right of juries to nullify a wrongful law ; other courts erected barriers against third parties such as banning fusion slates .
It was during this same time that the myth of competitive virtue sprouted , helping to justify one of the great rapacious periods of American business .
It was a time when J.P. Morgan would come to own half the railroad mileage in the country -- the same J. P. Morgan who got his start during the Civil War by buying defective rifles for $ 3.50 each from an army arsenal and then selling them to a general in the field for $ 22 apiece .
The founding principles of what we now proudly call the " American free market system " flowered in an era of enormous bribes , massive legislative corruption , and the creation of great anti-competitive cartels .
It was a time when the government , in a precursor to industrial policy , gave two railroad companies 21 million acres of free land .
And it was also the time that American workers , who had once used commerce to free themselves from the economic and social straitjacket of the monarchy , found themselves servants of a new rigid hierarchy , that of the modern corporation .
The political movement of populism , which Jonathan Rowe calls the " last spasm of economic freedom in an American context , " did battle with the new corporations but lost , as did the eurocentric socialists who followed .
Save during the depression , generations of Americans would come to accept the myth of the free markets and free enterprise .
The buzz from scoring an iPod for $ 15 undoubtedly wore off quickly for one New Zealand man .
Instead of a working MP3 player that could be loaded up with tunes , Chris Ogle found a broken iPod filled with 60 pages of US military data and personally identifying information .
Update : Sleuthy Arsians pointed out that the MP3 player in this story is in fact not an iPod .
The specific manufacturer and model is not known , but judging from CNN 's video coverage and interview , the MP3 player could very well be a DNT MP3 Fun200 ( PDF link ) .
The files Ogle found on the MP3 player contain the names and personal details of US soldiers , including some who served in Afghanistan and Iraq .
There are no details on exactly how many personal records are contained within the documents ( most of which date back to 2005 ) , but they also have information on mission briefings and equipment deployment .
This incident is probably not the worst breach of military data in recent memory .
About a year ago , a UK military recruitment officer 's notebook containing over 600,000 personally identifying , unencrypted records was stolen from his car .
In 2007 , the US military began clamping down on " milbloggers " who may have inadvertently been giving away too much information to the enemy by posting about day - to - day base operations on increasingly popular public blogs .
Of course , there is also Gary McKinnon , who is responsible for the " biggest military hack of all time . "
While McKinnon was n't exactly snooping for the bad guys , he did manage to break into various systems across the US Army , Navy , Air Force , NASA , Pentagon , and Department of Defense in search for proof that aliens exist .
Still ,
Ogle 's situation is a bit bizarre in that no one knows how or why this sensitive information was stored on an iPod , or how that MP3 player slipped out to a used hardware vendor .
According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) , some of the phone numbers from the MP3 player 's records still work , and the identified individuals indeed picked up on the other end .
" The more I look at it , the more I see and the less I think I should be [ seeing ] , " Mr Ogle told ABC .
He says he will hand the player over to the US Defense Department should it ever ask .

Recently , I have wanted to improve the searching ability in a number of my projects .
I 've often added a search box that simply does an icontains filter , which works fine for small sites but does n't scale due to the inefficiency of matching text with basic SQL queries .
The plus side of an icontains filter is that it works on all of Django 's database backends ( with the exception of SQLite , which works but in a case - sensitive way ) .
All of my projects run on PostgreSQL , an open - source database package that runs beautifully everywhere I 've tried it .
If you are familiar with MySQL , Postgres should n't be a problem for you .
When you want to do full - text searching from within your Django projects , you have a few different choices available to you , mostly depending on which database backend you 're using :
MySQL has built - in fulltext indexing which can be used in Django with some basic ORM extensions .
PostgreSQL prior to 8.3 has a ' contrib ' module known as tsearch2 , which allows full - text indexing within your SQL queries .
This is what I am going to detail below .
, which allows full - text indexing within your SQL queries .
This is what I am going to detail below .
PostgreSQL 8.3 and later has tsearch2 built - in , which is usable in Django if you follow these directions from Barry Pederson
built - in , which is usable in Django if you follow these directions from Barry Pederson
You can install Sphinx to index your database content ( on either MySQL or Postgres ) , then use django - sphinx to get access to your Sphinx indexes within the Django ORM .
Since this can work over a network , it may be a better option for massive datasets as you can run your database and index on separate machines .
Similar to Sphinx is solr , which can be used with a Django ORM addon as documented in this blog post .
I believe solr works with both MySQL and PostgreSQL , but I have n't investigated it further .
I 'm using PostgreSQL 8.1 , and decided not to rely on external software to maintain my index due to memory limitations .
Therefore my choice was simple : I utilised the tsearch2 contrib application for PostgreSQL .
Note :
All of the instructions in this blog post relate to my setup on a basic Debian 4.0 system with a relatively default PostgreSQL configuration .
PostgreSQL and Django were already installed and running , and I already had my models in place .
My models also had data in them already as I was upgrading an existing website .
YMMV .
The first thing I had to do was install the postgresql - contrib - 8.1 package , which provides a number of third party addons to PostgreSQL including type extensions for ISBNs , benchmarking , various full - text indexing tools , and XML manipulation tools .
The only element out of these that we 'll be using is tsearch2 , described as " Searchable text data type supporting indexed access . "
The PostgreSQL contribs are similar to those in Django :
If you do n't actually use them , they 'll just sit there taking up nothing but hard - drive space .
This means the extra contribs that I am not using should n't cause any compatibility or runtime errors .
sudo apt - get install postgresql - contrib - 8.1
Once the package is installed , on Debian I was given a bunch of new files under /usr / share / postgresql/8.1/contrib / , including a file called tsearch2.sql .
You can take a look at it if you like : it provides a number of new tables , functions and data types once it 's imported into a database .
The next step is to do just that : Import the tsearch2.sql file into my database .
In this case I 'm working on the DjangoSites database , so within my djangosites folder I ran ./ manage .py dbshell .
$ cd djangosites $ ./ manage .py dbshell djangosites = > \i /usr / share / postgresql/8.1/contrib/tsearch2.sql djangosites = > \q
Running this command as my restricted djangosites user threw up an error immediately , and because the script utilises transactions the rest of the changes were rolled back .
To get around this I had to run the import as the postgres superuser .
Alternatively , I could give the djangosites user a higher level of access .
$ psql - U postgres djangosites djangosites = # \i /usr / share / postgresql/8.1/contrib/tsearch2.sql
SET BEGIN CREATE TABLE CREATE FUNCTION ... ( a few hundred CREATE TABLE , CREATE FUNCTION , and INSERT commands ) CREATE OPERATOR CREATE OPERATOR CLASS COMMIT djangosites = # \q
My djangosites database is now able to recognise the commands used by tsearch2 , and a handful of new database tables have been created :
$ ./manage .py dbshell djangosites = > \d t pg* List of relations Schema | Name | Type | Owner --------+--------------+-------+---------- public | pg_ts_cfg | table | postgres public | pg_ts_cfgmap | table | postgres public | pg_ts_dict | table | postgres public | pg_ts_parser | table | postgres ( 4 rows ) djangosites = > \q
I now need to create a new field on the table I wish to index and search to hold the full - text search keywords and index .
This is pretty straightforward , and needs to be done once for each table you 'll be searching on :
$ ./manage .py dbshell djangosites = > ALTER TABLE websites_website ADD search_tsv TSVECTOR ; ALTER TABLE djangosites = > CREATE INDEX search_index ON websites_website USING gist ( search_tsv ) ; CREATE INDEX djangosites = > \q
This simple command added a new field called search_tsv to my websites_website table and created an index on that field .
The type , TSVECTOR , is only available if we successfully imported the tsearch2.sql file earlier .
The name search_tsv is arbitary , I chose that name so when inspecting the schema later I 'll be reminded it 's a tsvector field and not for general use .
In my example I want to include four fields in the search index : the website Title , URL , Description and Tags .
Because my table is already populated with plenty of data , I need to update the index for each existing row .
If you are working with a fresh database , this wo n't be needed .
This first example will build the search index out of a single column , if you only have one column to index :
$ ./manage .py dbshell djangosites = > UPDATE websites_website SET search_tsv = to_tsvector ( ' default ' , title ) ; UPDATE 1994 djangosites = > \q
If , like me , you have multiple columns you want to match on , then you need to use the COALESCE command while combining them to ensure columns with no data are handled without errors :
$ ./manage .py dbshell djangosites = > UPDATE websites_website SET search_tsv = to_tsvector ( ' default ' , COALESCE ( title , '' ) || ' ' || COALESCE ( url , '' ) || ' ' || COALESCE ( description , '' ) || ' ' || COALESCE ( tags , '' ) ) ; UPDATE 1994 djangosites = > VACUUM FULL ANALYZE ; VACUUM djangosites = > \q
Running this command gave me an error , as my djangosites user did not have permission to read the pg_ts _* tables created during the import earlier .
To fix this , I jumped into the console as the postgres user again and granted SELECT access to the relevant tables .
I could immediately run the UPDATE command above after doing this .
$ psql - U postgres djangosites djangosites = # GRANT SELECT ON pg_ts_cfg , pg_ts_cfgmap , pg_ts_dict , pg_ts_parser TO djangosites ; GRANT djangosites = # \q
The UPDATE command populated my search_tsv field with a mass of data taken from the columns I fed into it .
If you run a SELECT on this column now you 'll see that search data :
$ ./manage .py dbshell djangosites = > SELECT title , search_tsv FROM websites_website WHERE slug = ' www-rossp-org ' ; title | search_tsv
------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Poulton 's Website | ' wed ' : 20 ' blog ': 10,27 ' info ': 17 ' ross ': 1,6 ' howto ' : 15,28 .... ( 1 row ) djangosites = > \q
So we have built our initial search index and loaded it up with data from the existing database records .
But what about when somebody comes along and inserts a new row , or modifies an existing row ?
We need to make sure the index is updated so that the search remains useful .
To do this , we create a database trigger .
$ ./manage .py dbshell djangosites = > CREATE TRIGGER websites_website_tsvectorupdate BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON websites_website FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE tsearch2 ( ' search_tsv ' , ' title ' , 'url ' , ' description ' , ' tags ' ) ; CREATE TRIGGER djangosites = > \q
You can now try inserting data into your table with a simple INSERT query , then SELECT that row to ensure the search_tsv column is populated .
If you get an error on the insert stating ERROR : could not find tsearch config by locale , then you need to update the tsearch2 configuration to match the locale that your system is using .
$ psql - U postgres djangosites djangosites = # SHOW lc_collate ; lc_collate ------------- en_US.UTF -8 ( 1 row ) djangosites = # UPDATE pg_ts_cfg SET locale='en_US.UTF -8 ' WHERE ts_name= ' default ' ; UPDATE 1 djangosites = # \q
We 've now reached a point where all existing data is indexed , and all new or updated records are indexed automatically .
This data is n't very useful as it is , though .
We can now make use of a handful of nifty commands to actually run our full - text search against our data set :
$ ./manage.py dbshell djangosites= > SELECT title FROM websites_website WHERE search_tsv @@ to_tsquery ( ' melbourne ' ) ; title ------------------------
FC

As you can see , the HEADLINE ( ) and RANK ( ) commands come in quite handy .
HEADLINE ( ) will highlight the matching words with HTML < b > tags , and RANK ( ) will provide a ranking that can be used to sort the items from most to least relevant .
Something interesting to note in the above hosting example is that a search for hosting also matched the word host and hosts .
This fuzzy searching is configurable in tsearch2 , but is beyond the scope of this blog post ( and , to be honest , the defaults work perfectly for me in my English - based websites ) .
The last piece of this puzzle is to make use of our search within our Django view .
Assuming we have a variable called q with our search terms , we can use the extra ( ) command in Django 's ORM .
Note that we turn the space - separated keyword list into a pipe - separated list , so all searches will OR words together by default :
keywords = " | " .join ( q.split ( ) ) results = Website.objects.select_related ().extra( select={ ' snippet ' : " headline(websites_website.description , to_tsquery ( %s ) ) " , ' rank ' : " rank ( search_tsv , %s ) " , } , where = [ " search_tsv @@ to_tsquery ( %s ) " ] , params=[ keywords ] , select_params= [ keywords , keywords ] , order_by = ( ' - rank ' , ) , )
We 're now left with results , a standard Django QuerySet for the Website model with two new fields : snippet contains a section of the description column with the search terms highlighted ( avoiding XSS during template display is an exercise for the reader ) and rank , a numeric ranking of the usefulness of each row returned .
We 've sorted it by the rank , so that the most likely search results are presented at the top of the list .
You may want to add this code into a custom manager to provide quicker access to it , although it will work fine in a view as it is .
You can pass results into your template , or even into a generic view that makes use of pagination .
Your website search will be more accurate so it 'll be more useful to your visitors , and it'll place less load on your server .
Enjoy !
Benchmarking
To get an idea of how efficient this method of searching is , take a look at these two examples .
The first is utilising the LIKE command , which Django defaults to for it 's icontains searches .
The second is utilising the tsearch2 index explained above .
There are less than 2000 rows in this table , and the difference in both query time and results returned is staggering .
$ ./manage .py dbshell djangosites = > \t iming Timing is on .
djangosites = > SELECT title , url FROM websites_website WHERE title LIKE ' % hosting % ' OR description LIKE ' % hosting % ' OR url LIKE ' % hosting % ' OR tags LIKE ' % hosting % ' ; .... ( 19 rows )
Time : 13.892 ms djangosites = > SELECT title , url FROM websites_website WHERE search_tsv @@ to_tsquery ( ' hosting ' ) ; .... ( 34 rows )
Time : 5.921 ms djangosites = > \q
If I run each command twice in quick succession , the LIKE query drops to about 11ms and the tsearch2 query drops to 0.9 ms .
Given most searches do n't happen twice in quick succession , I 'm seeing a 50 % improvement in query times .
As the number of rows grows , I would expect the LIKE query to take longer whilst the tsearch2 query should stay relatively stable .

John Kenneth Galbraith ( 1908 - 2006 ) : a great observer of economic life but a bad economic theorist
Posted by William Coleman
J. K. Galbraith was a great observer of economic life but a bad economic theorist .
Thus argues Dr William Coleman - Reader in Economics at the Australian National University .
John Kenneth Galbraith ( 1908 - 2006 ) was the stylish chronicler of the economic life and times of " the American century " .
In 63 books - ranging from marketing in Puerto Rico to painting in India - he crafted scenes that conveyed the morals he drew from what he saw .
He is usually described as an " economist " .
But he was not an economist 's economist .
Despite his Harvard chair , and his presidency of the American Economics Association , the cold truth is that he was barely taken seriously by economists .
Perhaps Galbraith's best claim for economists ' attention was his 1967 book The New Industrial State , that purported to record an economic transformation .
In Galbraith 's telling , the charismatic entrepreneur ( Ford , Carnegie , Rockefeller ) had disappeared .
So had the Victorian paterfamilias , briskly dispatching his capital to the location of the greatest profit .
The economy was now controlled by a small number of corporations , each a little bureaucratic state .
Prices were administered , planned , and " institutionalised " .
So were production , sales , investment , and profits .
The New Industrial State distilled a swarm of ideas of the inter - war period , and the events of the day .
In the 1920s " scientific management " had championed the importance of rationalistic planning in the corporation .
In the same decade Thorstein Veblen had pressed the ability of business to contrive and thrive on waste .
Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means in their 1932 The Modern Corporation and Private Property , and James Burnham in his 1941 The Managerial Revolution , had announced the usurpation , by managers , of the control of the limited liability company .
And at Harvard , Cambridge and Oxford , respectively , Edward Chamberlin , Joan Robinson and Robert Hall had articulated the significance of advertising , the irrelevance of costs at the margin , and the power of the modern business to control prices .
The events that shaped The New Industrial State were two .
First , the Great Depression saw a precipitous drop in prices of ( competitively produced ) agricultural commodities , but rigidity in ( oligopolised ) manufacturers ' prices .
The second was Galbraith 's appointment to Office of Price Administration in 1942 .
Galbraith later recalled that in joining the OPA he brought with him the economist 's conviction that it was not " honourable " for the government to fix prices .
Prices should be stabilised by reducing demand , as Keynes was arguing .
But his experiences at OPA , he believed , taught otherwise .
In 1946 he announced :
The simple fact is that price control worked .
It worked because all manufacturing prices were " administered " anyway .
They could either be administered by the corporation , or by the OPA .
The New Industrial State provided a credal statement of his vision of the invulnerable corporation .
It has since lost its resonance with reality .
Corporate icons like PanAm have expired .
Once sturdy " industrial states " have been waylaid by huge losses ( GM lost US$ 8.6 billion in 2005 ) .
And the entrepreneur - owner has come back - Gates , Jobs , Brin , Bezos , Ellison , and Murdoch , too ) .
This empirical disconfirmation was not unforeseeable , as Galbraith never came close to grappling with the theoretical issues that were at stake .
The fact is that Galbraith was a good observer , but a bad theorist .
This , of course , was no disadvantage when it came to selling his books to the public .
Putting aside text - book authors , surely no one else ever sold more books on economics in the English language .
This celebrity did not come without him seeking it .
He wished for public renown .
He felt it was his due to be near the centre of power , and in the midst of things .
Part of this " engagement " was his long association with the Democratic Party .
He was , however , never crudely partisan in this .
Galbraith once said :
The Democrats recruit people who want change , mostly for themselves .
I have always thought that there are few problems New York City could not solve by doubling its city budget .
His own preferred self - description was " Liberal " .
This denoted a particular historical type ; the mid-century , intellectual cum public servant , of footloose " progressive " inclination , of which Keynes was perhaps the best exemplar .
In the United States this category believed its hour had come with the Kennedy administration , but it promptly wilted under the twin attacks of the New Left and the New Right .
Galbraith was not equipped to fight either effectively .
So he lingered on as a vestigial New Dealer , who could untroubledly announce : Galbraith 's career bespeaks of a mistaking of talents .
He spoke ill of the economic historian .
But most of what he did was history , of some sort .
And his best book is one of economic history , The Great Crash .
With his delicacy in observation , and his sensitivity to rhetoric , personality and advantage , he could have told the tale of Du Pont , or J.P Morgan or Henry Ford .
He never did .
But he left behind a massive trove of testimony to what he had witnessed , which is all , and much more , one can ask of anyone blessed with the writer 's muse .

MSL is Nasa 's next rover mission to the Red Planet The US space agency ( Nasa ) has delayed the launch of its Mars Science Laboratory rover mission .
MSL was scheduled to fly next year , but the mission has been dogged by testing and hardware problems .
The rover 's launch would now be postponed until late 2011 , agency officials said .
The mission is using innovative technologies to explore whether microbial life could ever have existed on the Red Planet .
The delay could add $ 400 m to the price tag , which is likely to top $ 2bn .
" Trying for '09 would require us to assume too much risk , more than I think is appropriate for a flagship mission , " said Nasa 's administrator Michael Griffin .
Trying for 2009 would require us to assume too much risk - more than I think is appropriate for a flagship mission
Michael Griffin , Nasa
The launch date was changed following an assessment by the mission 's scientists and engineers of the progress it has made in the past three months .
" Despite exhaustive work in multiple shifts by a dedicated team , the progress in recent weeks has not come fast enough on solving technical challenges and pulling hardware together , " said Charles Elachi , director of Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , US .
" The right and smart course now for a successful mission is to launch in 2011 . "
Technology hurdles MSL will use novel technologies to adjust its flight while descending through the Martian atmosphere , and to set the rover on the surface by lowering it on a tether from a hovering platform .
It is engineered to drive longer distances over rougher terrain than previous rovers and contains a science payload 10 times the mass of instruments on Nasa 's Spirit and Opportunity Mars rovers .
" Up to this point , efforts have focused on launching next year , both to begin the exciting science and because the delay will increase taxpayers ' investment in the mission , " said Doug McCuistion , director of Nasa 's Mars exploration programme .
" However , we 've reached the point where we can not condense the schedule further without compromising vital testing . "
Engineers have struggled with the development of MSL 's complex actuators - the motors that drive and turn the rover 's wheels , and operate its robotic arm .
The window for a 2009 launch ends in late October .
The relative positions of Earth and Mars are favourable for flights to the Red Planet only a few weeks every two years .
The next launch opportunity after 2009 is in 2011 .
The window in 2011 runs through October to December .
Joining forces Dr Ed Weiler , chief scientist at Nasa , announced he had held discussions with the European Space Agency ( Esa ) about conducting joint missions to Mars in future .
He said the cost of such missions meant collaboration was inevitable .
Dr Weiler told reporters that preliminary discussions with his opposite number at Esa , David Southwood , had led to an informal agreement that in future they would adopt a joint architecture for all missions to the Red Planet .
Europe and the US could now make ExoMars a joint mission Both agencies are likely to combine their efforts in the early 2020s to return rocks from Mars for study in Earth laboratories .
Europe has already made a decision to delay the launch of its own Mars rover , ExoMars , from 2013 to 2016 .
Dr Weiler said there was a possibility this mission could also now become a joint venture with Nasa even though ExoMars is quite advanced in its design .
" We had a very short discussion yesterday on some ideas on how we could work together on ExoMars .
They are literally at the viewgraph stage at this point in time , and I think we both learned not to make too many plans based on Powerpoints , " said Dr Weiler .
" It is going to take some real scientists and engineers getting together and working that out .
But is there a possibility it could become a joint mission ?
Absolutely .
And we 're certainly open to it and would welcome it . "
At its Ministerial Council meeting last week , Esa said it was actively seeking the participation of both the US and Russia on ExoMars as a means of limiting the mission 's 1.2 bn - euro cost .
David Southwood told the BBC that international cooperation at Mars was the only way forward .
" This is big , " he said .
" Ed and I can set the grand plan , but we need our people to get together to work out the detail .
Give us six months and we 'll have an announcement . "

As if the the Terminator is not freaky enough , they have now combined it with a bear , bringing the Bearbrick Terminator to life in a morbid and crazy looking toy .
Bearbrick makes some odd looking bears in different themes and fashion and now with the upcoming Terminator Movie made a new version of the endoskeleton model in a bear toy called T - Rip .
It is n’t everyday that you see a lovable toy such as the Care Bears turned into a horrifying model … unless you think of good ol ’
Chucky from Child ’s Play .
The T - Rip Bear looks like the model with the bright red eyes , endoskeleton print and robotic colors , making it a great collectible for the Terminator movie fans .
If you would rather go for some thing with a little more presence , you can check out the Bio - Cycle held together with a silver skeleton , the Terminator T - 800 Replica , or the Exoskeleton Suit .

In November that year Telstra made a new offer , a 12 Mbps network serving 4 million addresses in the five big cities , again on condition that it was released from the access rules .
The rules were introduced in the early 1990s , as the government deregulated telecommunications and exposed Telstra to competition .
They allow Telstra 's competitors to rent parts of Telstra 's network to combine with their own .
Trujillo seemed to think that by dangling the prospect of a shiny new network , the government would abandon 15 years of bipartisan policy .
The then communications minister , Helen Coonan , told Telstra she would not change the law .
Telstra would not listen .
For two years it tried and failed to do a back - door deal - first with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission , and subsequently with Coonan .
Telstra 's relations with the Howard government were poisonous .
So when the Rudd Government came to power with a policy of holding a competitive process to determine who would get the right to build the national broadband network , Telstra should have changed its approach .
Instead , Telstra made four fundamental mistakes .
First , it failed to acknowledge the Rudd Government 's clearly stated policy objective that the new network be " open access " to increase competition .
Telstra still thought it could lock up a new broadband monopoly .
Second , Telstra followed a muddled and unclear strategy .
In February this year it issued a media release saying the company would participate in the Government 's competitive selection process .
Days before the deadline , it said it would only participate if the Communications Minister , Stephen Conroy , explicitly ruled out " structural separation " of Telstra 's business - which he rightly refused to do .
On the day proposals were due late last month , Telstra said it was " not … in a position to lodge a highly detailed proposal in response " to the request for proposals .
On Monday , after the Government ejected it from the process , Telstra said it considered it had " fully complied with the [ request for proposals ] requirements " .
If even Telstra was unsure whether it was participating in the process or not , it can hardly be surprised if the Government makes the decision for it .
Third , Telstra made a basic error in not meeting the formal legal requirements .
The Government would have been in an impossible position if it had broken its own rules - so clearly spelled out in the document - to give Telstra special treatment .
Fourth - a point that has received little focus so far - the substantive deal Telstra was offering was one that Conroy could hardly have accepted .
When Trujillo first put his deal to Howard in 2005 he offered two options .
If Telstra was given sweeping regulatory concessions , it would build a network serving 98 per cent of Australians .
Howard could have a 6 Mbps network for $ 2.6 billion , or a 12 Mbps network for $ 4.7 billion .
The options were set out in a document that Telstra made available to the stock exchange a few days later - and the second option subsequently underpinned the Rudd Government 's policy to spend $ 4.7 billion on a national broadband network .
Yet last month Telstra in effect reneged on the deal .
Now it says that for $ 4.7 billion it will only build to between 80 and 90 per cent of the population .
The first rule of negotiation is to recognise your counterparty 's position .
How could the Rudd Government ever accept a deal so much worse than the one Telstra offered to Howard ?
This week 's developments may not spell the end of Telstra 's broadband ambitions .
But they certainly show how it has misplayed its response to the Rudd Government 's process - much as it has consistently misread the Australian Government for more than three years .

He also denounced “ the gutting of America ’s ability to engage , assist and communicate with other parts of the world  the ‘ soft power ’ which had been so important throughout the cold war . ”
He blamed both the Clinton and Bush administrations and said later in an interview that “ it is almost like we forgot everything we learned in Vietnam . ”

Mr. Obama ’s choice for national security adviser , General Jones , took the critique a step further in a searing report this year on what he called the Bush administration ’s failed strategy in Afghanistan , where Mr. Obama has vowed to intensify the fight as American troops depart from Iraq .
When the report came out , General Jones was widely quoted as saying , “ Make no mistake , NATO is not winning in Afghanistan , ” a comment that directly contradicted the White House .
But he went on to describe why the United States and its allies were not winning :
After nearly seven years of fighting , they had failed to develop a strategy that could dependably bring reconstruction projects and other assistance into areas from which the Taliban had been routed  making each victory a temporary one , reversed as soon as the forces departed .
Several times during his presidency , Mr. Bush promised to alter that strategy , even creating a “ civilian reserve corps ” of nation - builders under State Department auspices , but the administration never committed serious funds or personnel to the effort .
If Mr. Obama and his team can bring about that kind of shift , it could mark one of the most significant changes in national security strategy in decades and greatly enhance the powers of Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state .
Mrs. Clinton may find , as her predecessor Condoleezza Rice and others in the Bush administration discovered , that building up civilian capacity is easier to advocate than execute .
That problem will be no less acute for Mr. Obama in Afghanistan , where the building projects and job - creation activities that Mr. Bush promised in 2002 , soon after the invasion , and then again in late 2005 , have ground to a halt in many parts of the country because the security situation has made it too dangerous for the State Department ’s “ provincial reconstruction teams ” to operate .
Ms. Rice recently ordered a review of what had gone wrong with the reconstruction team strategy , part of a broader review of Afghanistan and Pakistan strategy that the Bush White House is turning over to its successors .
OTTAWA–Prime Minister Stephen Harper is defending next week 's mammoth budget deficit , saying big - ticket federal spending is essential to restore the confidence of bruised consumers and corporations .
" I think we 're in a rare time where you need a deficit , " Harper said yesterday , warning that Canada is facing one or two " difficult " years because of the global economic slowdown .
And if Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff decides he can't support the budget and topples the Conservatives , Harper said he 's ready for an election and " prepared to accept the judgment of the people .
" Obviously I have no desire to have an election so I hope we 'll get on with governing , " he said .
Speaking in advance of the most important budget in years – and a costly one for taxpayers – Harper insisted that the aggressive action is needed .
And the Prime Minister , despite his background as a conservative thinker and free - market economist , is unmoved that the return to deficit spending is happening on his watch – a shortfall of $ 64 billion over two years .
" You have an incredible period of economic uncertainty and pensiveness where consumers are ceasing to spend because they 're worried about their jobs , where businesses are ceasing to invest because they 're worried about the decline in the economy and poor prospects ... yet we know there are billions of dollars out there , " he said .
During an interview in his wood - panelled office on Parliament Hill , Harper hammered home the key goal for Tuesday 's budget – " we keep people employed and address the growing problem of unemployment . "
He added that " this budget will be very large . "
But he said the budget would also be " forward - looking " with measures to exploit business opportunities expected in the future .
Harper suggested the main goal for Canada in the months to come is to buy time and prop up its economy while other nations tackle the problems that sparked the global meltdown in the first place .
" None of the source of the slowdown is in Canada .
This is a global recession emanating from the financial sectors of other countries . "
Still , he reiterated the government view that the global recession wo n't hit Canada as hard as other nations and that this country will come out of it sooner .
But that will require " everybody gets their shoulder to the wheel , " he said in a pointed message to opposition parties who have threatened to topple the minority Conservatives .
On that front , Harper voiced some respect for Ignatieff , whom he said has " learned and improved quickly " since entering politics .

And he appeared to shed few tears that Ignatieff 's predecessor was out of the picture .
Stéphane Dion teamed up with the NDP to form a coalition that threatened to topple the Conservatives .
" I think the change is desirable , even though I believe ( Ignatieff ) will be a more formidable opponent , " he said .
" I think that 's a good thing for the country . "

Recap

Haskell is a great language for constructing code modularly from small but orthogonal building blocks .
One of these small blocks is the monoid .
Although monoids come from mathematics ( algebra in particular ) they are found everywhere in computing .
You probably use one or two monoids implicitly with every line of code you write , whatever the language , but you might not know it yet .
By making them explicit we find interesting new ways of constructing those lines of code .
In particular , ways that are often easier to both read and write .
So the following is an intro to monoids in Haskell .
I 'm assuming familiarity with type classes , because Haskell monoids form a type class .
I also assume some familiarity with monads , though nothing too complex .
This post is literate Haskell so you can play with the examples directly .
In Haskell , a monoid is a type with a rule for how two elements of that type can be combined to make another element of the same type .
To be a monoid there also needs to be an element that you can think of as representing ' nothing ' in the sense that when it 's combined with other elements it leaves the other element unchanged .
A great example is lists .
Given two lists , sayand , you can join them together usingto get .
There 's also the empty list .
Usingto combinewith any list gives you back the same list , for example Another example is the type of integers , .
Given two elements , say 3 and 4 , we can combine them with + to get 7 .
We also have the element 0 which when added to any other integer leaves it unchanged .
So here is a possible definition for the monoid type class :
The function mappend is the function we use to combine pairs of elements , and mempty is the ' nothing ' element .
We can make lists an instance like this :
Because we want mempty to do nothing when combined with other elements we also require monoids to obey these two rulesandNotice how there are two ways to combine a and b using mappend .
We can writeor .
There is no requirement on a monoid that these be equal to each other .
( But see below . )
But there is another property that monoids are required to have .
Suppose we start with the list .
And now suppose we want to concatenate it withon the left andon the right .
We could do the left concatenation first to getand then form .
But we could do the right one first and get .
Because we 're concatenating at opposite ends the two operations do n't interfere and it does n't matter which we do first .
This gives rise to the third and last requirement we have of monoids : and you can summarise it with the slogan ' combining on the left does n't interfere with combining on the right ' .
Notice how the integers , combined with + , also have this property .
It 's such a useful property it has a name : associativity .
That 's a complete specification of what a monoid is .
Haskell does n't enfore the three laws I 've given , but anyone reading code using a monoid will expect these laws to hold .
But given that we already have individual functions likeand , why would we ever want to use mappend instead ?
One reason is that with a monoid we get another function called mconcat for free .
mconcat takes a list of values in a monoid and combines them all together .
For exampleis equal to .
Any time you have a monoid you have this quick and easy way to combine a whole list together .
But note that there is some ambiguity in the idea behind .
To computewhich order should we work in ?
Should we work from left to right and computefirst ?
Or should we start with .
That 's one place where the associativity law comes in : it makes no difference .
Another place where you might want to use a monoid is in code that is agnostic about how you want to combine elements .
Just as mconcat works with any monoid , you might want to write your own code that works with any monoid .
Explicitly using the Monoid type class for a function also tells the reader of your code what your intentions are .
If a function has signatureyou know it takes a list and constructs an object of type b from it .
But it has considerable freedom in what it can do with your list .
But if you see a function of type , even if it is only used with lists , we know what kind of things the function will do with the list .
For example , we know that the function might add things to your list , but it 's never going to pull any elements out of your list .
The same type can give rise to a monoid in different ways .
For example , I 've already mentions that the integers form a monoid .
So we could define : But there 's a good reason not to do that : there 's another natural way to make integers into a monoid :
We can't have both of these definitions at the same time .
So the Data .
Monoid library does n't make Integer into a Monoid directly .
Instead , it wraps them with Sum and Product .
It also does so more generally so that you can make any Num type into a monoid in two different ways .
We have bothandTo use these we wrap our values in the appropriate wrapper and we can then use the monoid functions .
For exampleis , butisUsingandlooks like a complicated way to do ordinary addition and multiplication .
Why do things that way ?
You can think of monoids as being accumulators .
Given a running total , n , we can add in a new value a to get a new running total n' = n `mappend` a .
Accumulating totals is a very common design pattern in real code so it 's useful to abstract this idea .
This is exactly what the Writer monad allows .
We can write monadic code that accumulates values as a " side effect " .
The function to perform the accumulation is ( somewhat confusingly ) called .
Here 's an example where we 're logging a trace of what we 're doing .
This is an implementation of the factorial function that tells us what it did .
Each time we callwe combine its argument with the running log of all of the strings that we 've ' told ' so far .
We useto extract the results back out .
If we runwe get back both 10 ! and a list of what it took to compute this .
But Writer allows us to accumulate more than just strings .
We can use it with any monoid .
For example , we can use it to count how many multiplications and subtractions were required to compute a given factorial .
To do this we simply tell a value of the appropriate type .
In this case we want to add values , and the monoid for addition is Sum .
So instead we could implement :
There 's another way we could have written this , using the state monad :
It works just as well , but there is a big advantage to using theversion .
It has type signature .
We can immediately read from this that our function has a side effect that involves accumulating a number in a purely additive way .
It 's never going to , for example , multiply the accumulated value .
The type information tells us a lot about what is going on inside the function without us having to read a single line of the implementation .
The version written withis free to do whatever it likes with the accumulated value and so it 's harder to discern its purpose .
Data .
Monoid also provides an Any monoid .
This is the Bool type with the disjunction operator , better known as || .
The idea behind the name is that if you combine together any collection of elements of typethen the result isprecisely when at least any one of the original elements is .
If we think of these values as accumulators then they provide a kind of one way switch .
We start accumulating with mempty , ie. , and we can think of this as being the switch being off .
Any time we accumulate Any True into our running ' total ' the switch is turned on .
This switch can never be switched off again by accumulating any more values .
This models a pattern we often see in code : a flag that we want to switch on , as a side effect , if a certain condition is met at any point .
At the end of our calculation we get n! , but we are also told if at any stage in the calculation two numbers were multiplied to give 120 .
We can almost read the tell line as if it were English : " tell my caller if any value of r is ever 120 " .
Not only do we get the plumbing for this flag with a minimal amount of code .
If we look at the type for this version of f it tells us exactly what 's going on .
We can read off immediately that this function , as a " side effect " , computes a flag that can be turned on , but never turned off .
That 's a lot of useful information from just a type signature .
In many other programming languages we might expect to see a boolean in the type signature , but we'd be forced to read the code to get any idea of how it will be used .
Two elements of a monoid , x and y , are said to commute if .
The monoid itself is said to be commutative if all of its elements commute with each other .
A good example of a commutative monoid is the type of integers .
For any pair of integers , If a monoid is n't commutative , it 's said to be non-commutative .
If it 's non-comuutative it means that for some x and y , is n't the same as , soandare not the same function .
For exampleis different from .
This has the interesting consequence that we can make another monoid in which the combination function is .
We can still use the sameelement , so the first two monoid laws hold .
Additionally , it 's a nice exercise to prove that the third monoid law still holds .
This flipped monoid is called the dual monoid and Data .
Monoid provides thetype constructor to build the dual of a monoid .
We can use this to reverse the order in which the writer monad accumulates values .
For example the following code collects the execution trace in reverse order : Suppose we want to accumulate two side effects at the same time .
For example , maybe we want to both count instructions and leave a readable trace of our computation .
We could use monad transformers to combine two writer monads .
But there is a slightly easier way - we can combine two monoids into one ' product ' monoid .
It 's defined like this : Each time we use mappend on the product we actually perform a pair of mappends on each of the elements of the pair .
With these small helper functions : we can now use two monoids simultaneously :
If we had simply implemented our code using one specific monoid , like lists , our code would be very limited in its application .
But by using the generaltype class we ensure that users of our code can use not just any individual monoid , but even multiple monoids .
This can make for more efficient code because it means we can perform multiple accumulations while traversing a data structure once .
And yet we still ensure readability because our code is written using the interface to a single monoid making our algorithms simpler to read .
One last application to mention is the Data .
Foldable library .
This provides a generic approach to walking through a datastructure , accumulating values as we go .
Thefunction applies a function to each element of our structure and then accumulates the return values of each of these applications .
An implementation offor a tree structure might be :
We can now use any of the monoids discussed above to compute properties of our trees .
For example , we can use the functionto test whether each element is equal to 1 and then use the Any monoid to find out if any element of the tree is equal to 1 .
Here are a pair of examples : one to compute whether or not an element is equal to 1 , and another to test if every element is greater than 5 : Note , of course , that these expressions can be used , unmodified , with any foldable type , not just trees .
I hope you agree that this expresses our intentions in a way that is easy to read .
That suggests another exercise : write something similar to find the minimum or maximum element in a tree .
You may need to construct a new monoid along the lines ofand .
Try finding both in one traversal of the tree using the product monoid .
The foldable example also illustrates another point .
The implementor offor the tree does n't need to worry about whether the left tree should be combined with the central element before the right tree .
Associativity means it can be implemented either way and give the same results .
Monoids provide a general approach to combining and accumulating values .
They allow us to write code that is agnostic about the method we will use to combine values , and that makes our code more reusable .
By using named monoids we can write type signatures that express our intentions to people reading our code : for example by using Any instead of Bool we make it clear just how our boolean value is to be used .
And we can combine the monoid - based building blocks provided by Haskell libraries to build useful and readable algorithms with a minimum of effort .
Some final notes : mathematicians often refer to mappend as a ' binary operator ' and often it 's called ' multiplication ' .
Just like in ordinary algebra , it 's often also written with abuttal or using the star operator , ie . ab and a*b might both represent .
You can read more about monoids at Wikipedia .
And I wish I had time to talk about monoid morphisms , and why the list monoid is free ( and what consequences that might have for how you can your write code ) , and how compositing gives you monoids and a whole lot more .
President Obama has called for sacrifice and sharing .
I wholeheartedly agree .
However , before sharing the pain , and before working towards a solution , we must understand the problem .
To date , many mistakes have been made because Congress , the Fed , and the previous administration did not attempt to understand the problem and the role everyone played in it .
Fed's Role
The Greenspan Fed slashed interest rates to 1 % in 2002 fueling the biggest housing bubble in history .
Furthermore , Greenspan was the biggest cheerleader of derivatives and subprime lending on the planet .
Fed Governor Ben Bernanke went along with Greenspan every step of the way .
The serial bubble blowing tactics of the Fed must be eliminated at all costs .
It should be clear now that the Fed does not know , and is guessing every step of the way what interest rates should be , and is also guessing what the solution to this mess is .
Congressional Role
Congress refused to rein in the GSEs and ignored repeated warnings by many to cut off their lending .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were accidents waiting to happen .
It simply is not Government 's job to promote housing in the first place .
Promotion of housing caused prices to go up ( until they crashed ) and this is why Congress was always chasing its tail perpetually looking for affordable housing solutions .
The very sponsorship of affordable housing programs guarantees that affordable housing will not exist .
In addition , Congress threw money at every problem , built bridges to nowhere , and wasting a trillion dollars on a war in Iraq fought on trumped up charges of weapons of mass destruction .
All of those things cheapened the US dollar and kicked off a commodities bubble that has also crashed .
State Legislatures Role
State legislatures are also to blame .
44 states now have large budget deficits .
California in particular is a basket case .
States believed the housing party would last forever and failed to fund pension plans while squandering money on all kinds of irresponsible pet projects .
Property taxes rose to and remain at unsustainable heights .
States are now running out of money to fund all the projects and benefits they have promised .
My biggest fear right now is Congress will throw money at the states , without requiring them to make the sacrifices that need to be made .
Spending must be cut , programs must be cut , benefits must be slashed , and pensions must be capped .
I ask that not one cent of Federal ( taxpayer ) money go to any state that does not make the necessary sacrifices .
Part of that sacrifice must be a reduction in pay by the Governor and legislature of every state .
I commend Ohio Governor Ted Strickland for having the courage to ask for across the board union pay cuts .
That is a start , but it is only a start .
Pension Plans
Pension plans are a particularly sore point for many citizens .
Promises have been made to unions that can not be kept .
Such promises caused the bankruptcy of the city of Vallejo , California .
Other cities are sure to follow .
Wages and pension benefits of all government employees needs to be brought inline with wages and benefits in the private sector .
There is no other way out .
Pension benefits must be capped for all new state and federal hires .
Taxpayers should not have to bear the pain for funding massive benefits for government employees when they have no such opportunities for themselves .
Fractional Reserve Lending
Unquestionably bank greed came into play .
Massive leverage and off the book SIVs by Citigroup and others certainly played a role .
However , it is important to understand the Fed 's role as an enabler .
The culprit in this case is fractional reserve lending .
This fraudulent policy , sponsored by the Fed , allows more credit to be extended than there is base money supply .
This was the enabler that allowed banks to lend and securitize over and over and over again , recording fake profits every step of the way .
Over time , asset bubble form such as the bubble in housing .
To keep the bubble going , the Fed printed more and more money , and banks extend more and more credit .
As with every credit bubble , there eventually there comes a day reckoning when what has been lent out , cannot possibly be paid back .
That day of reckoning is now .
In simple terms the Fed is a sponsor of the world 's biggest Ponzi scheme .
The scheme has now blown sky high , as money to keep the bubble growing simply ran out .
That is why 10 new Fed programs have failed to produce any results .
Unless and until fractional reserve lending is eliminated , these kinds of problems will reappear .
I ask Congress to disallow fractional reserve lending .
It can not be done at once , but it can be phased in over time .
It will be a painful process but banks must share in the pain for their role in the mess .
Role of the SEC
Many blame the rating agencies for the ridiculous AAA ratings on mortgage backed securities .
The rating agencies deserve criticism , but one must take the problem back to the root source .
It was SEC sponsorship of the rating agencies that actually created the problem .
The origin of the rating game mess dates back to 1975 with the establishment of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ( NRSRO ) by the SEC .
NRSRO turned upside down the model of who had to pay .
Previously debt buyers would go to the ratings companies to know what they were buying .
In the revised model , the issuers of debt had to pay to get it rated or they could n't sell it .
Not only that , but they have to be rated by one of the rating agencies approved by the SEC .
This led to shopping around to see who would give the debt the highest rating .
In the new model , the rating agencies got paid by the quantity of the work they did rather than the quality of the work they did .
Now there are calls for regulation and oversight of the ratings agencies .
However , the simple and correct solution to this problem is to eliminate government sponsorship of the rating agencies returning to the model where the rating agencies get paid by the quality of their work rather than the quantity of it .
I guarantee this solution will work .
Why Banks Are n't Lending
Money was given to banks and many members of Congress are asking for banks to increase lending .
I suggest that instead of attempting to force banks to lend , that Congress seek reasons why banks are not lending .
Here is the answer .
1. Banks are still insolvent after all those capital injections .
There is simply no capital to lend .
Book values of banks , if credit were to realistically be marked to market is negative .
2 . There is no reason to lend .
What do we need more of ?
Cars ?
Pizza Huts ?
Houses ?
Nail Salons ?
Malls ?
Furniture ?
What ?
Nothing is what .
3 . There is no consumer demand because there are no jobs .
Since there are no jobs ( or significantly fewer jobs ) banks are unwilling to extend credit to consumers with less of an ability to pay it back .
It is a serious , serious mistake to force banks to lend at this point .
All it will do is increase bank writeoffs .
A Word About Jobs
In spite of what Krugman and other economists say , Government cannot really " create " any jobs per se .
It can raise taxes and shift private sector jobs creation to government jobs ( typically a malinvestment ) , and it can bring production and consumption forward for those jobs that are genuinely needed ( filling potholes and repairing bridges ) , but once the potholes are filled and the bridges repaired , one has to ask the question , " What will we do for an encore ? "
There is no free lunch .
It is impossible to spend one 's way out of a hole .
It can not be done and should not be tried .
Japan proved it .
So did FDR .
Ultimately it was World War II and the destruction of much of the world 's productive capacity that ended the great depression .
The US was relatively untouched by the war , and could lead a worldwide recovery .
That said , there is a genuine need to repair infrastructure and that need must be done at the cheapest possible price .
I Urge Congress To Scrap Davis Bacon
When it comes to jobs creation , we need to get the most work done for the cheapest amount .
The way to do that is to scrap the Davis - Bacon act .
Economist Greg Mankiw writes :
" More public projects would pass a cost - benefit test if we repealed the Davis - Bacon Act .
This law requires contractors on these public projects to pay " prevailing wages , " which are typically union wages well in excess of what would occur in a free market .
If the government paid market - determined wages for infrastructure projects , we could have both more infrastructure and less government debt .
Without doubt , that legacy would benefit future generations . "
Where 's The Apology ?
Now that the bubble has burst there has not been one peep from Bernanke for his role in the mess .
Nor has there been an apology from Barney Frank or anyone in Congress for their role in this mess .
What about an apology from governors and state legislatures for their role in the mess .
How about an apology from the SEC ?
Instead we are told we must share the pain .
Here is a synopsis of the plan to date .
Sharing The Pain Plan
Ordinary Taxpayers 100 %
Banks 0 %
Congress 0 %
State Legislatures 0 %
Bernanke 0 %
Fed Governors 0 %
Fannie Mae Bondholders
0 %
Freddie Mac Bondholders
0 %
FDIC executives 0 %
SEC 0 %
Is it any wonder the average person is up in arms over the bailouts .
When does Congress share the pain ?
When do bank executives share the pain ?
When does Shelia Bair share the pain ?
When does Paulson share the Pain ?
When does Bernanke share the pain ?
Bernanke , Barney Frank , and anyone else in Congress who supported Fannie and Freddie owe US taxpayers a huge apology .
They should share in the pain .
Healing cannot begin until those responsible for the mess own up to their part in it .
Instead , Congress is turning to Bernanke for answers when he failed to see the problem .
If Bernanke could not see the problem , how can he possibly see the solution ?
Bernanke failed to see this coming , denied it every step of the way , then threw 10 new programs at the credit crunch , all of which failed .
I call for Congress to share the pain by cutting their own salaries .
I call for Congress to not give one cent to the states unless they do the same .
I call for a reduction in salaries at the FDIC , the SEC , and every Federal department .
I call for a reduction in salaries at the Fed .
I call for a reduction in salaries in state and local governments .
I call for capping of pension plans everywhere in government .
I call for Congress to revoke Davis - Bacon .
I call for the end of SEC sponsorship of the rating agencies .
I call for union concessions from the auto makers .
I call for executives and all employees of banks and brokerages receiving money to share the pain .
I call for an apology from all who contributed to this mess , including Bank and Brokerage executives .
Here 's what you can do .

Most of all , I call for the resignation of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , the abolishment of fractional reserve lending , and the end of the Fed itself , the latter to be phased out over an appropriate period of time .

Dr. Lawrence Summers ( lawrence_summers@harvard.edu ) who is going to lead the White House National Economic Council .
Here is the Online Directory For The 111th Congress up to date as of January 16 , 2009 .
I would like to introduce the Reality Sandwich audience to Aaron Gach , of the Center for Tactical Magic whose tagline is " Mixing Magic , Art & Social Engagement since 2000 . "
I sat down with him at the " Democracy in America " art exhibition on September 26 , 2008 in NYC , nearby the Center 's Tactical Ice Cream Unit , a rather sleek Fascist looking treat vehicle which freely dispenses informative flyers about the law and public rights to anyone looking to buy frozen snacks .
It also features a bangin audio system .
Aaron spoke about the ideas which formulated the Center , his ice cream truck , and the relationship between art and magic .
The Center dissects the uses of power in our world and uses this information to aid individuals in cleverly reclaiming his or her power using the broad spectrum of magic .
AL : Tell me a little bit about how you got the Center for Tactical Magic started and your related early childhood experiences .
AG : Hi my name is Aaron Gach , and I 'm a co-founding member of the Center for Tactical Magic .
The Center actually began in a pretty boring academic way .
I guess in the way magic tends to happen , you get these surprises that are often fortuitous and I think CTM 's foundations were sort of one of those surprises .
At the beginning I had this notion of interviewing different people in society that had unique skills sets and interests in power and how power manifests in society .
I guess on an individual level , community level or transnational level .
The first three people that I contacted were a private investigator , a stage magician and a ninja .
The idea was to more or less to give them the same interview and see how their answers varied based on their personal experiences and the way they looked at the world .
That premise fell apart fairly quickly , mainly because a couple of them did n't really want to do interviews , but they offered to work out some kind of apprenticeship .
The private investigator said he was too busy to sit down and do an interview but he needed help , an extra body in some of his cases .
I sort of became his shadow and I could ask him questions as we were working on the cases and he explained what he was doing and why he was doing it .
The ninja I contacted said he would n't do an interview but he still wanted to see the questions that I would have asked him .
So I handed him the list of questions and he looked them over and he said , " Everything that you want to know on this list gets expressed through the martial arts .
It 's up to you to answer the questions for yourself if you want to train , I 'll train you and you can answer the questions .
Even if I were to give you the answers you would n't understand them without having gone through the training . "
So we started training together in 2000 .
There are crazy stories that go from there in that relationship .
The magician was actually willing to do the interview but when we set it up he could n't actually do the interview without performing .
Anytime he wanted to give me an example of something or make an analogous reference he would always have to show me a trick , sleight of hand , or an illusion .
We worked together for a period of time and during that time we were just dealing with secular magic : stage magic , theatrical magic , what magicians refer to as conjuring magic .
At one point he stopped me , while we were working out a routine and asked me , " what are you trying to accomplish , what 's your goal here ? "
At the time , I gave him a really kinda arty answer — a lot of fluff , big words .
And he said " No , no , no , what the fuck are you trying to prove with magic ?
Why are you interested in magic ? "
I said , " Look , I 'm interested in perception and how people perceive the world , how reality , on the one hand is consensual and on the other it is illusionistic ; how people feel incredibly disempowered by the way signs and language are manipulated around them .
I want to empower people . "
And he said , " Are you sure you are investigating the right type of magic ? "
And at that point , I was very skeptical .
I thought there was only one kind of magic , which was performing , stage magic , and hand tricks .
When he asked me that question , I thought he meant maybe you should be looking at card tricks or something to this effect .
He said " No , no , no , I 'm talking about ritual magic , have you explored the occult and metaphysics ? "
I thought he was setting me up so I kinda smirked and said " No. " waiting for the punch line .
He said " I want to introduce you to some other people . "
His position was that he studied magic tricks in part so that he could discern when real metaphysical manifestations occurred .
It was a way of filtering out fakery from actual phenomena .
That was my real introduction to that side of magic , really exploring magic as a vast spectrum , a range of experiences , products , plays , politics , arts , that really fall into " Magic . "
I guess , retrospectively , looking back at that , I realized I have always been interested in magic , I just did n't always call it magic .
I always had a magical childhood , retrospectively I can think of a huge range of very bizarre things that happened to me throughout my life which I can accept as the fabric of life .
Then you realize as you get older , that maybe these things are larger than coincidence , they are not " normal " experiences that other people have .
They do n't necessarily experience the same type of world that you do , and then of course as you get older you meet other people who do experience the world that you do .
Only , we 've all been sort of positioned that life is what we 're told it is , rather than what we are experiencing .
AL : Do you want to share a specific childhood memory ?
AG : Here is something that I feel a lot of people could relate to on some level , which is just wishing for things , even absurd things and having them manifest within a reasonable amount of time , and accepting that if you wish for things , forces will come into play that will create these things at different times .
As a kid , these are often petty things , like wishing for candy .
Usually it 's the type of situation that you do n't consider , you go to the store with empty pockets and you wish you had some candy .
You leave the candy store and you 're walking back to your house and on the side of the road you find a wad of $ 5 bills , and it 's all muddy and probably been sitting out there for weeks on end .
There it is sitting there , the means to go back and buy the candy .
As a kid , you chalk it up to lucky — that sort of situation .
Sometimes people ask what the earliest inspiration for the Ice Cream Truck was .
One of the stories I like to tell about the truck is when I was five and at the county fair .
The army had a tank which was set up so kids could go in and climb all over it , obviously a way of recruiting people and really getting into the minds of children at a very young age .
I climbed inside and starting pushing the buttons .
My mom was concerned and asked the soldiers if there was anything risky about a five year old playing in a huge weapon .
They said , no , everything is locked down and requires the right sequences .
I was in there with a friend , we were hitting all the buttons , and between the two of us we managed to start the tank .
As a five year old , that did n't seem strange to me .
My intentions were to start the tank .
Obviously , I did n't know the codes , but nonetheless it started , the soldiers freaked out and jumped in .
We were n't rolling anywhere , just the engines came on .
That was the last time they had tanks at our county fair .
So I take it as a success .
AL : You were n't recruited at that point ?
AG : No ( laughing ) .
So having that experience made me think of how to set up a situation where people can willfully engage in the experience and produce real results .
I think the Tactical Ice Cream Unit does that for a lot of kids .
I think there are a lot of kids that see the space and their mind starts to open up , and they find new categories for understanding different things they have seen .
AL : I want to know more about each of those types of world perceptions as the private eye , magician , and the ninja .
What is something you learned from each of them ?
AG : OK , the single most valuable lesson that I got from the private eye is something he would talk about repeatedly , which was , humans are creatures of habit .
His whole job was really predicated on uncovering hidden information , information that 's either intentional hidden away , or even unintentionally — sometimes just lost .
The gist of what he was always attempting to do , was to find out more than what was readily available .
Depending upon what sort of situation he was engaged in , sometimes it involved following people , sometimes it involved going to courthouses and digging up records , sometimes it involved just talking to the right people , networking people or convincing people to give him information that they were n't supposed to give him .
But his main operating premise in all of these situations was always " humans are creatures of habit . "
That meant that if he was trying to find a missing persons he would start by looking at their routine .
If there was a situation where he was trying to deal with someone who was intentionally trying to avoid him or trying to hide something , he would start by looking at the most mundane aspects of their life that they returned to , consistently .
Those became points of vulnerability .
When I think of that in society at large I feel that in a lot of respects this is what TV does , this is why advertising happens on TV .
It happens at that mundane part of the day when everyone is coming home from work and they are exhausted , tired , and vulnerable and they want to relax .
They 're in a suggestive state .
That 's just one type of example , but nonetheless we can begin to think about how that relates in everyday life .
My relationship with the magician gradually became more complex , like relationships do the more time you spend with someone .
Initially , we were just dealing with the ideas of perception and the ideas of performing power ; what it means to be a figurative power , or someone perceived as having great or greater abilities than other people .
Oftentimes when you think of a magician , whether it's a street or a stage magician , the initial notion is that the magician has some sort of knowledge or power that the audience does not have .
That 's what allows the magician to perform .
You end up , within metaphysics and the occult , with this split , this sort of binary between those of black magic and white magic .
That pops up in stage magic performance on occasion too , and it happens in reference to the type of magic performed by a magician for his audience .
A magician that is truly performing for his / her audience is a magician who is trying to amaze , is trying to give some profound understanding of the complexities of reality , that reality is n't what is seems to be , that our perceptions can be fooled , deceived , and that sometimes in that fooling , we begin to recalibrate our understandings of what actually is going on around us .
On the contrary side of the magician , maybe he is performing for him or herself .
The act is a very egotistical act , it 's an act about showing that he or she has greater abilities and becomes this big ego trip .
I think anyone who has seen a magician perform is always ill at ease when a volunteer is asked for because the fear in part is maybe they are going to go up on stage and be humiliated .
This is the real shift between magicians where on one hand the magician may bring a volunteer on stage and have them participate in casting an illusion or creating a grand effect ; but on the other hand everyone sort of knows the worst case scenario where someone generously volunteers to be on stage and ends up being turned into a fool — they become the victim .
I think dealing with those sort of power relations shows up in politics all of the time .
We see it every time a White House spokesperson makes semantic arguments that do n't really speak to the events that are at hand ; anytime that the government seeks to distract our attention by presenting us with some sort of false debate ; anytime the news media chooses not to cover events or not to offer solutions to crises , but rather just to report the doom and the drama in the midst .
Those are all instances where the relationship between the stage magician begins to reflect the sorts of illusions and the sorcery that gets cast in the halls of government and the offices of marketing agents .
My relationship with the ninja was interesting on a couple of different levels .
For one thing , I think it 's important to emphasize that ninjas in pop culture are not the same thing as ninjas today .
Ninjas in pop culture and movies from the 80s , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , Ninja Motorcycles , all of these sorts of constructions really are fictional constructions about what the world of the ninja was historically .
They are usually cast simply as assassins , or sometimes underhanded secret agents .
But historically if you look at the role they played , they had a very community - based practice , they did n't necessarily abide by the norms , standards , or the codes of feudal Japan .
They took matters into their own hands , and they often focused on achieving goals .
It 's not a martial art that 's strictly self - defensive .
Sometimes , it 's just about accomplishing the goal at hand , which may mean running from conflict altogether , it may mean hiding , or evading circumstances .
It may mean preempting a certain set of circumstances that would lead to trouble or danger .
Having that sort of understanding , of just trying to accomplish goals , while trying to think tactically and strategically , I think it goes beyond many martial arts today .
The way this martial art is practiced today , while it trains for tactical purposes , it focuses on principles .
The difference there is that a technique can be deployed when the circumstances allow for that technique , but understanding the principle gives you the flexibility and the resourcefulness to adapt yourself or change your conditions .
So in that case , ninjas tend to think of training not just an individual body , but as thinking of the body as a small group , a large assembly , and a social mass .
In those instances , the principles apply , where as an individual technique it may not .
AL : Can you tell me more about the body as a large group ?
AG : When most people think of the martial arts , they think just of body on body , or two people in a confrontation , but the body when you think of principles , can be thought of not just as an individual , but as a small group of five , a dozen people , one hundred , one thousand , etc .
So when you have a set of principles you can work with , you can organize as groups rather as individuals .
We can apply the same sort of principles , in this case martial arts principles , to groups of people .
In many ways , this is what the U.S. Military is doing .
Kind of as a side note , as a reference to the U.S. military , when the current Grand Master of this martial art first opened training to the west in the early 80s , a number of the people who began training with him were all involved in various militaries around the world , and that was who was most interested in this type of information .
Now you see a lot of the same principles getting enacted within the law enforcement community , when they think about crowd control and going into conflict .
It 's also being used for corporate security and mercenary firms .
So even though people tend to think of ninjas in a specific context , they should be aware that this art is not just historical , but one that is affecting the present as well , one that the halls of power are intimately aware of and engaged with .
I have n't spoken yet about magic on the occult level .
I think if you look at occult practice on a broader , historic level , with a sweeping gaze , you will see that a lot of occult practice has been invested in the broader goal of social liberation , of the ascendancy of humanity and all sentient beings , towards some sort of greater becoming , coming into being , achieving a larger , more positive potential .
Carrying on that tradition , updating and not being anachronistic about our understandings of magic is vitally important to that goal .
This is a goal that a lot of different people , in different schools and camps refer to in various contexts as " The Great Work , " often disagreeing on what that is , but agreeing on the general trajectory that what we are all looking at is some sort of ascendancy .
AL : Do you think The Great Work was there at the beginning and has led humankind ?
AG : People argue whether The Great Work is a journey or a destination .
Personally I suspect that its not a destination but it's a goal that you work towards also .
That is to say , you do n't work towards a goal without thinking you are going to achieve it .
If you work towards a goal not expecting achievement , your successes are going to be few and far between .
So I think you have to operate along the two opposing positions at the same time , which is on the one hand this perspective that the journey is immensely valuable and may in fact be the totality of the journey and at the same time you have to occupy the position that you are working toward achieving The Great Work and that The Great Work will be achieved , maybe without even knowing what that looks like .
Knowing full well that when we can imagine a world that 's better than what we have at the moment , then we have an obligation to try to manifest it .
I think this gets into a good space to talk about the relation between art and magic .
I think those things are really critically linked together and I think they are linked in a very prehistoric way .
If you think about the first artwork , or the first act of magic by people , I suspect that those acts were very similar , that the language was n't there to differentiate upon producing art or producing magic , and in many ways they use the same process and produce the same thing .
By starting with an abstract idea , sort of flowing across the grey matter in your brain , pulsing inside your head and then looking at the world around you , the forces and materials available can recombine and restructure to manifest that abstraction in reality .
It 's in that moment that you are in fact creating reality , that you are changing reality , shifting reality , kind of enacting your will on the cosmos , or perhaps that the cosmos is reenacting its will through you , or perhaps a little of both .
I think that relationship , whether you call it making art or magic , is all about manifestation , is all about looking at the world and trying to figure out your place in it and what you want to see manifested .
AL : Do you think everything else is people acting out of fear ?
And when they are acting out of fear , what are they manifesting ?
AG : I 've been having a few conversations with people recently about this white magic , black magic dichotomy , and it's a funny dichotomy to talk about in post - modernity , and maybe even post - post modernity , where you end up with all kinds of relativist positions .
A lot of people I have spoken with , often when they 're talking about black magic or trying to define some idea of black magic , fear is a term that comes up a lot — as a form of control , a way of having power over others , and it's also a way to take power away from others .
Those things may sound similar , but their nuances are different .
When someone can instill fear in you , obviously they can manipulate you from that position and at the same time fear is something we often conjure in ourselves as a way of not venturing out , taking risks , engaging the world , and in the activities we feel in our heart of hearts need to be undertaken .
AL : What do you think everybody is caught up with in the " real world , " what do you think they are they engaged in ?
AG : Where are their heads ?
I think a lot of the battles that have been waged historically have not been true opposite sides vying for the same thing .
I think that what you have is a struggle between those who want to consolidate and accrue power and resources , and those who simply want to live a good life .
So this is not a battle between two forces who want the same thing .
You have this toss up between those who are greedy for power and those who want to spend time with their families , party , listen to music , eat good healthy food , etc .
This is where a lot of the tensions for any sort of political struggle become very complicated .
Those who want to consolidate power are putting the resources generationally into consolidating .
They create huge lineages building military might , developing technology , which is a long - term journey .
Those who want to live the good life think in term of a single life , or a couple of generations .
They want to see their children , maybe they want to see their grandchildren live a good life .
It is tough to think about what it means to create a large - scale humanistic , social transformation .
So yeah , I think most people want to live in peace .
Magic and the occult has a long history of being very secretive , and I think there is a lot good reason for that .
Historically there has been a lot of persecution , vulnerability , and issues of survival .
Even for stage magicians , if you expose your stage tricks to everyone , you are out of a job .
What we are seeing this time is an interest in magic on all fronts and which needs to be reflected in the actions of the people who have the knowledge .
There needs to be an opening up for information to be shared productively , not shared just for the sake of spectacle , not just shared for the sake of archiving , but for the sake of activating power and moving toward a brighter future .
AL : What do you think , like how yoga has been co-opted , about everything in the occult having to being certified and being turned into schools and sold ?
AG : This is the nature of the beast .
Capitalism will make every attempt to co-opt anything that gains attention .
Part of it is not being fooled by those illusions , part of it is being smarter than those illusions , creating networks and structures that are not easily co-opted .
The process of cooptation is essentially a process that at its core stifles creativity .
It tries to answer all of the creative questions for you , and it often gives you very boring , very cliché answers .
If you 're satisfied with those answers than that 's fine , I 'm not in a position to tell you how you should think about the world around you .
What we have found having conversations like this , most people are not excited by a world that is constantly packaged , that 's being sold back to us in a cheap shoddy way .
So what that means is finding your own creative voice as your own liberation , banding together with other people and quite literally creating your own reality , or re-creating your own reality which is to say , " re-creation is recreation . "
Find those cracks and crevices where you can band together with other people to enjoy the world around you , not the world which is sold to you .
My last point is that if we were to make any sort of prediction , it would be less of a prediction and more of a demand :
What we demand is nothing short of the complete and irrevocable invocation and unleashing of the creative and prophetic power of the multitude .
AL : Well said .
Thank you Aaron .

Tis the season for snow and ice – only fun if you 're a penguin or like to walk with an ice pick .
For the rest of us , the big challenge is dealing with frozen precipitation once it hits the ground , especially if we want to be " eco friendly . "
These tips will help .
What 's wrong with rock salt ?
Many consumers use rock salt to clear a path through the snow around their homes .
But this is not ideal for the planet .
5 Problems With Salt
1. Excess salts build up in the soil , just as they do with chemical fertilizers .
2 . Salt residue prevents plants from absorbing moisture and nutrients .
3 . Salts can leach heavy metals , which eventually make their way into water supplies .
4 . Salt on grass or sidewalks close to roads can attract animals , which may be hit by cars if they 're licking the salt from the ground .
5 . Plus , salt can burn our pets if it lodges in their paws .
Yes , salt does effectively melt snow .
But is there a better way ?
9 Eco-Friendly Ways to De - Ice Your Driveway
1. Shovel Snow
Minimize snow and ice by shoveling , and the sooner after snow stops falling , the better .
If shoveling is too challenging for you , pay a neighborhood kid a few dollars to help .
2. Go Electric ( if you must )
If you prefer to use a snow blower , get an electric model .
Gas - powered blowers generate a lot more air and noise pollution
3 . Try a " Snow Melt Mat "
If you 're installing a new driveway or replacing an old one , lay down electric wires to heat the driveway from below and radiate heat upwards .
Yes , you pay for electricity , so it 's not as " eco " as shoveling by hand .
On the other hand , it may be better than using chemicals that pollute the water and endanger plants and pets .
It would cost someone living in the Washington , DC area ( where I live ) about $ 14 in electricity each time the system was used – though that does n't include the cost of installing the system .
Electricity costs will vary by region .
( NOTE : I 'm not recommending you tear up a perfectly good driveway to put in a snow melt system ! )
4. Get a Grip
Scatter sand or even birdseed for traction .
The grains wo n't melt snow or ice , but they will give you more grip on icy surfaces .
5. Scrimp on the De-icer
Remember , the job of a de-icer is to loosen ice from below to make it easier to shovel or plow .
Do n't pile on the de-icer thinking you 'll remove the ice completely .
You wo n't .
The recommended application rate for rock salt is around a handful per square yard you treat .
Calcium chloride will treat about 3 square yards per handful .
6. Pick Your Salt Carefully
If you do use salt , choose wisely .
Sodium chloride ( NaCL ) may contain cyanide .
Calcium chloride ( CaCl ) is slightly better since less goes farther , but it is still not ideal , since its run -off still increases algae growth , which clogs waterways .
Potassium chloride is another salt to avoid .
•
Whatever you use , keep it away from landscape plants , especially those that are particularly salt - sensitive , like tulip poplars , maples , balsam firs , white pines , hemlock , Norway spruce , dogwood , redbud , rose bushes and spirea bushes .
7. Skip the Kitty Litter or Wood Ashes
Neither melts snow and ice , and they have a tendency to get messy when it warms up .
8. Avoid Products that Contain Nitrogen - Based Urea
They 're more expensive and are not effective once the temperature drops below 20 °F .
Plus , the application rate for urea during a single deicing is ten times greater than that needed to fertilize the same area of your yard .
Remember that the urea you apply to the ground will eventually run off into the street , down the drain , and into lakes and streams .
9 . Get the Boot
Wear boots that have a solid toe and bottom treads to help increase your grip on icy surfaces .

GAZA CITY , Gaza Strip ( AP ) 
A rocket fired by Palestinian militants fell short of its target in Israel on Friday , striking a house in northern Gaza and killing two schoolgirls .
The attack came as Israel sent mixed signals regarding its plans for Gaza .
Israeli defense officials say politicians have approved a large - scale incursion into the territory .
But at the same time , Israel appeared open to international pressure against an invasion , prying open its border with Gaza on Friday to allow deliveries of humanitarian aid .
None of Gaza 's militant factions claimed responsibility for the deadly rocket attack on the house in Beit Lahiya .
Gaza Health Ministry official Dr. Moiaya Hassanain identified the two victims as 5 - year - old Hanin Abu Khoussa and her 12 - year - old cousin , Sabah Abu Khoussa .
Three other young people were wounded , Hassanain said .
The girls were the first Palestinian civilians inadvertently killed by militants since their truce with Israel began collapsing six weeks ago .
Family members and medics said they were killed by rocket fire .
Israel 's crossings with Gaza have been largely clamped tight since Islamic Hamas militants seized control of the coastal strip in June 2007 , with only the barest essentials allowed in since a June 19 truce with Gaza gunmen began unraveling six weeks ago .
On Thursday , however , Israel 's Defense Ministry said it agreed to open its cargo crossings into Gaza to avoid a humanitarian crisis there .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak said the decision followed consultations with defense officials and calls from the international community , suggesting Israel might not be impervious to international pressure to resume the truce .
A total of 106 trucks carried medicine , fuel , cooking gas and other vital goods into Gaza , the military said .
Cabinet Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said the humanitarian shipment was meant to be a message to the people of Gaza that they were not Israel 's enemy .
" We are sending them a message that the Hamas leadership has turned them into a punching bag for everyone , " he told Israel Radio .
" It is a leadership that has turned school yards in rocket - launching pads .
This a leadership that does not care that the blood of its people will run in the streets . "
Ben-Eliezer echoed the message Prime Minister Ehud Olmert tried to deliver a day earlier in an interview with the Arabic language Al - Arabiya TV station : That Gaza 's Islamic Hamas militant rulers were to blame for the suffering of the territory 's 1.4 million residents .
But there were no immediate signs of backlash against the militants after the girls ' death .
The militants kept up their fire on Israeli border areas despite Israel 's agreement to open its crossings Friday .
In all , 13 rockets and mortars were fired toward Israel by Friday evening , the military said .
One home was struck but no injuries were reported .
Israel had originally agreed to open the cargo crossings with Gaza on Wednesday , but shut the passages after militants began pounding southern Israel with rockets and mortars .
Pressure has been mounting in Israel for the military to crush Gaza militants and Israeli leaders have been voicing strong threats in recent days .
But on Friday , military officials said the army was planning a routine rotation of its troops along the Gaza border in the coming week .
That , coupled with current winter weather , made an imminent operation seem unlikely , they said .
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not permitted to discuss military strategy publicly .
Israel left Gaza in 2005 after a 38 - year occupation and has been reluctant to press ahead with a campaign likely to exact heavy casualties on both sides .
Past incursions have not halted the barrages , and officials fear anything short of a reoccupation of Gaza would fail to achieve the desired results .
Also Friday , a poll published in the Maariv daily showed Livni 's moderate Kadima Party neck and neck with its hawkish Likud rival ahead of Feb. 10 elections .
Likud objects to the peace talks that Israeli negotiators , led by Livni , are conducting with the government of moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , who has ruled only the West Bank since Hamas ' Gaza takeover .
A Teleseker survey showed Kadima winning 30 of parliament 's 120 seats , to Likud 's 29 seats .
The poll surveyed more than 800 people and had a margin of error of 2 seats .

The Dakar Rally was traditionally an off - road multi-stage race from Paris to Dakar , Senegal .
However , due to fears of terrorist attacks , the Rally was cancelled last year - and this year moved to an entirely different continent , South America .
540 teams started the 2009 Dakar Rally in Buenos Aires , Argentina on January 3rd , and , after 9,578 kilometres ( 5,951 mi ) in 14 stages , will return to Buenos Aires on January 17th .
Back in France , a small group of die - hard African Rally fans decided to stage their own version of the Dakar , folllowing the traditional route despite any terrorist threat , and have dubbed their version the " Africa Race " , and 27 drivers started out from Marseille , France on December 28th .
Here are some photographs of the official Dakar Rally ( in South America ) , and a few of its shadow competition , the Africa Race .

Whether you 're a pratin ' granny , single mom or a full - on haxxor , you no longer have to dread waking up to an RIAA summons .
They still might rat you out to your ISP , though .

Alas , it took the RIAA five years and 35,000 cases to realize that suing individual for illegal downloads was not an effective deterrent .
Not only was it an abject PR failure , not even the RIAA has ever pretended that it was making a difference .

That 's not to say the RIAA is not entirely out of the anti-pirate game , of course .
Now , they will focus on notifying your ISP of your malfeasances , should their wide net of semi-legal piracy detection agents sniff out your IP seeding 808s and Heartbreak to 12 year old girls .
The RIAA will email your ISP ( if it is one of the " major " providers that has an agreement ) , who will then either forward the email on or send their own warning .
If you do n't comply to that and subsequent warnings , your service may be canned .

Deflation has already set in and it's now realistic to start talking about another " D " word , this one being depression .
Before we can use a word , we must define it .
For the sake of argument , let 's define depression as unemployment of 10 % or greater .
Looking at alternative measures of unemployment ( counting discouraged workers , those working part time for economic reasons , etc ) , we are already there at depression levels of unemployment as noted in table A - 12 of the October Employment Report .
Table A - 12
click on chart for sharper image
The official unemployment rate is 6.5 % .
However , if you start counting all the people that want a job but gave up , all the people with part - time jobs that want a full - time job , all the people who dropped off the unemployment rolls because their unemployment benefits ran out , etc. , you get a closer picture of what the unemployment rate is .
That number is in the last row labeled U - 6 .
U - 6 is 11.8 % .
It reflects how unemployment feels to the average Joe on the street .
Note that it was 8.4 % a year ago .
Both U - 6 and U - 3 ( the so called " official " unemployment number ) are poised to rise further .
But let 's assume depression means 10 % in the base rate ( Line U - 3 ) .
Can unemployment rise from 6.5 % to 10 % ?
Let 's take a look at the data and see .
ADP Says U.S. Companies Cut 250,000 Jobs in November
ADP , the largest payroll processor in the US says Companies Cut 250,000 Jobs in November .
Nonfarm private employment decreased 250,000 from October to November 2008 on a seasonally adjusted basis , according to the ADP National Employment Report® .
The estimated change in employment from September to October was revised down from a decrease of 157,000 to a decrease of 179,000 .
November ’s ADP National Employment Report offers evidence of a labor market that continues to weaken .
This month ’s employment loss was again driven by the goods - producing sector which declined 158,000 during November , its twenty - fourth consecutive monthly decline .
The manufacturing sector marked its twenty - seventh consecutive monthly decline , losing 118,000 jobs .
These losses were compounded by an employment decline in the service - providing sector of the economy which fell by 92,000 , the second monthly loss in the service - providing sector recorded by the ADP Report since November of 2002 .
In November , construction employment dropped 44,000 .
This was its twenty - fourth consecutive monthly decline , and brings the total decline in construction jobs since the peak in August of 2006 to 521,000 .
Small Businesses Have Largest Decline In Seven Years
Total small business employment : - 79,000
Goods - producing sector : - 47,000 small business jobs
Service - providing sector : - 32,000 small business jobs
Mass Layoffs Double From Year Ago
Job cuts announced by U.S. employers in November more than doubled from a year earlier , led by a surge at financial firms as the credit crisis deepened and the global economy faltered , according to a private placement firm .
Firing announcements rose 148 percent to 181,671 , the most since January 2002 , from 73,140 in November 2007 , Chicago - based Challenger , Gray & Christmas Inc. said today .
The figures are n’t adjusted for seasonal effects , so economists prefer to focus on year - over - year changes instead of monthly numbers .
Companies are slashing jobs as access to credit remains frozen and sales weakened worldwide .
A deteriorating labor market is likely to undermine consumer confidence and spending , pushing the economy further into what may become the longest recession in 70 years .
“ Those hoping for a holiday reprieve in downsizing as Christmas approaches could be disappointed , ” John A. Challenger , chief executive officer of the placement company , said in a statement .
“ December has historically been among the larger job - cut months of the year , with many employers making last - minute staffing adjustments to meet year - end earnings goals . ”
Surpassed 1 Million
The Challenger report today showed companies have announced a total of 1,057,645 cuts so far this year , up 46 percent from the same period in 2007 .
Job cuts have surpassed 1 million for the first time since 2005 .
The number of planned job cuts increased 61 percent in November from the 112,884 announced in October , Challenger said .
Financial companies led industries in announced cutbacks with 91,356 reductions last month after Citigroup Inc. said it would cut 52,000 workers from its payroll .
Retail employers followed with 11,073 firings , while computer and electronics firms combined for 15,350 cuts .
Service Industries Contract by Most on Record
Service industries in the U.S. contracted the most in at least 11 years , and a measure of private payrolls showed job losses accelerated , signaling the economy ’s decline deepened last month .
The Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non- manufacturing businesses , which make up almost 90 percent of the economy , fell to 37.3 in November , the lowest level since records began in 1997 .
“ What we ’ve seen since mid to late September is that business activity has shut down , along with the consumer , ” Stephen Gallagher , chief economist at Societe Generale in New York , said in an interview with Bloomberg Television .
“ There is no reason for an immediate turnaround ; financial markets have not stabilized ; consumers have not stabilized . ”
The Labor Department ’s November jobs report may show payrolls fell by 330,000 , the biggest drop in 26 years , according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists .
John Silvia , chief economist at Wachovia Corp. in Charlotte , North Carolina , lowered his forecast for November payrolls by 100,000 to a decline of 450,000 , following the ISM report .
Ellen Zentner , of Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York , projected job losses reached 470,000 last month .
The ISM group ’s index of new orders for non-manufacturing industries decreased to 35.4 from 44 the prior month .
Its gauge of employment dropped to a record - low 31.3 from 41.5 , and a measure of prices paid fell to 36.6 , also the lost since at least 1997 .
Ushering in a new era in medicine , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday that it had cleared the way for the world ’s first clinical trial of a therapy derived from human embryonic stem cells .
By early summer , a handful of patients with severe spinal cord injuries will be eligible for injections of specialized nerve cells designed to enable electrical signals to travel between the brain and the rest of the body .
When the cells were administered to rats that had lost control of their hind legs , they regained the ability to walk and run , albeit with a limp .
As a Phase I trial , the study will primarily assess the safety of the treatment , which has been under development by Menlo Park , Calif . - based Geron Corp. for nearly a decade .
But scientists , doctors and patients said they were most eager to see whether low doses of the cells would produce any therapeutic benefit .
If so , it would help validate years of hope and investment in the nascent field of regenerative medicine .
Besides patients with spinal cord injuries , stem cell therapies could ultimately benefit people with such intractable diseases as Alzheimer ’s , Parkinson ’s and multiple sclerosis .

The cell therapy is made from one of the first batches of human embryonic stem cells ever created .
Researchers had feared those cells could never be used to treat people because they were derived using molecules from mice and cows and thus might be rejected by the human immune system .
Newer stem cell lines that are animal - free have not been eligible for federal research funding under the policy set by President Bush in 2001 .
As a result , many people had expected FDA approval for any embryonic stem cell therapy to be years away .
Now , however , the FDA appears satisfied that the stem cells are safe for human use , and more clinical trials are sure to follow , said Amy Comstock Rick , president of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research , a patient advocacy group that supports stem cell research .
“ It shows that things are starting to move through the pipeline , ” she said .
Dr. Thomas Okarma , Geron ’s chief executive , said the timing of the FDA ’s decision -- made late Wednesday but announced Friday by the company -- had nothing to do with the change of administrations in Washington .
Unlike Bush , President Obama has voiced strong support for human embryonic stem cell research .
“ We have no evidence that there was any political shadow over this process , ” Okarma said in a conference call with reporters and corporate analysts .
Geron submitted its application to test the nerve cells , dubbed GRNOPC1 , in April , and the FDA spent an appropriate amount of time evaluating the cells ’ safety , he said .

Unlike human stem cells derived from blood or fat , embryonic stem cells are coveted because they are theoretically able to grow into any kind of cell in the body .
Scientists are also trying to turn them into insulin- secreting islet cells for patients with Type 1 diabetes and cardiac tissue that could repair damage from heart attacks .
Even if the spinal cord therapy does n’t make paralyzed patients walk again , it could still substantially improve their quality of life , said UC Irvine neuroscientist Hans Keirstead , whose research team figured out how to convert human embryonic stem cells into the replacement nerve cells .
“ I would absolutely love to see a quadriplegic regain use of their thumb , ” Keirstead said .
“ That means that person can get out of bed in the morning and operate their own wheelchair .
They can type ; they can make phone calls . ”
To treat spinal cord injuries , scientists first realized that the crucial damage was to oligodendrocytes , cells that insulate nerve fibers with myelin so that signals can be transmitted to and from the brain .
The hard part , Keirstead said , was figuring out the complex recipe of growth factors and other chemicals that would turn stem cells into oligodendrocyte progenitor cells that could ultimately make new myelin .

To test the cells , Keirstead ’s team gave rats anesthesia and damaged their spinal cords just enough so they could not walk normally .
After seven days , they injected the rats at the site of the injury with the progenitor cells .
After four weeks , the rats could walk , run and stand on their hind legs , and their coordination had fully recovered , Keirstead said .
The research was published in the Journal of Neuroscience .
UC Irvine researchers spent two years studying hundreds of rats to make sure the injections were safe .
Pure embryonic stem cells tend to grow into tumors , but the rats showed no such signs for a year after treatment .
Blood and urine tests turned up none of the chemicals that would signal a toxic reaction , said Keirstead , whose work was funded by Geron .
The first patients to get the treatment will be injected with 2 million of the cells seven to 14 days after a spinal cord injury .
If they are administered sooner , the cells could be damaged by inflammation from the injury .
If doctors wait too long , there might be too much scar tissue for the cells to find room to grow , Okarma said .
Patients will be given a low - dose anti-rejection drug for 60 days to ensure their bodies do n’t reject the GRNOPC1 cells , even though research indicates that the cells wo n’t be recognized by the human immune system , he said .
The sites of the clinical trial will be announced in coming months .

Despite the risks , recruiting patients should not be difficult , said Peter Kiernan , chairman of the Reeve Foundation , which funds research to find cures for spinal cord injuries .
Some patients already travel overseas for expensive , unproven therapies that purport to use various kinds of stem cells .
Though he hailed the FDA ’s decision to allow Geron to proceed with the first phase of its trial , Kiernan cautioned that a cure could still be years away .
He said he worried that if the improvement was n’t immediate and dramatic , people might turn their backs on human embryonic stem cells altogether .
“ It ’s your worst nightmare , ” he said .
“ There may be some people who say , ‘ See , we told you so .
It ’s all hype . ’ ”

Times without a separate local news front for the first time since the paper 's early decades .
The publisher decided to fold local news inside the front section — which will be reconfigured to downplay national and foreign news — despite what an official of the paper confirmed for me was the unanimous and vocal objections of senior editors .
Advertisers were informed on Wednesday , and word began to leak on Thursday .
Hartenstein reportedly planned to delay an announcement until the close of business on Friday , fearing it will play as another black eye for the Times .
He 's right about that .
I 'm told that in contentious discussions in recent weeks , the editors failed to persuade Hartenstein that if a section had to go , the more palatable cut would be to move the less - read Business pages .
The backdrop , of course , is the economy and the Times ' continued free - fall in ad revenue .
By getting rid of California , the Times can print the more profitable Calendar section at night and eliminate the expense of a second , earlier daily press run .
( Times presses can only handle four sections per run , as this post from last Friday discussed .
Note , too , that pressmen are the Times ' only unionized workers . )
The move will apparently be spun as an enhancement in local coverage , but Times officials are bracing for howls of protest from print readers who already have been canceling subscriptions over the paper becoming thinner and less well edited .
Some LAT officials fear this might be a tipping point .
" We can't keep alienating our core readers , " a senior person told me .
Papers that have tried doing away with just their Business sections have been stunned by the backlash ; the Orange County Register reversed its decision to mollify readers .
For the journalists , this is another big hit .
They already work under the constant threat of layoffs — department heads have reportedly readied their lists , awaiting the final count from Hartenstein — and there 's not much confidence that things will ever get better .
Morale totally blows , especially in Metro , the department most hurt by losing the section .
Hartenstein also has people kind of freaked out , I hear — but only unofficially since he has tried to ban employees from talking to me .
" We have a vindictive publisher , " an editor told me , asking to stay unnamed .
An afternoon email to Editor Russ Stanton seeking context to the California section axing went unanswered .
By the way : I got a lot of email asking why the Times raised its newsstand price by 50 percent without any warning to customers .
I 'm told now that Hartenstein personally barred the customary story from running .
I hear the voices of my friends in Gaza as clearly as if we were still on the phone ; their agony echoes inside me .
They weep and moan over the death of their children , some , little girls like mine , taken , their bodies burned and destroyed so senselessly .
One Palestinian friend asked me , " Why did Israel attack when the children were leaving school and the women were in the markets ? "
There are reports that some parents cannot find their dead children and are desperately roaming overflowing hospitals .
As Jews celebrated the last night of Hanukkah , the Jewish festival of lights commemorating our resurgence as a people , I asked myself : How am I to celebrate my Jewishness while Palestinians are being killed ?
The religious scholar Marc Ellis challenges us further by asking whether the Jewish covenant with God is present or absent in the face of Jewish oppression of Palestinians ?
Is the Jewish ethical tradition still available to us ?
Is the promise of holiness – so central to our existence – now beyond our ability to reclaim ?
The lucky ones in Gaza are locked in their homes living lives that have long been suspended – hungry , thirsty , and without light but their children are alive .
Since Nov. 4 , when Israel effectively broke the truce with Hamas by attacking Gaza on a scale then unprecedented – a fact now buried with Gaza 's dead – the violence has escalated as Hamas responded by sending hundreds of rockets into Israel to kill Israeli civilians .
It is reported that Israel 's strategy is to hit Hamas military targets , but explain that difference to my Palestinian friends who must bury their children .
On Nov. 5 , Israel sealed all crossing points into Gaza , vastly reducing and at times denying food supplies , medicines , fuel , cooking gas , and parts for water and sanitation systems .
A colleague of mine in Jerusalem said , " this siege is in a league of its own .
The Israelis have not done something like this before . "
During November , an average of 4.6 trucks of food per day entered Gaza from Israel compared with an average of 123 trucks per day in October .
Spare parts for the repair and maintenance of water - related equipment have been denied entry for over a year .
The World Health Organization just reported that half of Gaza 's ambulances are now out of order .
According to the Associated Press , the three - day death toll rose to at least 370 by Tuesday morning , with some 1,400 wounded .
The UN said at least 62 of the dead were civilians .
A Palestinian health official said that at least 22 children under age 16 were killed and more than 235 children have been wounded .
In nearly 25 years of involvement with Gaza and Palestinians , I have not had to confront the horrific image of burned children – until today .
Yet for Palestinians it is more than an image , it is a reality , and because of that I fear something profound has changed that will not easily be undone .
For how , in the context of Gaza today , does one speak of reconciliation as a path to liberation , of sympathy as a source of understanding ?
Where does one find or even begin to create a common field of human undertaking ( to borrow from the late , acclaimed Palestinian scholar , Edward Said ) so essential to coexistence ?
It is one thing to take an individual 's land , his home , his livelihood , to denigrate his claims , or ignore his emotions .
It is another to destroy his child .
What happens to a society where renewal is denied and all possibility has ended ?
And what will happen to Jews as a people whether we live in Israel or not ?
Why have we been unable to accept the fundamental humanity of Palestinians and include them within our moral boundaries ?
Rather , we reject any human connection with the people we are oppressing .
Ultimately , our goal is to tribalize pain , narrowing the scope of human suffering to ourselves alone .
Our rejection of " the other " will undo us .
We must incorporate Palestinians and other Arab peoples into the Jewish understanding of history , because they are a part of that history .
We must question our own narrative and the one we have given others , rather than continue to cherish beliefs and sentiments that betray the Jewish ethical tradition .
Jewish intellectuals oppose racism , repression , and injustice almost everywhere in the world and yet it is still unacceptable – indeed , for some , it 's an act of heresy – to oppose it when Israel is the oppressor .
This double standard must end .
Israel 's victories are pyrrhic and reveal the limits of Israeli power and our own limitations as a people : our inability to live a life without barriers .
Are these the boundaries of our rebirth after the Holocaust ?
As Jews in a post -Holocaust world empowered by a Jewish state , how do we as a people emerge from atrocity and abjection , empowered and also humane ?
How do we move beyond fear to envision something different , even if uncertain ?
The answers will determine who we are and what , in the end , we become .

Your imagination is the limit .
Unfortunately , shortly after their rise to prominence , the government , acting on the behalf of corporate interests , began engaging in a campaign of repression and persecution of the Wobblies .
The Wobblies were fast becoming a formidable force in the labor movement and they were determined to put an end to it before it was too late .
Companies often employed Pinkerton agents or hired goons along with military troops and police provided by government connections as strikebreakers to attack and intimidate striking workers .
In one of the worst of many examples of labor clashes , 250 IWW members from Seattle travelled to Everett , Washington to protest restrictions on free speech and violent attacks on Wobblies by local police during a 1916 strike .
Their ferry was met at the dock by the local sheriff and about three hundred deputized strikebreakers .
When the Wobblies refused the sheriff 's orders to turn back , him and his " deputies " opened fire on the boat .
The union members returned fire and the ensuing melee resulted in eleven dead and twenty - seven wounded passengers ; plus two dead and twenty - four wounded on shore .
Things got even worse with the onset of the First World War .
Opponents took advantage of the IWW 's anarchist , socialist , and anti-war beliefs ; as well as their close affiliation with immigrants to strike at its membership .
Beginning in 1917 , IWW union halls throughout the country were raided by Justice Department agents and hundreds of Wobblies were arrested .
They were charged with acts in violation of the newly passed Espionage
Act including conspiring to hinder the draft , encourage desertion , incite revolution , and intimidate others in connection with labor disputes .
The government used wartime hysteria to justify the imprisonment or deportation of thousands of IWW members .
In addition , portrayals of the Wobblies in government and corporate propaganda as " enemy aliens " and traitors for their opposition to American involvement in WWI led to many Wobblies being attacked by vigilante mobs .
In Butte , Montana ; Frank Little , a member of the IWW General Executive Board , was kidnapped by six masked men and lynched for criticizing the war .
Wesley Everest was beaten , castrated , lynched , and shot ( the most complicated suicide ever ! ) in Centralia , Washington by a mob after being arrested following a gunbattle between Wobblies and a group of war veterans , who had attacked the local IWW union hall during an Armistice Day Parade .
Many other Wobblies throughout the country were beaten , maimed , or killed by police officials and / or vigilante mobs ( often composed of thugs hired by business owners ) .
However , not all the Wobblies ' problems were external .
Even as the government was using the public 's fear of communism to validate their oppressive actions ; the IWW was experiencing its own internal struggle over communism .
Historically , divisions had always existed between Communists and Anarchists , the two main groups comprising the IWW , involving statism .
While the two groups had , for the most part , been able to coexist prior to WWI , the combination of a lack of leadership , brought about by the government repression .
and the success of the Russian Revolution brought those divisions to the forefront .
In 1920 , the IWW suspended the Philadelphia Longshoreman 's Local no. 8 , one of it 's largest and most celebrated branches , over false allegations by a communist rival that they had supplied weapons to anti-Bolshevik forces in Europe .
Erosion of membership continued in the early 20's as some members began to leave to join communist organizations .
Soon , the remaining communist members began pushing for the IWW to align itself with the Red International of Trade Unions ( also called the Profintern ) , a Soviet created organization of worldwide communist labor unions .
Anarchist members , who disagreed with communism 's statist approach and the abuses under communist rule in Russia , resisted these efforts .
Further defections were caused by increases in criticisms of Soviet leaders and policies being printed in the Industrial Worker and other Wobbly publications .
Finally in 1924 , there was a rift between Wobblies in the eastern states , who favored centralized control of the union and political involvement , and those in the west , who favored more localized control and organizing on the job .
This led to a second union headquarters being set up in Utah and claims from both them and the original in Chicago as the " real - IWW , " including two separate IWW union halls in many towns .
While the western branch of the IWW had folded by 1930 , this split , along with the passage of the Taft - Hartley Act of 1947 , which severely restricted the tactics the Wobblies traditionally employed in disputes , contributed to the IWW quickly declining in membership during the next decades .
Though they never actually broke up the Wobblies numbers and influence steadily decreased until they became a largely forgotten footnote in labor history .
That is until recently , when they have begun to gain ground amongst young politically active workers .
Yard Trimmings being used as “ ADC ” at the Bradley Landfill in Sun Valley
Our neighborhood comrade Tara Kolla , who grows sweet peas for farmer ’s markets in her urban backyard , has been busted for . . . composting !
Specifically for composting fruit and vegetable scraps from a local restaurant .
From last Friday ’s Los Angeles Times :
Tara Kolla said she was doing a good thing for her Silver Lake Farms business while doing the right thing for the planet by filling a garbage can each week with produce scraps from a nearby restaurant and dumping them into her compost .
A neighbor did not see it that way and complained about the compost , which Kolla has in two wood boxes covered with black plastic .
“ I did n’t put it here to offend anyone .
I put it here because it ’s a work area , ” Kolla said one morning as she showed a visitor her half - acre urban farm , where she grows flowers as well as some other crops to sell at farmers markets in Echo Park , Hollywood and Silver Lake .
In August , Kolla received a letter from the Los Angeles Local Enforcement Agency telling her to “ cease and desist ” composting food waste that was not generated at her home .
The letter was signed by David Thompson , the agency ’s program supervisor , who declined to talk on the record .
But a city spokeswoman said there would be no additional action taken if there are no more complaints .
It turns out it ’s against the law to compost material not generated at your own residence .
So when you take back that bag of coffee grounds from Starbucks to put in your compost pile you ’re an outlaw .
It ’s a law that benefits the status quo , where the the city and private contractors haul away all that perfectly good organic matter that could be nourishing our neighborhood gardens , parks , and street trees and stuff it in . . . the dump .
There ’s a dirty little secret with what happens to the organic matter we all some of us put in the green bin ( a trash can provided by the city some municipalities to separate out yard trimmings ) in the city of Los Angeles and many other municipalities .
According to a friend of mine who works in the recycling business , 80 % of the green bin contents in Los Angeles ( county ? )
[ Editors note : see neighborhood colleague , and fellow “ trash geek ” Jeremy Drake ’s correction in the comments section .
Drake says that LA City does not use green bin contents as ADC .
My friend may have been refering to LA County waste practices . ] are used as “ Alternative Daily Cover ” or ADC .
ADC , which in addition to yard waste can consist of all kinds of things including broken glass and construction materials are used to cover up trash dumped into landfills .
So while our friend Tara gets busted for composting , some cities go about taking the same perfectly good organic matter and toss it into the dump along with the rest of our garbage .
The green bin is a sham , but it gets worse .
According to Mayor Sam’s Sister City , classifying waste as ADC “ allows dump operators to escape paying State per ton fees which in turn are used for State recycling and enforcement programs . ”
There ’s a opportunity in this composting kerfuffle for an elegant solution .
Anyone who gardens in the city knows how important , and sometimes difficult , it is to get enough organic matter .
How about regional composting facilities ?
Instead of trucking organic matter from restaurants and yards to far - off dumps ( and generating tons of diesel particulate matter on those long hauls ) , how about we compost it closer to home ?
We ’ll need skilled workers for this , perfect in a time of rising unemployment .
This is precisely what our friend Nance Klehm does in Chicago , taking the waste from 6,000 daily meals at the Pacific Garden Mission and , with a large worm composting operation , turning that waste into prized worm compost which is sold at a farmer ’s market .
The operation is staffed with homeless clients from the Mission .
Waste is reduced , gardeners get compost , homeless people get work and everyone benefits .
Now let ’s change these silly composting laws and get to work . . .
[ Editors note–Tara had a correction to the LA Times story –she does not “ dump ” stuff in her compost pile , but skillfully and responsibly layers green and brown materials .
You can take a compost class from her at the Norman Harrington / Franklin Hills Community Garden .

Researchers , including lawyers and economists , have begun examining ugliness , suggesting that the subject has been marginalized in history and that discrimination against the unattractive is a silent , widespread injustice .
Researchers have tried to measure appearance discrimination or " uglyism " and " looksism , " and the impact of what they call the " beauty premium " and the " plainness penalty " on income .
" Beauty and the Labor Market , " a study published in the American Economic Review in 1994 , estimated that unattractive men and women earn five to ten percent less than those considered attractive or beautiful , and that less attractive women marry men with less money .
Another study conducted by Tanya Rosenblat , an associate professor of economics , said " people who are physically attractive might develop better communication skills because the tendency is that from an early age they get more attention from all their caregivers , including their own mothers onward .
The conclusion : discrimination based on looks occurs across occupations .
Currently , few laws prohibit employment discrimination based on lack of attractiveness , although some cities , have passed ordinances banning discrimination based on looks including San Francisco and Santa Cruz .
Correctly observed , legal actions on behalf of the unattractive can be complicated for at least the following reasons :
1 . Most people in general would want to disclaim membership .
It is not likely that " members " will admit " I am an ugly person and let 's have a meeting of all ugly people . "
Being ugly is unlike being of a particular race or religion .
2 . There is no agreement on what makes someone ugly .
As " beauty is in the eye of the beholder , " the same is true with " ugliness . "
So defining ugliness is difficult as is defining beauty .
These complications , however , have little effect on the persistent research into differential treatment on the basis of looks .
Steadily playing off of insecurities and implications , Dr. Synnott states : " Beautiful people are considered to be more intelligent , sexier , and more trustworthy .
And this implies that ugly people are assumed to be less trustworthy and less intelligent . "
One study that looked into the earning power of law students graduating from the same law school during the 70s and 80s determined that five years after graduation , males who ranked one notch above average ( on a scale of 1 to 5 , with 5 being best looking ) earned about 10 % more than fellow students who ranked one notch below average .
Fifteen years after graduation , the premium for good looks grew to 12 % .
The study found that the pay differential was consistent for lawyers working in both the private and public sectors .
This might explain why I have never been able to negotiate a higher salary as a lawyer .

Iceland will be put on a fast track to joining the European Union to rescue the small Arctic state from financial collapse amid rising expectations that it will apply for membership within months , senior policy - makers in Brussels and Reykjavik have told the Guardian .
The European commission is preparing itself for a membership bid , depending on the outcome of a snap general election expected in May .
An application would be viewed very favourably in Brussels and the negotiations , which normally take many years , would be fast - forwarded to make Iceland the EU 's 29th member in record time , probably in 2011 .
Olli Rehn , the European commissioner in charge of enlargement , said : " The EU prefers two countries joining at the same time rather than individually .
If Iceland applies shortly and the negotiations are rapid , Croatia and Iceland could join the EU in parallel .
On Iceland , I hope I will be busier .
It is one of the oldest democracies in the world and its strategic and economic positions would be an asset to the EU . "
Rehn 's support for swift Icelandic membership was echoed by senior European diplomats in Brussels .
" We would like to see Iceland join the EU , " said one .
The current and next holders of the EU presidency , the Czechs and then the Swedes , are also strong supporters of EU enlargement and will deploy their agenda - setting powers to help Iceland .
The conservative government in Reykjavik , in power for 18 years , collapsed this week , the first government to fall as a result of the financial meltdown which has wrecked the Icelandic currency , the krona , wiped out savings and pensions , required a massive IMF bailout , sparked unprecedented riots in Reykjavik , and forced the formation of a caretaker centre - left government until new elections can be held , probably on 9 May .
EU membership will be a central theme of the election campaign , with the social democrats - the senior partner in the coalition interim government with the anti-EU Left Greens - pushing to join the EU and to swap the krona for the single European currency as soon as possible .
" The krona is dead .
We need a new currency .
The only serious option is the euro , " said a senior Icelandic official .
The financial disaster in Iceland has triggered extreme volatility among voters .
While there is support for joining the euro as a currency safe haven to protect Iceland from a battering by the markets , there is less enthusiasm for full EU membership , particularly among those in the vital fishing sector .
This factor has fuelled talk of " unilateral euroisation " , meaning that Iceland might join or use the single currency without being admitted to the EU .
This is dismissed in Brussels as nonsense .
Though deeply indebted and in dire straits , the Icelandic economy is minuscule compared with the main EU member states and therefore unlikely to prove a destabilising force .
Iceland has already secured a multibillion pound IMF loan and is unlikely to prove a drain on the EU budget .
But joining the euro is a different question .
Despite growing sentiment in Iceland that Brussels and the single currency might be the remedy to the worst crisis the country has seen , the road to the euro is likely to be fraught with problems because of the strict rules governing the eurozone under the Maastrict treaty .
Although the economic and financial crisis has seen a loosening of the single currency rulebook , current Icelandic interest rates of 18 % would pose big problems for mainstream single currency members .
Already Christian Democrats in the Netherlands , the party of the prime minister , are coupling their hostility with Turkey 's membership of the EU to criticism of Iceland 's ambitions .
Such hostility might increase but senior figures in the European commission believe that Reykjavik brings more assets than liabilities to the EU .
The arrests and harassment of nonviolent protesters and journalists covering the Republican National Convention demands a full investigation .
We call upon the elected officials of Minneapolis and St. Paul to immediately launch an investigation of all law enforcement agencies involved in policing the RNC .
Nonviolent protesters exercising their First Amendment rights and independent journalists were targeted by police , subjected to pre-emptive raids , pepper - sprayed , arrested en masse in sweeps and detained without probable cause for extended periods .
In addition there have been numerous complaints of brutality directed against arrestees held in the Ramsey County jail .
We call on the mayors of the Twin Cities , the Minneapolis and St. Paul City Councils , and all of the local authorities to fully investigate these aggressive and violent tactics .
The same police agencies that violated the First and Fourth Amendment rights of arrestees cannot be allowed to investigate themselves .
Arresting and detaining nonviolent activists for exercising their Constitutional rights and journalists for doing their jobs is a gross violation of free speech and freedom of the press .
Civic minded citizens and journalists must be free to assemble , free to speak and free to report the news - without intimidation .

17 : Manna Storehouse
7 : The Stowers tell their story .
Our earlier post “ ODA ‘ swats ’ Manna Storehouse co-op ” is proving to be tremendously popular .
Following up some of the traffic sources and ping - backs I eventually found more details on the story , which is looking more and more bizarre .
Here ’s some of what Berit Kjos is saying about it over on the True Discernment blog .
From the looks of things , somebody up there must think Amish farmers are more of a threat than those “ terrorists ” we hear so much about .
“ On Monday , December 1 , a SWAT team with semi-automatic rifles entered the private home of the Stowers family in LaGrange , Ohio , herded the family onto the couches in the living room , and kept guns trained on parents , children , infants and toddlers , from approximately 11 AM to 8 PM .
The team was aggressive and belligerent .
The children were quite traumatized .
At some point , the “ bad cop ” SWAT team was relieved by another team , a “ good cop ” team that tried to befriend the family .
The Stowers family has run a very large , well - known food cooperative called Manna Storehouse on the western side of the greater Cleveland area for many years .
There were agents from the Department of Agriculture present , one of them identified as Bill Lesho .
The search warrant is reportedly supicious - looking .
Agents began rifling through all of the family ’s possessions , a task that lasted hours and resulted in a complete upheaval of every private area in the home .
Many items were taken that were not listed on the search warrant .
The family was not permitted a phone call , and they were not told what crime they were being charged with .
They were not read their rights .
Over ten thousand dollars worth of food was taken , including the family ’s personal stock of food for the coming year .
All of their computers , and all of their cell phones were taken , as well as phone and contact records .
The food cooperative was virtually shut down .
There was no rational explanation , nor justification , for this extreme violation of Constitutional rights .
Presumably Manna Storehouse might eventually be charged with running a retail establishment without a license .
Why then the Gestapo - type interrogation for a 3rd degree misdemeanor charge ?
This incident has raised the ominous specter of a restrictive new era in State regulation and enforcement over the nation ’s private food supply .
This same type of abusive search and seizure was reported by those innocents who fell victim to oppressive federal drug laws passed in the 1990s .
The present circumstance raises the obvious question : is there some rabid new interpretation of an existing drug law that considers food a controlled substance worthy of a nasty SWAT operation ?
Or worse , is there a previously unrecognized provision (s ) pertaining to food in the Homeland Security measures ?
Some have suggested that it was merely an out - of - control , hot - to - trot ODA agent , and , if so , this would be a best - case scenario .
Anything else might spell the beginning of the end for the freedom to eat unregulated and unmonitored food … . ”
“ …. The issue appears to be the discovery of a bit of non-institutional beef in an Oberlin College food service freezer a year ago that was tracked down by a county sanitation official to Manna Storehouse .
Oberlin College ’s student food coop is widely known for its strident ideological stance about eating organic foods .
It seems that the Oberlin student food cooperative had joined the Manna Storehouse food cooperative in order to buy organic foods in bulk from the national organic food distributor United , which services buying clubs across the nation .
The sanitation official , James Boddy , evidently contacted the Ohio Department of Agriculture .
After the first contact by state ODA officials , Manna Storehouse reportedly wrote them a letter requesting assistance and guidelines for complying with the law .
This letter was never answered .
Rather , the ODA agent tried several times to infiltrate the coop , as described above .
When his attempts failed , the SWAT team showed up !
Food cooperatives and buying clubs have been an active part of the American landscape for over a generation .
In the 1970s , with the rise of the organic food industry ( a direct outgrowth of the hippie back - to - nature movement ) food coops started up all over the country .
These were groups of people who freely associated for the purpose of combining their buying power so that they could order organic food items in bulk and case lots .
Anyone who was part of these coops in the early era will remember the messy breakdown of 35 pounds of peanut butter and 5 gallon drums of honey !…
“ …. The state of Ohio boasts the second largest Amish population in the country .
Many of the Amish live on acreages where they raise their own food , not unlike Manna Storehouse , and sell off the extras to neighbors and church members .
There is a sense of foreboding that this state crackdown on a longstanding , reputable food cooperative operation could adversely impact the peaceful agrarian way of life not only for the Amish , but homeschoolers and those families living off the land on rural acreages .
It raises the disturbing possibility that it could become a crime to raise your own food , buy eggs from the farmer down the road , or butcher your own chickens for family and friends – bustling activities that routinely take place in backwater America .
The freedom to purchase food directly form the source is increasingly under attack .
For those who have food allergies and chemical intolerances , or who are on special medical diets , this is becoming a serious health issue .
Will Americans retain the right to purchase food that is uncontaminated by pesticides , herbicides , allergens , additives , dyes , preservatives , MSG , GMOs , radiation , etc . ?
The melamine scare from China underscores the increasingly inferior and suspect quality of modern processed institutional foods …. ”

NEW : Manna Storehouse raid part 5 –DEEPER DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE
DEC 16 UPDATE : Manna Storehouse # 6
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke on Tuesday suggested the incoming Obama administration may want to retool the government ’s approach to fighting the credit crisis and tap a $ 700 billion ( £ 482 billion ) financial rescue fund to sop up bad assets on the books of banks .
In his first policy speech since early December , Bernanke said that while an expected U.S. fiscal stimulus package could provide a “ significant boost ” to the economy , the government may need to inject more capital into banks and consider steps to clear the financial system of toxic mortgage - related debt .
“ Fiscal actions are unlikely to promote a lasting recovery unless they are accompanied by strong measures to further stabilise and strengthen the financial system , ” Bernanke said at the London School of Economics .
U.S. President - elect Barack Obama , who takes office in a week , is pressing a sceptical Congress to let his Treasury Department access the remaining $ 350 billion .
Bernanke said the government could consider using the money to buy up bad debt , as originally intended , or could offer asset guarantees or set up a so - called bad bank to take over the assets as a way to strengthen a shattered financial system and help the U.S. economy pull out of its year - long recession .
“ The presence of these assets significantly increases uncertainty about the underlying value of these institutions and may inhibit both new private investment and new lending , ” Bernanke said .
John Bovenzi , chief operating officer for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp , told a congressional panel removing bad assets from bank balance sheets should be “ a key component ” of how the final $ 350 billion in bailout funds is used .
A rising tide of U.S. mortgage delinquencies has saddled the global banking system with distressed assets , choking off lending and sending many economies tumbling .
Outgoing U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Bernanke had pressed Congress in September to approve the $ 700 billion bailout fund so the government could buy up the bad debts to stave off a financial calamity .
Paulson , however , quickly turned his focus towards purchasing equity in banks , which he has argued was a quicker way to shore up the system .
FED STILL HAS ‘POWERFUL TOOLS ’
Bernanke said how governments respond to the financial crisis would determine the timing and strength of recovery , and he stressed that the Fed still had ‘ powerful tools ’ to deploy even though it has cut benchmark interest rates to near zero .
When the U.S. central bank dropped overnight rates to a range of zero to 0.25 percent in December , it said monetary policy would now focus on the size of its balance sheet , which has exploded as officials pumped funds into stressed markets .
Analysts have said the Fed ’s policy marks a form of ‘ quantitative easing ’ of the sort Japan employed earlier this decade to break free of a persistent deflation .

Bernanke , however , sought to differentiate the Fed ’s “ credit - easing ” approach with the policy pursued in Japan .
“ The Federal Reserve ’s credit - easing approach focuses on the mix of loans and securities that it holds and on how this composition of assets affects credit conditions for businesses and households , ” he said .
In contrast , the Bank of Japan focussed on the quantity of bank reserves .
This difference means the U.S. strategy does not lend itself to targeting the quantity of excess bank reserves or the money supply , Bernanke said .

DON ’T WORRY ABOUT INFLATION
In outlining the Fed ’s emergency tools , Bernanke said a program to support consumer and small business credit , which will begin providing loans to investors next month , could be expanded or widened to cover additional classes of securities .
He also reiterated that the Fed was considering buying longer - term government debt .
Some analysts have warned that the Fed ’s aggressive efforts may end up fuelling inflation .
Bernanke , however , played down that concern , noting that many of the Fed ’s lending facilities will wind down as demand for the money winds down .
With many of the assets held short - term in nature , a “ significant shrinking ” of the Fed ’s balance sheet could happen quickly , he said .
“ We see little risk of inflation in the near term ; indeed , we expect inflation to continue to moderate , ” Bernanke said .
In answer to a question , Bernanke said he was expecting the economy to stabilise later this year , but suggested it could take longer for the labour - market to heal .
“ I am hopeful that later in 2009 , depending on factors , particularly including financial and credit markets , we should begin to see some stabilization in the economy .
It takes a while though for labour markets to recover . ”
President Obama chose a Saudi - funded television network today for his first interview aimed at an Arab audience , passing over the U.S. government ’s own heavily - funded Alhurra station .
Obama ’s predecessor pumped more than $ 500 million into Alhurra , which has been plagued by serious staff problems , financial mismanagement and long - standing concerns inside the U.S. government and Congress regarding its content .
The president ’s decision to go with Al Arabiya led several media watchers to wonder whether Alhurra would continue to receive the same kind of cash flow from the Obama administration as it enjoyed under former president Bush .
" I am curious whether the choice of Al Arabiya signals the administration 's abandonment of the U.S. - funded Alhurra satellite channel , " wrote Michael Rubin , in National Review Online .
Marc Lynch , a professor at George Washington University , wrote on Foreign Policy magazine ’s Web site that " Obama 's choice to give his ground - breaking interview to the Saudi Al Arabiya and not to the American Alhurra is as clear a statement as it is possible to make of Alhurra 's failure .
It 's time to face the facts and clean house to recoup some of that investment , " he wrote .
The Bush Administration ’s public diplomacy efforts have long drawn criticism from Democrats , and Obama signaled shortly after his election that he was contemplating major changes in that arena .
" I think we ’ve got a unique opportunity to reboot America ’s image around the world and also in the Muslim world in particular , ’’ Obama told reporters in early December .
Alhurra , and its sister radio station , Radio Sawa , were meant to showcase U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and compete with Al Jazeera and other networks such as Al Arabiya , which interviewed Obama Tuesday .
But Alhurra has come under Congressional scrutiny and has been unable to win a desired audience share .
Last month , news anchors at Alhurra swapped out brightly - colored outfits for black suits as a demonstration of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza who were under Israeli fire during weeks of fighting there .
Alhurra broadcasts to the Middle East , but its
Web site carried streaming video of the anchors , wearing black suits on air at their news desk and during reports on the fighting .
Two people with direct knowledge of the incident said Alhurra managers had instructed anchors to halt the practice at the beginning of the new year and were conducting an informal review of the incident .
Deirdre Kline , a spokeswoman for Alhurra , did not return phone messages or e-mails seeking comment .
She also did not respond to requests for comment regarding a nascent inquiry by the State Department ’s inspector general ’s office regarding several complaints of financial mismanagement at Radio Sawa .
Two people involved in the inquiry said it began after concerns were raised that money was missing from the station ’s Baghdad bureau .
Alhurra has cost U.S. taxpayers more than half a billion dollars in five years and has been the subject of an ongoing ProPublica investigation that began in partnership with CBS News ’
60 Minutes last June .
It sparked several Congressional inquiries and a State Department investigation of Alhurra ’s parent company , The Middle East Broadcasting Networks .
Since then , a study commissioned by the U.S. government concluded that Alhurra has failed to meet basic journalistic standards .
The study by researchers connected to the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California was based on a review of a full month ’s broadcasts by Alhurra , the 24 - hour news network .
" The quality of Alhurra ’s journalism is substandard on several levels , " the researchers wrote .
Its broadcasts " lack appropriate balance and sourcing , " and " relied on unsubstantiated information too often , allowed on - air expressions of personal judgments too frequently and failed to present opposing views in over 60 percent of its news stories . "
" Our diagnosis is that Alhurra is not performing at the level that it needs to reach to be successful , " the authors said .
After the study was completed , Obama chose the Dean of the Annenberg School , Ernest J. Wilson III , to review Alhurra and other U.S. government broadcasting efforts for the new administration .
Al - Jazeera , which the Bush administration publicly blamed for inflaming anti-American sentiment in the Arab world , remains the most popular news network in the Arab world .
Al Arabiya is No. 2 for audience share .
Viewership polls , including one conducted last year by the University of Maryland found that Alhurra ’s pan -Arab broadcast is one of the least viewed in the Middle East , with an audience share of just 2 percent across the region .
Dell will pay US$ 3.85 million to 46 U.S. states under a settlement agreement involving allegations that the company used deceptive practices to sell its products .
As part of the settlement , Dell will provide restitution to customers who experienced problems with the company 's financing promotions , rebate offers , technical support and repair policies , according to state attorneys general .
The company will pay $ 1.5 million to a restitution account and the rest to the states to reimburse legal costs and other expenses , said Dell , which did not admit to wrongdoing .
States started investigating Dell 's sales practices after receiving complaints on an array of issues .
Some customers never received rebates they were promised , while those who applied for zero - percent financing were charged higher interest rates .
Some consumers also had trouble obtaining warranty service on their Dell PCs , according to the Washington State Attorney General 's Office .
" The deals Dell made and the terms computer buyers thought they agreed to did n't always compute , " said Washington Assistant Attorney General Katherine Tassi in a written statement .
Customers are eligible for restitution if they purchased a Dell product between April 1 , 2005 , and April 13 , 2009 , and have a complaint addressed by the agreement .
Consumers must file their claims by April 13 .
The issues represented only a small percentage of the tens of millions of Dell consumer transactions in the states during the four - year period , Dell said in a statement .
" Dell had previously addressed the issues directly with many of the customers involved and many were satisfactorily resolved prior to the states ' involvement , " the company said .
Dell has also agreed to provide further disclosures to make sure that customers are fully informed about its financing and service offers .
" This settlement ensures that Dell consumers will receive full disclosure concerning Dell 's promotional offers and provides for changes in Dell 's business practices that will aid consumers in making informed choices about purchasing Dell products and services , " Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley said in a statement .
The states involved in the settlement are Alabama , Alaska , Arizona , Arkansas , California , Colorado , Connecticut , Delaware , Florida , Hawaii , Idaho , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , Michigan , Mississippi , Missouri , Montana , Nebraska , Nevada , New Jersey , New Mexico , North Carolina , North Dakota , Oregon , Ohio , Oklahoma , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , South Carolina , South Dakota , Tennessee , Texas , Utah , Washington , West Virginia , Vermont , Virginia and Wisconsin .
It took 19 months , a few thousand dollars , multiple doctors ’ visits , and the help of a private lawyer for my wife Justyna to finally live and work in the United States legally .
Our story was enraging and expensive , but it ’s sadly not unique ; of all the problems facing our country right now , legal immigration is perhaps the most under - recognized and embarrassing , but it should also be one of the easiest to fix .
And yet our government drags its feet on this issue , perpetuating a broken , money - sucking system that ’s fundamentally un-American in its disdain for motivated foreigners .
A wealth of complicated , divisive decisions await the president - elect , but he could make a positive mark early on by streamlining our legal immigration process and saving less fortunate families from the demoralizing maze my wife and I recently endured .
I met Justyna while studying abroad in London in 2005 .
She is Polish by birth but had been living , working , and attending school in the United Kingdom for over two years at the time .
With only an easily obtained student visa , I enjoyed the same privileges , including England ’s national health care system — a resource that proved especially useful when Justyna became pregnant in the spring of 2006 .
We decided that I would return to America and finish my degree while she would go home to Poland to have the baby near her family .
With the intention of bringing my wife to America after the birth of our child , I filed an I - 129f Petition for Fiance (e ) visa in October 2006 .
Thus began our protracted and degrading experience with the United States Customs and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) .
The I - 129f petition requires multiple copies of biographical information , passport photos , an affidavit of support including very personal financial information , a statement of intent , and proof that the intended parties have met before .
It also costs hundreds of dollars .
Once we had mailed the I - 129f to Warsaw , my wife was summoned , despite the embassy ’s knowledge that she was caring for a newborn , to take a six - hour train ride for a series of highly invasive medical checkups and interviews about her intentions , her relationship to me , and our daughter ’s background .
All this was required despite our thorough Polish documentation stating I was the father .
Once it became clear that my wife and daughter would be able to join me in the U.S. , her sisters and mother applied for tourist visas to attend our wedding in June 2007 .
All five family members who applied were rejected .
The USCIS ’s Byzantine series of applications , interviews , and background checks is designed to ensure that every visa holder has sufficient impetus to eventually return to their home country .
Yet even my mother - in - law , a 59 - year - old Szczecin native who speaks no English , has never left Poland , owns an apartment , and has been married for over 30 years , was not allowed into the U.S. to witness her own daughter ’s wedding .
We were married nonetheless , and subsequently began the Adjustment of Status process , which required us to resubmit many forms , my wife to undergo another biometrics exam , and another $ 1010 .
We sent the application to Chicago , only to receive notice that these cases were handled by the Nebraska office .
Nebraska also sent it back , telling us to mail it to Chicago .
We contacted a lawyer soon thereafter .
Legal counsel was a great help , but even the most knowledgeable bureaucratic Sherpa ca n’t anticipate the often bottomless depths of American governmental ineptitude .
In July 2008 , we received word that the Department of State needed another copy of Justyna ’s medical forms , the very same ones we had already filed on two separate occasions .
They admitted to losing it , yet still instructed us to complete the $ 300 checkup and documentation procedure ourselves , within 90 days .
When I asked our lawyer whether an appeal could be made , he said of course , but the process would take longer than 90 days and Justyna ’s entire file would be thrown out after that deadline .
If this sounds like a farce , it is .
Here is a woman who has made the incomparable sacrifices of leaving her home country , her family , and her friends just to bring her new family together under one roof .
The U.S. should be begging people like Justyna — who holds a master ’s degree and desires only to work legally and pay the according taxes here — to live and raise their families within our borders , yet our government makes it humiliating and nearly impossible for them to do so .
Unfortunately , my wife and I are not an exceptional case , and a number of unsettling immigration - related national incidents concurred with our own struggles .
In response to an early - 2007 surge in citizenship applications , for example , USCIS Director Emilio Gonzalez announced in February 2008 that thousands of files would n’t be reviewed in time for applicants to vote in the upcoming presidential election .
They too were the victims of a mind - boggling bureaucracy that seems to view every would - be citizen and legal alien with scorn rather than welcome .
The efforts of public servants like California Rep .
Zoe Lofgren to recapture these lost papers have also been routinely sabotaged by purportedly “ pro-immigration ” senators and congressmen who wish to impose even stricter limits on visa applications .
A thoughtful New York Times editorial names a few of the more egregious hypocrites ( including Iowa ’s Steve King and Alabama ’s Jeff Sessions ) who insist that prospective Americans go through the proper immigration channels , then recommend making those channels even more difficult than the illegal options .
A friend ’s father once told me about a Polish man he employs , who initially came to America by flying to Mexico and floating across the Rio Grande like so many illegals before him .
Years later , when Poland is now a longstanding member of the E.U. , I still would n’t blame a citizen of that country for choosing to swim .
As a nation , we literally cannot afford to maintain a system that makes it so hard for people to come live and work here .
We can already see the economic effects of this attitude : in 2007 , before our current financial panic undoubtedly made the situation worse , the Times reported an 11 - percent drop in British leisure and business travel to the United States since 2000 , despite the remarkable strength of the pound over the dollar .
The same article cites a study that blames “ time - consuming and sometimes rude Customs and Immigration procedures at airports and a poor image of the United States abroad for an overall 17 percent decline in overseas travel to the United States since late 2001 . ”
A properly reformed legal immigration policy would positively affect American tourism , the economy , and help stem the flow of illegal immigrants that so frightens the more xenophobic congressmen and citizens among us .
Democrats and Republicans alike ( at least any non-hypocritical ones ) would theoretically champion such reform , making it a worthy first step towards Obama ’s much - promised bipartisanship .
It would , in short , be a seemingly left - field but entirely appropriate first move for a president with Obama ’s full plate — a move that would redefine America ’s 21st - century attitude towards the rest of the world , allow for morale - building bipartisan consensus , and cut wasteful federal spending .
But regardless of the issue ’s timely relationship to a current crisis , we must start honoring America ’s origin as a nation of immigrants before the world ’s travelers and workers simply find more welcoming destinations .
My family ’s particular situation , one which is hardly unique in 2009 , would be better accommodated and respected in the U.K. , and the option of moving back there seemed more ideal with every bureaucratic hurdle we jumped for nearly two years .
How much longer can we reasonably expect people to fight for residency in a place that treats them so horribly ?
A relatively easy national infrastructure improvement awaits President Obama and the new 111th Congress if they want it .
Alternatively , they can allow xenophobia and hypocrisy to maintain their stranglehold on this issue , the continued mishandling of which is an embarrassment to all Americans whether they know it or not .

Abdalla El Badri said $ 50 a barrel would be too cheap
The price of oil has to rise to between $ 60 and $ 80 a barrel to safeguard investments , according to the bosses of oil cartel Opec and top energy firms .
The downturn had resulted in " dangerous demand destruction " , said Opec Secretary - General Abdalla El Badri .
He said Opec would cut production further , if prices did not recover .
BP boss Tony Hayward said a $ 60 to $ 80 price range would meet both Opec 's needs and cover the cost of investing in difficult oil exploration projects .
The energy industry would have to invest $ 25 trillion over the next 20 years , he said during a session at the World Economic Forum in Davos .
" The price of oil has to be high enough to motivate investment going forward . "
El Badri says even an oil price of $ 50 a barrel is too low .
Read Davos live event page " When the economy picks up , demand will pick up very fast and we will quickly run into supply problems , " said the BP group chief executive .
" We do need a price that allows us to continue to invest in the downturn . "
Speculators ?
Mr El Badri agreed : " A $ 50 price will not allow us to invest .
If we do n't invest now , then we will store up a problem in three years from now when your demand picks up . "
With demand falling sharply , Opec had already cut its production several times , and its members were on track to meet the lower targets by 15 February .
But he said he had not been " not happy " with last year 's record price of $ 147 a barrel either .
" This was not based on any fundamentals . "
He blamed speculators and investors fleeing the US sub - prime mortgage market for last year 's soaring oil prices .
There had been no shortage of supply , he said .
Energy mix Pierre Gadonneix , the chief executive of French energy giant EDF , agreed with the price range proposed by Tony Hayward , but said investments would have to be made regardless of the economic downturn .
" If we invest ... it 's for decades , " he said .
" We can invest now , the long - term perspective of the energy sector has nothing to do with the current downturn . "
" We know the economy will start again - whether in months or years - so we should invest now . "
While there was some agreement on price , the session at the World Economic Forum also showed the fault lines between producers , energy firms and consumers .
While Mr Gadonneix and Mr Hayward called for a diverse energy mix of oil , coal and renewables ( and in case of Mr Gadonneix for nuclear ) , Mr El Badri bristled at the suggestion that Opec would be treated as a " back - up " source of energy .
Opec members could not be asked to invest into oil production just to fill the gaps should energy diversification not work .
Consumers
While high prices may make sense for oil producers , they create huge social problems , especially in the countries that will be the main drivers for energy demand , India and China , warned Mukesh Ambani , chairman of India 's Reliance Industries .
Reliance is an active player in oil and gas exploration , and about to start delivering gas worth an oil equivalent of 600,000 barrels a day from fields on the east coast of India .
" Oil is important for the prosperity of our people , " he said .
Consumers in emerging markets needed " affordable energy " to achieve " quality of life " .
Mr Ambani also appeared to blame speculators for high oil prices , noting that for every barrel produced , 30 had been traded on world markets .
He called for global regulation to make energy markets transparent , " where one knows whose money it is , who is buying and selling " .

The move , due to be finalised at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels , will bring the bloc 's Zimbabwe sanctions list to more than 200 people and 40 companies , by adding government members and relatives of Mr Mugabe 's allies .
EU ministers will also step up pressure on Mr Mugabe by urging a probe into whether diamond sales are being used to support his government .
Until the end , Christine Maggiore remained defiant .
On national television and in a blistering book , she denounced research showing that HIV causes AIDS .
She refused to take medications to treat her own virus .
She gave birth to two children and breast - fed them , denying any risk to their health .
And when her 3 - year - old child , Eliza Jane , died of what the coroner determined to be AIDS - related pneumonia , she protested the findings and sued the county .
On Saturday , Maggiore died at her Van Nuys home , leaving a husband , a son and many unanswered questions .
She was 52 .
According to officials at the Los Angeles County coroner ’s office , she had been treated for pneumonia in the last six months .
Because she had recently been under a doctor ’s care , no autopsy will be performed unless requested by the family , they said .
Her husband , Robin Scovill , could not be reached for comment .
Jay Gordon , a pediatrician whom the family consulted when Eliza Jane was sick , said Monday that Maggiore ’s death was an “ unmitigated tragedy . ”
“ In the event that she died of AIDS - related complications , there are medications to prevent this , ” said Gordon , who disagrees with Maggiore ’s views and believes HIV causes AIDS .
“ There are medications that enable people who are HIV - positive to lead healthy , normal , long lives . ”
Diagnosed with HIV in 1992 , Maggiore plunged into AIDS volunteer work -- at AIDS Project Los Angeles , L.A. Shanti and Women at Risk .
Her background commanded attention .
A well - spoken , middle - class woman , she was soon being asked to speak about the risks of HIV at local schools and health fairs .
“ At the time , ” Maggiore told The Times in 2005 , “ I felt like I was doing a good thing . ”
All that changed in 1994 , she said , when she spoke to UC Berkeley biology professor Peter Duesberg , whose well - publicized views on AIDS -- including assertions that its symptoms can be caused by recreational drug use and malnutrition -- place him well outside the scientific mainstream .
Intrigued , Maggiore began scouring the literature about the underlying science of HIV .
She came to believe that flu shots , pregnancy and common viral infections could lead to a positive test result .
She later detailed those claims in her book , “ What if Everything You Thought You Knew About AIDS Was Wrong ? ”
Maggiore started Alive & Well AIDS Alternatives , a nonprofit that challenges “ common assumptions ” about AIDS .
She also had a regular podcast about the topic .
Her supporters expressed shock Monday over her death but were highly skeptical that it was caused by AIDS .
And they said it would not stop them from questioning mainstream thinking .
“ Why did she remain basically healthy from 1992 until just before her death ? ” asked David Crowe , who served with Maggiore for a number of years on the board of the nonprofit Rethinking AIDS .
“ I think it ’s certain that people who promote the establishment view of AIDS will declare that she died of AIDS and will attempt to use this to bring people back in line .
But you can only learn so much from an unfortunate death . ”
Brian Carter , who facilitated local peer groups with Maggiore , said the movement would remain strong .
“ Christine was only part of this .
There is an outstanding number of prominent rethinkers , independent thinkers , doctors , scientists , lawyers who question AIDS causation . ”
Though they run counter to the scientific consensus about AIDS , such beliefs can have a major effect .
In South Africa , where about 5.7 million people live with HIV , the government refused until 2005 to fund antiretroviral treatment , citing questions about the effectiveness of the drugs that inhibit the replication of HIV .
Federal health officials and other experts say the link between HIV and AIDS has been shown in hundreds of studies and the prescription of antiretroviral drugs has helped reduce the pandemic to a chronic but manageable disease in the United States .
Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health calculated earlier this year that the South African government ’s delay in introducing treatment between 2000 and 2005 cost more than 330,000 lives in that country .
Craig Thompson , executive director of AIDS Project Los Angeles , said Maggiore was an effective and powerful advocate , in part because she was a woman living with HIV .
But he said her message discouraging testing and treatment was dangerous .
“ It ’s just really sad that she never could understand and never could trust the medical community , unlike the rest of the world , ” Thompson said .
Maggiore ’s friends said she underwent a holistic “ cleanse ” last month that left her feeling ill .
“ She was telling me that she was n’t feeling great , ” Carter said , adding that he questioned whether the pneumonia was related to AIDS .
As an advocate , Maggiore counseled HIV - positive pregnant women on how to avoid pressure to use the drug AZT as a method to reduce the chances of transmission to their babies .
She considered the drug toxic .
Maggoire gave birth to her son , Charlie , and his younger sister , Eliza Jane , at home and breast - fed both , although research indicates that it increases the risk of transmission .
Eliza Jane Scovill died in 2005 from what the coroner ruled was AIDS - related pneumonia .
Maggiore and Scovill , however , hired a pathologist who concluded that the girl died of an allergic reaction to the antibiotic amoxicillin .
After Eliza Jane ’s death , Los Angeles police investigated whether Maggiore and Scovill were negligent in not testing the girl for HIV .
In 2006 , the Los Angeles County district attorney ’s office decided not to file criminal charges against Maggiore , saying that it would have been difficult to prove criminal negligence because Maggiore had sought medical advice .
Friends said that Maggiore never fully recovered after the death of her daughter and that she had trouble even sleeping and eating .
Her preteen son , Charlie , has tested HIV negative .
Last year , Maggiore and Scovill sued Los Angeles County and others on behalf of their daughter ’s estate , charging that the autopsy report lacked proper medical and scientific evidence for the declared cause of death .
The case is pending .

The California Energy Commission hopes to end the burden of energy - inefficient plasma and LCD TVs on the state ’s power grid .
The regulations are expected to pass mid-2009 , and could be in full effect by 2013 .
Officials claim that the standards , once fully in place , would be a power gain equivalent to that of 87,000 homes .
On the flip side , if the regulations do pass , it will surely remove some TVs from store shelves and slightly boost sticker prices .
During peak viewing times , TVs use about 10 - percent of the power needed to power all of Southern California !
These gray areas in the market could lead consumers to outside markets via Amazon.com , or just some old - fashioned pillaging .
I have to say , maybe this is a good thing .
TV just makes kids fat and violent .
Also , plasma
TVs which hold very little market share use more than 3 - times as much energy !
And with sales of televisions growing by 4 million a year , that ’s kinda scary .
The regulations would be spread out over a two year period , where the first phase would take place in 2011 .
The final phase would take place in 2013 .
Needless to say , television manufacturers kinda thinks this sucks .
California has pioneered legislation like this before .
In fact , the federal government has adopted California ’s rules on everything from appliances to home insulation .

Mr Offen replied to Mrs Fletcher with an indignant email .
" It is quite clear that whatever we do you will not be happy with us , " he wrote .
Her attitude , he alleged , was tainted by " a vindictiveness which belies the spirit of Christmas , and it is both unusual and shocking when it concerns a mere lunch for four " .
The Alaska governor wants a high - priced deal to write her story , say reports
She may be back in Alaska , but Sarah Palin has a high - powered connection in Washington : the same lawyer who represented Barack Obama and both the Clintons when it came to their book deals .
D.C. attorney Robert Barnett has been retained by the former GOP vice - presidential candidate , 44 , to represent her as she tries to sell her own book , according to the Hollywood Reporter .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Laura Bush reportedly received $ 2 million for her highly anticipated White House memoir .
Hillary Clinton ’s 2003 bestseller , Living History , generated an $ 8 million advance .
TV Deal in the Works ?
Barnett – who has also brokered TV deals for Brian Williams , Lesley Stahl , Neil Cavuto , Christiane Amanpour and Dr. Sanjay Gupta – had no comment .
Immediately after the election , stories swirled that the telegenic Palin might be considering a TV career .
In the meantime , Palin , who is halfway through her first term as Alaska ’s governor , kicked off her State of the State Address Thursday night in Juneau by congratulating President Obama and saying that he is in her prayers .
Is the FDA dragging its feet these days ?
Well , it 's certainly missing lots of deadlines .
We all know by now that the agency did n't decide the fate of prasugrel , the Eli Lilly and Daiichi Sankyo blood thinner , by Sept. 26 as promised ; in fact , FDA still has n't decided almost a month later .
Today , the news is that the drug watchdog wo n't meet its October target date on TAK - 390 MR , a Takeda candidate for treating gastric reflux .
The company announced that the delay will last at least three months .
And those are just a couple of the latest examples .
Here 's a list of the rest of FDA 's delays this year :
Promacta , a GlaxoSmithKline treatment for a clotting disorder ; FDA missed the Sept. 19 deadline and has not yet made a decision

And finally , another recent example :
The FDA has said it will miss the Oct. 27 deadline on Takeda 's diabetes treatment alogliptin .
You 'll recall that earlier this year , the FDA warned that it would probably start missing deadlines because of a staffing crunch .
And observers have commented that the agency seems to be hesitant at the approval trigger , perhaps because it 's gun-shy after a variety of high - profile drug safety problems .
Meanwhile , the agency has been scrambling to fill vacant positions and bring on additional help .
Only time will tell whether the additional workers can speed up the process .

David McWilliams ( Irish economist ) has an article in which he all but said Ireland needs to leave the Euro to be able survive the recession .
Although I ’m somewhat disheartened by the disbelief in the mere mention of leaving the Euro ( in the articles comments ) I ’m glad we ’re on the same page .
Although we may not have to actually leave of our own free will , as of this moment there is a very high chance that we be flung from the Euro as the economic pariahs of the EU .
Events have moved fast since the announcing of the closing of Dell in Limerick and now Anglo Irish Bank ( the third largest bank in the country ) has been nationalised .
It seemed when the government began having a look into the institution to give it a € 1.5 Billion bailout package it found something much worse , something that € 1.5 Billion could n’t fix .
No big deal some may say , and in the whole scheme of things across the world this is now becoming the norm .
But here is the issue , in taking on this bank , the state has now taken on it ’s liabilities .
All €30 Billion of them .
This is now thrown on top of a € 40 Billion national dept .
Overnight ( literally as the takeover order was given Thursday night ) the national dept of the country has nearly doubled , and this is a dept which our country of 4 million does not have the resources to pay .
And on top of this there is at least another of the banks that are likely to follow Anglo Irish in the space of a few months .
The debts being taken on are far greater than the entire state is capable of paying , the Irish government has followed Iceland into this grey abyss .
Instead of letting the bank fail the government has caused the state to fail .
So what might happen , there are a few possibilities .
We get a bailed out by the ECB and other EU countries .
We get kicked out of the Euro .
We go to the IMF for help ( either in or out of the Euro ) .
In the first case Europe may try to use us as an example of the stability and power of the Euro and bail us out .
But it would effectively mean that the EU owns Ireland and would expect the country to tow the line in future EU issues .
Effectively the country would lose it ’s indepenedence .
The second case the EU decides to toss us out of the Euro , Ireland reverts to the Punt and begins massive currency devaluation , following exactly in Icelands footsteps .
And in the third case of IMF involvement we could expect the selling off of all government assets , raised taxes , and removing 30 - 50 % of civil servants ( without any redundancy pay ) .
In short whichever of the above options is taken people across the country must realise we are all Icelandic now as in we are all truely fucked .
Even before his son was born , Pawan Sinha saw unique potential .
At a birthing class , Dr. Sinha , a neuroscience professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , stunned everyone , including his wife , by saying he was excited about the baby ’s birth “ because I really want to study him and do experiments with him . ”
He did , too , strapping a camera on baby Darius ’s head , recording what he looked at .
Dr. Sinha is among a new crop of scientists using their children as research subjects .
Other researchers have studied their own children in the past , but sophisticated technology allows modern - day scientists to collect new and more detailed data .
The scientists also say that studying their children allows for more in - depth research and that the children make reliable participants in an era of scarce research financing .
“ You need subjects , and they ’re hard to get , ” said Deborah Linebarger , a developmental psychologist who directs the Children ’s Media Lab at the University of Pennsylvania , who has involved her four children in her studies of the effect of media on children .
Arthur Toga , a neurology professor at the medical school at the University of California , Los Angeles , studying brain change , scanned his three children ’s brains using magnetic resonance imaging .
That ’s right , a photographer took pictures of the Trump International Hotel and Tower construction in Chicago , and put them into a time lapse video .

BAGHDAD , Dec. 14 , 2008  -- President George W. Bush spoke with ABC News ' Martha Raddatz Sunday following an incident in which an Iraqi reporter threw two shoes at the president .
Bush told Raddatz he was n't insulted by the shoe - throwing , and that stranger things have happened to him .
He also spoke about his legacy , standing by the invasion of Iraq as the right thing to do , but also saying his presidency was about a lot more than taking down Saddam Hussein .
The full transcript of the interview follows :
Martha Raddatz : Let 's start with what just happened .
And that is someone threw a shoe at you , whether it's an Iraqi reporter ?
President Bush : Yeah , I think it 's a reporter .
At least that 's what they told me on the way out , that it 's a person who works in the Iraqi press , stands up and throws his shoe .
And it was amusing .
I mean , I 've seen a lot of weird things during my presidency and this may rank up there as one of the weirdest .
On the other hand , I do remember when the president of China came to the South Lawn , and a member of the press corps started yelling .
I think it was Falun Gong slogans at the Chinese president .
So this happens and it's a sign of a free society .
Raddatz :
It 's also considered a huge insult in this world , the sole of a shoe , throwing a shoe .
Bush : I guess .
Look they were humiliated .
The press corps , the rest of the Iraqi press corps was humiliated .
These guys were just besides themselves about , they felt like he had disgraced their entire press corps and I frankly , I did n't view it as , I thought it was interesting , I thought it was unusual to have a guy throw his shoe at you .
But I 'm not insulted .
I do n't hold it against the government .
I do n't think the Iraqi press corps as a whole is terrible .
And so , the guy wanted to get on TV and he did .
I do n't know what his beef is .
But whatever it is I 'm sure somebody will hear it .
Raddatz : Let 's talk about this trip .
Your last trip to the region as president .
Your last trip to Iraq .
Surely your legacy will be largely about this war .
Talk to me about how that feels being here ?
The last trip and what you really think that legacy will be .
Bush :
Well , first of all I think a president 's legacy is going to take time .
We 've accomplished a lot in my administration .
Like No Child Left Behind ; 52 months of uninterrupted job growth ; PEPFAR , which is the AIDS initiative in Africa ; fighting malaria , where there 's poverty ; faith based ; I mean there a lot that people will be able to judge this administration on .
Clearly , one of the most important parts of my job because of 9/11 was to defend the security of the American people .
There have been no attacks since I have been president , since 9/11 .
One of the major theaters against al Qaeda turns out to have been Iraq .
This is where al Qaeda said they were going to take their stand .
This is where al Qaeda was hoping to take ...
Raddatz : But not until after the U.S. invaded .
Bush : Yeah , that 's right .
So what ?
The point is that al Qaeda said they 're going to take a stand .
Well , first of all in the post - 9/11 environment Saddam Hussein posed a threat .
And then upon removal , al Qaeda decides to take a stand .
And they 're becoming defeated and I think history will say , one , the world was better off without Saddam , two , along with the Iraqi troops we have denied al Qaeda a safe haven because a young democracy is beginning to grow , which will be an important sign for people in the Middle East .
Raddatz : Just let me go back because you brought this up .
You said Saddam Hussein posed a threat in the post - 9/11 world .
They did n't find weapons of mass destruction .
Bush :
That 's true .
Everybody thought they had them .
Raddatz :
So what threat ?
Bush : Saddam Hussein was the sworn enemy of the United States .
He had been enriched by oil revenues .
He was a sponsor of terror .
I have never claimed like some said that he -- you know , oh , that he was directly involved with the attacks on 9/11 , but he did support terrorists .
And , uh , Saddam Hussein had the capability making weapons of mass destruction .
I did not have the luxury of knowing he did not have them , neither did the rest of the world until after we had come and removed him .
Raddatz :
So would you have gone in anyway ?
Bush : … Excuse me for a minute .
And finally we gave Hussein a peaceful way out .
It was his choice .
And when he refused to allow for inspections , when he refused to disclose or disarm , then a large coalition of troops took him out .
And ...
Now the question is are we going to stay and help this young democracy thrive .
What happened was after Saddam leaves , al Qaeda says this is the second front in the war on terror .
And I take the words of a terrorist leader seriously and ... so we have worked with the Iraqis to try to help their democracy grow and thrive [ and ] at the same time eliminate al Qaeda safe havens .
Raddatz : Did you imagine it would -- the war would go the way it went ?
And you'd be sitting here today with signing a SOFA , a ...
Bush :
First of all , it has taken longer then we hoped and it is more expensive then we had hoped , so in one way I guess I was -- it did n't meet expectations .
However I am pleased that we are now in a position to have signed these agreements .
Because it 's a signal of success , but there were some pretty tough moments and you know better than anyone because you covered them during 2006 .
I had a tough call to make and that was whether or not to pull back and hope the chaos did n't spread beyond certain parts of Iraq and beyond the borders of Iraq or send more troops in order to achieve victory and I chose the latter and the signing of these agreements , the strategic forces agreement and the SOFA , I mean the strategic framework agreement and the SOFA is a sign of success .
I was asked does this mean , you know , are you taking a victory lap .
No , it means that this is a stable platform to continue forward .
Raddatz : [ You ] said again and again -- that there would be no arbitrary timetable .
Bush : Yes .
Raddatz :
Three years now ... and they want U.S. forces out , why is that signal the enemy something with timetables ?
Bush :
What I talked about timetables , was a political timetable imposed upon Iraq by people who did n't think we should have been in there in the first place .
This is an agreement between the sovereign government of Iraq and the U.S. government with the considered judgment of our military commanders at the core of , uh , of the agreement .
It basically says that the situation is such that we can start bringing our troops home now and should be complete by 2011 .
Raddatz : Obama 's plan -- he still says 16 months -- think it is a possibility ?
Bush :
His plan -- the numbers did n't come up -- but one of the things I assured the Iraqi government of is that President - elect Obama is , uh , will honor the agreements that we have just signed -- and I think it is very important for them to know he is obviously going to listen to the commanders .
He will listen to [ Defense ] Secretary Gates and Gen. Petraeus , Gen. Odierno , but ... I 'm not gong to speak for President - elect Obama .
That is what he will do for himself , once he is sworn in as president .
Raddatz :
His nominee for cabinet member for V.A. -- Shinseki , what did think of that appointment ?
Bush : I thought it was in many ways a brilliant appointment because Gen .
Shinseki served with great distinction and he is an honorable man and cares deeply about the vets and he is obviously capable of managing entities and the VA is a large entity .
Raddatz :
Think he was treated fairly in your administration by [ former Defense Secretary ] Rumsfeld ?
Should you have listened to him ?
Bush : I did listen to Gen. Shinseki when he came in with the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
They came in and spoke to me in the Cabinet room and every member of the joint chiefs had their say .
Raddatz :
He said we need several hundred troops .
To stabilize this country ...
Bush : I can't remember the exact conversation , but that one does not ...
Raddatz :
Do you think he was treated fairly ?
Bush :
Wait a minute , let me finish your penetrating question please .
You , you , you , I , I must confess , I do n't remember those exact words being spoken to me by Gen. Shinseki .
I must confess I do n't remember those exact words being spoken to me , by Gen .
Shi… he may have said it .
Raddatz : He was on the Hill ...
Bush : I do n't remember him coming to talk to me specifically with the other generals on the joint chiefs , but I just do n't remember that conversation .
It may have happened at the White House , I do n't think so , but it could have .
He 's an honorable man and I appreciate his service
Raddatz : Afghanistan deteriorated -- your concerns ?
Bush :
No question the violence is up because the Taliban is making firm moves .
In Afghanistan , you said it is deteriorating ?
It is no question though , no question there is a need for more troops , which I announced earlier this fall , but also no question that we will succeed .
Raddatz : Did you ever imagine your presidency ending , and I know it 's not over yet , without capturing Osama bin Laden ?
Bush :
We have done great damage to al Qaeda .
We have denied them safe havens , a safe haven in Iraq .
We are pursuing them in Pakistan .
We have got them on the run .
We 're keeping the pressure on them full time .
And do I wish we had brought Osama bin Laden to justice , sure .
But he 's not leading a lot of parades these days .
GayAtheist revealed a document this morning providing proof that the Church of Latter Day Saints donated $ 30,354.85 to ProtectMarriage.com on 11/3/2008 , the day prior to the election .
The Late Contribution Report was not filed until January 15 , 2009 .
View the Late Contribution Report .
They cannot hide behind the lies any longer .
This is probably one of the main reasons why ProtectMarriage.com filed a lawsuit asking that late Prop 8 donors not be disclosed publicly , which was thrown out yesterday .
It also adds even more credibility to the charges leveled by Fred Karger of Californians Against Hate and the investigation by the CFFP .
Post by ILO on 01/30/09 at 6:00 pm
In a mountainous kingdom in what is now southeastern Turkey , there lived in the eighth century B.C. a royal official , Kuttamuwa , who oversaw the completion of an inscribed stone monument , or stele , to be erected upon his death .
The words instructed mourners to commemorate his life and afterlife with feasts “ for my soul that is in this stele . ”
University of Chicago archaeologists who made the discovery last summer in ruins of a walled city near the Syrian border said the stele provided the first written evidence that the people in this region held to the religious concept of the soul apart from the body .
By contrast , Semitic contemporaries , including the Israelites , believed that the body and soul were inseparable , which for them made cremation unthinkable , as noted in the Bible .
Circumstantial evidence , archaeologists said , indicated that the people at Sam’al , the ancient city , practiced cremation .
The site is known today as Zincirli ( pronounced ZIN - jeer - lee ) .
Other scholars said the find could lead to important insights into the dynamics of cultural contact and exchange in the borderlands of antiquity where Indo - European and Semitic people interacted in the Iron Age .

Developer support , third - party apps
( added May 25th , 2009 )
The UI itself is absurdly slick -- certainly on par with the iPhone 's interface and HTC's TouchFlo 3D .
There are smooth zooms , transitions , and fades in and out of content , and there 's little noticeable lag or stutter when moving through actions .
Fonts are tastefully chosen , and the icons are akin to OS X's or Vista , with soft shadows underneath and lots of dimension .
Using the interface is mainly accomplished with swipes along the screen and by pushing the center button .
A quick swipe up with your thumb slides a launcher ( essentially a prettied up traditional Palm app screen ) over your current state .
What 's notable is that you never leave the application you 're in to do this .
It goes up , then it goes away .
Unlike the iPhone ( which is really its nearest competitor ) , webOS provides true multitasking , allowing you to switch between active apps .
You do n't have to close and reopen , just shuffle through your programs .
If you switch to another app , the UI scales back the program you 're in down to that deck of " cards , " then zooms up the new selection .
By pressing the center button on the phone , you zoom out all of your cards , and can swipe through them to find what you 're looking for .
The content inside of the cards is n't just a snapshot like tabs in Mobile Safari -- they 're live applications that can be flipped and manipulated .
You can also rearrange the cards in any order by touching and holding , then sliding them around .
Gestures can also be used to move back and forward in a document or webpage ( swipe left or right ) , and there 's a gesture used to bring up a quick launcher " wave " over top of whatever application you 're in .
The gestures are useful , but not immediately natural .
There will be a learning curve with this device , but Palm is clearly looking for what makes sense to them -- they 've tried to implement components of the old OS in the new one ( like having quick access to your most used apps and not bogging things down with lots of dropdown menus ) , and at a glance seem to have succeeded .
Besides the input and design , there are core ideas that are new to mobile OSs at play here .
The first is something that Palm calls Synergy , which allows you to pull together contacts and calendars from lots of different sources , but without altering or merging that data .
Synergy will grab the same contact from Facebook , Gmail , and Outlook , then combine those into a " stack " of info for that person on your phone .
It looks for duped data , so you do n't get doubles of phone numbers or names .
It 's essentially a contact aggregator , and if they can pull this off , it will end a lot of headaches for a lot of people .
It looks like it will do the same for calendars , and it's also pooling IM services together , allowing for modes where you can keep a threaded conversation going with someone over SMS , AIM , GTalk , and other services .
It 's heady stuff , and only time ( and use ) will tell if this does what they say it will -- but right now it looks like a terrifically unique and innovative way to handle a myriad of data .
Notifications on the device are handled similarly to the G1 , so when you get an SMS or have a calendar event , webOS scales back your app a little bit and brings up a dialog at the bottom of the screen ( whereas Android adds them in a " curtain " up top ) .
Palm insisted that this lets you have control over how and when you respond to alerts , rather than having to " dismiss " pop-ups .
We like how Android implements this -- we 'll see if Palm 's variation is as effective .
The OS also has a rich search function which pulls up a dialog when you begin typing something on the keyboard .
Like Mac OS 's Spotlight , it uses a universal search to pull applications and content , but switches to a web search if you can't find what you 're looking for .
Right now the phone defaults to Google , Google Maps , and Wikipedia .
While we can't run through every app , we can say that the browser is Webkit based , seems snappier than other Webkit browsers we 've used on mobile devices , and a Flash plugin is supposed to be available for the phone by the end of the year .
What may be most astounding at the core of the OS , however , is the way apps are to be crafted .
All of the applications for the phone will be coded in standard CSS , XML , and JavaScript , meaning the learning curve for creating content and programs on the phone will be almost nonexistent for developers who know their way around coding for sites .
Additionally , Palm says developers will have access to all the software layers , allow system calls and custom content to be loaded into things like notifications .
Of course , the nature of the SDK ( which will be available to anyone ) means that things like 3D games will be hard ( if not impossible ) to pull off , which could be a big blow to a burgeoning developer community , considering how well games have done in the App Store .
We would n't be surprised if Palm ultimately relented and gave developers deeper access .
There 's way , way more to talk about in the UI and OS design , but we 'll save that for when we can take a longer look at the device and its interface .
The long and short of it is this : the Palm Pre and webOS are the first real challengers to the iPhone 's innovative approach to a mobile UI and data management .
Oh , and yes , it has copy and paste functions ( triggered by holding down your thumb on the gesture area and selecting your text with another finger ) .( added May 25th , 2009 ) Palm seems to be striking a bit of a balance between the iPhone and Android when it comes to services , offering a centralized Apple - style push notifications system for developers , Synergy for pulling / merging contacts , email and calendar data from services like Google , Facebook and Microsoft Exchange , and a " Palm Profile " for backing up phone settings and apps .
The Palm Profile , which is tied to a user - provided email address and can be setup on the phone on first boot also helps with OTA updates and App Catalog downloads .
Thanks to phone 's reliance on the cloud , users can also send a " kill pill " to wipe the phone by logging into their Palm Profile online .
Palm wo n't be offering a desktop syncing app , but there will be a PC - based " Data Transfer Assistant " for getting data off of an old Palm OS device and onto the Pre.
There 's been no word on how multimedia syncing is supposed to work , but hopefully the Pre will operate in some sort of mass storage mode when plugged into the computer -- both for loading on music and movies , but also for pulling off purchased media like Amazon MP3s .
After almost half a year of speculation , Palm finally confirmed the release date and price for the handset : June 6th , for $ 200 .
That 's the price with a 2 - year contract , and is after a $ 100 mail - in rebate , though some retailers like Best Buy will offer the phone at rebate - free for $ 200 .
Out of contract the price has been pegged at $ 549 by sales reps , though that has n't been " officially " confirmed by Palm .
Unfortunately , word of expected Pre shortages mean that folks looking to get one within the first week or so might want to look into that age - old rite of gadget lust : lining up for it .
Retailers at launch include Sprint stores , Best Buy , Radio Shack and select Wal - Mart stores .
As far as developer support is concerned , Palm has effusively stated that it wants to engage the community and stoke the fires of app development .
Given that webOS is based around really simple tenets of web coding , it should n't be hard to get in the game and start experimenting for most people , and seasoned devs will probably sink their teeth into it wholeheartedly .
- video encodings still in process -
Sarah Palin and John McCain have now conducted their very first debate .

" Welcome to Washington !
The fun is about to begin , but first , please join me in pausing for a moment , to ask God ’s blessing upon our nation and our next president .
O
God of our many understandings , we pray that you will …Bless us with tears – for a world in which over a billion people exist on less than a dollar a day , where young women from many lands are beaten and raped for wanting an education , and thousands die daily from malnutrition , malaria , and AIDS .
Bless us with anger – at discrimination , at home and abroad , against refugees and immigrants , women , people of color , gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people .
Bless us with discomfort – at the easy , simplistic “ answers ” we ’ve preferred to hear from our politicians , instead of the truth , about ourselves and the world , which we need to face if we are going to rise to the challenges of the future .
Bless us with patience – and the knowledge that none of what ails us will be “ fixed ” anytime soon , and the understanding that our new president is a human being , not a messiah .
Bless us with humility – open to understanding that our own needs must always be balanced with those of the world .
Bless us with freedom from mere tolerance – replacing it with a genuine respect and warm embrace of our differences , and an understanding that in our diversity , we are stronger .
Bless us with compassion and generosity – remembering that every religion ’s God judges us by the way we care for the most vulnerable in the human community , whether across town or across the world .
And God , we give you thanks for your child Barack , as he assumes the office of President of the United States .
Give him wisdom beyond his years , and inspire him with Lincoln ’s reconciling leadership style , President Kennedy ’s ability to enlist our best efforts , and Dr. King ’s dream of a nation for ALL the people .
Give him a quiet heart , for our Ship of State needs a steady , calm captain in these times .
Give him stirring words , for we will need to be inspired and motivated to make the personal and common sacrifices necessary to facing the challenges ahead .
Make him color - blind , reminding him of his own words that under his leadership , there will be neither red nor blue states , but the United States .
Help him remember his own oppression as a minority , drawing on that experience of discrimination , that he might seek to change the lives of those who are still its victims .
Give him the strength to find family time and privacy , and help him remember that even though he is president , a father only gets one shot at his daughters ’ childhoods .
And please , God , keep him safe .
We know we ask too much of our presidents , and we ’re asking FAR too much of this one .
We know the risk he and his wife are taking for all of us , and we implore you , O good and great God , to keep him safe .
Hold him in the palm of your hand – that he might do the work we have called him to do , that he might find joy in this impossible calling , and that in the end , he might lead us as a nation to a place of integrity , prosperity and peace .
AMEN . "
