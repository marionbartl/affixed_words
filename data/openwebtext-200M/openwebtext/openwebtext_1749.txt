Vier Bundesländer wollen Zahlungen an Kirchen verringern Peter Mühlbauer
Als Druckmittel für Vertragsänderungen könnten die umfassenden Steuerbefreiungen für Religionsgemeinschaften dienen
Vor den im Juni beschlossenen Sparplänen der Bundesregierung war kaum jemandem bekannt , dass jenseits der Kirchensteuer Milliardenbeträge aus der Staatskasse in die Taschen der staatlich privilegierten Religionsgemeinschaften fließen .
Unter anderem bezahlen die Bundesländer fast 500 Millionen für Gehälter und Pensionen von Kardinälen , Bischöfen , Pfarrern , Küstern und anderen Kirchenangestellten .
Alleine der nach etlichen Skandalen aus dem Amt gedrängte ehemalige Augsburger Bischof Mixa kassiert monatlich eine Staatsapanage in Höhe von über 5.400 Euro .
Berücksichtigt man die bundesweite Verteilung , kommen etwa zwei Drittel dieser Summe aus den Einkommen protestantischer und konfessionsloser Steuerzahler .
Nun hat der schleswig - holsteinische FDP - Vorsitzende Wolfgang Kubicki angekündigt , solche Zahlungen in seinem Bundesland um 10 bis 15 Prozent verringern zu wollen .
Die niedersächsische FDP hat laut Fraktionschef Christian Dürr Ähnliches vor .
Im Saarland und in Brandenburg äußerten Grünen - beziehungsweisen Linken - Vertreter entsprechende Absichten .
Dazu will man die gut 200 Jahre alten Verträge mit den Kirchen neu aushandeln .
Ein insofern problematischer Weg , als für eine Vertragsänderung die Zustimmung von mindestens zwei Parteien vonnöten ist .
Allerdings könnte ein Einlenken der katholischen und lutherischen Bürokratien zu einer Senkung der Zahlungen ( wenn dies wirklich politisch gewollt ist ) auf relativ einfache Weise erreicht werden - denn bei Weitem nicht alle Zuwendungen an und Vergünstigungen für die Kirchen gründen auf Verträgen .
Sehr leicht einseitig ändern ließen sich beispielsweise die zahlreichen Steuerbefreiungen , aus denen dem Fiskus Mindereinnahmen in erheblicher Höhe entstehen .
Alleine durch einen Wegfall der Grundsteuerbefreiung könnte der Staat den Kommunen auf einen Schlag riesige Mittel zuführen - denn mit einer Fläche von zusammengerechnet mehr als Hälfte Schleswig - Holsteins sind die Kirchen in Deutschland die größten privaten Grundbesitzer .
Die Aufhebung der Befreiung von der Zinsabschlags - , der Kapitalertrags - und der Körperschaftsteuer würde dagegen Bund und Länder bei der Haushaltssanierung ein gutes Stück weiter bringen .
Denn den Religionsgemeinschaften gehören nicht nur Grundstücke , sondern auch Wirtschaftsunternehmen wie Banken und Brauereien .
Durch die Steuerbefreiungen ist die genaue Vermögensmenge allerdings nicht bekannt .
Als der Spiegel bei den katholischen Bistümern unlängst eine Rundfrage dazu durchführte , verweigerten 25 von 27 Angaben mit Begründungen wie " Das ist einfach so " und " Ich habe keine Lust , darüber mit Ihnen zu sprechen . "
Weitere Einnahmen entgehen dem Staat dadurch , dass Kirchensteuerausgaben anders behandelt werden als Spenden an gemeinnützige Vereine .
Letztere sind nämlich , im Gegensatz zur Kirchensteuer , nur begrenzt von der Einkommensteuer absetzbar .
Alleine diese unbegrenzte Absetzbarkeit als Sonderausgabe kostete dem Subventionsbericht der Bundesregierung zufolge im letzten Jahr 2,94 Milliarden Euro .
Für das Einziehen der Kirchensteuer durch die Finanzämter erhält der Staat zwar eine Ausgleichszahlung - allerdings entspricht diese Kritikern zufolge bei Weitem nicht den Summen , welche die Religionsgemeinschaften ohne diese Hilfsleistung aufwenden müssten .
Zudem könnte der Gesetzgeber Unternehmen für die kostenlose Buchhaltungsarbeit , die sie zum Kirchensteuerabzug aufwenden müssen , einen Erstattungsanspruch gewähren .
Von den Kirchensteuern werden nach Recherchen des Augsburgers Gerhard Rampp vom Bund für Geistesfreiheit nur etwa acht Prozent für soziale Zwecke ausgegeben .
Dass gemeinhin geglaubt wird , dieser
Anteil läge wesentlich höher , liegt zu einem großen Teil daran , dass formell von den Kirchen getragene Einrichtungen häufig zu 90 Prozent und mehr aus dem allgemeinen Steueraufkommen finanziert werden .
Würden Bund , Länder und Kommunen das Geld stattdessen für eigene Schulen , Kindergärten , Altersheime und Armenspeisungen ausgeben , hätten die Kirchen wahrscheinlich einen erheblichen Imageverlust zu verzeichnen .

Every time I read of a home invasion robbery , or an in - the - window abduction of a sleeping child , I feel angry and also frustrated .
Why should we be so vulnerable in our homes ?
I ’m annoyed with architects .
Why are n’t they designing homes in which we can at least relax and feel safe ?
If architects wo n’t do their job , I ’ll volunteer to step in and do it for them .
Here ’s an inverted , upside down single - family home .
Do you see a problem with this ?
Do we really need windows on the first floor ?
Burglars , rapists and child abductors will not find it easy to get in !
The tapered walls on the building shown on the left could even be coated with grease .
Not shown are support pillars , embedded deep into the subsoil , that support the building and also afford space for a small basement .
In case of fire , occupants either exit from the front door or jump from second - story windows into soft , deeply - tilled soil covered with ice plant or similar soft bedding plants .
Note how bushes , potential hiding places , are few and kept trimmed small .
If living in an upside down home seems restricting or strange , there are other design solutions that can at least minimize one ’s interaction with strangers , especially ones who might have criminal intent .
Just as gas stations and mini-marts provide slide - out trays and bullet - proof glass to protect their employee - attendants at night , so can a Home Solicitor Interrogation Room be added to a single - family residence .
A plus feature , not shown in the illustration , is the electronically - lockable front door .
The resident , safe inside the home , is able to lock a criminal or criminals inside the tiny entry room , creating a holding cell until police arrive .
Another type of holding cell can be located underground directly in front of a fake front door .
The real front door is located elsewhere , its location known only to friends and family .
If the resident does n’t like the looks of a person , he or she presses a button causing the porch to collapse into the cell below .
Not shown is the ample padding that lines in the floor and wall of the brick - lined holding cell .
A deceptively simple yet effective design is the Home Perimeter Dog Run .
Rather than setting an alarm when leaving the home for the day , or when retiring to sleep at night , the resident unlocks an interior gate , giving the dog full run of the entire balcony .
Dogs are very sensitive to sounds and vibrations , especially those made by strangers .
Should a criminally - inclined stranger step anywhere on the metal walkway , a large dog would leap out of its house and attack .
I worked on the problem of home invasion over several decades .
The solutions that are shown above , drawn in the mid-1980s , seem silly today , but that was before there existed sophisticated home security systems with night - vision cameras , body heat detectors , and web cams .
A Swimming Moat would offer an opportunity for residents to relax in their pool , do laps or invite friends and neighbors over for a pool party .
But at night , or when homeowners are away from home , the pool becomes a moat .
Drawbridges are raised .
Unauthorized entry is effectively discouraged , since burglars do not wish to contemplate climbing slippery walls in wet running shoes , balancing delicate electronic appliances overhead .
Posted signs suggest the added possibility of serious electric shock .
The sign would be false .
If it were not , cats , dogs and squirrels – or drunk revelers who climbed the fence – would be electrocuted .
My favorite solution is the Underground Bedroom .
The bedroom , located anywhere on the property , is approached through a secret passageway .
In this example , residents enter at night through the door of a stacked washer - dryer machine ( fake ) and crawl down a sloped ramp .
The bedroom is stocked with food , television , computer , VCR , phone and a very small toilet .
This room is the quietest in the house .
LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) --
As part of its second - quarter earnings report , oil giant BP PLC said Tuesday that it will reduce its contributions to U.S. tax coffers by $ 9.9 billion , due in large part to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill .

Robin Williams has said : “ I would do Batman in a second , playing anyone , I ’d play The Riddler in the next one , although it would be hard to top Heath as the villain and I ’m a little hairy for tights …
The Batman films have screwed me twice before : years ago they offered my The Joker and then gave it to Jack Nicholson , then they offered me The Riddler and gave it to Jim Carrey .
I ’d be like , ‘ OK , is this a real offer ?
If it is , then the answer ’s yes .
Do n’t pump me again motherf ** kers . ' ”
Having been passed over twice for key roles in this franchise before , maybe Williams does have a slight chance if Nolan even chooses the Riddler as the next villain .
He has worked with him before in the film ‘ Insomnia ’ .
Problem is that Nolan might choose a younger Riddler for his film , but as of right now , it ’s anybody ’s guess .
A near comedy dream team together in one film should be a recipe for nonstop laughter and a heckuva good time at the theater .
Well , not in this case .
I truly enjoy Adam Sandler ’s films for the most part ( ‘ Little Nicky ’ excluded ) .
David Spade was great in the films he did with Chris Farley , ‘ Black Sheep ’ and ‘ Tommy Boy ’ .
Chris
Rock makes me laugh just looking at him .
Kevin James has had lots of recent success with ‘ Hitch ’ , ‘ Paul Blart ’ , and ‘ Chuck & Larry ’ .
And Rob Schneider , although he has made some real subpar films , is very good as a co-star in some of Adam Sandler ’s films and given the right material , is just as funny as the rest of this group .
There are many problems with ‘ Grown Ups ’ .
First of all , the script is very weak .
If the guys were ad - libbing a lot of their scenes , they really should n’t have , because a lot of the jokes fall flat .
It does appear that the cast is having a lot of fun while filming here , but unfortunately I did n’t have a lot of fun watching them stumble through this picture .
Chris
Rock is almost completely wasted because his story is so weak that you just do n’t really care what he says or does .
I will say that if his part would have been beefed up a bit , the end result would have probably been better .
Making David Spade ’s character the womanizer of the picture is a funny idea , but his schtick falls flat about midway through … it just gets old and less funny as we near the end .
Sandler does well with what he is given , although there were many times I found myself hoping Happy Gilmore would show up .
James is on par with Rock as far as being wasted ( inside film joke ! ) here .
It almost seems like he was thrown into the mix just because he is friends with Sandler now .
The funniest part in the film belongs to Schneider , who plays the overly sensitive , older woman loving , with 2 out of 3 hot daughters guy pretty well .
He has the most story and by far the most hilarious .
Salma
Hayek , even though she is as gorgeous as ever , seems out of place .
She never quite fits her character of being the rich fashion designer wife of Sandler ’s Hollywood agent .
I can think of at least a dozen other actresses better suited for this role .
Maria Bello , as James wife , has a couple of funny bits and is just as underused as he is .
Maya Rudolph , also good on Saturday Night Live , was probably hired due to her SNL background .
She is Rock ’s wife , and just like him …underused .
The children in the film are funny and serve their purpose well , and the small role by Steve Buscemi highlights the last half of the movie .
There was a lot of potential here .
Nothing against Kevin James ( he does have a one or two hilarious scenes ) , but if his character had not been a part of this , the film would have probably been better .
Reason being is that I can see a better picture if Adam Sandler ’s part had more to it , and Chris Rock ’s character has more script with more laughs .
The concept of ‘ Grown Ups ’ is better than the product .
Hopefully , if some of these comedic actors get together again , they can come up with something more laugh out loud funny and fewer parts that just fall flat .
I found myself actually wanting Will Ferrell to show up somewhere during this … but unfortunately , he did n’t .

The Coca -Cola Company has tried to have a lawsuit thrown out that claims Vitaminwater ® is really just sugar water , but a federal court yesterday said the company has violated FDA regulations and will allow the lawsuit to proceed .
Imagine that !
Coca Cola 's Glacéau is lying to consumers about their magical elixir , Vitaminwater® , which they say performs amazing feats such as the " focus " flavor 's ability to " reduce the risk of age - related eye disease . "
The company 's use of the word " healthy " on its products also violates the FDA 's " Jelly Bean " rule that prohibits companies from selling junk foods that provide minimal health benefits while passing them off as such .
Federal Judge John Gleeson explained his decision to allow the lawsuit , by the Center for Science in the Public Interest to go forward :
In sum , plaintiffs ' allegations sufficiently state a claim that defendants have violated FDA regulations by making health claims about vitaminwater even though it does not meet required minimum nutritional thresholds , by using the word ‘ healthy ' in implied nutrient content claims even though vitaminwater 's fortification does not comply with FDA policy , and by using a product name that references only two of vitaminwater 's ingredients , omitting the fact that there is a key , unnamed ingredient [ sugar ] in the product . "
Damn .
This troubling news , along with the fact that Muscle Milk® and MuscleTech Nitro - Tech Hardcore ™ powder are actually over - the - counter arsenic , should concern every health conscious person and rattle their faith in these awesome companies .
We 've been bamboozled .

Near the beginning of my trip out here in Los Angeles for E3 , I heard the oddest of rumors : Microsoft 's controller - free sensor array , Kinect , would only work if you were standing up .
No way , right ?
Advertisement
For the last several days I 've been peppering the conversations I 've had with game creators at this massive video game showcase with the " sitting question . "
Can Kinect really not work when you 're sitting ?
Is that the reason why every Kinect developer makes me stand to play their game ?
Is the future of voice - controlled , gesture - triggered television viewing a future of watching TV while standing up ?
Advertisement
What Microsoft says
Officially , Microsoft says that the sitting question is unfounded .
In a mock Q&A that had appeared on the company 's press site but has since been removed , they field this question themselves :
Q : Are there any games or experiences I can do while sitting on the couch ?
A : Absolutely .
The games and experiences are designed to be as fun to watch as they are to play - they 're designed to get you off the couch .
And when you want to enjoy movies , music , and ESPN on Xbox 360 , you can control your entertainment hands free from the comfort of your couch .
Couch potatoes have nothing to worry about , then , right ?
They should n't fear a future that would have them enjoying ESPN and Forza Motorsport on their own two feet ?
No .
There is some cause for concern .
What Game Creators Say
One developer with whom I spoke and who is familiar with how Microsoft is briefing studios making games for Kinect said the company has specifically advised developers to not make games that would involve the player 's sitting down .

None of the games shown for Kinect at a showcase early in the week were set up for sitting .
Kinectimals , a cute take on Nintendogs - style games , but with tiger cubs , was presented as a player - stand - here demo .
That 's logical , because the game involves walking up to the animal and then jumping or running or doing some other action you want the animal to replicate .
The game 's lead creator , Frontier Design 's David Braben shrugged when I asked him if the game could be played sitting down .
He guessed some of it might work , but it did n't sound like he'd tried , possibly because it was irrelevant to his game design .
You might have expected a seated Kinect experience from the Forza Motorsport team .
Those folks are making Kinect driving games and tech demos .
They 've got a fun highway driving challenge that involves standing in front of the Kinect and steering by holding your hands in front of your body as if you were turning a real steering wheel .
The perspective for this game experiment is inside the car , through the eyes of a driver .
Rolling your shoulders in front of Kinect turns the game 's camera view slightly , letting you look around inside the car .
Your lower body is not used — no foot - forward - to - accelerate as was seen in a similar demonstration last year with racing game Burnout .
Nevertheless , you have to play this one standing up if you are playing it at E3 .

I asked one of the two members of Forza development studio Turn 10 if I could play their demo sitting down .
They said I could not , that it was " optimized for standing . "

The thought that prompted me to start asking the " sitting question " to so many Kinect - connected game developers and executives at E3 was that the Kinect 's sensor can't clearly read a human skeleton if a person is seated .
Some developers with whom I was theorizing about this guessed that the Kinect would become confused by the bent knees of a seated gamer — that it would need a player to always return to a resting position that has all their joints on one flat plane , which is the case when you are standing , not when you are sitting .
No Kinect developer could or would get that specific with me , so I 'm left to guess .

The second Forza demonstration involves walking up to a virtual car and peering at it from various angles .
You control this by standing in front of the Kinect and then turning your body , kneeling or side - stepping to push the camera view around the car or to lower it for close inspection .
You can open the driver 's door of a virtual Ferrari and sit in the driver 's seat .
But , even in this Forza demo , when you sit in the driver 's seat , you are standing in real life .
That 's the kind of thing that makes you wonder .
Throughout this week I have watched or tried fitness games , dancing games and several games reminiscent of Wii Sports .
All are played standing up , and all have good game design reasons to be played that way .
So maybe there is no tech limitation to Kinect regarding your couch ?
Maybe these games are all stand - up just because that 's what is best ?

" Sitting is something we 're still calibrating for . "
I 'd be worried less about this sitting thing — and I would stop asking the " sitting question " — if I had not been made to watch a movie via Kinect while standing up .

On Monday evening I participated in a brief demonstration of how Kinect could be used to control the Xbox 360 dashboard .
This demonstration had me standing in front of the Kinect and using both hand - waves and voice commands to flip through menus on a TV and load applications such as movie - watching and video chat .
There were chairs at this demo , but they were off to the side .
I had to stand up .
The Kinect is superb at recognizing a standing player .
It reads the presence of your body , detects 19 or so key joints in your frame and tracks your movement with magical immediacy .
I had no more trouble swiping through the Kinect menus than I did steering the car in the Forza demo .
Voice commands worked nicely as well , though I lamented that the Kinect could n't distinguish my commands from anyone else 's in the room .
What I did n't understand is why I had to stand through all of this .

I liked telling the Xbox 360 to pause a movie .
I liked extending my hand and dragging the movie 's progress bar left or right , as if I was using the Star Wars Force to fast forward and rewind .
But , I asked the Microsoft people running the demo , could I drag a chair over and try this sitting down ?
No .
" Sitting is something we 're still calibrating for , " one of them told me .
Some time during the demo they showed me a video that simulated Kinect - powered video chat .
That was going to be calibrated for sitting , right ?
And movie watching is n't really going to require me to stand , correct ?

The Microsoft people pointed out that for entertainment applications like these I would be using a lot of voice commands and those would work just fine from a couch .
That backs up the simulated Q&A bit from Microsoft about how , " when you want to enjoy movies , music , and ESPN on Xbox 360 , you can control your entertainment hands free from the comfort of your couch . "
They do n't say anything about games .
And they do n't say anything about relying on voice - command rather than body motion detection .
One of the Microsoft people with whom I was discussing the " sitting question " said the chair stuff is just more complicated .
You could be sitting far away , at an angle .
True , though I had asked to move a chair in front of the TV before being denied .

A demo reel Microsoft released of families playing Kinect does does show them using hand gestures to manipulate a movie while sitting , but it is not clear if they are really using the tech .
At least it is a sign that Microsoft wants Kinect to work like this .
Fake Families Put Kinect Through Its Paces
You already knew that much of Kinect 's early marketing would be targeted at a casual crowd .
So when Read more

UPDATE : A Microsoft spokesperson told me after the publication of this article that the company is certain that Kinect gesture control will work for movies , ESPN and other " entertainment " features before the sensor is launched .
As I originally reported , that is not an implemented feature yet .
The spokesperson was not able to provide any update on the Kinect 's tolerance of a person who sits while playing games .

Standing And Delivering
Sitting is an important , if not essential , posture for gaming .
You sit to play Halo .
You sit to play Fable .
You can sit to play most Wii games , even though you risk flailing or injuring the people next to you .
Sitting is good .
Microsoft has presented Kinect as a control option relevant to all gamers .
And developers have theorized that it could be used to enhance even the most hardcore — shall we call them " sitting - centric " ? — games .
How Kinect would work with a game we normally play seated is now an open question .

To those doubting Kinect , I can say that , after a week of playing more of its games , it works great .
But after a week of noticing a lack of seated play — after a week of not getting a single developer or Microsoft person to clearly state that Kinect can track your body while you sit —
I 'm left to wonder if this impressive tech has a problem .
Controller - free gaming is an exciting future .
Couch - free gaming ( and maybe movie - watching and video - chatting ) ?
Say it ai n't so .
President Barack Obama to pick U.S. Solicitor General Elena Kagan as U.S. Supreme Court nominee ( CLG compilation ) 09 May 2010
You know you 're in trouble when Faux News is calling her ' a brilliant woman . '
During her hearings to be confirmed as Solicitor General , the New York Times paraphrases Kagan as saying " that someone suspected of helping finance Al Qaeda should be subject to battlefield law -- indefinite detention without a trial -- even if he were captured in a place like the Philippines rather than a physical battle zone . "

1 . The Jabulani is not living up to its reputation
Never before have players and fans been on first - name terms with the match ball .
Adidas 's Jabulani has been heavily criticised for its unpredictable deviations , its lack of dip on free - kicks and the way it sails when crossed .
It has not only been the goalkeepers who have complained bitterly about it ; outfield players have been made to look foolish .
" It is terrible , " said the England manager , Fabio Capello , while his midfielder Joe Cole said it had taken " some of the skill out of the game " .
Jamie Carragher , the England defender , added : " When you create a ball for the World Cup , the idea is to create more goals , I think .
This one does strange things to make it a more exciting tournament . "
But the goals have not followed while there have been further concerns about how the high altitude in South Africa affects the Jabulani 's flight .
Reason to be cheerful
Practice makes perfect .
The Germans have played with the Jabulani for months , since it was made available in January , and they had no trouble in their opening fixture
2. Marquee names have not performed
Every leading nation has an undoubted star , the player who most readily inspires his countrymen .
But with the exception of Argentina 's Lionel Messi , who showcased his instant control and incisive running in possession against Nigeria , they have so far been unable to shine .
Injury prevented Michael Ballack ( Germany ) from making the finals while it ruled out Andrea Pirlo ( Italy ) and Arjen Robben ( Holland ) from the opening ties .
France 's talisman Franck Ribéry was suffocated by Uruguayan defenders , Wayne Rooney ( England ) was unable to impose himself against USA and Cristiano Ronaldo ( Portugal ) , after a bright start , faded badly against the Ivory Coast , for whom Didier Drogba played less than half an hour .
The rigours of a long season , both physically and mentally , have been blamed .
The World Cup always creates new stars – Germany 's Mesut Ozil is an early contender – but it needs its big names to stand tall , as they can excite like no others .
Reason to be cheerful
Form is temporary ; class is permanent .
It is inconceivable that the aforementioned players will remain in the shadows .
And Spain have not kicked off yet
3 . The defensive mindset of the coaches
Marcello Lippi was outspoken after Italy 's opening fixture against Paraguay and he mocked his opposite number , Gerardo Martino , for promising attack and then parking the bus .
" They made some pretty heavy statements before the game so I thought they would be bolder , " Lippi said .
" Instead , they did not even go past the halfway line .
They tried to defend for the entire match . "
If there was a certain irony to hearing an Italian coach make such protestations , Paraguay have not been alone in keeping bodies behind the ball .
Caution has underpinned the opening matches , with teams scared of defeat , knowing that it could effectively rule them out .
Better to wait for a mistake than make one yourself .
" Every team has prepared very thoroughly and all are defending well , " said Paraguay 's Roque Santa Cruz .
" There are not a lot of chances and the difference from team to team is not very much .
It 's going to be the same until the end . "
Reason to be cheerful
As teams need to win matches to advance in the tournament , so they will be forced out of their defensive shells .
Defending can only get you so far on this stage
4 . The number of empty seats in the stadiums
Given how many fans across South Africa and beyond would give almost anything for a match ticket , it has been disappointing to see swaths of empty seats .
The stadiums for South Korea v Greece , Algeria v Slovenia and Japan v Cameroon were more than 10,000 below capacity while there were 15,000 empty seats in Rustenburg for New Zealand v Slovakia .
There have been only a handful of sell - outs , according to Fifa 's official statistics , and the governing body has investigated whether its transport and ticket distribution systems have been at fault .
On the morning of Algeria v Slovenia , Fifa said there were only 700 tickets available , suggesting that many people in possession of them had been unable or unwilling to turn up .
Fears over gridlocked roads have been advanced as one possible excuse , together with other logistical difficulties .
If the empty seats have looked terrible , then the clashes between riot police and striking stadium stewards have been worse .
Reason to be cheerful
Unattractive matches early on are often some way short of capacity and , overall , Fifa is happy with attendances .
The organising committee is confident of resolving the issue with the stewards
5 . The vuvuzelas
The biggest off - the - field talking point so far , the plastic horns have provided the soundtrack to the finals – or should that be white noise ?
Hugely irritating , according to their detractors , they have also been condemned by high - profile players .
" It 's impossible to communicate on the pitch , it 's like being deaf , " said Lionel Messi .
There is a tuneful art to blowing the vuvuzela which , clearly , the many thousands of arrivistes have not mastered .
They have made the stadiums sound like angry hornets ' nests and killed off natural crowd sounds ; most regrettably , the primal roars that celebrate goals .
There have been calls for the vuvuzelas to be banned ; it was interesting that they were not allowed inside the stadium for South Africa 's rugby international against France in Cape Town last Saturday .
The BBC , meanwhile , following viewer complaints , have been moved to investigate whether it can offer a so - called " clean " feed , which would strip out the blaring of the vuvuzelas .
Reason to be cheerful
The vuvuzela is here to stay and , in the interests of novelty and diversity , that has to be a good thing .
Every World Cup needs its distinguishing features .
And really , they 're not that bad
After seeing firsthand the perils of using an open WiFi network last week I resolved to post about tethering a Nokia smartphone to an Ubuntu - powered laptop or netbook via USB , as a public service to those who did n’t know that they could .
Count me among them — or at least among those who did n’t realize how ridiculously easy it is !
This first step is the hardest , in that it ’s the least intuitive .
When you connect your Nokia to your Ubuntu box make sure you select ‘ PC Suite ’ .
This will activate the USB modem connection on the Nokia side .
From here on in it ’s dead simple .
You can fire up Network Connections from your System Administration panel , or even easier , click on ‘ New Mobile Broadband Connection ’ in your Network Manager Applet ’s drop - down menu at the top of your screen .
You should be presented with this window , with your Nokia device already selected .
The latest release of Ubuntu ( 10.04 as of this writing ) includes a database of carriers worldwide .
Note the presence of Canadian newcomer WIND Mobile in the menu seen above .
Once you ’ve made your selection your carrier ’s settings are automatically loaded — no more searching HoFo !
You could also use JoikuSpot , an S60 / Symbian app that rebroadcasts your cellular data connection as a WiFi hotspot , to reach the same end — provided you have 64 or 128 - bit encryption turned on .
But since you ’ll need an AC cable anyway ( JoikuSpot drains your Nokia ’s battery in fairly short order ) why not take a USB connector instead and enjoy a virtually impenetrable connection to the Internet wherever you go ?
With some help from Simon at KnowNokia.ca
I ’m hoping to delve further into the security risks of open WiFi hotspots in a future post .
I ’d also like to write about tethering to Ubuntu from other mobile OSes but alas , I ’m a Nokia user so that ’s all I know .
Maybe you can help me out with a comment below ..?
The BBC's Top Gear will feature fewer crazy stunts in the next series .
Here are six of the silliest so far
It 's been announced that the new series of Top Gear is to be quite unlike any series of Top Gear you 've ever seen , in that it 's going to be about cars .
Actual cars .
Not cars decorated like cottages , or cars strapped to the side of hot - air balloons .
Actual cars .
Ahead of Sunday 's first episode , James May has done the unthinkable and warned viewers not to expect as much " Last of the Summer Wine tomfoolery " as they 're used to .
This news is bound to divide opinion .
Yes , Top Gear is still a motoring show at heart , but its huge global audience still primarily watches to see three middle - aged morons clown around like the world 's paunchiest schoolboys .
So as we look forward to a future when Jeremy Clarkson will be recognised less for his ability to push cars off battleships and more for his ability to churn out endless Christmas books differentiated only by his imperceptibly different facial expressions on the covers , let 's commemorate this bygone age with a look at some of Top Gear 's stupidest comedy stunts :
1. Car darts ( 2004 )
An early indication of things to come .
Although it 's still technically a car - based segment , the cars are only used as projectiles to be fired into a quarry by James May and Richard Hammond .
One of the first signs that , in the revamped Top Gear , motoring would take a backseat to the spectacle of adult men hopping from foot to foot and cackling .
2 . The airship ( 2009 )
Only tangentially related to cars at best ( Richard Hammond was driving underneath ) , James May 's airship caravan stunt managed to combine Top Gear 's love of pointless indulgence better than most .
Most , but not all .
3. World 's smallest car ( 2007 )
Jeremy Clarkson drives around the BBC in a tiny car .
That 's basically it .
You see ?
Clarkson is n't an out - of - touch millionaire with slightly tedious political views – he's just the same as you .
Well , not you .
The annoying bloke you work with .
He 's just the same as him .
4. Four Go Mad In Dorset ( 2006 )
Depending on who you ask , this stunt will either go down as Top Gear 's all - time high watermark , or the moment when the rot set in .
Clarkson , Hammond and May lurch from one scripted set - piece to another , culminating in an accidental caravan explosion that makes them all run around and pull funny faces .
When James May spoke of " Last of the Summer Wine tomfoolery " he may well have been directly referencing this .
5. Top Ground Gear Force ( 2008 )
A charity special that ditched the cars altogether so that the hosts could point jet engines at raw chickens , commit arson , fire shotguns at sheds and generally babble and yelp at each other like a trio of Gibraltar monkeys .
Entertaining , but another sign that Top Gear was turning into Geriatric Jackass ?
6. Jeremy Clarkson 's accent and silly hair ( 1989 )
But maybe Top Gear wo n't dispense with the comedy stunts completely .
After all , take a look at this early , pre-revamp Top Gear clip .
During an otherwise sober piece on junk sale auctions , Jeremy Clarkson still manages to jazz things up by putting on a crazy wig and doing a warped , stilted Mr Cholmondley - Warner accent .
At least I assume he 's doing it as a joke .
Is n't he ?
Have I missed any particularly memorable stunts ?
Are you pleased that Top Gear is going serious ?
Comments please .
Part Two of my conversation with Peter Beinart .
Part I is here .
More , I hope , after Shavuot :
Jeffrey Goldberg :
It 's interesting to me that you , an Orthodox Jew , do n't answer the question about Zionism in any sort of theological way whatsoever .
Anti-Semitism to me is not a good enough answer to the question of " Why Israel . "
I 'm not Orthodox , but I do feel a spiritual connection to our homeland .
Without this connection , can Israel 's location in what was Palestine be justified ?
Should n't it have been built in Bavaria ?
Peter Beinart : I did n't call myself an Orthodox Jew ; I said I attend an Orthodox synagogue .
But anyway , it 's a reasonable question .
I feel a spiritual connection through Jewish observance -- when I 'm in shul , on Shabbat , even through kashrut .
And I feel a spiritual connection to Jewish people -- a certain delight at certain Jewish idiosyncracies , at a sense of global peoplehood .
I 'll never forget my grandfather coming from Cape Town to Newton , Massachusetts and looking at an apartment building filled with Jewish names and saying " I know everyone here . "
It was schmaltzy , but he meant it and it moves me to think back on that .
My spiritual connection to the land of Israel is , in all honesty , weaker .
Perhaps that 's why I do n't feel the sense of potential loss at giving up Hebron that some people genuinely do .
My love of Israel is n't about the land ; it 's my endless wonder at a society in which Jews from around the world were thrown together , a museum of the dazzling variety of world Jewry , in which people separated for millennia forged , and reforged , the bonds of peoplehood .
That 's what chokes me up about Israel - - that and what those Jews have built .
PB : First , on the New York Review of Books .
I disagreed with Tony Judt 's essay in 2003 arguing for a binational state .
That should be evident from my essay , which is all about saving liberal Zionism .
But I think its wrong to call The New York Review anti-Israel .
Among the Israelis it publishes are Amos Elon , David Grossman , David Shulman and Tom Segev. Margalit recently won the Israel Prize .
I 'd like to hear which among them is anti-Israel .
In fact , The New York Review is one of the few American publications that gives space to those Israeli intellectuals fighting to maintain Israel 's liberal democratic character , the very voices that I argue American Jews desperately need to hear .
In general , I think American Jewish leaders and commentators have become far too promiscuous about throwing around words like anti-Israel .
In my mind , you 're anti-Israel if you want Israel to disappear as a Jewish state .
Being a harsh critic is something very different , and even if you believe someone is insufficiently attentive to Israeli security , that merely makes them wrong , not anti-Israel , unless you can prove that they are inattentive because they would not mind if Israel ceased to exist as a Jewish state .
There certainly are leftists ( and for that matter ) rightists who focus so disproportionately on Israel 's failings as to raise questions about their true motives .
I 'm not sure what that has to do with my essay .
I 'm writing about American Jewish groups whose mission is ostensibly to sustain Israel as a democratic Jewish state , and to sustain Zionism in the United States .
I think they 're failing on both fronts .
Netanyahu 's hostility to a Palestinian state defines his entire political career ( his utterly transparent mouthing of the words under U.S. pressure notwithstanding ) .
But what has changed since his last stint in office is the coalition around Netanyahu .
Because they have been bribed by housing and other subsidies , Shas and the Ashkenazi haredi parties are now invested in the settlement project as well .
That was n't the case in the 1990s .
Nor had Lieberman 's Yisrael Beiteinu emerged as Israel 's third largest party .
So what is new politically is the emergence of a coalition of three parties ( three of Israel 's five largest ) :
Shas , Yisrael Beiteinu and Likud , all basically devoted to foreclosing a Palestinian state and with a pretty fundamental disregard for democratic values .
I genuinely believe that the more impossible a Palestinian state becomes , the more mainstream ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians -- and perhaps Israeli Arabs - - will become .
That 's the significance of Effi Eitam , and of Lieberman 's endless efforts to strip Arab Israelis of their rights , and of the polling data I quote which shows how open Israelis , especially young Israelis , are to the idea .
Jeffrey , the people in Israel who share our values , are saying this every day .
To read Haaretz is to sense their desperation .
Akiva Elder , Gideon Levy , David Grossman , they make me sound tame .
Your piece in the New Yorker on the settlers was the most powerful thing any American has ever written on the subject , and it burned with outrage .
Things are much worse now , and yet I do n't sense that outrage anymore .
What has changed with you ?
JG : Nothing has changed with me .
I still believe the settlers are the vanguard of binationalism ( i.e. , their project endangers the idea of Israel as a Jewish democracy ) and I worry , as do you and David Grossman ( I do n't put myself in the same camp as Gideon Levy , by the way ) , about the intolerance of Avigdor Lieberman .
But the world is bigger than just crazy Jews .
The world has its share of crazy Muslim extremists -- the ones , for instance , who are pointing 40,000 rockets at Israel from Lebanon right now -- and they are not pointing these rockets at Israel in order to bring about the creation of a Palestinian state on the West Bank .
They are seeking the physical destruction of 5.5 million Jews in their historic homeland .
I take this seriously , and I think you should take it seriously , as well .
Avigdor Lieberman is less of an immediate threat to the future of Israel than Hassan Nasrallah .
Also , another , not unrelated point :
Our Israeli cousins do , in fact , support a two - state solution ( Jon Chait
One more question ( well , maybe they 'll be one more after this ) :
I 've read the 2008 report you refer to indirectly your piece , the one you implied suggested that young , non-Orthodox American Jews are growing distant from Israel .
It actually does n't say what Stephen Cohen and others think it says .
" Jewish attachment to Israel has largely held steady for the period 1994 - 2007 , "
PB : I do take the threat of Hassan Nasrallah seriously .
I 'm not against any Israeli use of force , if there 's a real chance that it will make Israelis safer and its done in a way that as much as possible spares civilians .
But over the long run , the best way to undermine Nasrallah and people like him is to give hope to those Palestinians and Muslims who do want a two - state solution .
In Fayyad , and even Abbas , we have such leaders .
Surely in those circumstances continued settlement growth , which simply convinces Palestinians that they will never have a state on most of the West Bank , is deeply self - destructive .
I want the major American Jewish groups to say so , loudly .
Instead , they deny that settlements are even a problem .
You 're right that Kadima won more seats than Likud .
But Livni , to her credit , would not join Netanyahu 's government in part because he would not commit to supporting a Palestinian state ( not surprising given his lifetime opposition to one ) .
And Netanyahu was able to create a coalition with Shas , Yisrael Beiteinu , Labor and far - right settler parties .
That is a new and frightening phenomenon , as I said , since until recently Israel did n't have a major semi-fascist party ( Yisrael Beiteinu ) and the anti-democratic illiberalism of Shas had n't been connected to the settlement project .
On respecting the views of our Israeli " cousins " .
As with my own actual cousins in Israel ( not Meretz voters , I assure you ) , I think I have the right to decide which Israelis share my values and which do n't .
You 're absolutely right that those who do are right now in the political minority .
I can live with that , after all , for much of my life I have n't seen my political values reflected by a majority of Americans .
On the question of declining loyalty of American Jews to Israel , there is one study that -- running counter to the mainstream view among sociologists who study this -- argues that loyalty has n't declined .
That 's the study that
I 've been to dozens of AIPAC meetings ( and a few ADL ) meetings across the country .
You see far fewer young Jews than you do at AIPAC policy conference in Washington .
And that 's AIPAC , which is very well - funded organization that devotes enormous resources to this problem .
I think what people like you should appreciate about liberal bloggers like Ezra Klein , Matthew Yglesias etc is that at least they have enough Zionism to care .
Their sense of concern should be nurtured , not discouraged , since for most secular young Jews the choice is not between a critical Zionism and an uncritical Zionism .
It 's between a critical Zionism and no Zionism .
To be continued .
And foreclosing the possibility of a Palestinian state is exactly what the current Israeli coalition wants to do .
You ask what has changed .
First , year after year of settlement growth at triple the rate of the Israeli population ( including this year , since in practice , Netanyahu's " partial freeze " has led to no slowdown of building , and in any case he has said it will not be renewed after September ) .
The more the settlements expand , the more settlers -- including fanatical settlers -- take over parts of the Israeli bureaucracy and become integral to the Israeli army and rabbinate , all of which makes the prospect of removing them without outright civil war more remote .
These people have already murdered an Israeli Prime Minister , and they routinely use violence against Israeli troops and Israeli leftists , not to mention Palestinians .
Their young " hilltop youth " are so extreme that they actually scare the settler old guard .
" When will the state of Israel wake up and realize that it is facing a real threat from an enemy within , " those words are not from a dove , they are Ben Dror Yemeni , the hawkish editor of Maariv last year .
And it's not just the growth and increased radicalization of the settlers , it 's the emergence of a political coalition determined to protect them and make a Palestinian state impossible .
Netanyahu's hostility to a Palestinian state defines his entire political career ( his utterly transparent mouthing of the words under U.S. pressure notwithstanding ) .
But what has changed since his last stint in office is the coalition around Netanyahu .
Because they have been bribed by housing and other subsidies , Shas and the Ashkenazi haredi parties are now invested in the settlement project as well .
That was n't the case in the 1990s .
Nor had Lieberman 's Yisrael Beiteinu emerged as Israel 's third largest party .
So what is new politically is the emergence of a coalition of three parties ( three of Israel 's five largest ) :
Shas , Yisrael Beiteinu and Likud , all basically devoted to foreclosing a Palestinian state and with a pretty fundamental disregard for democratic values .
I genuinely believe that the more impossible a Palestinian state becomes , the more mainstream ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians -- and perhaps Israeli Arabs - - will become .
That 's the significance of Effi Eitam , and of Lieberman 's endless efforts to strip Arab Israelis of their rights , and of the polling data I quote which shows how open Israelis , especially young Israelis , are to the idea .

Things are much worse now , and yet I do n't sense that outrage anymore .
What has changed with you ? :
Nothing has changed with me .
I still believe the settlers are the vanguard of binationalism ( i.e. , their project endangers the idea of Israel as a Jewish democracy ) and I worry , as do you and David Grossman ( I do n't put myself in the same camp as Gideon Levy , by the way ) , about the intolerance of Avigdor Lieberman .

They are seeking the physical destruction of 5.5 million Jews in their historic homeland .
I take this seriously , and I think you should take it seriously , as well .
Avigdor Lieberman is less of an immediate threat to the future of Israel than Hassan Nasrallah .
Also , another , not unrelated point :
Our Israeli cousins do , in fact , support a two - state solution ( Jon Chait points this out in his response to you ) but they are dispirited by the outcomes of Camp David and the Gaza withdrawal .
You do n't have to be an Israeli extremist to believe that the Arab side is not especially enamored with the ideas of peace and compromise , despite the existence of Salam Fayyad and other Palestinian moderates .
Perhaps we here in America should take these Israeli concerns more seriously , and have more respect for the hard - earned experience of Israelis .
And a small note : the biggest vote - getter in the last election was the moderate Kadima party , which chose not to join the Likud in a center - right coalition .
You make it seem as if the Israeli people voted for fascism .
They did n't .
You also make it seem , by the way , that Ha'aretz is some sort of centrist project .
It speak for maybe four or five percent of Israelis .
A disproportionate number of our friends in Israel are in the Ha'aretz camp , it is true , but it is still not representative of the non-crazy Israeli middle .
One more question ( well , maybe they 'll be one more after this ) :
I 've read the 2008 report you refer to indirectly your piece , the one you implied suggested that young , non-Orthodox American Jews are growing distant from Israel .
It actually does n't say what Stephen Cohen and others think it says .
" Jewish attachment to Israel has largely held steady for the period 1994 - 2007 , " is the way the report puts it .
I 've been to those enormous , borderline - unpleasant AIPAC meetings -- they draw thousands of people under the age of 45 , and not all of them are Orthodox , not by a long shot .
And studies show that the tens of thousands of Jewish young adults who visit Israel each year on Birthright trips come back with strong and durable pro-Israel feelings .
Finally , let 's not forget that fifteen to twenty percent of young , non-Orthodox Jews in America are growing up in Russian - and Farsi - speaking homes , and these folks are not Ha'aretz readers .
So the question is , outside the left - wing blogosphere , are you really so sure that we 're seeing a collapse in young adult support for Israel ? : I do take the threat of Hassan Nasrallah seriously .
I 'm not against any Israeli use of force , if there 's a real chance that it will make Israelis safer and its done in a way that as much as possible spares civilians .
But over the long run , the best way to undermine Nasrallah and people like him is to give hope to those Palestinians and Muslims who do want a two - state solution .
In Fayyad , and even Abbas , we have such leaders .
Surely in those circumstances continued settlement growth , which simply convinces Palestinians that they will never have a state on most of the West Bank , is deeply self - destructive .

That is a new and frightening phenomenon , as I said , since until recently Israel did n't have a major semi-fascist party ( Yisrael Beiteinu ) and the anti-democratic illiberalism of Shas had n't been connected to the settlement project .
On respecting the views of our Israeli " cousins " .
As with my own actual cousins in Israel ( not Meretz voters , I assure you ) , I think I have the right to decide which Israelis share my values and which do n't .
You 're absolutely right that those who do are right now in the political minority .
I can live with that , after all , for much of my life I have n't seen my political values reflected by a majority of Americans .
On the question of declining loyalty of American Jews to Israel , there is one study that -- running counter to the mainstream view among sociologists who study this -- argues that loyalty has n't declined .
That 's the study that Shmuel Rosner links to .
But for years and years now , most of the reports investigating this have found that affiliation is declining , and certainly when you factor out the orthodox .
As Cohen and Kelman put it , in surveying the literature , " a mounting body of evidence has pointed to a growing distance from Israel of American Jews and the distancing seems to be most pronounced among younger Jews . "
Their own study , which explicitly discounts for life cycle effects , concludes that " we are in the midst of a massive shift in attitudes toward Israel propelled forward by the process of cohort replacement , where the maturing younger cohorts that are least Israel - engaged are replacing the oldest cohorts that are the most Israel - engaged . "
Luntz found the same thing in his focus groups .
And all this takes account of the kids of Persian , Russian , Israel , South African and Argentine Jews coming into the US , and of years of the Birthright program .
So yes , I am pretty confident because the evidence leans strongly one way .
I 've been to dozens of AIPAC meetings ( and a few ADL ) meetings across the country .
You see far fewer young Jews than you do at AIPAC policy conference in Washington .
And that 's AIPAC , which is very well - funded organization that devotes enormous resources to this problem .
I think what people like you should appreciate about liberal bloggers like Ezra Klein , Matthew Yglesias etc is that at least they have enough Zionism to care .
Their sense of concern should be nurtured , not discouraged , since for most secular young Jews the choice is not between a critical Zionism and an uncritical Zionism .
It 's between a critical Zionism and no Zionism .
: You do n't seem too interested in the forces that seek the elimination of Israel -- and here I mean Hezbollah , Hamas , al Qaeda , the Islamic Republic of Iran .
Israel is a democracy , with freedom of speech , in a part of the world in which gays are murdered for being gay ; in which cartoonists are condemned to death ; in which press freedom is practically nonexistent .
Israel struggles to survive in this harsh atmosphere .
Sometimes it does this deeply imperfectly .
For instance , in its attempt to stop Hamas from firing rockets at its own civilians , it killed many Palestinian civilians .
But does this really compare to the genocidal rhetoric , and actions , of Israel 's enemies ?
Do these things really compare to the building of apartments for Jews in Jerusalem ?
This is a question , in case you have n't figured this out yet , about the New York Review of Books , where you published your article .
It 's also a question about proportionality , about the unseemly interest the left takes in Israel 's moral failings .
Can you name another country , facing the same types of enemies , that does a better job protecting individual rights and freedoms while at war with a foe that seeks its physical elimination ? :
Yes , there are leftists ( and rightists ) who focus so disproportionately on Israel 's failings as to raise questions about their true motives .
But I 'm asking you something else : Are Israel 's failings , in fact , so terrible , especially given the line - up of enemies Israel is facing ?
I 'm asking you to confront reality , not your Utopian vision of what a Jewish country should be .
The reality is that there are organizations and countries trying to physically eliminate the Jewish state .
Even with this existential problem , Israel still manages to be the freest and most democratic state in the Middle East , and one that even grants its Muslim citizens the right to build minarets and wear burqas , unlike many countries in Europe .
Again , I 'm asking about proportionality .
Another way of asking this is , what has changed for you ?
Except for the appointment of a very unpleasant and right - wing foreign minister , very little ( the settlements , etc. ) is actually that different than it was five or ten years ago , except that Israel removed its settlements from Gaza and got rockets in return .
So what has changed for you , except the adoption of the apartheid narrative by the far - left ? : I 'm not asking Israel to be Utopian .
I 'm not asking it to allow Palestinians who were forced out ( or fled ) in 1948 to return to their homes .
I 'm not even asking it to allow full , equal citizenship to Arab Israelis , since that would require Israel no longer being a Jewish state .
I 'm actually pretty willing to compromise my liberalism for Israel 's security and for its status as a Jewish state .
What I am asking is that Israel not do things that foreclose the possibility of a Palestinian state in the West Bank , because if it is does that it will become -- and I 'm quoting Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak here -- an " apartheid state . "
Image caption The UK Border Agency removed 20,000 illegal workers in 2009
In his small two - bedroom flat , Felipe looks through a carefully filed thick pile of payslips .
They show he has been making regular tax and national insurance contributions and have been issued by a large well - known company , where he has been working for six years .
Yet Felipe is an illegal immigrant with no right to work in the United Kingdom .
Professor Ian Gordon , the co-author of a report on the issue of illegal working , says that he thinks Felipe 's story is far from unusual .
Prof Gordon , of the London School of Economics , told File on 4 that " probably two - thirds " of illegal workers are paying " some kind of taxes and national insurance " .
" I do n't think that it 's the case that the great majority of irregular migrants live in and work in some entirely cut - off economy , " he adds .
Forged documents
" I think that most of them are on the margins to start with and then well inside the margins of the mainstream economy with some kind of paperwork to support them . "
Some estimate that Felipe is one of about 200,000 illegal workers in London , although there could be more than that .
The UK Border Agency in the South East carries out regular raids on employers .
In the last financial year in the region , there were 22,714 immigration removals .
Back in his flat , Felipe produces his P60 - his annual tax statement .
It shows he paid about £ 750 in national insurance over the course of a year .
I 'm doing the job that most English people would n't do .
I think I have never seen an English person cleaning a toilet Felipe , Illegal worker from Colombia
Felipe , who is from Colombia and has been living in the UK illegally for nine years , claims he bought his national insurance number from a fraudster .
" I just use it as anyone else as anyone else would use his national insurance .
I just hand it to my boss and fill out the forms and that 's it , " he says .
He adds : " I see it [ paying tax and national insurance ] as a kind of payback for me being here .
And I do n't mind - and I prefer that - as long as I can work I am happy .
" The reason for me being here is not just because I want to become rich or because I want to come and take your jobs .
" I 'm doing the job that most English people would n't do .
I think I have never seen an English person cleaning a toilet . "
With tears in his eyes , he says he is doing it for his two young children and regularly sends money back to them in Colombia .
" I do n't want to harm anyone … .
It 's hard to be judged as a criminal when all you are doing is what you think is best for your family .
What I 'm doing cleaning toilets - is that a crime ? "
Bogus National Insurance
For Andrew Large , chief executive of the Cleaning and Support Services Association which represents contract cleaning companies , this is a familiar story .

" This is a problem that my members have come across on a number of occasions .
It seems quite clearly that people are able to use national insurance numbers to which they have no right , " he says .
" They may be legitimate national insurance numbers that have been misappropriated or alternatively , they may be wholly fictitious . "
Mr Large says the government needs to take responsibility .
" From our perspective , it would seem that inside Her Majesty 's Revenue and Customs … there does n't seem to be an effective process for handling any anomalies with regard to the number and the name which might emerge as part of this process .
They certainly do not appear to be communicating with the UK Border Agency . "
A government statement said it was committed to stopping illegal working but added : " It is an employer 's responsibility to ensure they check their employee 's paperwork to ensure they have the right to work in the UK .
" If they can't provide this proof , they will be liable for a fine of up to £ 10,000 per illegal worker .
" All government departments are working together to clamp down on illegal workers and the companies that employ them . "

Howard Dean was on Fox News Sunday this morning , where he blasted the network for what he called racist , phony , crap stories .
Dean said , “ I think Fox News did something that was absolutely racist …
They have been pushing a theme of black racism with this phony Black Panther crap , and this business , and Sotomayor and all this other stuff . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

Dean said , “ Let ’s just be blunt about this .
I do n’t think Newt Gingrich is a racist , and you ’re certainly not a racist , but I think Fox News did something that was absolutely racist .
They had an obligation to find out what was really in the clip .
They have been pushing a theme of black racism with this phony Black Panther crap , and this business , and Sotomayor and all this other stuff .
Look , the Tea Party called out their racist fringe , and the Republican Party has got to stop appealing to its racist fringe , and Fox News is what did that .
You put that on . ”
A whole lot of people including some Fox News viewers agree with all the points that Howard Dean made .
Fox
News is finally getting called out for their endless race baiting .
The network is guided by ideological , not journalistic principles , and Dean was correct to tie their Shirley Sherrod story to other instances of race baiting at FNC .
The Fox News spin is that they did nothing wrong .
They were responsible in their coverage , and according to Glenn Beck , Fox News got the story right .
If by getting the story right , he means getting it completely wrong then he is correct .
FNC has also claimed that they are the real victims of racism , not Shirley Sherrod .
Now is the time for everyone with a voice to be decrying the racist tactics of Fox News .
The strategy to open up old wounds and divide America based on race has been going on since the 2008 general election campaign .
Republicans believe that if they can divide this country along racial lines , they can turn the 2012 presidential election into a tossup .
The reality is the GOP base , which consists of white male voters , is so solidly outnumbered , that the end result of this strategy could actually be shrinkage in support for the GOP .
Howard Dean showed some real guts by calling out Fox News on their own program , and now is the time to turn up the heat in order to ensure that their attempts at the ugly politics of racism do not divide us
This is part of my wind series .
As noted before , I advise wind farm developers on their financing needs , including , as noted in the first link in the diary , US developers .
I had the pleasure of accompanying my most famous client to visit another offshore wind farm under construction with the same turbines .
We took the train to lovely Harwich an hour and a half away from London , and set out to visit the soon - to - be largest offshore wind farm .
It will be the first of several massive wind farms which are larger than 500MW each ( meaning they can produce close to 2 TWh of electricity per year ) , and a price tag in the EUR 1.5 - 2 billion range .
That price can be split roughly in 3 similar - sized bits , being ( i ) the turbines , ( ii ) the marine construction work , including the foundations , and ( iii ) the rest , including development costs , electrical equipment ( high voltage transformer station and cables ) and , if relevant , financing costs .
The size of the different fractions can vary depending on the distance to shore , water depth , site conditions and regulatory framework ( in Germany , for instance , you do n't need to build the high voltage export cable as this has to be taken care of by the grid operator ) .
: : ::
Construction typically starts with installation of the foundations , laying of the intra-array cables , and installation of the foundations .
The offshore transformer station and main export cable are independent tasks which are typically done as early as possible as their absence prevents the operation of the wind farm - but these are " long lead items " - ie it takes time to order them and build them .
: : ::
Offshore transformer station
In this case , the project is so vast that it has 2 transformer platforms and 3 export cables .
Here 's one of the platforms .
It is roughly 30 meters by 30 meters by 30 meters :
: : ::
Foundations
Today , almost all of the foundations - the parts of the structure that are hammered , or anchored on the sea floor and carry the turbines - have been installed , as have most of the " transition pieces " - the intermediate part of the structure which sits between the foundation and the turbine , ensuring that the bit where the turbines are built is perfectly horizontal , and including the boat landing , cable tubes and sometimes some of the electrical equipment .
Here are some of the foundations with nothing on top :
( In the back , you can see the foundation laying vessel , a huge boat , but we were not allowed to approach , as it was engaged in manoeuvring with its anchors and the security distance was quite large )
Here 's a transition piece :
: : ::
The turbines
And the same with the turbines on top :
Most of the turbines were still in the storage area at the port :
You can see the bottom part of the towers on the right , and nacelles on the left .
Blades are also on site , but not visible on that picture
: : ::
As the first picture above suggests , a few of the turbines have been erected already , which means that there was activity across the different tasks on the wind farm , allowing it to see various bits of the construction .
What is striking is the number of vessels engaged in work on such a wind farm ; beyond a number of smaller crew vessels and various tug boats ( not shown here ) , here 's a sample .
Hotel boat
A hotel vessel for the construction crews , located on the edge of the wind farm .
Workers typically spend 2 or 3 weeks in a row over there .
With the site 20 miles from shore , you can save 3 hours of transfer per day for workers - plus they are not woozy or seasick when they get to their tasks ...
It 's like a cruise ship , except that there is no alcohol on board ...
Transport vessel
This is a simple transport vessel , bringing the turbines from Denmark to the staging port .
You can see the two tower sections ( the bottom one is vertical , the second one is horizontal ) and blades .
I would guess the nacelles are transported by a separate boat .
Cable laying vessel
And here is a cable laying vessel .
Notice the platform on the front of the boat , which can carry several kilometers of rolled up cable ( in that case , the boat was not doing any installation ) :
With turbines typically situated 500 - 800 meters from each other ( with larger distances in the prevailing wind directions , to limit wake effects ) , you typically need more internal cabling than export cable , and you need to know exactly where you put these cables , to avoid any damage ( in a famous incident in an earlier wind farm , one of the vessels installing turbines jacked up through one of the cables , damaging it ... )
: : ::
Installation vessels
The project was using at least 3 jack - ups at that point .
Jackups are boats which are able to " stand " on the seafloor thanks to retractable legs which can be lowered to the seabed and carry the boat .
Their usefulness is constrained , naturally , by the size of their legs ( which limits the water depths they can be used in ) and their carrying capacity , both in terms of useful loading area on board and of the capacity of their crane (s ) .
The jackups used by the project were quite different :
The first one was a simple barge with no means of propulsion : it needs to be tugged to site .
It was on its way to the construction site .
We overtook it when we went there ourselves , and it still had n't arrived when we left : the trip requires roughly 6 hours for such a barge .
It can carry 3 full turbines :
As you can note , the tower sections have been pre-assembled onshore .
Any work which can be done onshore is a huge time and cost saver as things are always more complicated offshore .
In this case , blades must be installed individually .
The second jackup is a self - propelled vessel ( ie it can move with its own engines ) ; it can carry 2 turbine sets .
It has strong lifting capacity , but the positioning of the crane between the legs makes it more difficult to load the blades onto the vessel in the harbor .
A third jackup vessel was available ; note how the cranes are located on the " legs , " giving them a lot more freedom to move .
However that boat is also relatively small .
: : ::
There have been two philosophies to build offshore wind farms : consider that it is a wind farm project that happens to be offshore , or consider that it is marine construction work which happens to include wind turbines .
In either case , construction has been complicated until recently by the lack of adequate vessels and the need to make do with equipment which had not been specifically designed for the tasks involved in the offshore installation of wind turbines .
A lot of oil and gas people scoff at the wind industry people when they explain how difficult it has been to build the turbines : after all , the few hundred tons which need to be lifted when the various large bits of a turbine are being installed are rather puny compared to the massive structures built for offshore oil and gas platforms ; but oil&gas people tend to underestimate ( i ) the logistics involved in transporting and building dozens , and now hundreds , of identical structures at sea , and ( ii ) the specific requirements of below - centimeter tolerances to position multi- hundred ton items 80 meters above the sea ...
The land requirements in harbors for storage ( but with reinforced quays to bear the loads ) , the carrying capacity of the vessels ( to transport the parts 20 km - and in forthcoming projects 100 km out at sea ) , the transfer times , the crane specifics ( to install towers , nacelles and blades , which are very different animals ) make this industry a very unique one , and it is now just beginning to work out the best way to do things - and of course , all sites have different characteristics ( depth , distance to shore , nature of the subsea soil , size of the turbines selected ) which make standardised , universal equipment a pipe dream ...
But it 's happening - and it's keeping an increasing number of people busy .
There are worries about how quickly the supply chain will ramp up to accommodate the massive investment plans being contemplated ; ironically , I still think that the technical side will be easier to take care of than building up the commercial teams of the various key players ( turbine manufacturers , project developers , financing institutions ) which must put in place the highly complex contractual framework for these massive , and still risky , projects .
Right now , it seems it 's the same people on almost every other project ...
Japan hangs two death row inmates Published duration 28 July 2010
image caption Justice Minister Keiko Chiba called for debate on the death penalty
Japan has hanged two death row inmates , in the first executions since the new government took power last year .
The two prisoners , both convicted killers , were hanged at the Tokyo Detention Centre .
Justice Minister Keiko Chiba - who opposes the death penalty - witnessed the executions and announced the formation of a group to review the death penalty .
Opinion polls show broad support for capital punishment in Japan .
The two men executed were Kazuo Shinozawa , 59 , convicted of killing six women in a jewellery shop fire , and Hidenori Ogata , 33 , who killed a man and a woman in 2003 .
Ms Chiba said that as justice minister she believed it was her duty to witness the executions in person .
" It made me again think deeply about the death penalty , and I once again strongly felt that there is a need for a fundamental discussion about the death penalty , " she said .
Ms Chiba 's appointment in September - when the new Democratic Party - led government came to power - was seen as a sign that debate could be opened on the issue .
A total of 107 inmates remain on death row in Japan .
Prisoners are usually executed two or three at a time .
Last year , a report from rights group Amnesty International called for an immediate moratorium on executions in Japan , saying that harsh conditions on death row were driving inmates insane .

Small Solar Power Sail Demonstrator ' IKAROS '
Successful Attitude Control by Liquid Crystal Device
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) performed an attitude control experiment ( * 1 ) of the solar sail of the Small Solar Power Sail Demonstrator " IKAROS , " after its deployment , using an attitude control device , or the liquid crystal device , on July 13 , 2010 ( Japan Standard Time , the following dates and time are JST , unless otherwise noted . )
We have since confirmed that the attitude control performance was successfully accomplished as planned through post - experiment data verification and analysis .
The IKAROS was launched from the Tanegahima Space Center on May 21 , 2010 .
The liquid crystal device is a thin - film instrument to change the surface reflection characteristics of sunlight by turning on and off the power of the device .
It is an engineering test device to control attitude using only sunlight pressure without any additional propellant .
Two kinds of technologies are extremely important for a spin solar sail , like the IKAROS 's sail : one is technology to generate small attitude control torque ( * 2 ) constantly without causing oscillation on the large flexible sail , and the other is technology to control the direction ( attitude ) of large angular momentum generated by the spinning membrane without consuming propellant .
The attitude control method using sunlight pressure is one of the most feasible methods for satisfying the above two technological requirements , and JAXA has been a global leader in developing this original method .
JAXA will continue the attitude control experiment by the IKAROS to evaluate the details of the attitude control performance while continuing to conduct research on attitude control technology using sunlight pressure as a technology that enables navigation for longer in time and further in distance by a solar sail .
* 1 The IKAROS usually uses its onboard thrusters attached to its main body , not the liquid crystal device , for attitude control during normal operations .
* 2 Torque is a moment of force to rotate an object about an axis or pivot .
For the attitude control experiment using the liquid crystal device this time , the attitude control torque was minimal as sunlight pressure was used for attitude control , thus , by generating torque constantly , it was possible to control attitude without causing vibration on the membrane .
The 2010 FIFA World Cup is just around the corner , starting June 11 and ending July 11 .
Beyond the hype over which team is favored to win ( it seems that almost everyone has a different prediction — Spain , England , Brazil — ) , it is impossible not to recognize the congregation of languages that will occur during that one month .
Like the Olympics , the World Cup brings extremely diverse countries together ( thirty - two in total for the games , tens more , of course , as spectators ) and facilitates the friendly , if not heated , competition between them .
With thirty - two countries represented , eighteen official languages are shared from English to Spanish to Korean , but tens of various dialects enter the mix as well : Riverense Portuñol spoken in Uruguay or Algerian Arabic spoken , obviously , in Algeria .
In addition to the languages spoken by the teams and spectators , the languages of the host country also require special consideration .
This year ’s World Cup is being hosted by South Africa , a country that recognizes eleven official languages in its constitution and is home to a host of other dialects as well .
The eleven official languages are as follows : Afrikaans , English , IsiNdebele , IsiXhosa , IsiZulu , Northern Sotho , Sesotho , Setswana , SiSwati , Tshivenda , and Xitsonga .
Other languages spoken in South Africa and mentioned in the constitution , though not official , include Kho , Nama , San , sign language , Arabic , German , Greek , Gujarati , Hebrew , Hindi , Portuguese , Sanskrit , Tamil , Telegu , and Urdu .
The indigenous creoles and pidgins like Tsotsi taal and Fanagalo vary the language mix even more .
While these languages are not recognized or considered in the constitution , they are used by various language groups to communicate in the urban environment .
In today ’s global economy , it is easy to assume that English would be the lingua franca of South Africa — a globally common language that would enable a linguistically diverse population to communicate .
While English is popular , representing a total of 8.2 % of the population ( according to the dated 2001 census ) , it lags behind IsiZulu ( 23.8 % ) , IsiXhosa ( 17.6 % ) , Afrikaans ( 13.3 % ) , and Northern Sotho ( 9.4 % ) .
Setswana actually ties with English at 8.2 % .
English might be used for business communication , but , as the fifth most popular language , it obviously does n’t hold a prominent position compared to South Africa ’s more indigenous and other colonized tongues .
Given the diversity and distribution of languages in the country , it is useful to consider the four most popular South African languages ahead of English , especially in regards to the World Cup .
Different Cup matches will take place in stadiums across the country — Bloemfontein , Cape Town , Durban , Johannesburg , Kimberley , Nelspruit , Orkney , Polokwane , Port Elizabeth , Pretoria , and Rustenburg .
These cities are located all over South Africa and since the country ’s official languages tend to be centered in specific geographic locations , a brief history and explanation of the languages help ground the matches in their cultural - linguistic spaces .
IsiZulu
IsiZulu , the most popular language in South Africa , is the language of the Zulu people , South Africa ’s largest ethnic group .
It is a tonal language and is grouped in the Nguni language group along with IsiXhosa , SiSwati , and IsiNdebele .
While the language is spoken across the country , it is most concentrated in the province of KwaZulu - Natal .
A spoken language until the mid-nineteenth century , the written language developed after Christian missionaries first translated the Bible into IsiZulu in 1883 .
The first work of IsiZulu literature translated was Thomas Mofolo ’s Chaka , which appeared in 1910 and was published in 1925 .
IsiXhosa
IsiXhosa , also known as Southern or Cape Nguni , is closely related to IsiZulu , but in distribution is concentrated mostly in the former Transkei , Ciskei and Eastern Cape regions .
Like IsiZulu , it is a tonal language , and it is a language in which various click sounds represent consonants .
The noun is the primary part of speech in IsiXhosa .
For the written language , the Latin alphabet is used as a result of missionary influence , and the first IsiXhosa Bible was produced in 1859 .
While the language used in universities is usually English or Afrikaans , Xhosa is often taught as a subject .
Literature , radio , TV , plays , and the like , are produced in IsiXhosa .
Afrikaans
The third most prominent language , Afrikaans , is arguably the most generally recognized language in South Africa .
A language originating from seventeenth century Dutch settlement , Afrikaans can be simply described as a combination of English , Malay , German , Portuguese , French , and some African languages .
A distinct language from Dutch , it is still possible for Afrikaans and Dutch language speakers to understand each other .
The Afrikaans vocabulary is Dutch , and the language ’s grammar is like a simpler version of Dutch grammar .
The earliest texts of Afrikaans are attributed to “ doggeral verse ” from 1795 and a dialogue transcribed by a Dutch traveler in 1825 .
The first authoritative text , however , is considered to be L.H. Meurant ’s Zamenspraak tusschen Klaas Waarzegger en Jan Twyfelaar ( “ Conversation between Claus Truthsayer and John Doubter “ ) which was published in 1861 .
Sotho , Sesotho sa Leboa , Sepedi
The fourth most popular language is Northern Sotho , otherwise known as Sotho or Sesotho sa Leboa ( the autoglottonym used by the United Nations ) .
Northern Sotho is often referred to as Sepedi ( as it was originally designated in the constitution ) , but it has since been designated as Northern Sotho in an attempt to recognize the thirty closely related dialects the language represents instead of the one Pedi dialect .
Historically , Northern Sotho has been associated with Pedi because the original missionaries had contact with the Pedi people , but various non-Pedi dialects are also encompassed in the language .
The other official and unofficial South African languages , combined with the official World Cup languages , and all the other spoken languages Cup fans will be able to hear in the street in South Africa , will undoubtedly make this World Cup a celebration of linguistic diversity .
With the matches broadcast all over the world , it is impossible to discern the total languages and dialects that will be represented by the month long event — it ’s all enough to make a language lover scream “ GOAAAAAL ! ”

Language Test for Immigrants Causes a Stir Amongst English Soccer Fans
After years of disappointment , researchers have finally found a potential basis for an HIV vaccine .
Scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases say they have discovered three human antibodies that neutralize more than 90 percent of the current circulating HIV - 1 strains .
" This is significant because we 've now found antibodies that are good templates for HIV vaccine development , " explains Peter Kwong , chief of structural biology for the institute , and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Science .
" You can potentially inactivate the virus , " he says .
Although previous antibodies were promising , Kwong says , they often posed structural challenges that made them more difficult in terms of vaccine production .
The researchers were able to narrow the data to three specific antibodies that are able to bind to a " site of vulnerability " on the HIV - 1 strain , and it also helps that these antibodies appear in about 10 percent of all people currently infected with HIV .
" With this information we know the human immune system can make the antibodies , and this suggests the capability of the human body to make them in mass . "
Dr. Anthony Fauci , who heads the NIAID , tells CNN that it ’s really rare that someone would get a good immune response against the virus that causes AIDS .
Researchers now have found one individual who had such an immune response .
“ Now that we have those antibodies , we can use them to precisely identify the virus , " says Fauci .
He adds this is a new concept and “ the potential for a vaccine is here . ”
HIV / AIDS is the world 's leading infectious killer , ccording to the World Health Organization .
The disease accounted for an estimated 2 million deaths in 2008 , and more than 33 million people are living with the disease worldwide .
The researchers say the findings put them one step closer to their goal , and among their next steps are plans to make sure other people – not just those infected with HIV – can create these types of antibodies , and figure out how to derive the right inputs to be able to potentially mass produce more " broadly - neutralizing " antibodies to block nearly all HIV strains in the future .
I ’ve seen a lot of transit logos all over the world , and this is my personal favorite .
Perhaps one has to know Paris to appreciate it .
But that ’s fine ; it ’s a logo for Parisians .
In Paris , you need only draw a circle with a curving blue line through it , and anyone will see that as the city and its river , the Seine .
Huge liberties can then be taken with the shape of the Seine ( map version here ) to suggest the outline of a human profile .
That the face seems to be looking upward is brilliant ; it conveys reverence and relaxation in the same moment .
To take the city ’s original life force , the river , and render it as a face can take you deeper into the idea that Paris itself is a being , a consciousness , not just a playground for our egos .
( UPDATE :
If you go to the RATP website , you ’ll see the slogan that goes with the logo : Aimer la ville .
Literally , “ Love the city . ” )
I also love the fact that it ’s not trying to be about transport in any literal sense .
It aims higher .
Transport in a big city is like the circulation of blood .
It does n’t just enable urban life , it is urban life .
It ’s not just a product or a service ; it ’s a way of describing what the city is .
For whatever reason , I feel warmth and wisdom from this little logo whenever I see it .
Luxury car worth £ 1.2 m clamped outside Harrods Published duration 29 July 2010
image caption The Koenigsegg CCXR and Lamborghini Murcielago were both clamped outside Harrods
A luxury car valued at £ 1.2 m was clamped outside Harrods in central London after being illegally parked .
The Koenigsegg CCXR and a £ 350,000 Lamborghini Murcielago LP670 - 4 SuperVeloce were both clamped on the afternoon of 22 July .
Kensington and Chelsea Council said the light - blue vehicles were in serious contravention of parking rules .
The Knightsbridge store was bought by investors from Qatar in April for £ 1.5bn .
It was bought by the Qatar Holding group , led by the Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al - Thani , from Mohammed Al Fayed .
Both the cars are very rare with the Swedish - made Koenigsegg being one of only six ever made .
' Effective deterrent '
A Harrods spokesman said : " Any matters relating to parking tickets and enforcement are strictly the domain of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea . "
The council said £ 120 penalty charge notices were issued , but the cars were released for £ 70 each as the fines were paid within 14 days .
A spokesman said : " There is a greater shortage of parking space for residents in Kensington and Chelsea than practically anywhere else in the country .
" At the same time we have a huge number of visiting motorists attracted here by our fine shops , restaurants and other attractions .
Tories and Lib Dems publish the agreement that will underpin their coalition government
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
This document sets out agreements reached between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats on a range of issues .
These are the issues that needed to be resolved between us in order for us to work together as a strong and stable government .
It will be followed in due course by a final coalition agreement , covering the full range of policy and including foreign , defence and domestic policy issues not covered in this document .
1. Deficit Reduction
The parties agree that deficit reduction and continuing to ensure economic recovery is the most urgent issue facing Britain .
We have therefore agreed that there will need to be :
• A significantly accelerated reduction in the structural deficit over the course of a parliament , with the main burden of deficit reduction borne by reduced spending rather than increased taxes ;
• Arrangements that will protect those on low incomes from the effect of public sector pay constraint and other spending constraints ;
• And protection of jobs by stopping Labour 's proposed jobs tax .
The parties agree that a plan for deficit reduction should be set out in an emergency budget within 50 days of the signing of any agreement ; the parties note that the credibility of a plan on deficit reduction depends on its long - term deliverability , not just the depth of immediate cuts .
New forecasts of growth and borrowing should be made by an independent Office for Budget Responsibility for this emergency budget .
The parties agree that modest cuts of £ 6bn to non-frontline services can be made within the financial year 2010 - 11 , subject to advice from the Treasury and the Bank of England on their feasibility and advisability .
Some proportion of these savings can be used to support jobs , for example through the cancelling of some backdated demands for business rates .
Other policies upon which we are agreed will further support job creation and green investment , such as work programmes for the unemployed and a green deal for energy efficiency investment .
The parties agree that reductions can be made to the child trust fund and tax credits for higher earners .
2. Spending review – NHS , schools and a fairer society
The parties agree that a full spending review should be held , reporting this autumn , following a fully consultative process involving all tiers of government and the private sector .
The parties agree that funding for the NHS should increase in real terms in each year of the parliament , while recognising the impact this decision would have on other departments .
The target of spending 0.7 % of GNI on overseas aid will also remain in place .
We will fund a significant premium for disadvantaged pupils from outside the schools budget by reductions in spending elsewhere .
The parties commit to holding a full strategic security and defence review alongside the spending review with strong involvement of the Treasury .
The government will be committed to the maintenance of Britain 's nuclear deterrent , and have agreed that the renewal of Trident should be scrutinised to ensure value for money .
Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case for alternatives .
We will immediately play a strong role in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference and press for continued progress on multilateral disarmament .
The parties commit to establishing an independent commission to review the long - term affordability of public sector pensions , while protecting accrued rights .
We will restore the earnings link for the basic state pension from April 2011 with a " triple guarantee " that pensions are raised by the higher of earnings , prices or 2.5 % , as proposed by the Liberal Democrats .
3 . Tax measures
The parties agree that the personal allowance for income tax should be increased in order to help lower and middle - income earners .
We agree to announce in the first budget a substantial increase in the personal allowance from April 2011 , with the benefits focused on those with lower and middle incomes .
This will be funded with the money that would have been used to pay for the increase in employee national insurance thresholds proposed by the Conservatives , as well as revenues from increases in capital gains tax rates for non-business assets as described below .
The increase in employer national insurance thresholds proposed by the Conservatives will go ahead in order to stop Labour 's jobs tax .
We also agree to a longer - term policy objective of further increasing the personal allowance to £ 10,000 , making further real - terms steps each year towards this objective .
We agree that this should take priority over other tax cuts , including cuts to inheritance tax .
We also agree that provision will be made for Liberal Democrat MPs to abstain on budget resolutions to introduce transferable tax allowances for married couples without prejudice to this coalition agreement .
The parties agree that a switch should be made to a per-plane rather than per- passenger duty ; a proportion of any increased revenues over time will be used to help fund increases in the personal allowance .
We further agree to seek a detailed agreement on taxing non-business capital gains at rates similar or close to those applied to income , with generous exemptions for entrepreneurial business activities .
The parties agree that tackling tax avoidance is essential for the new government , and that all efforts will be made to do so , including detailed development of Liberal Democrat proposals .
4. Banking Reform
The parties agree that reform to the banking system is essential to avoid a repeat of Labour 's financial crisis , to promote a competitive economy , to sustain the recovery and to protect and sustain jobs .
We agree that a banking levy will be introduced .
We will seek a detailed agreement on implementation .
We agree to bring forward detailed proposals for robust action to tackle unacceptable bonuses in the financial services sector ; in developing these proposals we will ensure they are effective in reducing risk .
We agree to bring forward detailed proposals to foster diversity , promote mutuals and create a more competitive banking industry .
We agree that ensuring the flow of credit to viable SMEs [ small and medium enterprises ] is essential for supporting growth and should be a core priority for a new government , and we will work together to develop effective proposals to do so .
This will include consideration of both a major loan guarantee scheme and the use of net lending targets for the nationalised banks .
The parties wish to reduce systemic risk in the banking system and will establish an independent commission to investigate the complex issue of separating retail and investment banking in a sustainable way ; while recognising that this would take time to get right , the commission will be given an initial time frame of one year to report .
The parties agree that the regulatory system needs reform to avoid a repeat of Labour 's financial crisis .
We agree to bring forward proposals to give the Bank of England control of macro-prudential regulation and oversight of micro-prudential regulation .
The parties also agree to rule out joining the European single currency during the duration of this agreement .
5. Immigration
We have agreed that there should be an annual limit on the number of non-EU economic migrants admitted into the UK to live and work .
We will consider jointly the mechanism for implementing the limit .
We will end the detention of children for immigration purposes .
6. Political Reform
The parties agree to the establishment of five - year fixed - term parliaments .
A Conservative - Liberal Democrat coalition government will put a binding motion before the House of Commons in the first days following this agreement stating that the next general election will be held on the first Thursday of May 2015 .
Following this motion , legislation will be brought forward to make provision for fixed - term parliaments of five years .
This legislation will also provide for dissolution if 55 % or more of the House votes in favour .
The parties will bring forward a referendum bill on electoral reform , which includes provision for the introduction of the alternative vote in the event of a positive result in the referendum , as well as for the creation of fewer and more equal sized constituencies .
Both parties will whip their parliamentary parties in both houses to support a simple majority referendum on the alternative vote , without prejudice to the positions parties will take during such a referendum .
The parties will bring forward early legislation to introduce a power of recall , allowing voters to force a byelection where an MP was found to have engaged in serious wrongdoing and having had a petition calling for a byelection signed by 10 % of his or her constituents .
We agree to establish a committee to bring forward proposals for a wholly or mainly elected upper chamber on the basis of proportional representation .
The committee will come forward with draft motions by December 2010 .
It is likely that this bill will advocate single long terms of office .
It is also likely there will be a grandfathering system for current peers .
In the interim , lords appointments will be made with the objective of creating a second chamber reflective of the share of the vote secured by the political parties in the last general election .
The parties will bring forward the proposals of the Wright committee for reform to the House of Commons in full – starting with the proposed committee for management of programmed business and including government business within its scope by the third year of the parliament .
The parties agree to reduce electoral fraud by speeding up the implementation of individual voter registration .
We have agreed to establish a commission to consider the " West Lothian question " .
The parties agree to the implementation of the Calman commission proposals and the offer of a referendum on further Welsh devolution .
The parties will tackle lobbying through introducing a statutory register of lobbyists .
We also agree to pursue a detailed agreement on limiting donations and reforming party funding in order to remove big money from politics .
The parties will promote the radical devolution of power and greater financial autonomy to local government and community groups .
This will include a full review of local government finance .
7. Pensions and welfare
The parties agree to phase out the default retirement age and hold a review to set the date at which the state pension age starts to rise to 66 , although it will not be sooner than 2016 for men and 2020 for women .
We agree to end the rules requiring compulsory annuitisation at 75 .
We agree to implement the parliamentary and health ombudsman 's recommendation to make fair and transparent payments to Equitable Life policyholders , through an independent payment scheme , for their relative loss as a consequence of regulatory failure .
The parties agree to end all existing welfare - to - work programmes and to create a single welfare - to - work programme to help all unemployed people get back into work .
We agree that jobseeker 's allowance claimants facing the most significant barriers to work should be referred to the aforementioned newly created welfare - to - work programme immediately , not after 12 months as is currently the case .
We agree that jobseeker 's allowance claimants aged under 25 should be referred to the programme after a maximum of six months .
The parties agree to realign contracts with welfare - to - work service providers to reflect more closely the results they achieve in getting people back into work .
We agree that the funding mechanism used by government to finance welfare - to - work programmes should be reformed to reflect the fact that initial investment delivers later savings in lower benefit expenditure .
We agree that receipt of benefits for those able to work should be conditional on the willingness to work .
8. Education
Schools
We agree to promote the reform of schools in order to ensure :
• That new providers can enter the state school system in response to parental demand ;
• That all schools have greater freedom over curriculum , and that all schools are held properly accountable .
Higher education
We await Lord Browne 's final report into higher education funding and will judge its proposals against the need to :
• Increase social mobility ;
• Take into account the impact on student debt ;
• Ensure a properly funded university sector ;
• Improve the quality of teaching , advance scholarship , and attract a higher proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds .
If the response of the government to Lord Browne 's report is one that Liberal Democrats cannot accept , then arrangements will be made to enable Liberal Democrat MPs to abstain in any vote .
9. Relations with the EU
We agree that the British government will be a positive participant in the European Union , playing a strong and positive role with our partners , with the goal of ensuring that all the nations of Europe are equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century : global competitiveness , global warming and global poverty .
We agree that there should be no further transfer of sovereignty or powers over the course of the next parliament .
We will examine the balance of the EU 's existing competences and will , in particular , work to limit the application of the working time directive in the United Kingdom .
We agree that we will amend the 1972 European Communities
Act so that any proposed future treaty that transferred areas of power , or competences , would be subject to a referendum on that treaty – a " referendum lock " .
We will amend the 1972 European Communities
Act so that the use of any passerelle would require primary legislation .
We will examine the case for a United Kingdom sovereignty bill to make it clear that ultimate authority remains with parliament .
We agree that Britain will not join or prepare to join the euro in this parliament .
We agree that we will strongly defend the UK 's national interests in the forthcoming EU budget negotiations and that the EU budget should only focus on those areas where the EU can add value .
We agree that we will press for the European parliament only to have one seat , in Brussels .
We agree that we will approach forthcoming legislation in the area of criminal justice on a case - by - case basis , with a view to maximising our country 's security , protecting Britain 's civil liberties and preserving the integrity of our criminal justice system .
Britain will not participate in the establishment of any European public prosecutor .
10 . Civil liberties
The parties agree to implement a full programme of measures to reverse the substantial erosion of civil liberties under the Labour government and roll back state intrusion .
This will include :
• A freedom or great repeal bill ;
• The scrapping of the ID card scheme , the national identity register , the next generation of biometric passports and the Contact Point database ;
• Outlawing the fingerprinting of children at school without parental permission ;
• The extension of the scope of the Freedom of Information Act to provide greater transparency ;
• Adopting the protections of the Scottish model for the DNA database ;
• The protection of historic freedoms through the defence of trial by jury ;
• The restoration of rights to non-violent protest ;
• The review of libel laws to protect freedom of speech ;
• Safeguards against the misuse of anti-terrorism legislation ;
• Further regulation of CCTV ;
• Ending of storage of internet and email records without good reason ;
• A new mechanism to prevent the proliferation of unnecessary new criminal offences .
11 . Environment
The parties agree to implement a full programme of measures to fulfil our joint ambitions for a low carbon and eco-friendly economy , including :
• The establishment of a smart grid and the roll - out of smart meters ;
• The full establishment of feed - in tariff systems in electricity – as well as the maintenance of banded ROCs ;
• Measures to promote a huge increase in energy from waste through anaerobic digestion ;
• The creation of a green investment bank ;
The provision of home energy improvement paid for by the savings from lower energy bills ;
• Retention of energy performance certificates while scrapping HIPs ;
• Measures to encourage marine energy ;
• The establishment of an emissions performance standard that will prevent coal - fired power stations being built unless they are equipped with sufficient CCS to meet the emissions performance standard ;
• The establishment of a high - speed rail network ;
• The cancellation of the third runway at Heathrow ;
• The refusal of additional runways at Gatwick and Stansted ;
• The replacement of the air passenger duty with a per - flight duty ;
• The provision of a floor price for carbon , as well as efforts to persuade the EU to move towards full auctioning of ETS permits ;
• Measures to make the import or possession of illegal timber a criminal offence ;
• Measures to promote green spaces and wildlife corridors in order to halt the loss of habitats and restore biodiversity ;
• Mandating a national recharging network for electric and plug - in hybrid vehicles ;
• Continuation of the present government 's proposals for public sector investment in CCS technology for four coal - fired power stations ; and a specific commitment to reduce central government carbon emissions by 10 % within 12 months .
We are agreed that we would seek to increase the target for energy from renewable sources , subject to the advice of the climate change committee .
Liberal Democrats have long opposed any new nuclear construction .
Conservatives , by contrast , are committed to allowing the replacement of existing nuclear power stations provided they are subject to the normal planning process for major projects ( under a new national planning statement ) and provided also that they receive no public subsidy .
We have agreed a process that will allow Liberal Democrats to maintain their opposition to nuclear power while permitting the government to bring forward the national planning statement for ratification by parliament so that new nuclear construction becomes possible .
This process will involve :
• The government completing the drafting of a national planning statement and putting it before parliament ;
• Specific agreement that a Liberal Democrat spokesman will speak against the planning statement , but that Liberal Democrat MPs will abstain ; and clarity that this will not be regarded as an issue of confidence .
While the high - profile Google settlement has captured the attention of the publishing industry at large , a contentious copyright infringement lawsuit filed in Atlanta in 2008 by academic publishers against four individuals at Georgia State University has quietly progressed .
And while a New York court now considers whether to approve the sweeping Google deal , a court in Atlanta could yet deliver something that publishers expressly chose to avoid in their settlement with Google : a fair use ruling .
The case , known as Cambridge University Press , et al. v. Patton et al. , involves a popular practice known as e-reserves , or electronic reserves , on college campuses and the murky contours of copyright and fair use in the digital age .
But perhaps the most notable aspect of the suit is that publishers are in essence suing their very partners in the scholarly publishing enterprise ( including a university librarian ) , something critics say represents something of a waterloo for publishing .
Georgia on Their Minds
For those unfamiliar with the practice , e-reserves takes its name from the traditional library " reserve " model , where a professor makes a limited number of physical copies of articles or a book chapter available for students .
Those copies were generally subject to permission , and proper reproduction fees were paid to the publishers .
In the digital world , that 's all changed .
Rather than make multiple physical copies , faculty now scan or download chapters or articles , create a single copy , and place that copy on a server where students can access it ( and in some cases print , download , or share ) .
Since the practice relies on fair use ( creating a single digital copy , usually from a resource already paid for , for educational purposes ) , permission generally is n't sought , and thus permission fees are n't paid , making the price right for students strapped by the high cost of tuition and textbooks , as well as for libraries with budgets stretched thinner every year .
Not surprisingly , e-reserves are widely used and are immensely popular .
Students and instructors love the convenience , ease of use , and accessibility .
They are efficient and fit with the way teachers teach and students learn in the digital age .
In addition , e-reserves facilitate innovations , like distance learning and collaboration .
The problem , publishers say , is that e-reserves are unmonitored , and the practice is so varied that the system is routinely abused .
In reality , the term e-reserve today represents pretty much any kind of digital course content , whether managed by the library , placed in a course management system ( CMS ) like Blackboard , or hosted on a personal or faculty Web site .
And e-reserves also encompass the full range of course reading , from a fraction of supplemental reading to 100 % of assigned works , denying publishers the reproduction fees ( or sales ) they 'd come to rely on .
" It is a significant enough revenue stream for publishers to be concerned about , " says Sandy Thatcher , executive editor for social sciences and humanities at Penn State University Press .
" The paperback and the permissions markets have eroded over time because of e-reserves and course management systems , and if you can't substitute the lost revenue , you can't publish new books . "
Indeed , there has been mounting concern over e-reserve practices since the early 1990s , when publishers predicted that e-reserves could erode revenue from printed coursepacks .
In 1994 publishers sought to deal with e-reserves at the Conference on Fair Use ( CONFU ) , but the issue proved so contentious that the participants could not agree on a recommendation for the final report .
Since then , the threat of litigation has loomed over a number of universities concerning their e-reserves , as publishers ' reproduction revenues dipped .
Allan Adler , AAP 's v-p for legal and governmental affairs , has flatly denied that AAP ever threatened litigation against uni-versities over e-reserves , though he acknowledged there is a perception of " arm- twisting " out there .
In 2003 , AAP lawyers targeted the University of California , San Diego .
In 2006 , Cornell University and AAP released joint guidelines for electronic content , which Cornell officials say were in fact drafted under an implicit threat of litigation .
And in January of 2008 , AAP praised new accords with Syracuse , Marquette , and Hofstra universities regarding new guidelines for the use of electronic content , also , reportedly , with the stick of litigation .
These guidelines , or " best practices , " have mostly satisfied publishers so far .
They generally instruct those who wish to post e-reserves of some basic conditions so they can determine whether their use is fair use .
For example , e-reserve readings can make up only a small portion of the total assigned readings for any one course ; access is limited to students enrolled in the class ; and the readings should be hosted on a secure , password - protected server and not left up from semester to semester .
Adler admits that AAP did set out to " get the attention of these institutions in a serious way " when engaging these universities to adopt e-reserve guidelines .
But he insists a lawsuit was never the goal , pointing out that publishers have not been , and would not be , active in litigating copyright issues " like the music , movie , or software industries . "
AAP 's goal , Adler said , was to bring stakeholders to simple consensus : that practices and uses that required permission in print require permission in the electronic realm as well .
" We see that as black letter law in the United States , " Adler says .
Thatcher , meanwhile , says that Georgia State University was among the universities AAP tried to engage in a discussion about guidelines , but that university officials " rebuffed every attempt . "
Show Time
Out of patience , in April 2008 , publishers sued four individuals at Georgia State University in their " official capacities . "
Niko Pfund , publisher of Oxford University Press , one of the named plaintiffs in the case , along with Cambridge University Press and SAGE Publications , said the plaintiffs were reticent to sue , but had little choice .
" I consider this a failure of dialogue , " Pfund says of the suit .
" It 's a shame .
We 've successfully come to agreements with others over the years .
But Georgia State just would n't talk with us . "
The allegations in the complaint offer some sense of just how much material is being accessed through electronic course content systems on college campuses : publishers claim that at Georgia State , more than 6,700 works were " made available through a variety of online systems and outlets " without permission , representing " systematic , widespread , and unauthorized copying and distribution of a vast amount of copyrighted works " for students in more than 600 courses .
On one hand , the lawsuit has certainly served as a shot across the bow of the university library community and faculties who use course management systems , and has prompted many schools to revisit their policies and procedures .
But the legal case against Georgia State itself has been a complex , uphill battle for publishers from the start .
For one , as a state institution , Georgia State is immune under " state sovereign immunity , " a constitutional doctrine that protects states from prosecution in federal courts — and copyright is federal law .
That 's why , under a specific legal exception , publishers sued individual defendants at Georgia State — including president Carl Patton , provost Ron Henry , librarian Charlene Hurt ( who has since retired ) — and also why the case is limited to seeking an injunction to stop Georgia State 's e-reserve practices only , no damages .
It is unclear how serious settlement talks have been between the two sides .
But Georgia State has fought the case strongly and appears to have put itself in position to defeat the suit .
University officials have all but admitted that some of its e-reserves were not password protected in the past , but they attribute that to a vendor glitch , since repaired .
And in a remarkable coincidence , just when the suit was filed , Georgia State revised — and greatly tightened — its e-reserve policy .
In a court filing , Georgia State attorneys then argued that the new , conservative e-reserve policy rendered any claims about Georgia State 's past conduct moot .
After all , since only injunctive relief was available to the plaintiffs , why should the defendants have to fight against an injunction that to bar practices no longer in effect ?
The court agreed and on June 22 , 2009 , in a major blow to the publishers ' case , issued a protective order , limiting discovery in the case to Georgia State 's " ongoing and continuous conduct . "
In other words , the strongest evidence — the 6,700 infringing copies cited in the complaint — were gone .
To observers , that should have paved the way for a graceful exit via a settlement .
After all , both sides could now claim victory .
Publishers could claim the suit succeeded in changing the liberal policies governing electronic course content at Georgia State .
And Georgia State had avoided an injunction .
But the case continues .
In March , both sides petitioned the court for summary judgment , and a ruling could come soon .
But if summary judgment is n't granted , it could very well be off to trial .
Ca n't We All Just Get Along ?
While publishers hope for an injunction — and perhaps dream about a landmark fair use ruling in their favor — critics of the suit say victory would be hollow , only exacerbating the dysfunction that now pervades scholarly publishing and the business of higher education , especially in such difficult economic times .
" If publishers win an injunction , they would hope to get universities to pay for permissions more often , " says Duke University scholarly communication officer Kevin Smith , who has blogged extensively about the case .
" But the money simply is n't there .
So either our choices for student readings will get narrower , or the money that previously went to collections will go to permissions .
Neither of those things are good outcomes for publishing . "
Barbara Fister , a librarian at Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota and a popular columnist for Library Journal , agrees .
" Increasing students ' costs by replacing e-reserves with coursepacks , print or electronic , is , frankly , a nonstarter , " she wrote in a recent column about the suit .
With Congress already keeping an eye on the cost of textbooks and tuition , she notes , a ruling against Georgia State that in turn makes students pay for virtually every assigned reading would be " a politically toxic " outcome .
" But it 's equally unlikely that cash - strapped institutions would be willing or able to subsidize the costs on behalf of students . "
Thatcher , who has also written extensively on the case , says most libraries probably do n't have to be so concerned with a judgment against Georgia State because the university 's behavior was so " extreme . "
But he concedes that a judgment could force some institutions to reconsider " how aggressive " they want to be about fair use .
" Clearly , what publishers are aiming at is not allowing universities to call everything fair use and drying up any possible revenue streams from the reproduction of articles and book chapters , " he says , adding that the Georgia State suit is a sad example of the " systematic dysfunction " in higher education , where schools will pay for an assistant football coach but not adequately support their libraries , faculty , or their presses , leaving publishers no choice but to fight for their revenue streams .
" We 're often portrayed as the bad guys , but we 're asked to do a job .
And yet when we ask for a fee from the rest of the university , we 're told ‘ no . ' "
Out of the Courts
Indeed , to the uninitiated , scholarly publishing is a curious enterprise .
Simplified , it works something like this : universities or the government subsidize a professor 's research .
The professor , who is required to publish frequently for professional advancement , gives his research to a scholarly publisher , usually for little or no money .
That publisher , who adds value through editing , peer review , and production , assumes the copyright , packages , and sells the research back to the university at a markup .
And those mark - ups have proven significant over time , especially as the digital age has fostered an explosion of new databases and resources .
Even with a large chunk of the sector non-profit , make no mistake : scholarly publishing is big business .
In the Scholarly Publishing Roundtable report commissioned by Congress and released in January 2010 , the total worldwide revenue from the journal market alone was estimated at more than $ 8 billion in 2008 ( about $ 3 billion from the U.S. market alone ) and employed some 110,000 people worldwide .
Indeed , while trade publishing has remained flat in recent years , commercial academic publishing has been able to post significant growth .
That 's because on the academic side , the digital revolution is all but over — print has been dethroned ( but not banished ) , and digital rules — although clearly not in peace .
Whatever happens in court in the coming months , observers say the battle over e-reserves and the lawsuit at Georgia State have shown that begging for crumbs at the table of fair use is not a viable way to run a higher education system — not for publishers , who need support to cover their costs , not for faculty , who need to publish for promotion and tenure , not for the public who need a vibrant economy of ideas , and certainly not for students , who simply can't afford the escalating prices of learning materials .
" We need to be looking for new business models , and some of the arguments in the Georgia State case about how adequate the current licensing regime is suggest to me that we have n't found that model yet , " Smith told PW .
" Right now , the licensing model for permissions is inefficient and expensive , from staff time to hunt down who owns which rights , whether our annual campus license covers the use , whether we have CCC permission , and we often have to make quick decisions .
It is an extremely cumbersome process .
Yes , we need more clarity about what 's fair use and when it applies , but what we really need is a more efficient system . "
Curious about how a verdict against Georgia State might play out , Smith recently asked Duke 's e-reserves staff to give him random examples of recent permission fees .
" For the 2007 book No Caption Needed , we paid $ 150 for permission to make just 17 % of the work available to 12 students .
This amounts to over $ 12 per student to gain access to less than a fifth of a work that sells for $ 35 retail .
For an older work — Dealing with Terrorism : Stick or Carrot ?
— we paid about $ 10 per student to make 21 % of this $ 30 book available . "
These are not extreme examples , Smith insists .
In another example , fees exceeded $ 1,000 , more than $ 25 per student .
" As we are asked to pay ever - increasing costs for decreasing value , " he observes , " it seems that an unsustainable system is being created . "
Coming up with a " more efficient system " for scholarly communication has not been easy .
A debate has raged for a decade over the viability of such regimes as peer - reviewed open access publishing , institutional repositories , " self - archiving , " and other campus policies that urge faculty to retain their copyrights and harness technology to make scholarship more accessible , open , usable , and reusable by the very people who create it .
However , publishers have raised serious questions about the sustainability and wisdom of open access , a system that would shift the costs of publishing to authors through publication fees , while making the scholarship freely accessible to the user .
For most publishers , it really does n't matter who pays , as long as somebody covers the costs of publishing , archiving , and maintaining scholarly communication .
But are governments and universities , seemingly in constant budget flux , the best agents to control access to the scholarly record ?
Without some profit motive , can innovation thrive ?
Tough questions loom for scholarly publishing , but observers doubt that a fair use verdict in the Georgia State case will raise anything but more questions about the lack of support for teaching , learning — and publishing — in higher education .
" Something is badly broken when university presses sue universities for using their materials , " Fister notes .
" We need to stop playing a shell game that merely shifts the costs and benefits around .
It 's not sustainable . "
The Misconception :
You know why you like the things you like and feel the way you feel .
The Truth :
The origin of certain emotional states is unavailable to you , and when pressed to explain them , you will just make something up .
Take a look at this piece of art :
It is one of the most popular pieces of art ever featured at DeviantArt.com .
Now , imagine you have to write an essay on why it is popular .
Go ahead , think of a reasonable explanation .
No , do n’t keep reading .
Give it a shot .
Explain why this is a great photo .
Ok , moving on .
Is there a certain song you love , or a work of art ?
Perhaps there is a movie you keep returning to over the years , or book .
Go ahead and imagine one of those favorite things .
Now , in one sentence , try to explain why you like it .
Chances are , you will find it difficult to put into words , but if pressed you will probably be able to come up with something .
The problem is , according to research , your explanation is probably going to be total bullshit .
Tim Wilson at UVA demonstrated this with The Poster Test .
He brought a group of students into a room and showed them a series of posters .
The students were told they could take any one they wanted as a gift and keep it .
He then brought in another group , and told them the same thing , but this time they had to explain why they wanted the poster before they picked .
He then waited six months and asked the two groups what they thought of their choices .
The first group , the ones who just got to grab a poster and leave , they all loved their choice .
The second group , the ones who had to write out why , hated theirs .
The first group , the grab - and - go people , usually picked a nice , fancy painting .
The second group , the ones who had to explain their choice , usually picked an inspirational poster with a cat clinging to a rope .
This brings up a lot of concerns .
It calls into question the entire industry of critical analysis of art – video games , music , film , poetry , literature – all of it .
It also makes things like focus groups and market analysis seem like farts in the wind .
When you ask people why they do or do not like things , they must then translate something from a deep , emotion , primal part of their psyche into the language of the higher , logical , rational world of words and sentences and paragraphs .
Also , when you attempt to justify your decisions or emotional attachments , you start worrying about what your explanation says about you as a person .
In the above example , most people truly preferred the lady over the cat , but they could n’t conjure up the rational explanation why , at least not in a way which would make logical sense on paper .
On the other hand , you can write all sorts of bullshit about a motivational poster .
In a similar experiment by the same psychologist who conducted the Poster Test , people were shown two small photos of two different people and were asked which one was more attractive .
They then were handed a larger photo .
They were told it was the one they picked , but it was actually a completely different person .
They were then asked why they chose it .
Each time , people dutifully spun a yarn explaining their choice .
Believing you understand your motivations and desires , your likes and dislikes , is called the Introspection Illusion .
You believe you know yourself , and why you are the way you are .
You believe this knowledge tells you how you will act in all future situations .
Research shows otherwise .
Time after time , experiments show introspection is not the act of tapping into your innermost mental constructs , but is instead a fabrication , a construction , a fiction .
You look at what you did , or how you felt , and you make up some sort of explanation which you can reasonably believe .
If you have to tell others , you make up an explanation they can believe too .
When it comes to explaining why you like the things you like , you are not so smart , and the very act of having to explain yourself can change your attitudes .
In this new era of Twitter and Facebook and blogs , just about everyone is broadcasting their love or hate of art .
Just look at all the vitriol and praise being lobbed back and forth over “ Avatar ” or “ Lost . ”
When “ Titanic ” earned its Oscars , some people were saying it might just be the greatest film ever made .
Now , it ’s considered good but schmaltzy , a fine film , but decidedly melodramatic .
What will people think in 100 years ?
It would be wise to remember many of the works we now consider classics were in their time critically panned .
For instance , this is how one reviewer described “ Moby Dick ” in 1851 :
This is an ill - compounded mixture of romance and matter - of - fact .
The idea of a connected and collected story has obviously visited and abandoned its writer again and again in the course of composition .
The style of his tale is in places disfigured by mad ( rather than bad ) English ; and its catastrophe is hastily , weakly , and obscurely managed …
We have little more to say in reprobation or in recommendation of this absurd book …
Mr. Melville has to thank himself only if his horrors and his heroics are flung aside by the general reader , as so much trash belonging to the worst school of Bedlam literature — since he seems not so much unable to learn as disdainful of learning the craft of an artist .
– Henry F. Chorley , in London Athenaeum
Now , this book is considered one of a handful of great American novels and is held up as an example of the best pieces of literature ever written .
Chances are though , no one can truly explain why .

As you may have heard , Mississippi Public Broadcasting dropped Terry Gross ’ Fresh Air program recently over “ recurring inappropriate content . ”
You know , like the inappropriate way Gross always says , “ That ’s funny ” after her guests say something funny , instead of just laughing like a normal person .
Ha , just kidding :
It was because “ too often Fresh Air 's interviews include gratuitous discussions on issues of an explicit sexual nature , ” according to MPB executive director Dr. Judith Lewis , who adds , “ We believe that most of these discussions do not contribute to or meaningfully enhance serious - minded public discourse on sexual issues . ”
While this probably comes as no surprise to Fresh Air ’s vast , onanist fanbase who regularly use the prim , hesitant delivery of Terry Gross as an aural aphrodisiac , it ’s actually a bit of a surprise that what this all really came down to was a July 7 interview with comedian Louis C.K. , who enhanced serious - minded public discourse on sexual issues by talking about why he always does it with his shirt on .
Courtesy of Rachel Maddow ’s blog ( via Gawker ) , here ’s a partial transcript of the offending exchange that set this whole thing in motion :
Louis CK : But if I 'm with a woman and she wants to be with me , she must like me .
I definitely have sex with my T - shirt on , always .
I have n't had sex without a shirt on , God , since I was about 23 . "
Terry Gross :
Is that true ?
Louis CK : Yeah , I just do n't think that 's fair .
I mean , you know , let her think she 's with somebody decent , you know ? …
I do have sex sometimes on the show , and there 's a rule that I have to be on my back .
Terry Gross :
Why , because your stomach flattens ?
Louis C.K. : Well , no , God , no .
I 'm not laying back in that bed thinking , " I look awesome right now . "
It 's because I think I should always be the victim of the sex .
I do n't think anyone wants to see me looming over her .
I think that 's an upsetting image .
And then also , the mother - dog stomach that I get when I'm … you get the point .

Apparently MPB is located on the same campus as offices for the state ’s universities , and many of those use public radio broadcasts as their hold music .
When an innocent caller was placed on hold and found themselves subjected to mental images of Louis C.K. getting it on , they called to complain , thus triggering the station ’s zero - tolerance policy for inappropriate content — and thus , no more Fresh Air for Mississippi .
To be clear , producers of the show claim they were never told what specific " inappropriate content " led to the removal , but Maddow seems fairly convinced .
As is Louis C.K. , apparently : Late last night , he issued a video response to the matter , although it ’s since been taken down .
Anybody catch it ?
Did he use it to meaningfully enhance serious - minded public discourse on sexual issues , or was it just more filthy filth ?

The balanced formula above shows what happens if methane encounters oxygen .
It is not a spontaneous reaction , boys would n’t need to light farts if it was , but is helped along either by fire , catalysts or by methanotrophic microorganisms which metabolize methane into CO2 and water .
Methane is found in the permafrost environment e.g. in Siberia and , as global climate change warms up those areas , poses a great risk , because it ’s 25 - 30 times more effective a greenhouse gas as CO2 .
Here those microorganisms live on top of the permafrost ice and are really beneficial .
The permafrost in the Lena Delta begins only a few centimetres below the surface and extends down to a depth of 600 metres .
The ice in the polygon pools starts 50 centimetres below the water surface .
Methanogenic micro-organisms live directly on top of the ice and convert organic carbon into methane – almost one third of the organic carbon stored throughout the world is locked up in Arctic permafrost soils .
However , methane gas has an extremely large influence on the climate : the greenhouse effect of one molecule of methane is 25 to 30 times greater than that of one molecule of carbon dioxide .

Methane can be found in arctic mud volcanoes like the Haakon Mosby mud volcano , too .
And here , as well , the said methanotrophs exist .
At the rim of the volcano .
In the central region , scientists discovered a new bacterium species that use oxygen to feed on methane .
In sediments of the sulphur bacteria region , the team found a new group of methanotrophic Archaea ( archaic bacteria ) that form a symbiosis with bacteria and use sulphate to oxidize methane , a process called the anaerobic oxidation of methane ( AOM ) .

Unfortunately Methane is one of the major components of the BP oil spill , too .
A methane explosion is said to be the cause for it .
The deadly blast on board the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico was triggered by a bubble of methane gas , an investigation by BP has revealed .
A report into last month ’s blast said the gas escaped from the oil well and shot up the drill column , expanding quickly as it burst through several seals and barriers before exploding .

Biologists now found new dead zones in the Gulf ( additionally to the existing ones ) caused by the above mentioned effect .
This discovery offers a good explanation why unusually many fish and sharks are being seen in the shallow waters off the Gulf of Mexico ’s coast .
The migration of the fish is obviously only the part that we can really see , what we wo n’t see ist the extinction of all living things in those oxygen depleted zones that are not able to just swim away .
Add the methanotrophs to the oil eating bacteria , that will eventually clean up the ( then probably dead )
Gulf who also need oxygen for their metabolism and we are looking at another facet of the destruction , which may yet reach extinction level after all .

In high summer , deep in the Swedish countryside , you could easily believe Rebel Without a Cause or The Wild One are being remade .
The quiffs , classic cars and 1950s clothes are n't for show , however .
These people are n't costumed extras , they are raggare , members of the largest pop-culture tribe in Sweden , and one of the most influential in Scandinavia .
Rock 'n 'roll never died for the raggare : they are still devoted to the music , the fashion , the aesthetics .
For 50 years they have kept its spirit alive , but where rock 'n' rollers in other countries have dwindled into small groups , in Sweden they have gone from strength to strength – there are now estimated to be half a million of them .
The first raggare would travel in convoy from one hick town to the next to beat lumps out of each other and ogle the women .
There are still organised raggare brawls , but the movement is part of the mainstream now , its most visible manifestation the cheap 50s and 60s US cars the raggare still drive and the vintage clothes they wear .
You can have three generations of raggare within the same family , and there was no more eloquent statement of raggare respectability than the 12 kronor commemorative raggare stamp issued by the Swedish post office a few years back .
Arboga is a town of 10,000 people , 80 miles or so west of Stockholm .
It 's a dullish place , with late - night entertainment limited to a few service stations dishing out food .
There 's nothing to do here , which means it 's a perfect place for raggare culture to thrive .
The Burning Wheels are the smallest of three chapters of raggare from Arboga .
They meet every Sunday at Georg 's Garage to rev their engines , play rock 'n 'roll records and talk about the 1950s , while their children run around getting ice cream handprints all over the car seats .
It was n't always like this , according to Georg .
" We used to meet up on Sundays to have fights .
We were honest fighters .
No weapons , no martial arts , no kicking – and if you fell on the ground it was all over and you 'd buy the guy a drink . "
The raggare did n't confine the fighting to themselves .
They singled out punks and hippies for beatings , and did it so often that the Rude Kids , a Swedish punk band , released a single called Raggare Is a Bunch of Motherfuckers .
" Those were the drinking days , " Georg says .
" The crazy drinking days . "
If you drink too much nowadays , you 'll be kicked out of the Burning Wheels , they say .
The raggare have always tended to be drawn from country folk : farmers , petrol station owners , low - skilled workers .
The growth in their numbers is the result of the differing fortunes of the US and Swedish economies over the decades : successive oil crises and a poor exchange rate saw Americans trading in gas - guzzlers for more economical models ; the Swedes , relatively rich in comparison , bought their cars for a song .
For young Swedes , these giant American cars , which contrasted with the safe , boxy Volvos their parents drove , were the ultimate symbols of rebellion .
And they were dirt - cheap .
" They were stupid , " Georg says about the Americans .
" Some of the cars were limited edition .
They built maybe 70 of them and they were selling them to us for a few thousand when they were collector pieces . "
Georg picked up his first US muscle car , a black 1965 Pontiac , for $ 2,000 in Los Angeles in 1980 .
He found it in a lot , rusted and part - inhabited by a eucalyptus tree .
By the time he'd shipped it home , sourced original parts , resprayed and kitted out the whole body , it was worth 20 times as much , with an engine that purred and a stereo that roared .
The latter is the only concession to modernity acceptable in a raggare 's restored car ; music is a huge part of the culture .
" You do n't exactly want to have hip - hop playing from your car when you 're cruising , " says Martin , a farmer who drives a lime green Chevy .
He listens mostly to Creedence Clearwater Revival .
" That music came from a period when America was really great .
You can hear it in the lyrics . "
Martin's top - of - the - range sound system is hidden inside the glove compartment .
Every weekend , in car parks and petrol station forecourts up and down Sweden , the rest of Scandinavia , and even in some parts of western Russia , raggare gangs play out their classic rock 'n ' roll albums until their car batteries pack in .
When the raggare have parties , they tend to have them in their garages : comfortable enough spaces , filled with pots of grease , car jacks and stacks of fenders .
The more capable raggare jitterbug and twist ; others shuffle from foot to foot , stopping occasionally to pull out the kink in a poodle skirt or run a comb through a greasy quiff .
Maud is the longest - standing female member of the Burning Wheels .
She 's short of cash at the moment , and has to cruise around in a 20 - year - old Volvo – and Volvos are to raggare what dirty overalls are to mods .
" I fell in love with the scene thanks to my grandparents , " she says .
" The music they listened to and the cars they drove are so attractive . "
Maud is also involved with a girls - only raggare group who visit schools as part of a raggare awareness group , teaching pupils about the raggare lifestyle and the notion of respect .
When the first raggare appeared , they caused moral panic across Sweden , where they were seen as an oversexed bunch of hard partiers .
As the original raggare have grown older , they 've been trying to heal their reputation .
" It 's important to be a gentleman , " says Georg .
" If you want to join the Burning Wheels , you have a one - year probation period .
It 's not easy to join .
You have kids driving round in their parents '
Volvos calling themselves raggare when they 're not . "
That free use of the word has caused problems .
Raggare get blamed when far - right gangs attack Gypsy camps and smuggle drugs .
To outsiders , gangs in cars out drinking are all raggare .
Not to the Burning Wheels .
" We 're like craftsmen .
The lifestyle is an art , " says Martin .
" It 's not just drinking and driving fast .
There 's responsibility with what we do . "
It 's funny how often the words respect and responsibility are used by a group who take their cues from music and films whose very purpose was to express rebellion .
That 's partly the result of the Swedish government realising there was more to be gained from embracing the raggare than alienating them .
In the 60s , the government made the decision to consult the raggare about decisions that might affect them – so now they pay no car or import tax on their vehicles , and Sweden has the largest collection of classic cars outside the US .
Another 6,000 were imported last year alone .
When winter comes around , the majority of raggare go into hibernation .
They tuck their Buicks under blankets , slip off their blue suede shoes and pull on their snowboots .
And the next time they pull out of their driveway with Chuck Berry on the stereo , it 'll probably be in a nice warm Volvo .
A veteran British journalist and author promoting his book on the death penalty in Singapore was arrested in the country today for alleged criminal defamation and other offences .
Alan Shadrake 's arrest came two days after Singapore 's Media Development Authority lodged a police report .
The Foreign Office in London said it was seeking more information from local authorities .
The 75 - year - old 's latest book , Once A Jolly Hangman : Singapore Justice In The Dock , contains accounts of high - profile cases in Singapore involving the use of the death penalty , and includes interviews with a former executioner , Darshan Singh .
Published by a Malaysian company , the book was first released in Malaysia .
Death penalty opponents who helped to organise the Singapore launch were told by police that no bail had yet been set for Shadrake , whose passport has been impounded .
Last week one of Singapore 's biggest book retailers , Kinokuniya , withdrew the book from its shelves after it was contacted by the Media Development Authority , which controls censorship in Singapore , according to the Asian Correspondent website .
In publicity material for the book , Margaret John , from Amnesty International Canada , described it as " a timely contribution to growing criticism of Singapore 's shameful use of the death penalty " .
Shadrake attracted the attention of authorities in Singapore in 2005 when he revealed the identity of Singh shortly before he executed an Australian drug trafficker , Nguyen Van Tuong .
The case , a cause célèbre in Australia , led to friction between the Australian and Singaporean governments .
Singapore has a reputation for taking tough legal action against what it sees as unfair criticism .
In March last year a judge found a Wall Street Journal senior editor , Melanie Kirkpatrick , in contempt of court for allegedly impugning the independence of Singapore 's judiciary .
In October the Far Eastern Economic Review and its editor - in - chief , Hugo Restall , lost an appeal in a defamation lawsuit brought by Singapore 's founding leader , Lee Kuan Yew , and his son , the current prime minister , Hsien Loong Lee , over a 2006 article that they said implicitly suggested they may have abused the public 's trust .
" In the interests of security , public order , morality , national harmony , or friendly foreign relations , Singapore law authorises censorship of content and distribution of print material and films , severe limits on public processions and assemblies , and prolonged detention of suspects without trial , " was Human Rights Watch 's verdict on the city state .
According to a recent poll , legalizing same sex marriage is gaining support in India one year after the Delhi High Court decriminalized homosexuality .
Before July 2009 homosexuality was illegal in India .
That was overturned by the high court last year , which stated “ the fundamental right to life and liberty and the right to equality as guaranteed by the Constitution of India . ”
Since then the country has seen an increase in health and social services for the LGBT community .
Supporters say there has been a decrease in harassment , along with an opening of gay and lesbian establishments including pride parades in major cities .
SMS GupShup , known as the largest mobile social network in India conducted a Voice of India poll in June asking users , “ Do you think same sex marriage should be legalized in India ? ”
Of the nearly 8,000 respondents , 31 percent said they support legalizing same sex marriage and 69 percent said they oppose it .
Conductors of the poll say the results highlight a major shift toward gay rights and same sex marriage .
Rachael Himsel with VSC Consulting and spokesperson for the poll said , “ In India sexuality in general has always been a taboo topic in a very religious country . ”
She added , “ But that has changed a lot and now there is an overall willingness to speak openly about sexuality in India . ”
When the courts decriminalized homosexuality it was a huge “ about face , ” she said .
She said the poll shows that “ the people have a more liberal view about the issue than perhaps the government . ”
Most of the respondents are from urban areas including : 35 percent from Bangalore , 29 percent from Mumbai , 16 percent from Kolkata , 15 percent from Delhi and 3 percent from Chennai .
Supporters of gay rights in India say same sex relationships have been seen more in the arts and entertainment industry .
Vishal Nongbet , SMS GupShup senior director and head of marketing said Bollywood and American pop culture has had an impact in acceptance of the gay and lesbian community .
“ We are seeing a growing number of films , TV shows , and music coming from India , the U.S. , and around the world that show same sex couples , ” said Nongbet in a statement .
“ As more Indians are exposed to information and entertainment which show these relationships , one can see how acceptance grows . ”
Himsel notes the arts truly have an impact .
“ I believe that when we see more and more LGBT relationships on television for example it puts a human face to the issue that people can relate to , ” she said .
“ And more Indian celebrities are embracing the equal rights of the LGBT community . ”
According to U.S. polls taken in 2009 an average of 44 percent of Americans support same sex marriage making the margin between Indian and U.S. support somewhat minimal at only a 13 percent difference .
SMS GupShup is the world ’s largest mobile social network and is similar to Twitter allowing users to communicate via text messaging to connect with family , friends and fans .
It was launched in 2007 and has generated 26 million users in over 2 million communities and reaches 4 billion users worldwide .

Well , what about that , then ?
The Pandorica Opens exploded onto TV and computer screens the world over in dazzling and impressive fashion , seemingly including visual references to every monster in the entire history of Doctor Who , presenting us a trio of equally impossible cliffhangers , and throwing in at least three kitchen sinks into the bargain .
And yet , it still made for staggeringly compelling viewing , and only whets our appetite for The Big Bang , the final episode of Matt Smith ’s and Steven Moffat ’s sterling first series of Doctor Who .
The only question now …how can The Big Bang possibly top this ?

The Fourth of July is not only America ’s birthday , but also the anniversary of one of the boldest experiments in American letters .
On July 4 , 1845 , Henry David Thoreau moved into a small cabin near Walden Pond in Massachusetts and began writing “ Walden , ” the autobiographical book that would define his legacy .
Thoreau was many things – naturalist , political dissident , professional crank – but he was also one of our earliest and most memorable media critics .
His reservations about the limits of journalism resonate with particular urgency today , as a massive oil spill near my home state of Louisiana underscores what Thoreau found lacking in media culture .
“ I am sure that I never read any memorable news in a newspaper , ” Thoreau told readers of “ Walden . ”
“ If we read of one man robbed , or murdered , or killed by accident , or one house burned , or one vessel wrecked , or one steamboat blown up , or one cow run over on the Western Railroad , or one mad dog killed ... we never need read of another ....
“ To a philosopher , ” said Thoreau , “ all news , as it is called , is gossip , and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea . ”
Thoreau had other ideas about what was newsworthy , as I ’ve been reminded recently while perusing editor Damion Searls ’s masterly abridged new version of Thoreau ’s journals .
The journals are a sustained record of the natural world – the slant of light in a summer sky , the flow of sap from New England maples , the arrival of spring birds “ more sure than the arrival of the sailing and steaming packets . ”
In Thoreau ’s time , as in ours , nature did n’t usually did n’t make news unless it was touched by obvious trouble .
If war , as one wit famously observed , is “ God ’s way of teaching Americans geography , ” then environmental disasters such as the BP oil spill seem to be the primary way that Americans learn about ecology .
In “ Walden ” and his other writings , Thoreau argued for a less fragmentary understanding of land and water , one based on a daily intimacy with the realities of how man and nature interact .
It ’s a grasp of the natural world that the news cycle , with its emphasis on crisis and conflict , seems ill - suited to sustain .
Thoreau said that his decision to move to the woods of Walden on Independence Day was merely an accident of the calendar .
Coincidental or not ,
Thoreau ’s timing reminds us that his sense of America ’s possibility was inextricably linked with the wonder of its landscape .
That connection is worth remembering on this Independence Day , as an ongoing oil spill places our natural bounty at risk .

I ’m not a spiritual person .
I ’ve studied and practiced Buddhism for ten years .
If those two statements seem antithetical to you then please allow me to explain how they are not .
I believe a lot of people involved with technology misunderstand Buddhism and I hope to clarify a few points for them here .
If you are not familiar with Buddhism , you may be surprised to learn that Buddhists have no God and do not believe in the idea of a soul , let alone an eternal one .
Heck , we do n’t even believe in the idea of a self !
How can this be ?
What about reincarnation ?
What about karma ?
What about all those Tibetan deity paintings ?
All good questions but the facts remain : in Buddhism there is no God , no soul and no self .
In other words , there is nothing spiritual about Buddhism .
Buddhism is concerned only with the here and now .
I am inclined to scientific rationalism .
It ’s no surprise therefore that I ended up working in the technology field .
I am interested in any kind of system , both in terms of design and operation , but I am especially interested in the ones that make humans tick .
The latter go by names like sociology , psycholog y , philosophy and pretty well everything on the humanities side of the curriculum along with economics , religion , politics and warfare .
I have spent time with each of these but my nature , like that of many people , is to ask the ultimate questions about life .
A systems thinker seeks a system as an answer and thus Buddhism entered my life .
I have always been an atheist but one with a true love for the natural world .
My idea of God is the DNA molecule : omnipresent , eternal and vastly powerful .
We know all life is connected on the physical plane by DNA and I believe that includes ways we currently only dimly perceive but do not yet understand and call by names like mythology and archetype .
DNA even seems to be inherent in what we consider non-living matter .
Given the right conditions , the chemical precursors of life arise from once molten rock .
“ In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it wast thou taken : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return . ”
The Book Of Genesis 3:19
In my first religion , Science , indeed all is one and the One is all .
Still , this personal sense of the nature of things did not satisfy .
Something was missing .
In the deepest existential sense , I was not happy .
No matter the ups or downs of my life , behind everything was a sense of a missing piece of the puzzle .
I sought a solution in many teachings , however things really only began to change after I opened a book in a bookstore and read this :
“ I believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness .
That is clear .
Whether one believes in religion or not , whether on believes in this religion or that religion , we are all seeking something better in life .
So , I think , the very motion of our life is towards happiness … ”
The book was The Art Of Happiness : A Handbook For Living by His Holiness The Dalai Lama and Howard C. Cutler .
M.D .
No one had ever told me before that the purpose of life was happiness .
It got my attention .
I read on .
Ten years later , I am still enthralled with this marvelous system by which one finds happiness .
Webster ’s defines technology as : the practical application of knowledge especially in a particular area ; a capability given by the practical application of knowledge ; a manner of accomplishing a task especially using technical processes , methods , or knowledge
Based on the above definitions , Buddhism qualifies as a technology for finding happiness .
According to Buddhism , happiness is the absence of suffering .
Suffering is caused by wanting things to be other than they are .
It is resistance to reality that is the cause of suffering .
The way to the end of suffering is to accept that , in each moment , things are the way they are , whether you like it or agree with it or not .
The way to learn to do that is to follow Buddha ’s Eight Fold Path .
The path not only provides the technology to accomplish the goal but its teachings instruct all those who study it to believe nothing based on external authority but only what their own senses and experiences validate .
The Eight Fold Path explains not only how to practice but why the practice of compassion , loving kindness , sympathetic joy and equanimity lead to happiness .
It explains how and why one should practice morality , renunciation , mindfulness and harmlessness and how and why one should practice both concentration and insight meditation along with Right Speech , Right Action and Right Livelihood .
Not because these things will make you happy but because these things eventually eliminate everything that is preventing you from being happy .
Here and now .
In this life .
And it does so in considerable technical detail .
Buddhism is not a religion for the spiritually inclined .
Buddhism is not a philosophy for intellectuals .
Buddhism is a technology by which atheists can find true happiness .
It is the solution to the riddle that has plagued those of us so inclined down through the centuries — the riddle of finding a way to maintain our integrity in our sense of what is right ( right in the sense that a square is made of ninety degree angles ) and yet to find happiness in the bargain .

Denver police are cracking down on drivers who make illegal lane changes and cut in line on the interstate .
Police kicked off stepped - up enforcement Tuesday morning , giving 56 tickets on Interstate 225 at the DTC Boulevard exit , most of them to drivers making illegal lane changes that cut off backed - up traffic .
Some tickets were also given to drivers passing on the right shoulder .
“ I know you ’re not supposed to cross the solid white line , but everyone does it , ” said Michelle Martinez , who was pulled over .
Cutting in line ahead of cars waiting in a traffic jam can be illegal and frustrating to motorists who obey the law , officers said .
It can also be dangerous and lead to road rage , police warned .
One indication of how bad the problem is : More than 160 accidents have been reported at the I - 225 / DTC exit in the past three years , said Denver police Sgt. Kevin Edling .
“ When it ’s backed up , ( people ) do n’t want to wait , so they get in the right ( exit ) lane and go up about a mile and pass everyone and then cut over before the exit , ” Edling said .
When drivers do that , traffic has to slow down to let vehicles over , and , especially during times of high - volume traffic , it presents a safety hazard .
“ By them stopping ( in the exit lane ) to get over , it stops everybody else too , ” said Denver police Officer Dennis Thompson .
A Denver police study found Tuesday to be the worst day for traffic during the morning commute , with the heaviest volume from 7:15 to 10 a.m .
“ So have your coffee early and give yourself that extra couple of minutes , ” Edling said in a roadside news conference as he cautioned drivers to be “ calm , cool and collected . ”
Next week , officers are going to be focusing on westbound I - 70 and southbound I - 25 at the Mousetrap .
Those caught will face a $ 100 ticket and 3 points assessed to their driving record .
Philip Duran said he did not know crossing the solid white line or passing on the shoulder was illegal .
“ I was just trying to get around the guy who was trying to get over to the other lane , ” Duran said .
“ He was going too slow . ”
Martinez said she learned her lesson , but for some other drivers , it ’s all about not getting caught .
Duran said he would “ probably do it again . ”

Thriller set in the underworld of London 's Russian mafia .
When Anna , a midwife , sets out to discover the truth behind the death of a young prostitute , she finds herself snared in the deadly world of sex trafficking .
In November voters will face a choice .
It is not a Republican vs Democratic choice or even a liberal vs conservative choice .
Nope .
It is a bit more primal than that .
In November we face a choice between the Confederate Party and modernity .
All around the globe we face a battle with reactionary forces that seek to pull society back to some imagined fantasy time that they define as “ better ” .
Most of the time these Dark Ages Disciples wrap their lunacy in some cultish religious rhetoric that Jesus , Allah , Yahweh , Zoroaster , Indra or whoever blesses and mandates their insanity .
But religious ideology is not the only meme these wackos embrace .
Nationalism and political myths also motivate .
And often the Nationalist myths are woven tightly with the religious myth into one big twisted blob of hate and madness .
This fantasy world view animates and drive al - Qaeda and here in America it animates the Confederate Party .
The Confederate Party grew out of the Confederacy and their defeat in the Civil War .
It is easier to split an atom with a butter knife than it is to separate the Confederacy from racism .
Reconstruction almost killed the Confederacy , but it found a host in the Democratic Party .
For decades , it was the Democrats–especially those from the South–who kept the goals of the Confederacy alive .
Over time the Confederacy lost their grip on the Democratic Party and when LBJ passed Civil Rights and Voting Rights Legislation , the spirit of the Confederacy went looking for a new political host .
For a time this racist ideology found a home with the third party efforts of George Wallace , but it was Richard Nixon who thought he could invite this ideology of hate into the Republican Party and control it .
He was wrong .
Now the Confederacy controls Nixon ’s Party so completely that they would kick Dick out for being a squish .
Reagan would get the boot as well .
Today the Confederacy Party wears different Party labels like finely embroidered sheets that glide in the moonlight .
The Republican Party is a brand they control , but in the wake of George W. Bush it was a damaged brand .
So the Confederate Party did some marketing and came up with yet another name and yet another mask : The Tea Party .
Racism and xenophobia are the core organizing tools , along with old chestnuts like ‘ states rights ’ and fear of ‘ big government ’ .
Appeals to selfishness are also key , but it is quiet racism and fear that holds the blob of hate together .
Without racism and fear they have nothing .
That is why the a simple call from the NAACP to condemn racist behavior sent the movement into fits of hysterics .
And it is why their almost universal response was to attack the NAACP for pointing out the movement ’s tolerance for racism .
And that is why the Confederate Party and their leaders responded with fresh examples of racism .
Some were skilled in their response like TeaBagger / Republican movement leader Sarah Palin who used racist dogwhistles to mock the NAACP , others like Tea Party Express leader Mark Williams decided it was just fine to go all in .
He published a imagined letter from the NAACP to President Lincoln that was take - your - breath - away blatantly racist .
As the heat began to build Williams responded by calling the NAACP a racist organization and then he took down his letter and pretended like it was all good .
It is not .
Mark Williams is a racist and he is a leader of the Tea Party movement .
If that movement continues to tolerate him , then it is more than fair to call the Tea Party movement what it is : an organization that embraces racism to achieve their political goals .
This is not really a surprise as the Tea Party is just another iteration of the Confederate Party .
Color of Change is an organization that is working to increase the voice of African Americans in American Politics .
They are a relatively new group on the scene , but like the 101 year - old NAACP they know racism when they see it .
And the blatant racism of Mark Williams has made them shrill .
They are asking folks to sign a petition demanding that the Tea Party movement cut all ties with Williams .
Here is the text :
Dear Tea Party leaders ,
This week , the NAACP called on the Tea Party movement to reject the racist elements that exist among its ranks .
Sadly , instead of taking any responsibility for putting a stop to the bigoted , hateful rhetoric and imagery that has repeatedly surfaced in the Tea Party movement , one of your movement ’s most prominent leaders responded by attacking the NAACP with a barrage of offensive racial stereotypes .
This week , Mark Williams , the public face of Tea Party Express , called the NAACP a racist organization and said “ They make more money off of race than any slave trader , ever . ”
He went on to publish a blog post which implied that Black people do n’t like to work or think for themselves , that they depend on welfare , and that they want to benefit from White peoples ’ tax dollars so they can have a widescreen TV in every room .
If as Tea Party leaders you wish to have any credibility when you claim that racism is not a welcome , integral part of your movement , you must act decisively to reject people like Mark Williams .
I ’m calling on you to denounce Williams ’ bigoted rhetoric about the NAACP , and to demand he resign from his position at Tea Party Express and stop representing himself as a spokesman for the Tea Party movement .
Like the NAACP the young folks at Color of Change are also shrill .
I feel like being shrill with them so I ’ve signed their petition .
You can too if you wish .
Mark Williams is a slicker racist than David Duke–who was pretty slick .
The only difference between the two is that Duke has always been honest about his views while Willaims is not .
And because of all of that Mark Williams is on a fast track to a sweet gig as a paid teevee commentator on FOX , CNN and MSNBC .
Hell , CNN may already be in negotiations with him for their troubled 8 pm slot .
And I know asking the TeaBaggers to kick him out is like asking processed rice to kick out white .
Still , it is worth the effort .
When the Tea Party , the Republican Party and the conservative movement continues to embrace Williams then we will all know that it is the Confederate Party that call the shots in these groups and the face of hate behind the mask will get a small flash of sunlight .
That will be a good thing and it will help to make the stakes at the ballot box clear .
We have a choice in November between moving forward or moving back to 1852 .
And while that is not as far back as the Middle Ages it was and is a Dark Age as far as justice in America is concerned .
I think the lesson of the NAACP action is that more of us need to be shrill .
Cheers

CD and DVD writers usually include the serial number of the DVD or CD writer onto the CD / DVDs they write .
Theoretically , if intercepted , the entire supply chain could be tracked down to trace the purchase of the CD / DVD writer to you .
If you think there are financial records traceable to you , and your adversary has the will / capacity to be this thorough , avoid this method if interception is a high likelihood .
Such interception and tracing is very expensive , so keep that in mind when weighing your chances .
R yan Stone has much the same reputation with the fans as Curtis Glencross did .
To the fans of advanced stats , he 's one of the few Oilers that had the puck moving in the right direction last season , albeit in a limited amount of time .
For the fans of the traditional view of the game , he was full of piss and vinegar , second on the team in hits per game , and always - willing to stick up for his teammates .
For fans concerned about the salary cap , Stone should have a very reasonable cap hit , and reasonable contracts are something the cap - strapped Oilers lack .
There 's another team just down the highway that is also lacking reasonable contracts and the last time this happened , they swooped in to pull a Group 6 UFA out from under the Oilers ' noses , and this time the player is Calgary - born and raised .
How Steve Tambellini and his newly - found clarity handle this situation may give us hints as to how the rest of the off - season will go , and if Stone ends up a wing on the third line for the Flames , the teeth - gnashing will begin anew .
Derek Zona also had this to say about Stone in a late - season update on the forward 's condition :
Stone was n't a world - beater this season , with only six assists in 27 games , no one was mistaking him for Ales Hemsky .
But Stone brought an element to his game that the Oilers lacked - physical play with on - ice awareness .
Even though he only appeared in 27 games , Stone is still 9th on the Oilers in hits with 54 .
He does n't possess great foot speed , but he 's smart enough to read the play and understands where he should be on the ice in order to avoid getting beaten because of speed .
Stone played and average of ten minutes at ES per game in the Oilers ' bottom six and appeared to have secured a position on Edmonton 's third line prior to suffering his second knee ailment in January , a role he could possibly slide into in Calgary with the losses of Nigel Dawes , Eric Nystrom , and Jamal Mayers .
A bottom - six forward capable of outplaying the opposition for cheap is always valuable , and , although Stone played on the wing in Edmonton , I like the possibility of him centering a potential line of Ivanans and Jackman much better than I like the possibility of Backlund being dragged down by those two .
Kent has Stone pegged as AHL - bound barring injury , especially with the likes of Craig Conroy and Brett Sutter still reportedly in the mix , but at $ 500 K he 's a good bet to provide value for his contract if / when he's healthy , and is nonetheless a good buy for the cash - strapped Flames .
Rates of new genital wart infection in Australia have plummeted , research shows , in an early positive sign of the success of mass Gardasil vaccinations .
A study taking in patient data from sexual health clinics across the country has shown up to a 60 per cent drop off in new genital wart cases since 2007 , when the anti-cancer vaccine was rolled out .
Public health measure a winner ... Sophie Weisz , 14 , receives a Gardasil injection .
Gardasil works by preventing the transmission of four strains of the Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , two of which cause cervical cancer and two which cause genital warts .
Experts say while its effect on cervical cancer rates would take longer to materialise , the vaccine 's ability to prevent a less serious though embarrassing problem was now clear .

Oh , that was classy from a member of the core team .

I do n’t think I have one here .
What I

of silence .
Is that unreasonable ?
Your annoyance is understandable but , alone , it

I ’m not so much impatient waiting for a release .
Rather , I just think
better communication would be helpful .
I ’m already sold on Rails – I
really , really love it .
However , if I were sitting on the fence right
now – say , switching from PHP or Java , and evaluating Ruby , Rails ,
Sinatra , Python , Django , $ RAILS_COMPETITOR … – I ’d think twice about
adopting a technology that has this sort of support from its core team .
In other words , I do n’t fundamentally care that much whether Rails 3 is
released in August or December .
I just think that whatever is decided ,
it should be better communicated .
We , too , are pretty annoyed that the release candidate has dragged on ,
but we want a candidate we ’d feel comfortable deploying to production
with our own apps .
I appreciate that .
Again , the time is not the problem .
The lack of
communication is .
Thankfully , we ’ve had tons of people testing the
betas and bringing the polish up to release quality .
That means a
short RC cycle .
Check out http://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.0.0.beta4...master

This release is
going to rock .

Biden : Americans ‘ do n’t know ’ about White House ’s accomplishments
Seeming to echo a line of criticism usually voiced by Republicans , Vice President Joe Biden said Friday that most Americans and even many experts “ do n’t even know ” what ’s inside the White House ’s signature legislative accomplishments .
Biden said that lack of understanding was “ because of all the advertising done ” by opponents of those bills .
Asked by ABC's “ This Week ” host Jake Tapper in an interview aired Sunday if the administration “ is getting enough credit ” for the Wall St. bill , the health care bill , and the economic Recovery
Act in light of polls showing the majority of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track , Biden said : “ The vast majority of the American people and a lot of people really involved do n't even know what 's inside the packages . ”
“ People do n't know a lot of what 's going on in The Recovery Act , ” Biden said , ” understandably , because this has been so much stuff that has been flowing our way . ”
Despite those polls , Biden said , the country is moving in the right direction , saying of Americans who disagree “ nor could they or should they ” understand that , given the 6.7 million jobs lost in the last six months of the Bush administration and the first six months of the Obama administration .
Pointing to jobs growth in recent months , he added that when the “ country is in trouble , all [ people ] want to know is … that we 're moving in the right direction . ”
“ But they do n't think that we are , “ Tapper replied .
“ No .
No , they do n't think now because I do n't think they know the detail of what 's going on , ” said Biden , who said “ the health care numbers are going up ” now “ because they 're figuring out that small businesses are going to get a 30 percent tax cut .
They did n't know that because of all the advertising done . “
Detailing what he called “ the summer of recovery , ” Biden said , “ We have two , three times as many highway projects going .
We have significant investment in broadband for the first time now .
It 's starting to really ramp up [ with contracts ] in high speed rail , in wind energy .
“ This is a hard slog , man , ” Biden said .
“ And it 's counter - intuitive .
It 's counter - intuitive to say someone sitting at a kitchen table in Claymont , Del. , who lost their jobs -- by the way , we saved or created three million jobs and they pick up when we lost three million . ”
McDonald 's launches TV ad campaign targeting gay men
McDonald 's is launching its first television advertising campaign targeting gay men .
The fast food giant 's commercial - with the slogan ' Come as you are ' - is to be aired on television in France .
It features a teenager sitting in a McDonald 's restaurant gazing at a photo of his gay lover in a class photo , then phoning to say he ' misses him ' .
[ caption ]
The youth 's father then returns to the table with a tray of burgers , and says : ' It 's a shame you 're in an all boys college .
You would have had all the girls chasing you . '
The gay son then gives a knowing smile as they tuck in to their fast food .
McDonald 's said the ad was intended to show that it welcomed people from all walks of life .
A YouTube version of the advert with subtitles has so far been viewed more than 220,000 times in countries including Britain and the U.S. , where it has not been screened .
[ caption ]
One internet user in Los Angeles wrote : ' They could never show that in the States , or the Christian right would boycott the restaurant forever . '
Another in Memphis , Tennessee , added : ' I do n't understand - McDonald 's is simply saying that they will still serve you if you are gay .
' Thank you McDonald 's , for not shunning people based on their sexuality . '

26 % of Americans do n’t know who America fought in the Revolutionary War
While perusing the blogs the other night , I came across a post at A View from the Right about how 26 % of Americans surveyed could not correctly give the answer to the question of which country America gained her independence from in the Revolutionary War .
This means that one out of ever four people polled could not correctly answer the question , and this got me thinking .
Since I began blogging I have become a student of history ; I am not stating that I know everything that I should know yet , but I have been working hard to learn as much as possible about the founding of this country , and United States history in general .
While doing this reading I have come to the conclusion that people need to learn how this country was founded in order to understand where it is headed ; if you learn the past you can almost see the future .
By that I mean that if a person does n’t understand the ideas that this country was founded upon , and the vision of what the founders thought this country should be , that person cannot fully understand how far we have drifted away from the ideas and the form of government that the founders bestowed upon us .
When I read about the philosophies of the founders and I see where America is today , I understand how far we have strayed from the constitution .
More people need to understand what is going on , and the best way for them to do this is to read history ; history is so interesting if only people would apply themselves – there is so much to learn– but people today are more interested in American Idol and other mindless television .
These are nothing but diversions , and while a diversion once in awhile may be healthy , the fact that Americans have become so obsessed with this mindless drivel that more Americans vote for their favorite idol than vote for president shows us exactly how disengaged the American people have become to what is truly the important issues .
This survey tells us that our schools– and parents as well– have been negligent in teaching our children what America is supposed to represent .
Somewhere along the line American history took a back seat to other issues that are of more value to the leftist agenda than is the founding of the country , and I have to believe that this is being done on purpose as America heads to a European socialistic form of government that is at odds with the basic tenets of this country ’s founding .
As I said , if you do n’t know where this country came from , you wo n’t understand where we are headed – or how this direction is at odds with the constitution of the United States .
I have to believe that that is exactly what the far left radical socialists who teach our children want to accomplish .
They want to move our country in an anti-constitutional direction and the best was to accomplish this with little resistance– the best way to ensure that the hijacking of our constitution is met with little or no resistance– is to assure that as generations pass , the newest voters will have no idea what the origins of our government was , and the reservations the founders had about government were .
Through this ignorance , the left will be able to advance an agenda that would make the founders wince in pain , and through this ignorance they are slowly succeeding .
It has taken them many years to reach this point , but they have finally reached the point where a large amount of Americans do not understand what it is that America is supposed to be , if these Americans cannot even name which country we fought during the Revolutionary War , there is no way we can expect them to understand anything about the founding of this country once the war ended .
The fact that one quarter of those polled could not even answer the most basic of American history questions , tells us that the left is succeeding in this goal , and while three out of four people could name the country we fought in the Revolutionary War represents a strong majority , the fact that one quarter of the American people do not know which country America fought in the Revolutionary War means the leftists are making progress at a faster rate than I would have thought possible .
We can only expect this number to grow as the years go on .
This poll is even more disheartening when you realize that this was the most basic question on American history that could have been asked .
If 26 % of those polled did n’t even know America ’s enemy during the Revolutionary War , what would the poll numbers be if you asked these same people questions about the type of government the founders set up , of if you asked them about basic consitutional premises ?
The results would be much worse as the questions delved into American history .
It is unconscionable that our children are not being taught American history , but I have to believe that this is exactly what the leftists want .
James Madison once said , “ knowledge will forever govern ignorance ; and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives . ”
And that is why the left is working so hard to keep the younger generation ignorant .
It is not being done by mistake .
In a message announcing his retirement to the readers of art magazine FMR , the Italian publisher Franco Maria Ricci wrote : " To whoever asks me why , I shall answer in the same way as Voltaire : ' Laissez - moi cultiver mon jardin . ' "
The full import of those words has only now become apparent six years later with the news that the man who published some of the world 's most fantastical works ‑ and luxurious volumes ‑ has created its biggest maze .
His labyrinth of bamboo hedges at Fontanellato near Parma reportedly covers some seven hectares ( 17.5 acres ) , which would make it more than five times larger than the Pineapple Garden Maze on Hawaii , the largest permanent hedge maze in the Guinness Book of Records .
The former publisher said he first confided his ambition to Jorge Luis Borges , who characteristically told him the world 's largest maze already existed and was called a desert .
The publisher of such flights of the imagination as Luigi Serafini's Codex Seraphinianus , an illustrated encyclopaedia dealing with a parallel world and written in an unintelligible alphabet , Ricci said he had based the design for his enormous labyrinth on mazes depicted in two Roman mosaics .
The maze will open to the public in 2012 when a visitors ' centre has been built .
Ricci said visitors would be advised to bring mobiles in case they needed help .
A journalist from Corriere della Sera , which was given a first glimpse of the maze , recorded that he got lost on the return journey .
Never be intimidated by someone else ’s hardware , or opinion , and never think that yours is in anyway inferior .
Slow down , … Continue reading A gentle reminder in this crazy , opinionated world .
At the same time , the new high representative for foreign and security policy , Catherine Ashton , has made barely a ripple .
She has concentrated on replacing her staff and negotiating with the European Parliament and nations over the shape and personnel of the new External Action Service , a European Union diplomatic corps intended to supplement and coordinate , but not replace , national diplomats .
The service , which could end up with about 5,000 diplomats , will incorporate current overseas representatives of the commission , who are maneuvering to keep their posts .
Mr. Barroso , however , has already created waves by appointing his former chief of staff , a fellow Portuguese , João Vale de Almeida , to the new European Embassy in Washington , one of the most prominent posts to be filled in addition to those in Moscow and Beijing , without consulting member states .
Ms. Ashton , too , is trying to manage the French - German gap , looking to the current French ambassador in Washington , Pierre Vimont , as the most likely executive director of the new service , with a German deputy , perhaps Helga - Maria Schmid , who runs the policy unit of the council ’s secretariat .
But while the Europeans are slowly constructing these new institutions and bureaucrats are struggling for dominance within them , the French - German divide remains deep , European and national diplomats say .
Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Merkel know they must cooperate if Europe is to function , and their staffs and ministries work hard to coordinate .
Franco - German agreement is “ necessary but not sufficient , ” as Mr. Barroso said in an interview here .

At each crisis , usually after German hesitation , the two have found a compromise , as they did at the last summit meeting in mid-June .
But both leaders are increasingly unpopular , with Mr. Sarkozy battling ministerial scandals and Mrs. Merkel just managing to force through her choice for the ceremonial German presidency .
Abigail Thernstrom makes a dramatic break from her usual allies .
| Composite image by POLITICO A conservative dismisses right - wing Black Panther ' fantasies '
A scholar whom President George W. Bush appointed as vice chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights , Abigail Thernstrom has a reputation as a tough conservative critic of affirmative action and politically correct positions on race .
But when it comes to the investigation that the Republican - dominated commission is now conducting into the Justice Department ’s handling of an alleged incident of voter intimidation involving the New Black Panther Party — a controversy that has consumed conservative media in recent months —
Thernstrom has made a dramatic break from her usual allies .

“ This does n’t have to do with the Black Panthers ; this has to do with their fantasies about how they could use this issue to topple the [ Obama ] administration , ” said Thernstrom , who said members of the commission voiced their political aims “ in the initial discussions ” of the Panther case last year .
“ My fellow conservatives on the commission had this wild notion they could bring Eric Holder down and really damage the president , ” Thernstrom said in an interview with POLITICO .
The criticism has focused attention not just on Thernstrom , a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute , but on the partisan nature of the Civil Rights Commission and on a story that , like the controversy over the anti-poverty group ACORN , has raged almost completely outside the mainstream media .
The facts of the case are relatively simple .
Two men were captured on a video standing outside a polling place in a black Philadelphia neighborhood on Election Day in 2008 .
One of the men had a nightstick , if an unclear agenda — though a member of the black nationalist New Black Panther Party , he had earlier professed loathing for the Democratic " puppet " candidate , Barack Obama , who went on to overwhelmingly carry that precinct .
Three Republican poll monitors filed complaints of intimidation — itself a federal crime — but no voters attested to being turned away .
The Justice Department , while Bush was still president , investigated the incident and later , after Obama took office , decided that " the facts and the law did not support pursuing " the claims against the party and against a second , unarmed man , Justice spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler said .
But the issue galvanized long - running conservative complaints — including by former Bush administration lawyers — that the government does n’t take black racism seriously , and the incident has become a huge source of controversy among conservatives .
Fox News and other conservative media outlets have turned the Justice Department ’s handling of the case into the subject of the sort of intense , contained interest that ’s becoming increasingly common in an age of polarized and ideological media .
The liberal group Media Matters has counted 95 segments on Fox at least partially devoted to the story , much of it driven by “ America Live ” host Megyn Kelly , who focused on it during 45 segments , including one that discussed whether Fox ’s own coverage had been racist .
Fox News did not return calls asking for comment on its coverage .
But the wide exposure given the controversy , said one member of the Civil Rights Commission , was reason enough for the Justice Department to pursue the case aggressively .
“ Millions of people saw the clip on Fox News and YouTube , ” said Todd Gaziano , a commissioner who has been the driving force behind the commission ’s investigation .
“ Any reasonable American knows this is voter intimidation .
And so the dismissal itself of an infamous case where there ’s footage is more damaging to people ’s perception of the rule of law than a dismissal when nobody ’s paying attention . ”
The commission chairman , Gerald Reynolds , said Thernstrom is attacking the commission out of pique dating back to a dispute about organizing a conference scheduled for this fall .
“ The allegation that there ’s any interest in bringing down the Obama administration is false — and it ’s a lot more ; it ’s personal and petty . ”
Thernstrom , who had openly mocked the commission ’s hearing on the case , put her dissent in writing last week in National Review , where she said the incident was “ racial theater of very minor importance ” and “ small potatoes . ”
And other conservatives have weighed in on her side .
“ There are more important issues to go after Attorney General Holder on even in terms of the voting rights section itself , ” said Linda Chavez , president of the Center for Equal Opportunity , who was staff director of the Civil Rights Commission in the Reagan years and called the video “ damning ” but relatively minor .
“ Because it ’s 24 - hour news and cable news and Fox News — this is the kind of story , like the ACORN story , that ’s got pictures that you can run over and over again , ” said Chavez , who noted that she ’s a Fox News contributor .
“ When it comes to race , the right , like the left , ca n't resist getting hung up with trivia and sideshows , ” said Amy Wax , a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of an influential book arguing that discrimination against blacks is no longer very meaningful .
“ How do the antics of these two Black Panthers make a difference ? ”
A leading writer on the widely read HotAir marveled at Fox ’s eagerness to offer a platform to the New Black Panther Party ’s ranting chairman , Malik Shabazz , crediting it to the fact that the “ outrageous outrage he provokes is good for ratings and partly because , as here , his demagoguery necessarily casts the host in the role of Spokesman for Decency . "
And Doug Mataconis of the conservative blog Outside the Beltway called the flap “ much ado about very , very little . ”
Their doubts — and the on-air qualms of some Fox contributors — have not diminished conservative outrage .
The Panthers “ were there to intimidate blacks .
To keep them voting for Obama and other left - wing liberal Democrats , ” said Roy Innis , chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality .
“ The Obama folks should realize that they are enabling [ the idea ] that rules of civility are different for black people .
It 's a tired idea , and America is less tolerant of it by the year , ” said the Manhattan Institute ’s John McWhorter , who simultaneously dismissed the Panthers as “ a bunch of grown men medicated on photos of Huey Newton playing cops and robbers . ”
A chief casualty of the dispute may be the commission itself , which was established in 1957 and has been long known as a partisan redoubt ; when it was dominated by Democratic appointees , it spent much of the Bush years investigating allegations that he had stolen the 2000 election .
The commissioners serve six - year terms , and though only four can belong to one political party , sympathetic independents can round out sharply partisan majorities .
The president appoints four commissioners , and congressional leaders appoint the other four .
The current controversy , said Chavez , the agency ’s conservative former staff director , is more evidence that “ the commission has outlived its usefulness . ”
But even as the conservative commissioners debate their differences , another clear casualty of the debate has been the vestiges of a national conversation .
Many people who do not watch Fox News or follow conservative media have never heard of the issue .
The disconnect was painfully clear to Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - Calif. ) , who , when asked about the controversy at a recent town hall meeting in his district , admitted to constituents that he ’d never heard of it .
“ What this shows is just how polarized we ’ve become as a country , ” Sherman told POLITICO .
Sherman said he thought the Justice Department had “ mishandled ” the Panther case but blamed what he called the “ manipulative cowards at Fox News ” for blowing it out of proportion .
“ I grew up during the Vietnam War , and you had people on both sides , but they were getting their facts from the same place , ” Sherman said .
“ We have polarized political parties and , for the first time in 100 years , polarized journalism as well . ”

So the 30 - megawatt wind farm , which will have enough power to run about 30 Super Wal - Marts , will have Xtreme Power of Austin , Tex. , install a 15 - megawatt battery .
Computers will work to keep the battery exactly half - charged most hours of the day , said Carlos J. Coe , Xtreme Power ’s chief executive .
If the wind suddenly gets stronger or falls off , the batteries will smooth out the flow so that the grid sees only a more gradual increase or decrease , no more than one megawatt per minute at some hours of the day .
The Hawaii installation is designed to succeed at a crucial but obscure function : frequency regulation .
The alternating - current power system has to run at a strict 60 cycles per second , and the battery system can give and take power on a micro scale , changing directions from charge to discharge or vice versa within that 60th of a second , to keep the pace steady .
The battery system can also be used for arbitrage , storing energy at times when prices are low and delivering it when prices are high .
It can hold 10 megawatt - hours , which is as much energy as a 30 - megawatt wind farm will produce in 20 minutes if it is running at full capacity .
That is not much time , but it is huge in terms of storage capacity .
Neither First Wind nor Xtreme Power would say what the project cost , but publicly disclosed figures put the project in the range of $ 130 million , with about $ 10 million for the battery .
The Energy Department has provided a $ 117 million loan guarantee .
Across the country , it is proving hard to predict the cost and the value of power storage to consumers .
The electricity stored in off - peak hours could be quite low in cost , and prices at peak hours could be quite high .
If the reliance on renewable energy reduces the need to burn coal and natural gas , that would yield an additional advantage .
First Look : Amazing Spider - Man # 638
One Moment in Time
" What really happened at Peter and Mary Jane 's wedding ? "
That question has been on the lips of spider - fans since the One More Day arc concluded over two years ago .
Without getting into too many spoilers , the events of One More Day altered what happened on that day , leading to a single Peter Parker and a missing Mary Jane .
Since then Mary Jane has returned and now Marvel Chief Creative Officer Joe Quesada , who penned One More Day , promises us the answers in One Moment in Time .
Marvel Comics has posted a preview of Amazing Spider - Man # 638 , the first chapter of One Moment in Time written by Joe Quesada with art by Quesada and Paolo Manuel Rivera .
Amazing Spider - Man # 638 swings into comic shops July 21 .

“ It ’s the best skate park in the world , because it was n’t supposed to be a skate park , ” the professional skateboarder Mike Vallely said near the end of a popular YouTube video posted earlier this year to pay homage to the threatened Brooklyn Banks .

It is about to become little more than a construction zone during a four - year renovation of the Brooklyn Bridge .
Any day now , a new fence will slice the Brooklyn Banks roughly in half , giving construction crews a staging area for trucks and equipment until 2014 .
Sometime this summer , the entire area will be closed off for about six months while an overhead ramp is painted , the city said .
Skateboarders are used to being displaced from public spaces .
But the Brooklyn Banks has a decades - long history and a cultivated status as a sort of skating mecca .
Besides , it was already saved once , with help from the city , only five years ago .
That was the last time Steve Rodriguez rode to the rescue .
He has spent the past few months trying to do it again , making headway , thanks to city officials who see value in the Brooklyn Banks for skaters and bikers , but he is running out of time to keep them whole .
“ I ’m fine to close the Banks for six months to paint the overpass , ” Rodriguez said .
“ But four years for staging ?
Come on . ”
BP Oil Spill : Navy Sends MZ - 3A Blimp to Help Survey Gulf of Mexico Airship can hover over spill without using much oil .
July 7 , 2010  --
The government says more than 45,000 people and 6,900 ships or boats are fighting the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
But it 's time for heavier -- or , perhaps , lighter -- artillery .
The Navy has now sent a blimp -- the MZ - 3A Airship -- to patrol the shoreline from above , direct skimmers trying to corral floating oil , and look out for wildlife in harm 's way .
The MZ - 3A , almost identical to blimps used for advertising and bird 's - eye views of sporting events , has been brought in from Yuma , Arizona .
The Navy says the helium - filled ship , 178 feet long and capable of carrying 10 people or equipment , can stay in the air far longer than helicopters or planes , burning just 10 gallons of fuel an hour at its maximum cruising speed of 55 mph .
" The airship will operate relatively close to shore , primarily supporting skimmers to maximize their effectiveness , " said U.S. Coast Guard Capt .
Kevin Sareault in a statement from oil spill response headquarters .
" While different sensors are being considered , one of the primary means for locating oil will be by simple visual observation by the embarked aerial observers .
The mission of overflights is to locate and direct surface assets to actionable oil -- that is oil that can be burned , dispersed or skimmed . "
Lighter - than - air ships were the wave of the future for the Navy -- or at least they were back in the 1930s , when airplanes were primitive and the Nazi Zeppelin Hindenburg disaster had n't scared people away from airships .
By 1962 the Navy had phased out its last lighter - than - air squadron ; helium blimps were safe , but for patrols and reconnaissance , jets and satellites were faster and sleeker .
In 2006 the Navy decided to give airships another try .
It bought one blimp from the American Blimp Corp. , which made them for civilian use .
It flew the ship for a year -- and then mothballed it for lack of money .
This spring it handed it off to a division of the Naval Research Laboratory , which began testing it .
And then came the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
" Airships are great platforms for broad - area persistent surveillance , " said Jim Thiele , president of American Blimp Corp .
" That 's a fancy way of saying you can cover a lot of ground , and do it for a long time .
" For aerial surveillance , they work much better than when you 're zipping through the air , vibrating all the time , " he said .
Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill : Navy Blimp to Patrol Coast
The MZ - 3A should stand out in the steamy skies off the Gulf shore .
Unmarked except for its tail number , it is expected to hover at altitudes of a few thousand feet , looking much like a commercial blimp at the Super Bowl .
Cameras , radar and infrared sensors , says the Coast Guard , will be mounted in its gondola to survey the scene below .
Thiele says the Army , meanwhile , is working on an airship that would be able to do reconnaissance over theaters of war such as Afghanistan .
The remote - controlled ship would be able to carry a ton of equipment at an altitude of 20,000 feet -- and stay there for three weeks .
Blimps do n't do very well , though , in the stormy summer weather along the Gulf Coast .
The joint command for the spill operation said it would be Friday before the MZ - 3A is in place .
Sensing equipment should be installed by next week .
" I just hope the airship is able to help , " Thiele said .

Californians would no longer get plastic bags at supermarket check - out stands , and many children would have to wait longer to enter kindergarten under proposals advanced Wednesday by state lawmakers .
Other bills among the nearly 200 that legislators acted on would put the brakes on future fee increases at state universities and release on medical parole dozens of prison inmates who are physically incapacitated .
Meanwhile , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Wednesday signed into law a measure banning violent felons from owning body armor , such as the bullet - proof padding used by two bank robbers in the infamous 1997 North Hollywood shootout with the Los Angeles Police Department .
“ Violent felons wearing body armor pose a dangerous threat to our communities and especially to our men and women in law enforcement , ” Schwarzenegger said .
An appeals court last year overturned a similar law enacted a year after the North Hollywood incident ; it was ruled too vague .
Sen. Alex Padilla ( D - Pacoima ) wrote the new law , SB 408 .
The hottest debate Wednesday was in the state Assembly , which voted 41 to 27 to pass a bill that would ban single - use plastic grocery bags — the first of its kind in the nation , according to lawmakers and environmentalists .
Shoppers would have to bring reusable bags to the store or pay at least 5 cents each for recycled paper bags at the checkout counter .
Schwarzenegger has indicated that he would sign the bill , AB 1998 by Assemblywoman Julia Brownley ( D - Santa Monica ) , if it passes the Senate as expected .
Environmentalists say the single - use bags endanger marine life and are more likely to foul beaches than any other form of pollution .
Californians use 19 billion such bags a year , or 552 per person , according to an Assembly analysis .
The measure was sponsored by Santa Monica group Heal the Bay .
Opposition comes largely from the plastics industry .
Cities including San Francisco , Palo Alto , Malibu and others across the country have already instituted such bans .
“ It ’s easier to have a statewide ban than it is to have to figure out how to operate city to city , ” said Assembly Speaker John Pérez ( D- Los Angeles ) .
The California Grocers Assn. has endorsed the ban .
“ It does n’t surprise me that certain elements of big business have removed their opposition , ” said Assemblyman and U.S. Senate candidate Chuck DeVore ( R - Irvine ) , an opponent of the bill , alluding to the fee shoppers would have to pay for recycled bags .
“ As long as they do n’t get gouged , they ’re more than happy to dump the consumer under the bus . ”
The issue of when children should enter kindergarten was less controversial .
The Senate voted 28 to 4 for a measure that would increase the minimum age of those admitted to kindergarten , phased in over three years , starting in 2012 .
Youngsters would have to turn 5 by Sept. 1 of the school year they start , rather than by the current Dec. 2 cutoff .
The change would affect 100,000 children .
Proponents of the legislation say half of the $ 700 million in projected savings would benefit those children through expanded public preschool programs .
“ Both the research and our classroom teachers are telling us that California kids are starting kindergarten too young , ” said Sen. Joe Simitian ( D- Palo Alto ) , author of SB 1381 .
The measure , which next goes to the state Assembly , is opposed by the California Teachers Assn .
“ The current state preschool program is not accessible to all children , and we do not believe it is appropriate to displace students without access to preschool , ” the teachers group said in a statement .
Lawmakers also acted Wednesday in response to student protests over 32 % fee increases approved last year by the California State University system .
The Senate approved a proposal to limit future fee increases at CSU to the percentage change in the per capita income of Californians and to prohibit increases from taking effect until six months after they are adopted .
The goal of SB 969 , according to Sen. Carol Liu ( D - La Cañada - Flintridge ) , is to make fee increases “ gradual , moderate and predictable ” so that students and their families can better plan college finances .
The Senate also sent the Assembly a measure that would grant parole to dozens of state prison inmates who are comatose or otherwise physically incapacitated , to save $ 200 million annually .
Sen. Mark Leno ( D - San Francisco ) said his bill would allow the state parole board to put prisoners on supervised parole if they determine that the person is both incapacitated and no risk to public safety .
“ Currently we have dozens and dozens of comatose inmates in … specialty care facilities with armed guards on each side of the bed 24/7 , ” Leno said .
“ This is a waste of taxpayer dollars . ”
The measure , SB 1399 was opposed by Republican lawmakers , including Sen. Tom Harman of Huntington Beach .
“ I do n’t think we should be letting people out of prison for anything , ” said Harman , who is running for state attorney general .

El Partido Verde Ecologista de M�xico ( PVEM ) acord� con el PRI que nombrar� a los encargados de la cartera de Medio Ambiente en los estados y municipios donde participaron aliados , y ganaron , en los pasados comicios .
En un dec�logo de compromisos , ambos partidos se comprometieron a impulsar desde los congresos locales las propuestas de otorgar vales para medicinas , un bono educativo para cursos de ingl�s y computaci�n y poner a debate la discusi�n de la pena de muerte para secuestradores y asesinos .
Esas iniciativas fueron presentadas por el PVEM desde 2009 en el Congreso de la Uni�n , pero la discusi�n y su an�lisis se encuentran congeladas .
La organizaci�n ecologista Greenpeace se mostr� preocupada por el " derecho " que tendr� el PVEM para designar a funcionarios ambientales .
Patricia Arendar , directora ejecutiva de la organizaci�n , consider� que el acuerdo PRI - PVEM es de una visi�n " muy limitada " porque el tema de la protecci�n ecol�gica se aborda como un reparto de cuotas y cargos .
" El medio ambiente no es un bot�n pol�tico , tiene que ser un espacio para los mejores expertos , con probada trayectoria , de lo contrario vamos a seguir perdiendo 8.9 % o m�s del Producto Interno Bruto ( PIB ) por los recursos naturales ( mal utilizados ) " , coment� .
El secretario de Procesos Electorales del Comit� Ejecutivo Nacional del PVEM , Arturo Escobar , dijo que su partido no realizar� ninguna imposici�n .
" S�lo sugeriremos una terna de nombres para que sea el mandatario estatal o municipal quien elija .
Nos interesa poner a consideraci�n la creaci�n , por ejemplo , de procuradur�as ambientales " , precis� .
El pacto entre verdes y pri�stas se pondr� en marcha en Veracruz , Hidalgo , Chihuahua , Quintana Roo , Zacatecas , Aguascalientes , Tlaxcala , Tamaulipas , Durango ( alcald�as ) y en cinco municipios de Baja California .

The philosopher and cognitive scientist Andy Clark has argued that humans have always been ‘ natural - born cyborgs , ’ that is , they have always collaborated and merged with non-biological props and aids in order to find better environments for thinking .
These ‘ mindware ’ upgrades ( I borrow the term ‘ mindware ’ from Clark , 2001 ) extend beyond the fusions of the organic and technological that posthumanist theory imagines as our future .
Moreover , these external aids do not remain external to our minds ; they interact with them to effect profound changes in their internal architecture .
Medieval artificial memory systems provide evidence for just this kind of cognitive interaction .
But because medieval people conceived of their relationship to technology in fundamentally different ways , we need also to attend to larger epistemic frameworks when we analyze historically contingent forms of mindware upgrade .
What cultural history adds to our understanding of embedded cognition is not only a recognition of our cyborg past but a historicized understanding of human reality .
Going through the process of fraternity recruitment and sorority recruitment can be intimidating enough , the idea of “ selling yourself ” to a group of daunting peers in hopes of social acceptance and life long , unwavering friendship is frightening , then add in the fact that you ’re probably a college freshman and have just left home , your pets , your friends and your family , the situation makes me nervous just remembering it .
And yes , hazing does still happen with in the Greek community .
Within any culture , traditions will evolve and intensify as the society grows ; such is the case with hazing .
Hazing started as a way for new members of the Greek organizations to prove their loyalty to the organization they wished to join .
With exclusivity of membership , officers in the organizations could request or demand that prospective members prove that they wanted to be apart of the club so badly that they would never tell its secrets , and that they would be an active and contributing member .
Over the years , hazing turned from mere favors ( such as delivering requested things on campus , washing member ’s cars , baking sweets for members , serenades , etc. ) to more intensified requests ( buying things for members , doing homework for members , cleaning common rooms of chapter houses , etc. ) .
Then , eventually , hazing took a dangerous turn when members realized that belittling , embarrassing , and mentally and physically breaking down pledges was an easier way to ensure that only the mentally and physically strongest of the potential new members made it through their recruitment process .
Here is a list of some of the worst hazing cases , viewer discretion is advised :
Be Cool : Potential new members are doused with gallons of ice cold water while powerful fans blew cold air on them until they are completely dry , in some cases the potential new member is naked or has to stand on one foot .
Cleansing / Purification : Potential new members are forced to drink water through a funnel until they almost drown to death from too much water .
Drunk Skinny Dipping : Swimming naked normally in prohibited areas like university fountains or lakes .
Washboard Abs : Female potential new members are sat naked on a washing machine and the sisters circled the fat that jiggled , and the pledges had to lose that weight before they became a sister .
Porn : Female potential new members are sat on newspapers naked and forced to watch porn , the newspapers are then hung afterward in the house with the pledge ’s name on it , and circles around any wetness that transferred to the newspaper as a result of watching the porn .
Bobbing : Female potential new members were forced to bob for dildos and bananas in a toilet bowl .
Games of car / truck chicken :
Two cars / trucks head towards each other with the objection of crashing head on until one person flinches and steers clear of the other car .
If nobody chickens out , a head - on collision occurs .
Maids :
House clean ups after parties , or after members choose to make the house dirty for no reason other than having the potential new members clean up their messes .
Pizza :
Male potential new members forced to masturbate onto a pizza , the last one to ejaculate was forced to eat the pizza .
Sodomize : Male potential new members are forced to wear fairy wings and sodomized with frozen hot dogs .
Human Purse : Most potential new members ( especially male ) have to carry around cigarettes , a tin of dip , a bottle opener , $ 20 , and gum at all times , and will commonly be called to be a designated driver at all hours of the morning .
Vomit : Participating in puke slip n’ slides .
Drinking : Potential new members forced to drink a handle of alcohol in the stair closet along with a gallon of water .
Shots : Potential new members forced to drink shots for every time they could not perfectly recite the organizations motto and creed .
Branding : Potential new members forced to endure letter branding .
Members take a wire hanger , mold it into the organization ’s Greek letters , dip it in fire and burn the molding onto a hidden area of the new member ’s skin .
Mental : Potential new members forced to endure mental bashing .
Physical : Potential new members forced to endure physical battery .
Stand Up : Potential new members forced to stand against walls for hours while reciting the organizations creed until every pledge class member could say it perfectly and without hesitation .
Liver & Oil : Potential new members forced to swallow raw cow ’s liver pieces dipped in oil .
Puzzled : Potential new members had to put together a 5,000 piece puzzle of the organization ’s colors in the dark with nothing but a strobe light in the basement of the organization ’s house .
Frosty : Potential new members taken into snow in bathing suits and told to make snowmen that looked like members .
Snow Angels : Potential new members taken into snow in bathing suits and told to make snow angels for every member of the organization and decorate the snow angels to fit the member ’s personality .
Tied to a Tree : Potential new members tied to trees with duct tape and / or plastic wrap naked .
Duck Walk : Potential new members were lathered with a sticky substance and stuck with feathers and told to quack around as amusement for the members .
Breakfast of Champions : Potential new members were only allowed to eat cereal with whiskey or scotch instead of milk for a weekend .
Garbage Men : Potential new members were put into trashcans filled with the organization house ’s trash and rolled down a nearby hill .
Zzzs : Sleep deprivation
There is also the gray field of team building activities that border the realm of hazing .
Often times officers will send groups of new members on bonding experiences ; simple things like completing ropes courses and professionally directed programs are not considered hazing , but dropping five guys in the middle of a corn field without cell phones , keys or money and telling them to come back together to the university three hours away is considered hazing , even if members are willing and able to bond together to problem solve the arisen scenario of abandonment .
If you are a victim of hazing or want to anonymously report a case please call 1-888- NOT - HAZE ( 1-888-668-4293 ) , the anti-hazing organization lead by Kappa Alpha Order .

Well , you ’re in luck , because the enterprising hackers over at XDAndroid.com have developed a version of Android 2.2 ( Froyo ) that you run from your SD card .
Currently , this version runs on the following HTC phones :
Raphael ( Touch Pro )
Fuze
Diamond
Blackstone
Topaz
Rhodium .
Getting Started With XDAndroid
To run XDANDROID , simply download the appropriate version of Android 2.2 ( Froyo ) for your phone to your computer , extract the files , and copy them to your phone ’s sd card .
Begin by starting Haret.exe from your file manager .
Your phone will do a soft reset , and boot the XDANDROID operating system .
The phone will then give you a non-intuitive calibration screen .
Be quick when calibrating your screen , as it works on a timer .
If you do n’t calibrate quickly enough , your screen will be out of whack until you re-calibrate .
One caveat :
If you have a CDMA phone , you may need to go into settings ( Wireless / Mobile settings ) , to setup the data connection .
Once that is done , you are ready to go .
( If you get lost along the way , you can always consult XDAndroids more detailed install guide )
I have now been using this version of Android for approximately 2 weeks on my HTC Touch Pro , and in that time I have only found 1 showstopper , and a few annoyances .
Make sure you have a Gmail account to take full advantage of what Android 2.2 has to offer .
With a Gmail account , not only will you have access to Google office functions ( email , calendar , etc. ) , but you will have access to the Market Place as well , which is a storage house of free and inexpensive android applications that rivals Apples App store .
Make sure you have a Gmail account to take full advantage of what Android 2.2 has to offer .
With a Gmail account , not only will you have access to Google office functions ( email , calendar , etc. ) , but you will have access to the Market Place as well , which is a storage house of free and inexpensive android applications that rivals Apples App store .
Sensitivity
When running , the operating system is very responsive , although the screen is very sensitive to movements .
This can be a nuisance .
For instance , many times I was trying to go to the main app screen by pressing the home icon , but with the slightest movement , the phone thought I was doing a swipe move to menu # 2 .
Email
Using Android 2.2 , the phone will sync with your Google account much better than Windows Mobile does with their system .
The Email , Contacts and Calendar sync quickly , accurately , and without manual intervention .
Plus , you will still have access to Hotmail , AOL , or any other internet mail via the browser , or built - in POP and IMAP client .
GPS
Using the GPS through Google maps works well , giving accurate and quick readings for your current location .
In using the Google maps navigation feature , I found that the speech function to get your desired destination did not work .
However , you can type in your location and use the text to speech function , which works well and clearly ( after downloading the Text - to - speech app from the marketplace ) .
Font Size
While XDANDROID does have a setting to select font size , the selection is not saved .
The only time I find this annoying is for the Twitter application that comes with Android since it does not have a font setting .
Bluetooth Compatibility
While the Bluetooth does pair to the Bluetooth in my car , the audio does not work , so that it is not hands free .
For some people , like myself , this may be a showstopper .
Being able to use a hands free device is very important , so I reboot my phone back into Windows whenever I am in the car for an extended period of time .
For all other purposes , I run Android 2.2 on my phone .
Overall Impression
With the XDANDROID , the developers have made a first rate OS which , after a few bugs are resolved , will be able to stand on its own .
While the current version is not perfect , it does work remarkably well .
For those of us who like the HTC hardware that we have , or are still under contract , but want to use Android , this is a great alternative .

The Hockey Stick Illusion is the shocking story of a graph called the Hockey Stick .
It is also a textbook of tree ring analysis , a code - breaking adventure , an intriguing detective story , an exposé of a scientific and political travesty , and the tale of a herculean struggle between a self - funded sceptic and a publicly funded hydra , all presented in the measured style of an analytical treatise .
The hero of the story is Steve McIntyre , honourably assisted by fellow sceptics , especially by Ross McKitrick .
The villain is Michael Mann , dishonourably assisted by global warming alarmists , especially by his “ Hockey Team ” .
The bare bones of the Hockey Stick story are as follows .
In its First Assessment Report published in 1990 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) presented the conventional view of climate history : that around a thousand years ago there was a Medieval Warm Period , followed by a Little Ice Age , followed by the Current Warm Period that has not yet reached the temperatures experienced during the Medieval Warm Period .
In 1995 the IPCC ’s Second Assessment Report presented that view again but introduced some doubt about the Medieval Warm Period , suggesting that further investigation was required .
It had dawned on global warming crusaders that the Medieval Warm Period was a huge problem for the Anthropogenic Global Warming ( AGW ) hypothesis and that fame and fortune awaited a scientist who could get rid of it .
The scientist who took the prize was a brash and ambitious American paleoclimatologist , Dr Michael Mann .
With two of his more senior colleagues , Mann set about investigating the earth ’s temperature over the last millennium by scouring the world ’s research projects that had detected past temperatures by way of temperature “ proxies ” such as tree rings .
The amount of data they collated and the sophistication of their statistical analysis , claimed Mann , ensured that their conclusions would be more “ robust ” than those of previous studies .
Their first peer - reviewed paper ( MBH98 ) was published in the prestigious journal Nature in 1998 and their second ( MBH99 ) was published in Geophysical Research Letters ( GRL ) in 1999 .
The graphed summation of these papers wiped the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age out of the picture and replaced them with a flat - lined handle declining slightly from 1000 to 1900 then bending upwards into a twentieth - century blade of rapidly rising temperatures .
This “ Hockey Stick ” graph was immediately seized by AGW crusaders .
Typical of the reaction was that of Gerry North of Texas A&M University who enthused : “ The planet had been cooling slowly until 120 years ago , when , bam ! , it jumps up …
We ’ve been breaking our backs on [ greenhouse ] detection , but I found the 1000 - year records more convincing than any of our detection studies . ”
Almost overnight the Hockey Stick became the new gold standard of paleoclimatology .
As we now know ( or will know after reading The Hockey Stick Illusion ) what glittered was not gold but fool ’s gold .
The Hockey Stick was not “ robust ” .
It was the product of a pseudo - scientific mindset , faulty data selection , erroneous data identification , dubious statistical methodology , flawed mathematics , a perverted peer - review process , a frenzied propaganda campaign and unscrupulous defence mechanisms .
But so insatiable was the demand for this product that it swept all before it and challengers into the sceptic sin-bin .
Michael Mann was an incorrigible scientist , but he was an indomitable politician .
His hegemony over paleo - climatologists , peer reviewers , journal editors , and some key politicians and lobbyists was none too subtle but amazingly effective .
He quickly became a referee for eleven scientific journals and three grant programs , he was appointed scientific adviser on climate change to the US government , and he appeared regularly in the media .
His crowning achievement was his appointment by the IPCC as contributing author of a number of chapters of the Third Assessment Report , and lead author of its “ Observed Climate ” chapter .
As Hans von Storch understated it , to have a scientist who already dominated a debate also authorising the key review of that debate was a sure road to trouble ; the situation demanded the involvement of scientists who really were independent .
As McIntyre stated it , this situation would be entirely unacceptable in a commercial situation , and in fact illegal outside a banana republic .
Since it would have been too blatant , even for Mann , to have his own paleoclimatology papers as the only ones to be taken seriously in the IPCC report , he sought the collaboration of paleoclimatologists from the University of East Anglia ’s Climatic Research Unit who had been doing tree ring analysis for many years .
So Mann and his American colleagues joined forces with Phil Jones and his English colleagues to form an informal alliance that came to be known as the “ Hockey Team ” .
After some initial argy - bargy the pecking order was sorted out : Mann was captain , Phil Jones vice - captain and the team ’s all - for - one - and - one - for - all effort and prestige were harnessed to spearhead the cause of galvanising the world ’s attention on “ the great moral and economic challenge of our time ” , as Kevin Rudd described AGW alarmism .
While expressing doubts and concerns amongst themselves from time to time , the team was driven inexorably on by Mann ’s bluster about their common commitment to “ the science ” and the need to fend off dark forces he imagined being aligned against them by big energy companies , and references to the support the team could count on from unidentified “ friends in high places ” .
But the team was driven past the point of no return — the scientists ’ reputations and careers became so attached to the Hockey Stick that its defence overwhelmed their professional integrity and scientific objectivity .
Time and again the goal of enshrining the Hockey Stick as the robust “ consensus ” view took precedence over due scientific process and disclosure .
The English members of the team produced some tree ring graph lines that could be added to Mann et al ’s graph to bolster its intergovernmental credentials .
When evidence of the Medieval Warm Period became apparent it was rationalised away as likely to be localised rather than worldwide .
When proxy tree ring graph lines declined inexplicably in the late twentieth century they were cropped short and replaced with instrumental lines — sometimes the replacement was noted , sometimes it was hidden .
Borehole studies that showed higher temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period than during the Current Warm Period were shunted out of the picture , except for a consolation prize of being used to demonstrate rising temperatures since the Little Ice Age .
When the Third Assessment Report was released to great fanfare in 2001 the Hockey Stick was its centrepiece , appearing seven times in the report .
The version that appeared in the “ Synthesis Report ” , as the finale to its “ Summary for Policy Makers ” , was particularly awesome .
A single line traced northern hemisphere temperatures along a nine - century handle , then bent upward through the twentieth century , then continued skyward through the twenty - first century to make a blade nearly as high as the handle was long .
The graph ’s caption began :
Variations of the Earth ’s surface temperature : years 1000 to 2100 .
From year 1000 to year 1860 variations in average surface temperature of the Northern Hemisphere are shown ( corresponding data from the Southern Hemisphere not available ) reconstructed from proxy data ( tree rings , corals , ice cores , and historical records ) .
The line shows the 50 - year average , the grey region the 95 % confidence limit in the annual data …
The Hockey Stick was quickly adopted as the AGW crusaders ’ banner .
It appeared on posters , PowerPoint presentations , in schools , on trucks , and in 2002 it was referred to in a pamphlet sent to every household in Canada to promote ratification of the Kyoto Protocol .
In his documentary An Inconvenient Truth , Al Gore showed it as dramatic “ evidence ” and claimed that all scientists agreed with its message .
Others said : well , all legitimate scientists anyway .
And woe betide any scientist or politician who disagreed .
A few scientists and statisticians and journalists and politicians refused to be cowed .
Not many of them were financed by public institutions .
None involved in the Hockey Stick war were financed by big energy companies , despite the mantra recited by the likes of Mann and Gore that they all were .
( Personally I think sceptics should be financed by big business as a counterbalance to the almost limitless public funding for climate alarmism . )
Steve McIntyre had worked for a mining company , but his work on the Hockey Stick was done from home and was self - funded .
During his career McIntyre had applied his Oxford education in mathematics to data analysis and the auditing of statistically analysed surveys of prospecting and mining projects .
When he retired he educated himself in paleoclimatology , then decided to cast an auditor ’s eye over the Hockey Stick .
This required that he examine the data on which the research papers were based and the methods that had been employed to analyse it , so he e-mailed Michael Mann to ask for them .
Mann responded politely and arranged for a colleague to send some data .
It was not enough data to do a proper audit , but it was enough for McIntyre to start detecting significant problems with the Hockey Stick , which he started exposing on the web .
From then on his requests for the information required to audit papers were ignored , fobbed off , delayed , obstructed , belittled , rejected or grudgingly complied with in part .
He doggedly persisted with the frustrating time - consuming process of politely pursuing researchers , their employers , journals and freedom - of - information claims , in order to gain access to information that should have been made readily available according to the policies of the journals and institutions involved .
With a few exceptions the non-disclosure reality confounded the full - disclosure policy that is essential to the pursuit of scientific truth .
With only part of the data and procedures available to him , McIntyre ’s first task was to fill in the gaps as best he could by working backwards from the graphs to try and figure out how they had been arrived at .
This task made me think of a code breaker with a coded message and some idea of what it might mean who then has to decipher what the code is .
Not until he had broken the code could McIntyre start examining what it had been used to do and analyse whether its results were valid .
This required many hours of trial and error using sophisticated statistical analysis programs — at least they sound sophisticated to a layman like me .
McIntyre ’s discoveries were numerous , and startling , and damning .
When he started posting them on the web , the Hockey Team scathingly dismissed them as ignorant nonsense that would never get past a peer review ; but as soon as McIntyre and fellow Canadian Ross McKitrick had their first peer reviewed paper ( MM03 ) published in Environment and Energy the debate escalated into a Hockey Stick war .
Mann furiously orchestrated a campaign of denunciation and sabotage .
His “ friends over at Nature ” , as he called them , treated McIntyre and McKitrick particularly badly , accepting their paper , delaying it , then rejecting it and publishing Mann ’s exculpatory corrigendum instead .
While their paper was languishing at Nature the Canadians were constrained from responding to attacks by the team .
Mann declared that a paper by Scott Rutherford “ completely discredited ” MM03 .
But in 2005 McIntyre and McKitrick had their second paper published in Energy and Environment ( MM05EE ) and another one in Geophysical Research Letters ( MM05GRL ) and another one in a Dutch magazine .
Mann ’s response was to claim that Energy and Environment was not a legitimate scientific journal and that MM05GRL had “ managed to slip through the imperfect peer review filter at [ GRL ] ” .
He did n’t explain how he knew this about the allegedly confidential peer review process , but thanks to Climategate we know the sort of influence he could wield over that process , and what sort of filter he had in mind .
The war that raged between McIntyre and the hydra , in the journals , on the net , and in the media , came to a head , to one of them at least , when Mann once again refused to disclose his computational codes .
As long as McIntyre had to rely solely on the codes he had broken , Mann could claim that he had n’t got them right , so McIntyre asked Mann to provide the right ones — and was again refused .
Hence Mann ’s stance amounted to : no one can understand my methods and reproduce my results without my codes , and I am not going to allow anyone else to examine or use them .
When Mann ’s ridiculous statements on this matter ( for example , that big oil companies were behind the request and that he would not be intimidated ) were reported in the Wall Street Journal the tussle became political .
The key politicians involved were Joe Barton , a sceptic , and Sherwood Boehlert , an AGW alarmist .
To cut a long story short , Barton set up the Wegman committee to investigate and Boehlert set up the North committee to investigate .
The Wegman panel was made up of three statisticians from three different universities , none of whom had any professional connection to paleoclimatology or the AGW debate .
The North panel was made up of eleven paleoclimatologists and two statisticians , most of whom had been professionally connected to the IPCC or the Hockey Team , some of them closely connected .
So this jury was well and truly stacked in Mann ’s favour .
He acknowledged this to Keith Briffa in an e-mail urging him to appear before it as a witness :
I think you really should do this if you possibly can .
The panel is entirely legit [ im ] ate , and the report was requested by Sherwood Boehlert , who as you probably know has been very supportive of us in the whole Barton affair …
The panel is solid .
Gerry North should do a good job in chairing this , and the other members are all solid .
Christy is the token skeptic , but there are many others to keep him in check .
But despite its AGW bias , when the North panel presented its report in June 2006 it acknowledged that the Hockey Stick ’s depiction of temperatures before 1600 was invalid .
It reported that the Hockey Stick depended on bristlecone pine proxies that “ should be avoided for temperature reconstructions ” .
That its reliance on single validation statistics was unacceptable .
That its short - centring methodology was biased , towards a hockey stick shape .
That it used methodology that was “ unconventional ” and “ problematical ” such that it “ introduced certain distortions ” — that is , was wrong .
And more .
It concluded that : “ Some of these criticisms are more relevant than others , but taken together , they are an important aspect of a more general finding of this committee , which is that uncertainties of the published reconstructions have been underestimated . ”
This was a highly euphemistic summary of the report ’s specific findings .
The panel made no criticism of McIntyre or McKitrick or of the papers they presented .
Since the Wegman panel had not been stacked with AGW crusaders with allegiances to the team or the IPCC , and since its brief was confined to Mann ’s Hockey Stick rather than to climate history as such , its report was not compromised like the North report .
( A brief summary of its findings may be found here . )
The Wegman report identified a hard core of seven authors and a “ social network ” of forty - three authors with direct ties to Mann , and reported that this network had compromised independent research , perverted the peer review process , and so tied researchers to their public positions that they had become incapable of reassessing them .
It criticised the team ’s isolation from mainstream statisticians in other disciplines , and its grudging and haphazard release of the data required for verification of its findings .
Most importantly it found that “ the decentered methodology ” used to produce the Hockey Stick “ is simply incorrect mathematics ” , that the Hockey Stick has “ a validation skill not significantly different from zero ” , and that its obliteration of the Medieval Warm Period and contention that the 1990s was the hottest decade in a millennium were “ essentially unverifiable ” .
The team attacked the Wegman report on the grounds that it was not peer reviewed , which was ridiculous since it was a peer review — a proper independent one by three of the most distinguished statisticians in the country .
And they made maximum use of the wiggle room in the North report summary .
Although it had validated McIntyre and McKitrick ’s criticisms of Mann ’s data selection and methodology in the body of the report , its brief was to form an opinion about the world ’s temperatures over the last 2000 years , and the panel was not about to explicitly contradict the IPCC in this regard .
It got around the conflict of interests by deciding that there was evidence other than Mann ’s Hockey Stick that twentieth - century warming is “ para - normal ” .
What they did n’t do , however , was to scrutinise that “ other evidence ” very carefully , because of the examples they presented , all bar one included bristlecone pines in their data sets , which they had agreed should not be used .
It was in fact those bristlecones and other “ Mannian parlor tricks ” , as McIntyre called them , that produced the hockey stick effect in all their “ other evidence ” .
McIntyre argued that the North report ’s reference to twentieth - century paranormal warming made it “ schizophrenic ” , and that its logical conclusion should be based on two premises : ( 1 ) the Hockey Stick constituted the empirical base of the 2001 report ’s findings ; and ( 2 ) the North panel had “ agreed with the Wegman findings , as they testified to the House Subcommittee under oath ” that the Hockey Stick had been comprehensively discredited .
But North and his panel were too committed to the AGW crusade to accept the logical conclusion that the IPCC ’S 2001 report was critically compromised .
You would think that two bombshells like the North and Wegman reports going off in the bowels of battleship IPCC would sink it to the bottom of the deepest ocean and scatter the team like flotsam .
But such was the head of steam that powered it that it just kept sailing with barely a wobble .
Anyone who confined their attention to the mainstream media ( Murdoch press excepted ) would be left with the impression that the North report was a triumphant vindication of the Hockey Stick and the Wegman report was a beat - up by sceptical politicians in the pockets of the big energy companies .
Mann lost his position as lead author of the climate history chapter of the IPCC ’s Fourth Assessment Report , but he was replaced by Keith Briffa , one of the stalwarts of the Hockey Team .
Mann was kept on as a contributing ( and no doubt highly influential ) author .
The team was , however , forced to drastically modify the Hockey Stick for the IPCC ’s report that was released in July 2007 .
The Hockey Stick graph that had appeared in the 2001 report was conspicuous by its absence .
In its place was a graph of spaghetti strands that reintroduced the Medieval Warm Period , but showed it in a way that diminished its significance compared with the Current Warm Period .
The report did not , however , admit that the 2001 Hockey Stick was wrong ; in fact it went out of its way to avoid leaving that impression .
It noted that McIntyre and McKitrick ’s criticisms of the graph “ may have some theoretical foundation , but Wahl and Ammann ( 2006 ) also show that the impact on the amplitude of the final reconstruction is very small ” .
Given the fact that the IPCC was fully cognisant of McIntyre and McKitrick ’s published papers , of the Wegman report , of the North report , and of the fiasco that was the Wahl and Ammann paper ( it had to skirt around its own rules to even mention it , let alone place such untoward weight on it ) , this statement can only be considered a scandalous indictment of the IPCC ’s integrity .
It was clearly determined to whitewash Mann and the Hockey Team and showed no compunction about manipulating the evidence in order to do so .
Nevertheless , the fact that the straight handle with angled blade graph had disappeared was a significant , albeit unacknowledged , back - down .
Of the thirteen spaghetti lines in the IPCC ’s 2007 graph , only eight extend from the Medieval Warm Period to the Current Warm Period , and if they were the only lines shown the Medieval Warm Period would look much the same as the Current Warm Period with a Little Ice Age in between — which would not a hockey stick make .
Furthermore , according to McIntyre ’s analysis , all the graphs involved suffered from one or more of the flaws that he had exposed and had verified by the North and Wegman verdicts .
The illusion of a hockey stick , however , was created by the other five lines , particularly by two that were darker and thicker than the rest .
The only problem was that these two at least had no business being there at all .
One that swooped up from 1500 to 2000 was derived from bore­hole temperatures .
But if a borehole line was extended back in time it would show a higher Medieval Warm Period than the Current Warm Period .
The other that started at 1856 recorded instrumental ( thermometer ) readings .
Since it could not be extended back through the millennium it should not have been included in the graph .
Why not stick to the same methodology through the whole millennium ?
If you have to switch from apples to oranges to get the result you want there is something drastically wrong with your method or your result or both .
It is , argued David Holland :
obvious nonsense [ to ] claim that historic reconstructions are evidence that one period is warmer than another when the reconstructions cited cannot replicate the instrumental record of the actual decades which they are alleging to be warmer .
The evidence would be speculative if the divergence problem was unknown , but knowing it makes the evidential value of the reconstructions nil .
One by one the spaghetti strands that the IPCC presented were discredited by McIntyre ’s work .
Michael Mann , however , was not yet done .
In September 2008 the BBC announced to great fanfare that he and his colleagues had revived the Hockey Stick in a new paper to be published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science ( PNAS ) .
Nature announced triumphantly that it would silence Mann ’s critics because it produced a Hockey Stick that did n’t rely on tree rings .
Not only had this paper been thoroughly reviewed and revised and reviewed again but it complied with the North report ’s recommendations , including the publication of the data and codes used .
This latter was good news , the long overdue reward for McIntyre and McKitrick ’s dogged struggle that never should have been necessary .
But the reasons why their pursuit of full disclosure had been resisted so vigorously for so long were soon to become apparent .
Over the years McIntyre ’s website www.climateaudit.org had become a hub for sceptical scientists and statisticians , from retired professors , to beleaguered academics , to whiz kids .
Consequently the work of analysing the AGW alarmists ’ releases of allegedly “ new ” research results did not fall entirely on the shoulders of McIntyre and McKitrick .
So when a link was posted to Mann et al ’s new paper , sceptical minds clicked into gear and statisticians ’ programs clicked on around the globe .
It did n’t take them long to make some interesting discoveries .
First , a Czech physicist pointed out problems with Mann ’s theoretical approach ; just minutes later a Greek professor of hydrology noted more .
It was noted that the R2 statistic was absent , despite the fact that the North committee had agreed that it was required to verify the reliability of a reconstruction .
McIntyre discovered that Mann was still using a statistical technique that could create a Hockey Stick effect out of red noise .
An ecologist and a retired professor of statistics pointed out that Mann ’s presentation of a forty - year smooth right up to the present day was mathematically impossible ; another statistician discovered how Mann padded future data with past data in reverse .
Finally suspicion was cast on the peer review — finally for that first day ’s work , that is .
Incredibly , when McIntyre started looking into the tree ring proxies used , the same series that had been discredited were sitting there , including bristlecone pines !
Given the fact that this species had been explicitly rejected as a reliable proxy , even by the North report , its inclusion blatantly flaunted the paper ’s Hockey Stick bias .
Some new proxy series had been added , but hardly any of them showed modern warming , so the Hockey Stick effect relied on all the old suspects .
Except for one striking addition — proxies taken from the sediments of four Finland lakes by a Dr Tiljander were shown by Mann as indicating hockey sticks with marked twentieth - century rises in temperatures .
But , as the Tiljander evidence was analysed , travesty spiralled downward into farce .
An examination of Tiljander ’s research revealed that the twentieth - century proxy upturns had nothing to do with temperatures ; they were the result of ditch digging .
Furthermore , whereas Tiljander had explained that higher x-ray scores indicated lower temperatures , Mann had interpreted higher x-ray scores as indicating higher temperatures .
So it was this upside - down graph that had demolished the Medieval Warm Period ( that had been acknowledged by Tiljander ) and replaced it with a hockey stick .
If these errors seem incredible , Mann ’s determination to make good use of them regardless beggars belief .
Mann had acknowledged the ditch - digging factor but had used an extraordinary argument to defend the inclusion of the Tiljander proxies regardless of this distorting factor .
He claimed that the ditch - digging anomaly did n’t matter because according to his sensitivity analysis the Hockey Stick effect would remain the same even without these Tiljander proxies !
Why not just excluded the Tiljander series then , or its distorting twentieth - century readings ?
Montford managed to maintain his customary restrained tone in order to answer that question this way :
The big selling point of Mann ’s new paper was that you could get a hockey stick shape without tree rings .
However , this claim turned out to rest on a circular argument .
Mann had shown that the Tiljander proxies were valid by removing them from the dataset and showing that you still got a hockey stick .
However , when he did this test , the hockey stick shape of the final reconstruction came from the bristlecones [ and other discredited data and methods ] .
Then he argued that he could remove the tree ring proxies ( including the bristlecones ) and still get a hockey stick — and of course he could , because in this case the hockey stick shape came from the Tiljander proxies [ and discredited methods ] .
His argument therefore rested on having two sets of flawed proxies in the data set , but only removing one of them at a time .
He could then argue that he still got a hockey stick either way .
As McIntyre said , you had to watch the pea under the thimble .
This was by no means Mann ’s only pea-and - thimble trick .
He outdid “ Mike ’s Nature trick ” that had been used to infamously “ hide the decline ” in late - twentieth - century proxy lines .
This time he did n’t hide the decline , he showed a rising mirror image of the decline .
A second statistical method that turned red noise into a hockey stick shape was found .
A complicated filtering of proxy lines favouring those that added to the Hockey Stick effect was discovered .
A proxy line designated as being temperatures in Africa turned out to be rainfall in Spain , and when corrected it altered the temperature of the eighteenth century by 0.5 degrees .
These afflictions , remember , got past the vaunted peer review process with flying colours .
They were perpetrated and reviewed by people who , according to Dr Andrew Glikson in his debate with Joanne Nova ( see Quadrant Online ) should be trusted in the same way we trust doctors and airline pilots !
The PNAS stated it would accept comments on Mann ’s new hockey stick paper provided they were received within three months and were no more than 250 words — which was barely enough to list the number of the problems that had been uncovered , let alone prove them .
McIntyre and McKitrick chose to point out how conventional statistical methodology would show that the uncertainty bounds of Mann ’s reconstruction prior to 1800 were infinitely large , which meant that his graph prior to that date was worthless ; and then to list the most important of the other problems .
Mann was given equal space to reply , which he filled with his usual bluff , bluster and belligerence : McIntyre and McKitrick were “ amusing ” , they raised “ no valid issues ” , their claims were “ unsupported … bizarre … [ of ] no merit ” .
Which is exactly the sort of response he made to McIntyre and McKitrick ’s first paper in 2003 , and on every subsequent occasion they presented their findings , before being forced to surreptitiously concede point after point , camouflaging his back - downs with rationalisations , obfuscations , and unscrupulous attacks on the sceptics ’ ill - motivated lack of appreciation of his higher methodology — methodology that suggested , for instance , that it did n’t matter that he got the Tiljander proxies upside down since they correlated to temperature readings !
The last chapter of The Hockey Stick Illusion canvasses the Climategate e-mails as they relate to each of the preceding chapters .
But despite the book ’s subtitle this chapter adds very little to the story , except a postscript to this effect : boy , how right the suspicions of McIntyre and his merry sceptics were !

Story Synopsis
Five years ago , Amy Costello reported a story for FRONTLINE / World .
It was about the challenges of getting water in Africa , and a promising new technology called the PlayPump .
After years of covering " bad news " in Africa , she was happy to report a story that seemed to offer something to cheer about .
Her story showed how simple it might be for children to pump fresh water just by playing .
Behind it all , a South African entrepreneur named Trevor Field .
" A report commissioned by the Mozambique government on the PlayPump that was never released , cited problems with the pumps – women finding it difficult to operate ; pumps out of commission for up to 17 months ; children not playing as expected on the merry - go - rounds , and maintenance , " a real disaster , " the
report said . "
Field had made his career in advertising , but when he heard about this new device , he formed a company and started making PlayPumps himself .
To cover maintenance costs , he proposed selling ads on the sides of the water tower .
He said the PlayPump model would be a big improvement over the hand pumps that Africans have struggled with for years .
Field would become the PlayPump 's public face and most tireless salesman .
“ If we could put a 1,000 pumps in each country that 's water stressed , ” he told Costello , showing her how his merry - go - round water system worked , “ we 'd make a monster difference to rural water supplies . ”
When her story aired back in 2005 , there was an outpouring from across the country , and around the globe .
A few months later , in late 2006 , she was invited to an event in New York , where the PlayPump was being taken to a whole new level .
Celebrities , politicians and , most important , major donors had been hearing about the PlayPump , and , Costello was told , watching her FRONTLINE story .
As Laura Bush announced $ 16.4 million in U.S. donor support to install PlayPumps across southern Africa , Field watched amazed from his office in South Africa .
“ We were very very excited .
We hired a flat screen TV and got a live link up to watch , ” Field said .
The lion ’s share of the money would come from the U.S. government , which pledged $ 10 million .
Another $ 5 million came from a foundation run by Steve Case , the founder of America Online , and his wife Jean .
Steve Case called the idea of PlayPumps simple , but so perfect and the Cases would soon create PlayPumps International , a new nonprofit with an ambitious marketing plan .
Jean Case told Costello that her FRONTLINE story was the first thing she showed potential funders .
Facebook , Twitter , and fundraising campaigns on charitable websites would soon follow .
With the promise of all that money , Field began expanding his factory and turning out hundreds of new PlayPumps .
As part of the fundraising push , PlayPumps International helped arrange for hip - hop legend Jay - Z to visit one of Field ’s model sites , with MTV cameras rolling .
Later , there would be a benefit concert .
It was all part of a plan to raise more than $ 60 million for PlayPumps by 2010 .
Costello ’s little story about the PlayPump had become a big time cause .
Just a few months later , Field was expanding his PlayPump program in neighboring Mozambique .
And PlayPumps International planned to help Field roll out the pump in 10 African nations .
Costello traveled with Field to Mozambique , where a PlayPump was being installed at Intaka Primary school .
He seemed confident in the new technology he was delivering and the children seemed to be having fun .
As the rollout continued , the media ran with the story .
CNN , National Geographic , and others reported on Field ’s novel water solution that harnesses the power of children at play .
Three years later , Costello returned to Mozambique .
She ’d heard that the PlayPump rollout had run into trouble and wanted to see what had happened .
Back at the primary school in Intaka , the merry - go - round pump was still there but the children were standing idle .
“ We do n't know why but no water is stored in the tank , ” the assistant principal told her .
It did n’t used to be like that , he said .
Costello visited more PlayPump sites , the next one in a more remote part of Mozambique with fewer children around .
Women tell her that spinning the merry - go - rounds is often hard work without help , and hard especially for the older women .
They tell her the old hand pumps were much easier , and that no - one consulted them about the change .
The PlayPump just arrived .
One of the women , Regina , tells Costello the PlayPump has n't produced any water for six months .
Field 's plan to cover maintenance with revenue from billboards was n't working here .
And when the women called or sent texts to the repair line , they said they got no response .
Costello asks Joaqim George , from Mozambique 's Rural Water Authority , what went wrong .
“ Once the pump breaks , and it takes more than three months to repair , people in these communities no longer trust the PlayPump because they are demoralized , ” he tells her .
A report commissioned by the Mozambique government on the PlayPump that was never released , cited similar problems with the pumps that Costello was seeing – women finding it difficult to operate ; pumps out of commission for up to 17 months ; children not playing as expected on the merry - go - rounds , and maintenance , " a real disaster , " the report said .
Field was reluctant to speak about the problems .
But in Mozambique 's capital , Costello meets with John Grabowski .
His group , Save the Children , worked with Field to install dozens of pumps in Mozambique just before Grabowski became the group 's country director .
“ In December of 2007 , all of the pumps were operational , ” he said .
“ Right now there are only 13 . ”
Save the Children was reluctant to say that the problems with their PlayPumps were , in part , their own doing , since it turns out they 'd chosen poor or unsuitable sites for installation .
They were then slow to resolve complaints from the field .
The Mozambique government report in part blamed Save the Children itself for not properly testing sites and the quality of water at those sites , before they installed PlayPumps .
The agency was receiving complaints about the PlayPumps “ pretty much right after installation , ” Grabowski tells Costello .
Back in Washington , DC , Costello tries to get an interview with PlayPumps International in Washington .
The media spokesperson tells her the CEO is much too busy to see her .
Over the course of six months of requests , no one from the Case Foundation or PPI would agree to speak with her .
Then , late last Fall , she obtained this UNICEF report .
It was circulating among major funders , and laid out more problems with the pump and the rollout .
At UNICEF 'S New York headquarters , Clarissa Brocklehurst told Costello about the aid group 's brief experiment with the PlayPump .
After installing dozens of PlayPumps , UNICEF concluded the system was not as sustainable as it needed to be to work in rural Africa .
“ You can put in a beautiful perfect pump , and if it breaks down and there 's no spare parts , then it was only as good as the six weeks or six months that it ever lasted for in the first place , ” Brocklehurst told the reporter .
Despite the negative reports , PlayPumps International continued to push for more pumps across southern Africa .
They stepped up the fundraising to meet their goal of 4,000 pumps by 2010 .
Kristina Gubic visited more than one hundred PlayPump sites when she was communications manager for PlayPumps South Africa .
She said she also encountered pumps in the field that were n't working and felt there was pressure to roll out as many pumps as possible .
Earlier this year , Costello tried again to speak to the man who had always been at the center of this story .
And , after months of discussion , Trevor Field finally agreed to sit for an interview .
She met Field in Johannesburg , where he told her his side of what had happened with the PlayPump rollout – his frustration of wanting to hit targets ; keep people happy and put the $ 16 million to work to install 4,000 pumps .
“ That 's why we jacked up the factory ; that 's why we invested loads of money in people and time and computers and equipment , ” Field explained .
When asked about the maintenance problems and communities going six months with a broken pump , Field said that he may not have fixed all of the pumps all of the time , but the majority of the pumps were working , and “ the rest of them will get attended to . ”
He tells Costello that he did n't think he was responsible for what had gone wrong with a few dozen pumps in Mozambique , and says he told Save the Children that the sites they 'd chosen would never work .
" We tried to fix it …
We went back three times four times to try to repair it …
We informed PlayPumps International .
We informed Save the Children in Mozambique .
No response … for months , " he said .
Both Trevor Field and Save the Children tried to get PlayPumps International to pay to replace the non-working pumps but were told they would not release the money .
Meanwhile , with some 1,500 pumps still in the ground , and others being installed , Costello asked Field if he still believed in the idea of the PlayPump and if children were a reliable source of energy .
“ People say , ‘ Oh the kids do n't play on it , there 's no water in the tank . ’
It 's easy to be critical about the system .
But our policy is that we 're trying to give enough water for the kids to survive for the day .
And the pump does do that , ” he told Costello .
Although Field said he 's learning , and improving his technology along the way , he concedes that the PlayPump , which is mainly effective at large schools , will likely never live up to its initial promise .
Field and the Case Foundation had initially wanted to install thousands of PlayPumps across Africa , but the rollout came to a very quiet end last fall .
The only public acknowledgment of what had happened would be this brief letter on their website , posted right around the time we started asking questions .
It said that the organization had long - standing challenges with the PlayPump , and that the campaign had been " hard and humbling work . "
They would ultimately hand over their inventory of unused PlayPumps to another charity , which plans to use them only in limited circumstances .
As FRONTLINE prepared this report , we heard that PlayPumps International had at last decided to address the problem of the non-working pumps in Mozambique .
Then the villagers finally got the simple solution to their water problems they had been asking for : their old hand pumps back .

Across 148 studies ( 308,849 participants ) , the random effects weighted average effect size was OR = 1.50 ( 95 % CI 1.42 to 1.59 ) , indicating a 50 % increased likelihood of survival for participants with stronger social relationships .
This finding remained consistent across age , sex , initial health status , cause of death , and follow - up period .
Significant differences were found across the type of social measurement evaluated ( p<0.001 ) ; the association was strongest for complex measures of social integration ( OR = 1.91 ; 95 % CI 1.63 to 2.23 ) and lowest for binary indicators of residential status ( living alone versus with others ) ( OR = 1.19 ; 95 % CI 0.99 to 1.44 ) .
Funding :
This research was generously supported by grants from the Department of Gerontology at Brigham Young University awarded to JHL and TBS and from TP Industrial , Inc awarded to TBS .
The funders had no role in study design , data collection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript .
These findings indicate that the influence of social relationships on the risk of death are comparable with well - established risk factors for mortality such as smoking and alcohol consumption and exceed the influence of other risk factors such as physical inactivity and obesity .
Furthermore , the overall effect of social relationships on mortality reported in this meta - analysis might be an underestimate , because many of the studies used simple single - item measures of social isolation rather than a complex measurement .
Although further research is needed to determine exactly how social relationships can be used to reduce mortality risk , physicians , health professionals , educators , and the media should now acknowledge that social relationships influence the health outcomes of adults and should take social relationships as seriously as other risk factors that affect mortality , the researchers conclude .
The researchers identified 148 prospective studies that provided data on individuals ' mortality as a function of social relationships and extracted an “ effect size ” from each study .
An effect size quantifies the size of a difference between two groups — here , the difference in the likelihood of death between groups that differ in terms of their social relationships .
The researchers then used a statistical method called “ random effects modeling ” to calculate the average effect size of the studies expressed as an odds ratio ( OR ) — the ratio of the chances of an event happening in one group to the chances of the same event happening in the second group .
They report that the average OR was 1.5 .
That is , people with stronger social relationships had a 50 % increased likelihood of survival than those with weaker social relationships .
Put another way , an OR of 1.5 means that by the time half of a hypothetical sample of 100 people has died , there will be five more people alive with stronger social relationships than people with weaker social relationships .
Importantly , the researchers also report that social relationships were more predictive of the risk of death in studies that considered complex measurements of social integration than in studies that considered simple evaluations such as marital status .
Some experts think that social isolation is bad for human health .
They point to a 1988 review of five prospective studies ( investigations in which the characteristics of a population are determined and then the population is followed to see whether any of these characteristics are associated with specific outcomes ) that showed that people with fewer social relationships die earlier on average than those with more social relationships .
But , even though many prospective studies of mortality ( death ) have included measures of social relationships since that first review , the idea that a lack of social relationships is a risk factor for death is still not widely recognized by health organizations and the public .
In this study , therefore , the researchers undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature to determine the extent to which social relationships influence mortality risk and which aspects of social relationships are most predictive of mortality .
A systematic review uses predefined criteria to identify all the research on a given topic ; a meta - analysis uses statistical methods to combine the results of several studies .
Humans are naturally social .
Yet , the modern way of life in industrialized countries is greatly reducing the quantity and quality of social relationships .
Many people in these countries no longer live in extended families or even near each other .
Instead , they often live on the other side of the country or even across the world from their relatives .
Many also delay getting married and having children .
Likwise , more and more people of all ages in developed countries are living alone , and loneliness is becoming increasingly common .
In the UK , according to a recent survey by the Mental Health Foundation , 10 % of people often feel lonely , a third have a close friend or relative who they think is very lonely , and half think that people are getting lonelier in general .
Similarly , across the Atlantic , over the past two decades there has been a three - fold increase in the number of Americans who say they have no close confidants .
There is reason to believe that people are becoming more socially isolated .
To address these issues , we conducted a meta- analysis of the literature investigating the association between social relationships and mortality .
Specifically , we addressed the following questions :
What is the overall magnitude of the association between social relationships and mortality across research studies ?
Do structural versus functional aspects of social relationships differentially impact the risk for mortality ?
Is the association moderated by participant characteristics ( age , gender , health status , cause of mortality ) or by study characteristics ( length of clinical follow - up , inclusion of statistical controls ) ?
Is the influence of social relationships on mortality a gradient or threshold effect ?
Empirical data suggest the medical relevance of social relationships in improving patient care [ 13 ] , increasing compliance with medical regimens [ 13 ] , and promoting decreased length of hospitalization [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
Likewise , social relationships have been linked to the development [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] and progression [ 18 ] – [ 21 ] of cardiovascular disease [ 22 ] — a leading cause of death globally .
Therefore , synthesis of the current empirical evidence linking social relationships and mortality , along with clarifications of potential moderators , may be particularly relevant to public health and clinical practice for informing interventions and policies aimed at reducing risk for mortality .
Social relationships have been defined and measured in diverse ways across studies .
Despite striking differences , three major components of social relationships are consistently evaluated [ 5 ] : ( a ) the degree of integration in social networks [ 9 ] , ( b ) the social interactions that are intended to be supportive ( i.e. , received social support ) , and ( c ) the beliefs and perceptions of support availability held by the individual ( i.e. , perceived social support ) .
The first subconstruct represents the structural aspects of social relationships and the latter two represent the functional aspects .
Notably , these different subconstructs are only moderately intercorrelated , typically ranging between r = 0.20 and 0.30 [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
While all three components have been shown to be associated with morbidity and mortality , it is thought that each may influence health in different ways [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
Because it is presently unclear whether any single aspect of social relationships is more predictive than others , synthesis of data across studies using several types of measures of social relationships would allow for essential comparisons that have not been conducted on such a large scale .
There are two general theoretical models that propose processes through which social relationships may influence health : the stress buffering and main effects models [ 5 ] .
The buffering hypothesis suggests that social relationships may provide resources ( informational , emotional , or tangible ) that promote adaptive behavioral or neuroendocrine responses to acute or chronic stressors ( e.g. , illness , life events , life transitions ) .
The aid from social relationships thereby moderates or buffers the deleterious influence of stressors on health .
From this perspective , the term social support is used to refer to the real or perceived availability of social resources [ 6 ] .
The main effects model proposes that social relationships may be associated with protective health effects through more direct means , such as cognitive , emotional , behavioral , and biological influences that are not explicitly intended as help or support .
For instance , social relationships may directly encourage or indirectly model healthy behaviors ; thus , being part of a social network is typically associated with conformity to social norms relevant to health and self - care .
In addition , being part of a social network gives individuals meaningful roles that provide self - esteem and purpose to life [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
Current evidence also indicates that the quantity and / or quality of social relationships in industrialized societies are decreasing .
For instance , trends reveal reduced intergenerational living , greater social mobility , delayed marriage , dual - career families , increased single - residence households , and increased age - related disabilities [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
More specifically , over the last two decades there has been a three - fold increase in the number of Americans who report having no confidant — now the modal response [ 3 ] .
Such findings suggest that despite increases in technology and globalization that would presumably foster social connections , people are becoming increasingly more socially isolated .
Given these trends , understanding the nature and extent of the association between social relationships and mortality is of increased temporal importance .
Two decades ago a causal association between social relationships and mortality was proposed after a review of five large prospective studies concluded that social relationships predict mortality [ 1 ] .
Following the publication of this provocative review , the number of prospective studies of mortality that included measures of social relationships increased exponentially .
Although the inverse association between social relationships and nonsuicide mortality has received increased attention in research , neither major health organizations nor the general public recognize it as a risk factor for mortality .
This may be due in part to the fact that the literature has become unwieldy , with wide variation in how social relationships are measured across a large number of studies and disappointing clinical trials [ 2 ] .
“ Social relationships ” has perhaps become viewed as a fuzzy variable , lacking the level of precision and control that is preferred in biomedical research .
Thus , the large corpus of relevant empirical research is in need of synthesis and refinement .
Aggregate effect sizes were calculated using random effects models following confirmation of heterogeneity .
A random effects approach produces results that generalize beyond the sample of studies actually reviewed [ 27 ] .
The assumptions made in this meta - analysis clearly warrant this method :
The belief that certain variables serve as moderators of the observed association between social relationships and mortality implies that the studies reviewed will estimate different population effect sizes .
Random effects models take such between - studies variation into account , whereas fixed effects models do not [ 28 ] .
In each analysis conducted , we examined the remaining variance to confirm that random effects models were appropriate .
The majority of information obtained from the studies was extracted verbatim from the reports .
As a result , the inter - rater agreement was quite high for categorical variables ( mean Cohen 's kappa = 0.73 , SD = 0.13 ) and for continuous variables ( mean intraclass correlation [ 26 ] = 0.80 , SD = .14 ) .
Discrepancies across coding pairs were resolved through further scrutiny of the manuscript until consensus was obtained .
In cases where multiple effect sizes were reported across different levels of social relationships ( i.e. , high versus medium , medium versus low ) , we extracted the value with the greatest contrast ( i.e. , high versus low ) .
When a study contained multiple effect sizes across time , we extracted the data from the longest follow - up period .
If a study used statistical controls in calculating an effect size , we extracted the data from the model utilizing the fewest statistical controls so as to remain as consistent as possible across studies ( and we recorded the type and number of covariates used within each study to run post hoc comparative analyses ) .
We coded the research design used rather than estimate risk of individual study bias .
The coding protocol is available from the authors .
When multiple reports contained data from the same participants ( publications of the same database ) , we selected the report containing the whole sample and eliminated reports of subsamples .
When multiple reports contained the same whole sample , we selected the one with the longest follow - up duration .
When multiple reports with the same whole sample were of the same duration , we selected the one reporting the greatest number of measures of social relationships .
When multiple effect sizes were reported within a study at the same point in time ( e.g. , across different measures of social relationships ) , we averaged the several values ( weighted by standard error ) to avoid violating the assumption of independent samples .
In such cases , the aggregate standard error value for the lnOR were estimated on the basis of the total frequency data without adjustment for possible correlation among the averaged values .
Although this method was imprecise , the manuscripts included in the meta - analysis did not report the information necessary to make the statistical adjustments , and we decided not to impute values given the wide range possible .
In analyzing the data we used the shifting units of analysis approach [ 25 ] which minimizes the threat of nonindependence in the data while at the same time allowing more detailed follow - up analyses to be conducted ( i.e. , examination of effect size heterogeneity ) .
Data within studies were often reported in terms of odds ratios ( ORs ) , the likelihood of mortality across distinct levels of social relationships .
Because OR values cannot be meaningfully aggregated , all effect sizes reported within studies were transformed to the natural log OR ( lnOR ) for analyses and then transformed back to OR for interpretation .
When effect size data were reported in any metric other than OR or lnOR , we transformed those values using statistical software programs and macros ( e.g. , Comprehensive Meta - Analysis [ 24 ] ) .
In some cases when direct statistical transformation proved impossible , we calculated the corresponding effect sizes from frequency data in matrices of mortality status by social relationship status .
When frequency data were not reported , we recovered the cell probabilities from the reported ratio and marginal probabilities .
When survival analyses ( i.e. , hazard ratios ) were reported , we calculated the effect size from the associated level of statistical significance , often derived from 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) .
Across all studies we assigned OR values less than 1.00 to data indicative of increased mortality and OR values greater than 1.00 to data indicative of decreased mortality for individuals with relatively higher levels of social relationships .
To increase the accuracy of coding and data entry , each article was initially coded by two raters .
Subsequently , the same article was independently coded by two additional raters .
Coders extracted several objectively verifiable characteristics of the studies : ( a ) the number of participants and their composition by age , gender , marital status , distress level , health status , and pre-existing health conditions ( if any ) , as well as the percentage of smokers and percentage of physically active individuals , and , of course , the cause of mortality ; ( b ) the length of follow up ; ( c ) the research design ; and ( d ) the aspect of social relationships evaluated .
We included in the meta - analysis studies that provided quantitative data regarding individuals ' mortality as a function of social relationships , including both structural and functional aspects [ 23 ] .
Because we were interested in the impact of social relationships on disease , we excluded studies in which mortality was a result of suicide or injury .
We also excluded studies in which the only measurement of social support was an intervention provided within the context of the study ( e.g. , support group ) , the source of social support was nonhuman ( e.g. , a pet or higher power ) , or the social support was provided to others ( i.e. , giving support to others or measures of others ' benefit from the support provided ) rather than to the individual tracked for mortality status .
We coded studies that included participant marital status as one of several indicators of social support , but we excluded studies in which marital status was the only indicator of social support .
We also excluded studies in which the outcome was not explicitly and solely mortality ( e.g. , combined outcomes of morbidity / mortality ) .
Reports with exclusively aggregated data ( e.g. , census - level statistics ) were also excluded .
Manuscripts coded were all written in English , which accounted for 98 % of the total retrieved .
See Figure 1 for additional details .
To identify published and unpublished studies of the association between social relationships and mortality , we used three techniques .
First , we conducted searches of studies from January 1900 to January 2007 using several electronic databases : Dissertation Abstracts , HealthSTAR , Medline , Mental Health Abstracts , PsycINFO , Social Sciences Abstracts , Sociological Abstracts via SocioFile , Academic Search Premier , ERIC , and Family & Society Studies Worldwide .
To capture the broadest possible sample of relevant articles , we used multiple search terms , including mortality , death , decease (d ) , died , dead , and remain ( ed ) alive , which were crossed with search words related to social relationships , including the terms social and interpersonal linked to the following words : support , network , integration , participation , cohesion , relationship , capital , and isolation
To reduce inadvertent omissions , we searched databases yielding the most citations ( Medline , PsycINFO ) two additional times .
Next , we manually examined the reference sections of past reviews and of studies meeting the inclusion criteria to locate articles not identified in the database searches .
Finally , we sent solicitation letters to authors who had published three or more articles on the topic .
Sixty - one studies had combined data of both structural and functional measures of social relationships ( see Figure 5 ) .
Across these studies , the random effects weighted average effect size was OR = 1.44 ( 95 % CI = 1.32 to 1.58 ) .
A large degree of heterogeneity characterized studies ( I 2 = 82 % [ 95 % CI = 78 % to 86 % ] ; Q ( 60 ) = 337 , p<0.001 ; τ 2 = 0.09 ) , and we conducted a random effects metaregression using the same variables and analytic procedures described previously .
We extracted 64 unique effect sizes that evaluated combined structural and functional measures of social relationships within 61 studies .
The metaregression explained only 6.8 % of the variance in these effect sizes , and the model failed to reach statistical significance ( p = 0.95 ) .
None of the variables in the metaregression moderated the results .
Twenty - four studies had data exclusive to functional measures of social relationships ( see Figure 4 ) .
Across these studies , the random effects weighted average effect size was OR = 1.46 ( 95 % CI = 1.28 to 1.66 ) , which value fell within the CI of the omnibus results reported previously .
There was moderate heterogeneity across studies ( I 2 = 47 % [ 95 % CI = 16 % to 68 % ] ; Q ( 23 ) = 44 , p<0.01 ; τ 2 = 0.04 ) , so we conducted a random effects metaregression using the same variables and analytic procedures described previously .
We extracted 87 unique effect sizes that were specific to measures of functional social relationships within 72 studies .
A total of 16.5 % of the variance in these effect sizes was explained in the metaregression , but the model did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.46 ) .
The results were not moderated by any of the specified participant characteristics ( age , sex , initial health status , cause of mortality ) or study characteristics ( length of follow - up , geographic region , statistical controls ) .
Metaregression is an analogue to multiple regression analysis for effect sizes .
Its primary purpose is to ascertain which continuous and categorical ( dummy coded ) variables predict variation in effect size estimates .
Using random effects weighted metaregression , we examined the simultaneous association ( with all variables entered into the model ) between effect sizes and prespecified participant and study characteristics ( Table 3 ) .
To examine the most precise effect size estimates available and to increase the statistical power associated with this analysis , we shifted the unit of analysis [ 24 ] and extracted effect sizes within studies that were specific to measures of structural aspects of social relationships .
That is , if a study contained effect sizes from both structural and functional types of social relationships , we extracted the structural types for this analysis ( with identical subtypes aggregated ) , which resulted in a total of 230 unique effect sizes across 116 studies .
A total of 18 % of the variance in these effect sizes was explained in the metaregression ( p<0.001 ) .
As can be seen in Table 3 , effect sizes based on data controlling for other variables were lower in magnitude than those based on raw data .
Moreover , effect sizes differed in magnitude across the subtype of structural social relationships measured .
Complex measures of social integration were associated with larger effect size values than measures of social participation .
Binary measures of whether participants lived alone ( yes / no ) were associated with smaller effect size values .
Average random effects weighted odds ratios for the various subtypes of social relationships are reported in Table 4 .
Sixty - three studies had data exclusive to structural measures of social relationships ( see Figure 3 ) .
Across these studies , the random effects weighted average effect size was OR = 1.57 ( 95 % CI = 1.46 to 1.70 ) , which value fell within the CI of the omnibus results reported previously .
The heterogeneity across studies was still quite large ( I 2 = 84 % [ 95 % CI = 80 % to 87 % ] ; Q ( 62 ) = 390 , p<0.001 ; τ 2 = 0.07 ) , so we undertook metaregression with prespecified participant and study characteristics .
Given that structural versus functional components of social relationships may influence health in different ways [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , the high degree of heterogeneity observed in the omnibus results may have been due in part to differences between the components of social relationships evaluated within and across studies .
Hence the remaining analyses separately evaluate effect sizes obtained from structural , functional , and combined ( structural and functional ) measures of social relationships .
Table 2 provides definitions of the types and subtypes of social relationships evaluated .
To assess the possibility of publication bias [ 177 ] , we conducted several analyses .
First , we calculated the fail - safe N [ 177 ] to be 4,274 , which is the theoretical number of unpublished studies with effect sizes averaging zero ( no effect ) that would be needed to render negligible the omnibus results .
Second , we employed the “ trim and fill ” methodology described by Duval and Tweedie [ 178 ] , [ 179 ] to estimate the number of studies missing due to publication bias , but this analysis failed to reveal any studies that would need to be created on the opposite side of the distribution , meaning that adjustment to the omnibus effect size was unnecessary .
Third , we calculated both Egger 's regression test and the alternative to that test recommended by Peters and colleagues [ 180 ] that is better suited to data in lnOR format .
The results of both analyses failed to reach statistical significance ( p>0.05 ) .
Finally , we plotted a contour - enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 2 ) [ 181 ] .
The data obtained from this meta - analysis were fairly symmetrical with respect to their own mean ; fewer than ten studies were “ missing ” on the left side of the distribution that would have made the plot symmetrical .
Based on these several analyses , publication bias is unlikely to threaten the results .
Across 148 studies , the random effects weighted average effect size was OR = 1.50 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.42 to 1.59 ) , which indicated a 50 % increased likelihood of survival as a function of stronger social relations .
Odds ratios ranged from 0.77 to 6.50 , with substantial heterogeneity across studies ( I 2 = 81 % [ 95 % CI = 78 % to 84 % ] ; Q ( 147 ) = 790 , p<0.001 ; τ 2 = 0.07 ) , suggesting that systematic effect size variability was unaccounted for .
Thus factors associated with the studies themselves ( e.g. , publication status ) , participant characteristics ( e.g. , age , health status ) , and the type of evaluation of social relationships ( e.g. , structural social networks versus perceptions of functional social support ) may have moderated the overall results .
We therefore conducted additional analyses to determine the extent to which these variables moderated the overall results .
Statistically nonredundant effect sizes were extracted from 148 studies ( [ 29 ] – [ 176 ] ; see Table 1 ) .
Data were reported from 308,849 participants , with 51 % from North America , 37 % from Europe , 11 % from Asia , and 1 % from Australia .
Across all studies , the average age of participants at initial evaluation was 63.9 years , and participants were evenly represented across sex ( 49 % female , 51 % male ) .
Of the studies examined , 60 % involved community samples , but 24 % examined individuals receiving outpatient medical treatment , and 16 % utilized patients in inpatient medical settings .
Of studies involving patients with a pre-existing diagnosis , 44 % were specific to cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , 36 % to cancer , 9 % to renal disease , and the remaining 11 % had a variety of conditions including neurological disease .
Research reports most often ( 81 % ) considered all - cause mortality , but some restricted evaluations to mortality associated with cancer ( 9 % ) , CVD ( 8 % ) , or other causes ( 2 % ) .
Participants were followed for an average of 7.5 years ( SD = 7.1 , range = 3 months to 58 years ) , with an average of 29 % of the participants dying within each study 's follow - up period .
Discussion
Cumulative empirical evidence across 148 independent studies indicates that individuals ' experiences within social relationships significantly predict mortality .
The overall effect size corresponds with a 50 % increase in odds of survival as a function of social relationships .
Multidimensional assessments of social integration yielded an even stronger association : a 91 % increase in odds of survival .
Thus , the magnitude of these findings may be considered quite large , rivaling that of well - established risk factors ( Figure 6 ) .
Results also remained consistent across a number of factors , including age , sex , initial health status , follow - up period , and cause of death , suggesting that the association between social relationships and mortality may be generalized .
The magnitude of risk reduction varied depending on the type of measurement of social relationships ( see Table 4 ) .
Social relationships were most highly predictive of reduced risk of mortality in studies that included multidimensional assessments of social integration .
Because these studies included more than one type of social relationship measurement ( e.g. , network based inventories , marital status , etc. ) , such a measurement approach may better represent the multiple pathways ( described earlier ) by which social relationships influence health and mortality [ 182 ] .
Conversely , binary evaluations of living alone ( yes / no ) were the least predictive of mortality status .
The reliability and validity of measurement likely explains this finding , and researchers are encouraged to use psychometrically sound measures of social relationships ( e.g. , Table 2 ) .
For instance , while researchers may be tempted to use a simple single - item such as “ living alone ” as a proxy for social isolation , it is possible for one to live alone but have a large supportive social network and thus not adequately capture social isolation .
We also found that social isolation had a similar influence on likelihood of mortality compared with other measures of social relationships .
This evidence qualifies the notion of a threshold effect ( lack of social relationships is the only detrimental condition ) ; rather , the association appears robust across a variety of types of measures of social relationships .
This meta - analysis also provides evidence to support the directional influence of social relationships on mortality .
Most of the studies ( 60 % ) involved community cohorts , most of whom would not be experiencing life - threatening conditions at the point of initial evaluation .
Moreover , initial health status did not moderate the effect of social relationships on mortality .
Although illness may result in poorer or more restricted social relationships ( social isolation resulting from physical confinement ) , such that individuals closer to death may have decreased social support compared to healthy individuals , the findings from these studies indicate that general community samples with strong social relationships are likely to remain alive longer than similar individuals with poor social relations .
However , causality is not easily established .
One cannot randomly assign human participants to be socially isolated , married , or in a poor - quality relationship .
A similar dilemma characterizes virtually all lifestyle risk factors for mortality : for instance , one cannot randomly assign individuals to be smokers or nonsmokers .
Despite such challenges , “ smoking represents the most extensively documented cause of disease ever investigated in the history of biomedical research ” [ 183 ] .
The link between social relationships and mortality is currently much less understood than other risk factors ; nonetheless there is substantial experimental , cross-sectional , and prospective evidence linking social relationships with multiple pathways associated with mortality ( see [ 182 ] for review ) .
Existing models for reducing risk of mortality may be substantially strengthened by including social relationship factors .
Notably , the overall effect for social relationships on mortality reported here may be a conservative estimate .
Many studies included in the meta - analysis utilized single item measures of social relations , yet the magnitude of the association was greatest among those studies utilizing complex assessments .
Moreover , because many studies statistically adjusted for standard risk factors , the effect may be underestimated , since some of the impact of social relationships on mortality may be mediated through such factors ( e.g. , behavior , diet , exercise ) .
Additionally , most measures of social relations did not take into account the quality of the social relationships , thereby assuming that all relationships are positive .
However , research suggests this is not the case , with negative social relationships linked to greater risk of mortality [ 184 ] , [ 185 ] .
For instance , marital status is widely used as a measure of social integration ; however , a growing literature documents its divergent effects based on level of marital quality [ 186 ] , [ 187 ] .
Thus the effect of positive social relationships on risk of mortality may actually be much larger than reported in this meta - analysis , given the failure to account for negative or detrimental social relationships within the measures utilized across studies .
Other possible limitations of this review should be acknowledged .
Statistical controls ( e.g. , age , sex , physical condition , etc. ) employed by many of the studies rule out a number of potentially confounding variables that might account for the association between social relationships and mortality .
However , studies used an inconsistent variety of controlling variables , and some reports involved raw data ( Table 1 ) .
Although effect size magnitude was diminished by the inclusion of statistical controls only within the data obtained by measures of structural social relationships ( but not functional or combined measures ) , future research can better specify which variables are most likely to impact the overall association .
It must also be acknowledged that existing data primarily represent research conducted in North America and Western Europe .
Although we found no differences across world region , future reviews inclusive of research written in all languages ( not only English ) with participants better representing other world regions may yield better estimates across populations .
Approximately two decades after the review by House and colleagues [ 1 ] , a generation of empirical research validates their initial premise : Social relationships exert an independent influence on risk for mortality comparable with well established risk factors for mortality ( Figure 6 ) .
Although limited by the state of current investigations and possible omission of pertinent reports , this meta - analysis provides empirical evidence ( nearly 30 times the number of studies previously reported ) to support the criteria for considering insufficient social relationships a risk factor of mortality ( i.e. , strength and consistency of association across a wide range of studies , temporal ordering , and gradient of response ) [ 188 ] .
The magnitude of the association between social relationships and mortality has now been established , and this meta - analysis provides much - needed clarification regarding the social relationship factor (s ) most predictive of mortality .
Future research can shift to more nuanced questions aimed at ( a ) understanding the causal pathways by which social participation promotes health , ( b ) refining conceptual models , and ( c ) developing effective intervention and prevention models that explicitly account for social relations .
Some steps have already been taken identifying the psychological , behavioral , and physiological pathways linking social relationships to health [ 5 ] , [ 182 ] , [ 189 ] .
Social relationships are linked to better health practices and to psychological processes , such as stress and depression , that influence health outcomes in their own right [ 190 ] ; however , the influence of social relationships on health cannot be completely explained by these processes , as social relationships exert an independent effect .
Reviews of such findings suggest that there are multiple biologic pathways involved ( physiologic regulatory mechanisms , themselves intertwined ) that in turn influence a number of disease endpoints [ 182 ] , [ 191 ] –[ 193 ] .
For instance , a number of studies indicate that social support is linked to better immune functioning [ 194 ] –[ 197 ] and to immune - mediated inflammatory processes [ 198 ] .
Thus interdisciplinary work and perspective will be important in future studies given the complexity of the phenomenon .
Perhaps the most important challenge posed by these findings is how to effectively utilize social relationships to reduce mortality risk .
Preliminary investigations have demonstrated some risk reduction through formalized social interventions [ 199 ] .
While the evidence is mixed [ 2 ] , [ 6 ] , it should be noted that most social support interventions evaluated in the literature thus far are based on support provided from strangers ; in contrast , evidence provided in this meta - analysis is based almost entirely on naturally occurring social relationships .
Moreover , our analyses suggest that received support is less predictive of mortality than social integration ( Table 4 ) .
Therefore , facilitating patient use of naturally occurring social relations and community - based interventions may be more successful than providing social support through hired personnel , except in cases in which patient social relations appear to be detrimental or absent .
Multifaceted community - based interventions may have a number of advantages because such interventions are socially grounded and include a broad cross-section of the public .
Public policy initiatives need not be limited to those deemed “ high risk ” or those who have already developed a health condition but could potentially include low - and moderate - risk individuals earlier in the risk trajectory [ 200 ] .
Overall , given the significant increase in rate of survival ( not to mention quality of life factors ) , the results of this meta - analysis are sufficiently compelling to promote further research aimed at designing and evaluating interventions that explicitly account for social relationship factors across levels of health care ( prevention , evaluation , treatment compliance , rehabilitation , etc. ) .
This week The Corbett Report was sent documents purported to be the notes of an attendee of the recent Toronto G20 meeting .
The documents , if genuine , show that the recent meeting once again gave the G20 a chance to discuss global government as an answer to the ongoing economic meltdown and reaffirm that carbon taxes are high on the globalists ' priority list .
The notes were obtained from a source inside a South African bank whose CEO was a confirmed attendee of the Toronto meeting .
According to the source , they are most likely notes from a feedback session between the CEO and bank officials upon the CEO 's return from the conference .
Download the documents in PDF format via this link or browse them in the image set below :
According to the documents , the delegates concluded that a process of fiscal consolidation would be the key solution to the crisis , involving country - specific ideas with central coordination ... presumably by the G20 itself .
Although the delegates evidently discussed the need to address the sovereign debt crisis " through cutting expenses and not through increased taxes , " that statement is immediately followed in this attendee 's notes by the idea of introducing carbon taxes .
The idea of funding a nascent global governmental structure through the introduction of carbon taxes is by no means a new one , having been proposed as a funding mechanism for a North American Union at a secret Security and Prosperity Partnership meeting in Banff , Canada in 2006 .
Perhaps not coincidentally , the idea was last floated in the G20 Finance Ministers 's meeting in Scotland last year .
In leaked documents from that meeting it was revealed that attendees had seriously discussed the possibility of using a carbon tax to fund an international financial body which would supposedly be entrusted to look after climate adaptation and mitigation programs .
ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW
That the carbon tax was discussed during G20 deliberations comes as no surprise .
Nor does the fact that the delegates deliberated on the need " to develop Global governance structures " and the desire for " coordination across countries . "
The urge to use a manufactured economic crisis to institute a new international system of governance administered by the very bankers who created the problem in the first place has likewise been noted for years .
But there are hopeful signs that the globalists ' agenda is being derailed by a mass political awakening among the public , exactly as key globalist Zbigniew Brzezinski discussed in a recent speech .
Perhaps the foremost hurdle to the implementation of the G20's plans comes from fierce opposition to the carbon tax agenda in the United States exemplified by the fact that the current Senate climate bill is likely dead in the water .
Another hopeful sign are those passages of the leaked documents that seem to suggest that national governments may be diverting from the globalist agenda in order to protect their national interests , including repeated references to the specter of increased protectionism as a result of the global downturn .
On a more ominous note , however , are references to the need to create a " B20 " or " Business 20 " to give unaccountable multi-nationals an even bigger stake in the nascent global governmental structure inherent in the G20 structure .
This year 's G20 drew the ire of Canadians and concerned citizens around the world for its $ 1.3 billion security budget and brutal treatment of protestors .
The next G20 summit will take place in November in Seoul , Korea .

( Mashable.com ) --
Facebook has begun the rollout of a new feature , Facebook Questions , which will allow users to get answers to their queries from the entire Facebook community .
Similar in concept to Yahoo !
Answers , Quora and Mahalo , Facebook Questions gives users the opportunity to ask questions just by clicking the " Ask Question " button on the homepage .
Questions is also available on friends ' profiles just as you would post on someone 's wall .
We first learned of Facebook 's Q&A feature two months ago , when the company started asking for volunteers to beta test the product .
The world 's largest social network even went so far as to promise beta testers a trip to Facebook 's offices to meet with the Q&A team .
I had the chance earlier today to discuss the new feature with several Facebook employees .
Questions has several defining features :
• Photo questions :
For example , if you take a picture of a bird , but do n't know what species it is , you can post the picture on Facebook Questions and get your answer .
• Polling :
If you 're simply looking for the answer to " Which city is better : Chicago or Dallas ? " , you can get your answer by creating a poll .
• Tagging :
The company seems to be placing a lot of emphasis on tagging questions based on category or topic .
The goal seems to be to make Q&A discovery an easier and faster process by making it simple to look up questions on cooking , photography , San Francisco or a variety of other topics .
• Topic exploration : Facebook described this as a roulette - type feature that allows users to browse Facebook 's eventual mountain of Q&A .
Under the " Questions about " drop - down menu , there 's a feature called " Everything " that allows users to browse the company 's catalog of questions .
• Following :
You can follow specific questions for updates and new answers .
• Updated homepage : Facebook Questions does actually change the homepage , adding a new bar at the top of the page where you can choose to update your status , ask a question , add photos , or post a link .
There was one more thing that Facebook made clear to me : Facebook Questions is not an advertising product .
While brands with Facebook Pages will eventually be able to answer questions , it 's not meant to be a promotional platform ; it 's meant to be a useful and insightful product for users .
Facebook Questions will roll out to a limited group of beta testers today , but the company promises to " bring this product to all of you as quickly as we can . "
The entire feature is public , so we do n't suggest posting those awkward bedroom questions on Facebook .
Will Facebook Questions prove to be more useful than Quora or even Twitter as a Q&A platform ?
We think so , if only because it has the biggest advantage of them all : 500 million users .

ASKED IN 1995 what the Bureau of Reclamation plans to do when sediment threatens to fill Lake Powell , the 186 - mile - long reservoir on the Colorado River , former reclamation commissioner Floyd Dominy replied , “ We will let people in the future worry about it . ”
Lake Powell and Glen Canyon Dam are less than 50 years old , yet already we can see that those who will bear their true costs will not be some generation in a distant future , but our children and grandchildren , and even ourselves .
Glen Canyon was the second of two high dams on the Colorado .
In 1936 Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicated the earlier of the pair , Hoover Dam , the first of nearly 50,000 large dams built worldwide , 90 percent of them since 1950 .
To justify this frenzy of construction , proponents and funders routinely exaggerated benefits and longevity while underestimating and ignoring costs .
The most obvious cost of Glen Canyon Dam is the chasm that it drowned , western explorer John Wesley Powell ’s “ ensemble of wonderful features — carved walls , royal arches , glens , alcove gulches , mounds , and monuments . ”
These the Bureau of Reclamation sacrificed to fuel the juggernaut of development in Arizona , California , and Nevada .
But there are other costs .
The dam not only drowned Glen Canyon , it radically changed the Colorado River downstream in Grand Canyon .
Before the dam , the river was so muddy that the pioneer explorers joked ( as they did about many free - running Western rivers ) that it was “ too thick to drink and too thin to plow . ”
The Colorado delivers enough sediment to Lake Powell to fill 1,400 ship cargo containers each day .
The dam traps it all , leaving the water below clear as air and starving plant and animal species in Grand Canyon of the sediment they need for habitat and spawning .
Spring snowmelt once swelled the unimpeded river to 100,000 cubic feet per second ( cfs ) or more , equal to the summertime flow of Niagara Falls .
In midwinter the flow dropped to only a few thousand cfs .
To meet the demand for power in the Southwest , dam operators smoothed out the seasonal variations while they drastically increased the hourly ones , the released water surging through Grand Canyon like mini-tsunamis , washing away what sediment there is .
We justify dams for the hydropower , flood protection , irrigation water , and recreation that they provide .
Yet over time , accumulating silt reduces and then eliminates each benefit .
As long as the laws of physics hold , large reservoirs must fill with mud .
After Lake Powell fills , the Colorado River will meander across a mud flat and plunge down the face of Glen Canyon Dam in a waterfall that will undercut and eventually collapse the dam .
In time , the river will remove the dam debris and lake sediments as though they never existed .
Dams imprison rivers , but eventually they annihilate their jailers and escape .
Like the truth , a river will out .
Scores of the world ’s smaller reservoirs have already filled with mud , or nearly so .
Matilija and San Clemente Reservoirs in California , China ’s Sanmenxia , and others are full and overflowing .
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimated the life of the Cerron Grande Dam in El Salvador at 30 years , less than one - tenth the preconstruction prediction .
A mid-1980s study for the World Bank found that world reservoirs contained 1,100 cubic kilometers of sediment , nearly a billion acre-feet and almost one - fifth of worldwide storage capacity .
Lake Powell is so large that it will take longer to fill with sediment than most reservoirs — but how long ?
Assuming that sediment continues to arrive at the rate calculated from sonar surveys in the 1980s , to fill Lake Powell ’s 27 million acre-feet would take 700 years ( an acre - foot equals about 326,000 gallons ) .
But that time span is certain to be a drastic overestimate .
Many scientists predict that within two decades , rising demand for Colorado River water and falling supply will drop the surface of the reservoir to its lowest level , known as “ dead pool . ”
Because the lowest exit from the dam ( the river outlet works ) is 237 feet above the original riverbed , at dead pool Lake Powell will still hold 2 million acre- feet of water , one - thirteenth of capacity .
All things being equal , to fill a Lake Powell of 2 million acre - feet with sediment will take not 700 years but about 55 years .
And all things wo n’t be equal .
Lake Powell is destined for dead pool for two reasons : First , because the Southwest already consumes the entire flow of the Colorado River , and demand still rises inexorably .
Some of the driest states — Nevada , Arizona , and Utah — are among the fastest growing and none plans to slow down .
Take a desert , add water , stir in money — that will continue to be the Southwest ’s definition of success until it fails , until whole subdivisions stand empty because they have no water .
Second , while rising population drives demand for water in the Colorado River Basin , climate change shrinks supply .
Since 1950 , the average temperature in the West has risen over 2°F , nearly twice the global temperature rise during the entire twentieth century .
Higher temperatures increase evaporation , which reduces runoff .
But calculations show that runoff falls by an even greater percentage than temperature rises .
Suppose that evaporation in the Colorado River Basin increases by 2 percent , while precipitation remains the same .
Then runoff declines by 14 percent .
If precipitation also declines by , say , 1 percent , then runoff drops by 22 percent .
How much water is 14 percent of the average flow of the Colorado River ?
Two million acre-feet , nearly half of the water California takes from the Colorado every year .
A 14 percent decrease in the flow of the river is in the middle of the range that climate models project .
Not a single climate study projects an increase in flow .
The more pessimistic projections may already be coming true : from 2000 through 2009 , inflow to Lake Powell was down by one - third .
Lake Powell ’s decline has created a vicious cycle that will reduce its life span even further .
You can see the effect as you raft through Cataract Canyon above Lake Powell , where the lowering lake level has exposed thin strata of silt from the reservoir ’s formerly submerged delta .
Before your eyes , the sandy layers crumble and fall into the river , which washes them down into the lake and deposits them anew .
Lake Powell thus gains not only the new sediment that the Colorado River brings to it , but the recycled , older sediment that the river deposited years and decades before .
The reservoir also gains recycled sediment from its muddy tributaries : the San Juan , the Dirty Devil , and others .
A recent sediment survey found that in five years of declining water levels , Lake Powell received 22 years ’ worth of recycled sediment .
Thus even the 55 - year estimate of the reservoir ’s longevity might be too high .
With demand rising and supply falling , Lake Powell could reach dead pool in the 2020s .
Impossible ?
Hardly .
Between 1999 and 2005 , the reservoir lost two - thirds of its volume and neared the elevation of its generator intakes , 333 feet above the riverbed .
Another two or three years at the same rate of decline and Lake Powell would already be at dead pool .
Fortunately , a wet 2005 intervened to offer a temporary reprieve .
Another threat from rising sediment is invisible to our eyes but may be the more dangerous .
The delta at the reservoir ’s north end is one of two sediment deposits on the floor of Lake Powell .
A second , smaller wedge has piled up against the dam ’s upstream face , the result of turbidity flows racing along the bottom of the reservoir .
The sediment wedge at the dam face will rise gradually until it threatens to block the outlet works .
Former Reclamation scientist Dave Wegner of the Glen Canyon Institute and former Commissioner Dominy ( who died in April ) proposed drilling new tunnels below the dam , through the sandstone bedrock , and up through the floor of the reservoir , allowing water and sediment to bypass the outlet works .
Would it work ?
No one knows , for no one has studied the possibility .
But since the sediment will never cease to arrive , the tunnels , or any other solution , could never take a holiday .
Moreover , instead of accumulating steadily from small turbidity flows , a large volume of silt could arrive at the dam face all at once .
A vast quantity waits suspended not only in Lake Powell ’s delta , but in deposits along the river ’s upstream tributaries .
An earthquake , or an unusually large storm or series of storms , could set this silt moving along the lake floor and up the dam face .
If the surface of the reservoir were below the openings to the generators when silt rose to block the outlet works , no water would be able to leave Glen Canyon Dam and enter Grand Canyon .
The tributaries in Grand Canyon add too little water to make up for the loss of the mainstem , so sections of the river would run dry and riverine life would die .
These conditions would persist until water rose high enough in Lake Powell to exit either through the disused generator intakes or the spillways near the crest of the dam .
As long as Glen Canyon Dam prevented mainstem water from reaching the Grand Canyon , only a trickle from the tributaries in the canyon would arrive downstream at Lake Mead .
To meet downstream water contracts , the Bureau of Reclamation would have to drain Lake Mead to dead pool within a few years .
Until the Colorado River flowed again , evaporation would drop Lake Mead even lower and no water would be able to leave Hoover Dam .
As long as neither dam could release water , the lower Colorado River would cease to exist .
Though every dam will fill with silt eventually , reclamation agencies design them to hold water , not mud .
Wet mud weighs roughly twice as much as an equal volume of water .
The area behind Glen Canyon Dam has room for 70 billion tons of sediment .
Would the dam hold that much ?
No one knows .
Will the weight trigger an earthquake that precipitates a sediment flow or collapses the dam ?
No one can rule out the possibility .
The epicenter of the May 2008 earthquake that killed 70,000 people in China ’s Sichuan Province was located 3.5 miles from Zipingpu Dam , which itself stands 550 yards from a fault line .
Completed in 2006 , Zipingpu had not had time to fill with silt , but did hold 315 million tons of water .
The earthquake cracked the dam , requiring the Chinese authorities to drain the reservoir .
Some seismologists believe that though the weight of the water did not cause the earthquake , it likely advanced its timing and increased its severity .
Geologists have long known that reservoirs trigger tremors .
In the decade after Hoover Dam went up , some 600 earthquakes struck the area .
If Glen Canyon Dam were to fail when Lake Powell was full of mud , or even half full , one of the great disasters in United States history would unfold rapidly .
Sludge would destroy the Colorado River ecosystem in Grand Canyon .
The arrival of the silt from Lake Powell might overload Lake Mead and topple Hoover Dam .
As the silt continued its way downstream , it could collapse the other Colorado River dams and even reach the Sea of Cortéz .
Repair would be so monumental and costly as to be impossible .
The Colorado River dams provide water and power to 30 million people ; without them , the economy of the Southwest would collapse .
The benefits of large hydropower dams are fated to fade and disappear , in some cases in spectacular fashion .
The hundreds of dams that have destroyed rivers across the West represent a kind of national debt that Dominy ’s “ people in the future ” must someday pay .
In this century of climate change , that debt is coming due far sooner than anyone imagined .
The gushing BP oil well is a mystery still unfolding , and late last month , a team of scientists from the Energy Department discovered a new twist :
Their sophisticated imaging equipment detected not one but two drill pipes , side by side , inside the wreckage of the well ’s blowout preventer on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico .
BP officials said it was impossible .
The Deepwater Horizon rig , which drilled the well , used a single pipe , connected in segments , to bore 13,000 feet below the ocean floor .
But when workers cut into the wreckage to install a containment cap this month , sure enough , they found two pipes .
The discovery suggested that the force of the erupting petroleum from BP ’s well on April 20 was so violent that it sent pipe segments hurtling into the blowout preventer , like derailing freight cars .
It also offered a tantalizing theory for the failure of the well ’s last line of defense , the powerful pinchers called shear rams inside the blowout preventer that should have cut the pipe and stopped the rising oil and gas from reaching the Deepwater Horizon 5,000 feet above .
Drilling experts say those rams , believed to be partially deployed , could have been thwarted by the presence of a second pipe .
The doubled - up drill pipe joins a list of clues that is helping scientists understand the complexities of the Deepwater Horizon accident , and from that , craft changes in how deep - water drilling is conducted .
“ We still do n’t really know what ’s in ” the well wreckage , said Energy Secretary Steven Chu , whose team discovered the second pipe using gamma-ray imaging .
He added : “ If there were two drill pipes down there when the shear rams closed , or two drill pipes below , is it possible that in the initial accident … there was an explosive release of force ?
… Did it buckle and snap ?
… The more we know about this , the better we can know what to do next . ”
The challenge will be making enough changes to soothe policymakers ’ and the public ’s fears of a repeat accident , while keeping deep - water drilling economically feasible in an area that provides a third of the nation ’s domestic oil .
Whether this requires halting deep - water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico is hotly debated .
Last week , a federal judge overturned the Obama administration ’s May decision to ban work on 33 deep - water rigs until January , when a presidential commission is expected to release its reform suggestions .
The administration is appealing .
Officials are trying to plug the leak while looking for at least interim answers to fundamental questions about the oil spill .
Chief among them :
What part of the confluence of events that caused the disaster is unique to BP ’s methods and practices , and what is common to the industry at large ?
What amount of government oversight can increase the safety of deep - water drilling , and at what cost ?
Drilling experts and advocates , environmentalists and government officials agree so far on one point :
No amount of regulation can absolutely preclude another drilling accident .
But some changes could not wait : Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has dismantled and begun to reassemble the agency charged with drilling oversight after finding it had too cozy a relationship with the oil industry and had ceded too much safety responsibility to the drillers .
Many drilling experts say there ’s already ample evidence of errors designing and drilling the well beneath the Deepwater Horizon — and of officials on the rig “ cutting corners ” to finish a job that was expensively behind schedule .
Those could be addressed , and could be penalized with civil and criminal charges , without shutting down part of the industry .
The accident “ absolutely was preventable , ” said Eric N. Smith , associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute .
The rig , he added , lacked “ a regulatory presence onboard that said , ‘ I do n’t care how late it is , you do it right or you go home . ’ ”
The experts suggest that the most glaring mistake was a faulty cementing job in the well that was unable to handle the high - pressure oil and gas flow .
The government could prevent similar errors by hiring experienced engineers , stationing them on drilling rigs and empowering them to shut down any operation that failed to meet established safety standards , Smith said .
Administration officials acknowledge that the federal government has not provided nearly enough money or inspectors for that level of oversight .
Salazar called past and present funding levels for inspectors “ woefully inadequate ” and said that “ you need to have the horsepower to be able to have the inspection ” of deep - water drilling rigs .
He has also insisted that the drilling moratorium would give investigators crucial time to solve the mystery of why so many of the Deepwater Horizon ’s “ fail - safe ” backups failed .
That includes learning why the shear rams are partially deployed but resisting efforts to fully close .
“ There clearly needs to be identified what , if anything , went wrong with the fail - safe system , ” said Gene Beck , an assistant professor of petroleum engineering at Texas A&M University .
“ We need to understand , did something happen with the [ blowout preventers ] that we did n’t understand ?
Did they fail to function , in any way , shape or form , within their design parameters ? ”
Regulators could recommend additional backup systems , such as a second blowout preventer or a relief well drilled in conjunction with the initial well .
The other key to minimizing the risks of a similar blowout is economic .
For example , Beck said requiring a concurrent relief well with every project could drain any profit from drilling .
Smith , along with a chorus of public officials on the Gulf Coast , warns that Salazar ’s six - month moratorium could drive the exploration industry out of the gulf permanently .
Environmentalists are pushing the administration to value ecological protection more highly as it updates its risk calculations .
“ Safety costs a bit more , ” said Chris Mann , a senior officer with the Pew Environment Group .
“ Our argument is that should be the cost of doing business . ”
Chu said scientists wo n’t solve the mystery of the Deepwater Horizon — and absorb its lessons — until they exhume the blowout preventer from the seafloor and break it down .
Still , economists are beginning to tally the costs of possible reforms .
A Washington - based think tank , Resources for the Future , released an analysis suggesting that if the United States brought deep - water safety regulations up to the stricter standards of nations such as Norway , the cost of a typical drilling project would rise about 10 % to 20 % .
That shakes out to less than half a cent per gallon at the pump .

Massive Snake Scales Fence in Brisbane
Duration : 00:42
While on a walk with her friend in Bowen Hills , an inner suburb of Brisbane , Juliana Lima da Silva spotted an impressive , slithery sight , as a giant carpet python climbed a fence right next to them on the pavement .
The snake was almost fully vertical as it scaled the net - covered fence , giving an amazing display of its sheer size .
Silva joked when posting video of her walk on the wild side that it was just “ another normal day in Australia ” .

* Enbridge had been warned by US in January on safety
* US regulators demand detailed plan before restart
* Officials say Lake Michigan not at risk from spill ( Recasts with corrective order from US regulators , earlier warnings to Enbridge from regulators , Enbridge comment )
DETROIT , July 29 ( Reuters ) - U.S. regulators have told Canada 's Enbridge ENB .
TO to detail a safety and repair plan for a failed oil pipeline in Michigan after warning in January the company appeared to be in violation of safety standards because it was not monitoring rust in the 41 - year - old - pipe .
The order from the U.S. Department of Transportation was sent on Wednesday and raises the stakes in an oil spill that sent sent some 19,500 barrels of crude into a Michigan river .
Separately , the Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday that the spilled oil did not appear to be a threat to the Great Lakes since the spill appeared to be contained about 50 miles inland from Lake Michigan by work crews with booms .
The Enbridge spill follows the devastating BP Plc BP.L spill in the Gulf of Mexico and has been watched with concern in part because of its threat to Lake Michigan , part of the largest supply of fresh water on the planet .
In its safety order , regulators told Enbridge that it will have to take a number of precautionary steps before the 286 - mile pipeline carrying oil from northern Indiana to Sarnia , Ontario can be restarted .
Those steps include digging up 100 feet of the failed pipeline in the oil - clogged marshes near Marshall , Michigan , submitting a safety plan for its renewed operation and holding pressure to 80 percent of capacity after a restart .
At its capacity , the pipeline flows at a rate of 190,000 barrels a day .
Enbridge will also have to tell the U.S. government how it will test the pipeline in the future to avoid accidents and detail every failure along its span for the past two decades .
In January , the Department of Transportation ’s pipeline regulatory arm had warned Enbridge that it appeared to be in “ probable violation ” of safety regulations .
It said then that its inspectors had found that the company had discontinued monitoring of corrosion in the pipeline in 2007 and was only in the planning stages of implementing a new method of checking the pipeline using an electrical imaging technology also used in mining .
‘A HUGE JOB IN FRONT OF US ’
Enbridge , which ships most of Canada ’s oil to the United states , said on Thursday it was working to dig up the damaged section of the oil pipeline .
That is the first step toward repairing the 30 - inch diameter pipe along the Talmadge Creek near Marshall .
Enbridge Chief Executive Patrick Daniel said the company was convinced that the was “ no further oil leaking , ” but he declined to give an estimate of when the repair work would be done and the pipeline would be cleared to resume operation .
“ We have a huge job in front of us .
There is no doubt about that , ” he said .
Enbridge said it had tested the failed section of the pipeline for corrosion and cracking in 2009 .
The area that leaked had not been identified out for repair , it said .
EPA officials overseeing the cleanup of an estimated 820,000 gallons of oil hoped to contain the damage at Morrow Lake , just east of Kalamazoo .
“ We do not anticipate that Lake Michigan is at risk , ” Ralph Dollhopf , the on-scene coordinator for the EPA told reporters .
Tom Sands , a Michigan state police captain overseeing Michigan ’s emergency response , said he had seen what appeared to be oil floating on the surface of Morrow Lake and challenged the EPA ’s account of its success .
“ I saw the sheen .
I photographed the sheen , ” he told reporters .
“ Did I test it ?
No . ”
Sands said he had reported to Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm that the early response to the spill appeared to be “ wholly inadequate ” to prevent the oil from heading further down the Kalamazoo River system toward Lake Michigan .
“ This is a serious situation and we need more resources , ” he said .
Granholm has declared a disaster for the area along the Kalamazoo River .
Local health officials said residents in about 100 homes along the Kalamazoo River near Battle Creek , Michigan had been warned to stop using their tap water because of fears of contamination from oil seeping into their wells .
Residents from another 50 houses near the worst of the pooled oil were being asked to evacuate because of the health risk from fumes .
Oil refineries that use crude from the pipeline have four to five days of stored supply , Daniel said , and are served by other pipelines .
US industrial titan General Electric has agreed to pay over 23 million dollars to settle allegations that it bribed Iraqi officials , a US financial watchdog said on Tuesday .
GE had been accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of being part of “ a 3.6 million dollar kickback scheme with Iraqi government agencies to win contracts to supply medical equipment and water purification equipment . ”

Four subsidiaries of the Connecticut - based company were accused of bribing officials at the Iraqi ministries of health and oil , trading cash , computer equipment and medical supplies to win lucrative contracts .
The SEC said the four GE units — two of which were not part of the firm when the alleged bribery took place — earned around 18.4 million dollars as a direct result of the kickbacks .
“ Bribes and kickbacks are bad business , period , ” said Robert Khuzami , the head of the SEC ’s Division of Enforcement .
“ This case affirms that law enforcement is active across the globe — offshore does not mean off - limits . ”
The contracts were linked to the UN ’s discredited “ oil - for - food ” program which allowed international firms to offer services paid for from Iraqi oil revenues .

An investigation later found that Iraqi officials had siphoned off around 1.7 billion in kickbacks from the contracts .
In a statement , GE said the “ conduct did not meet our standards . ”
“ We believe that it is in the best interests of GE and its shareholders to resolve this matter now , without admitting or denying the allegations , and put the matter behind us . ”
Once you ’ve been training more than a few years the need to deload on a somewhat regular basis becomes more and more prevalent .
How often you do so depends on your training age , strength levels and injury history .
Countless successful lifters have had great results by training hard for three weeks and deloading on the fourth week .
It ’s a pretty widely accepted formula and has been proven time and time again .
So there ’s really no need to try and reinvent the wheel .
Three weeks hard , one week deload is my standard go - to - recommendation .
There are other options , however , and if you have only been training for a couple of years you wo n’t need to worry about deloading just yet .
Beginners can go a few years without deloading .
Eventually you ’ll want to start with 12 weeks then work your way down to 10 and so on .
When you get a little more advanced some people might be able to go 6 - 8 weeks hard before deloading .
If you ’re more of an early intermediate lifter , eight weeks may be a better option for you .
If you ’re more advanced and go eight weeks you might want to consider deloading for two weeks .
But to keep things simple let ’s assume everyone is following the three to one rule .
That ’s the easiest thing to do since it fits nicely inside of a month .
I usually recommend reducing the total training volume per workout by 40 % .
So say you normally do 20 sets per workout ; on your deload week you would do 12 sets at each workout .
On big barbell exercises that you do for maximal strength like a bench , squat , dead , military I recommend cutting the weight to 50 % of your one rep max and just doing two sets of five .
So lets say your 1RM on the bench is 315 and the previous week you were doing 255 for sets of 6 - 8 , the deload week would be 155 ( or technically 157.5 ) for 2×5 .
The other option is to remove the lift all together for that week .
I like this option for experienced guys who have a mastery of the lift and / or are also beat up from years of heavy training .
The removal of the big barbell lift all together helps their joints recover .
You also may kind of “ lose the groove ” if you do this , if you are more inexperienced , so it ’s something you have to decide for yourself .
But I think the benefits of taking that week off of heavy barbell lifting usually outweigh the negatives .
You ’ll get back in the groove in not time the following week .
For assistance exercises you have two choices .
Intermediates should just do fewer sets but keep the intensity the same .
You could do the same weight as the previous week or even try to go up .
However , the intensiveness ( not what some people mistake as intensity ) should not be as high as the previous week .
This means that you need to give your CNS a break on your deload week and should n’t be going to failure or getting overly psyched up on anything .
For guys who have been training a while and are a bit beyond the intermediate level I recommend cutting the intensity by 20 - 40 % on assistance exercises .
So just take 20 - 40 % off all your weights .
If you did incline db presses for 10 reps with the 100’s on week three you would do 60 ’s - 80 ’s on your deload week .
The stronger / more advanced / more beat up and further along in a training cycle you are the greater the drop off % should be .
It also depends on the exercise .
If you ’re normally using 150 lbs on a 1 arm row I would want to drop that down by a full 40 % .
But if it was just something like a face pull or curl you could easily get away with just dropping it 20 % .
You would do the same number of reps as the previous week but just cut the sets .
The other option is to just take the week entirely off from heavy lifting .
I first did this back in the mid 90’s after a phone conversation with Ian King , and my results were awesome .
My recovery dramatically improved , my testosterone went up , I was sleeping better and I had fewer nagging injuries .
Like any good American I wanted more and got suckered into other stuff and got away from that for a while .
That was until I went to Nazareth Barbell one day for a visit and big Mike Miller told me that that ’s what they did .
Three weeks on of balls to the wall training , one week off entirely .
They went at it hard and absolutely killed it for three weeks , then they rested .
They were all monsters and I ’m pretty sure Mike was the first guy to squat 1200 .
So it was hard to argue .
I went back to it again and had some of my over 35 year old clients doing it and they were making great progress .
Like the stubborn , glutton for punishment knucklehead that I am I have yet again gotten away from that schedule but it does work incredibly well and should strongly be considered by all those over 40 who like to go heavy and balls deep like we do .
If all you do is some light bodyweight training or kettlebell stuff , deloading wo n’t be as important for you .
But if you like moving iron and do stuff that stresses your shoulders , spine , elbows , wrists , hips , knees and ankles regularly ( like military presses , squats , farmers walks , tire flips , deadlifts - ya know , all the fun stuff ) then I would highly suggest deloading regularly .
If the over 35 crowd does n’t want to take the week off entirely they should definitely at least reduce both the volume AND the intensity on their deload weeks .
Not doing so really is n’t even an option , in my opinion , because it will keep you in the game and healthy a lot longer .
Either you take the deload week and truly deload or you will be forced to deload due to an injury sooner or later .
Also , for the over 35 crowd I ca n’t recommend going more than 10 - 12 weeks without taking a complete week off entirely ; with once every 8 ( or fewer ) weeks being an even better option .
During these weeks you can stay active - walking , swimming , hiking , stretching , etc .
But no lifting .
Hopefully that gave you some good ideas about how to deload properly without being too confusing .
To sum it up …
– Reduce total # of sets by 40 %
– Reduce intensity on big lifts to 50 % of 1 RM or just eliminate them all together
– Reduce intensity on assistance work to 80 % of the previous weeks weight ( if that does n’t allow enough recovery drop the % down to 75 % the next cycle , and so on and so on until you decide what % works best for you )

Während der Deutschlandrat der Jungen Union Deutschland am vergangenen Woche „ Löschen statt Sperren “ gefordert hat , erklärt die Junge Union Berlin heute in einer Pressmeitteilung , dass sie die Einrichtung einer Netzzensur - Infrastruktur befürworten und gleich noch ein „ effektives Pornographieverbot für Jugendliche “ anstreben : Junge Union Berlin : „ Stoppt die Generation Porno !
Wir fordern ein Pornografieverbot im Internet ! “
Es ist völlig unverständlich wie viele Politikerinnen und Politiker ( auch der CDU / CSU ) tatenlos bleiben .
Anstatt mit aller Macht nach technischen Lösungen für die Eindämmung der Pornografie zu suchen , wird über die Meinungsfreiheit und Zensurfragen philosophiert .
Dazu passt , dass eine interne BKA - Studie , die der Zeitung „ Die Welt “ vorliegt , aufzeigt wie überfordert das BKA mit den derzeitigen Regelungen ist .
Die Löschungsbemühungen bei Kinderpornografie - Inhalten bleiben völlig wirkungslos .
Die Maxime „ Löschen statt Sperren “ scheint nicht zu wirken .
Wir haben als Junge Union auch lange gesagt , dass Sperrungen nutzlos , kontraproduktiv und zudem relativ leicht zu umgehen sind .
Aber das Gleiche scheint für die Löschungsversuche zu gelten .
Ein Umdenken muss her .
Wir brauchen die Sperrung von kinderpornografischen Inhalten , wir fordern die Einrichtung wirksamer Altersbeschränkungen gegen die Porno - Welle aus dem Internet , wir fordern Aufklärungsprogramme für Eltern und Kinder .
Ziel muss ein effektives Pornografieverbot für Jugendliche im Internet sein .
Update : OrderbyRand weist in den Kommentaren auf ein kleines Logikproblem in der Argumentation hin :
a : Sperren sind nutzlos
b : Löschen funktioniert nicht
c : Dann lieber sperren .
Lustig ist auch noch ein anderer Abschnitt aus der Pressemitteilung :
“ Die Politik schaut zu wie die Jugendlichen zuschauen , wenn Filme mit fast unvorstellbarem I nhalt laufen .
Pornografie ist immer frauenfeindlich , sie erhöht die Gewaltbereitschaft von Jugendlichen gegenüber anderen Menschen und sie verdirbt die sexuelle Entfaltung ”
Da werden sich erstmal die feministischen Filmemacherinnen nicht berücksichtigt fühlen , die Pornographie für Frauen machen ( das gleiche gilt auch für schwule Filmemacher ) und für den Kausalzusammenhang zwischen dem Schauen von Pornos und der erhöhten Gewaltbereitschaft möchte ich mal die wissenschaftliche Forschung sehen .
Colon Health Magazine Staff - Updated Oct 31 , 2015 By
It seems that these days everyone is looking for the best colon cleanse .
The benefits of colon cleansing are numerous , including weight loss , a boost in energy levels , clear skin and luscious hair , and an overall feeling of lightness or well being .
The results will vary from person to person , but it ’s a good idea to take a look at the different options that are out there in order to find the best colon cleanse for each individual .
Because there are so many different factors behind a backup in the colon of old waste , sometimes just one colon cleanse will not work .
One of the best colon cleanse options that you could start off with would be eliminating any harsh processed foods or other chemicals from the diet , including alcohol , caffeine , and refined sugars .
These should be replaced with high - fiber foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables , as well as whole grains and fibrous proteins such as beans .
That is a way to give the colon a little boost and help encourage stubborn waste material to bulk up into stools and pass through the system .
If possible , this is the best colon cleanse because it is safe , natural , and healthy .
The secondary type of Colon Cleansing product on the market today would be those that are laxative based .
The ingredients that are used to induce bowel movements tend to be botanical in nature , such as bromelain extract from pineapples , senna leaf , or other fruit enzymes .
This could be seen as the best colon cleanse because it quite literally flushes out the system .
When taking laxatives , however , it ’s important to remember that they are a short term solution , rather than a long term best colon cleanse for many .
It ’s also important to remember to drink a sufficient amount of water when using any laxative - based supplements , to keep the body well hydrated and the colon lubricated .
A third type of best colon cleanse would be those products that contain pro-biotic ingredients .
By introducing more “ good ” bacteria into the digestive system , it ’s possible to create a healthier balance within the colon .
This then allows it to perform at a higher level of productivity , and improves digestion in general .
These pro-biotics , such as those found in yogurt like acidophilus , provide a variety of functions .
They help boost the immune system as well .
That is why this is commonly seen as one of the best colon cleanse ingredients or components .

This is interesting , if not very surprising : A new study by professors at Harvard , Rice and the University of Utah found a direct correlation between CEO compensation and CEO “ meanness . ”
That is , the higher the chief executive salary , the more of a not nice person he or she becomes .
In the words of the study ’s authors , “ We claim that higher income inequality between executives and ordinary workers results in executives perceiving themselves as being all - powerful and this perception of power leads them to maltreat rank and file workers . ”
Makes sense to me .
( God ’s work , anyone ? )
In addition to providing data to back up their claim that execs get nastier and their heads inflate to the size of a Mardis Gras papier - mache mask when they make more money , the authors offer some solutions ( namely to reduce CEO pay ) and , in doing so , they point out that many modern business and executive compensation luminaries , including Plato , Aristotle and J.P. Morgan , believed that executive comp should be a capped at a certain multiple of the rank - and - file wage .
“ Plato is known , ” the authors write , “ to have remarked that the highest paid worker in an economy ought not to make more than five times the pay earned by the lowest paid worker .
Aristotle thought likewise and cautioned that inequality , if not reigned in , will cause lower members of the economy to revolt …
Taking his cue from Plato , J.P. Morgan declared that top executives ’ compensation should be capped at twenty times the wage of an average worker . ”
However , the authors concede that a pay cap in this day in age ( when the rule and not the exception on the Street is , “ If at first you do n’t receive the seven - figure guaranteed bonus you believe you deserve , then try , try another firm ” ) will likely never work .
Which is why they pose something else : tax reform .
Specifically , the authors believe that tax loopholes ( such as the one that requires private equity principals and hedge fund managers to only pay a 15 percent capital gains tax rate on their income as opposed to the normal 35 percent ) should be closed .
Another idea posed in the white paper is to require that executives hand over a portion of their compensation to charity .
In other words , in addition to supporting the rights of the rank and file , the authors do n’t sit on the right side of the aisle .

I can think of two spaces in Texas that put me at risk of hypothermia : Rothko Chapel in Houston , and Tending , ( Blue ) in Dallas .
I ’ve visited both .
I ’ve sat silently inside their cold mouths and , in both spaces , felt a pang of gratitude for finally being spit out into warm air .
Rothko Chapel :
Tending , ( Blue ) :
But these spaces are n’t cold in the same way that climate - controlled homes of suburbia are cold .
In fact , Tending , ( Blue ) is open - aired .
James Turrell , the artist , considered it a skyspace .
I walked through these frosty glass doors and down a purple - lit hall that funnelled me into an inner sanctum with canted stone walls making up the 4 sides of a square .
The walls also served as a bench .
I sat down and leaned back and looked up through a smaller square - cutout in the ceiling :
Beyond this aperture , the sky :
James Turrell intended this piece to be slowly digested .
He has a problem with the idea that people spend a few seconds in front of a masterpiece hanging in a museum and then move on to another work .
Turrell wants his art to be lived .
And , to that extent , he succeeded magnificently in Tending , ( Blue ) .
I sat on that stone bench longer than I ’ve looked at most art .
And I had some deep thoughts .
DEEP THOUGHTS : What happens when it rains or snows in Dallas ?
How often do they clean this place ?
What would my scream sound like beyond the aperture ?
If the walls were narrower , there would be a time of day when the sun would shine directly onto the floor , mercilessly .
Is n’t there a form of torture where people are forced to sit under the venomous sun in a confined space , without respite , until their skin boils ?
It would be nice to be here at night with my girl .
Is the angle right ?
Have they ever had concerts in here ?
I imagine a violin would sound pretty .
Or are the acoustics not that great ?
Me and my girl and a cherry violin .
But not even the company of this last thought could keep my brain from feeling deep isolation .
Melancholy flooded the chamber .
I looked around at all of the bare rock and did n’t like the way I could n’t breathe .
There was something unclear about Turrell ’s art .
Something like a big fat WHY ?
This place felt cultish .
This place felt too extreme for balance .
I teetered .
I rubbed my arms to kindle warmth .
Then I got up and got on with the rest of my life .
Before visiting Tending , ( Blue ) , I visited Rothko Chapel several times .
I grew up with an inexplicable affinity for Mark Rothko :
His colors gave me color .
I do n’t think I ever got much out of his artwork other than a sense of color and emotion and how the two are inextricably linked and can clash like warm and cold fronts in the weather system .
At the very least , Rothko , give me some color !
Do n’t take color away from me , like you do inside Rothko Chapel :
This is Mark Rothko ’s idea of non-denominational art .
Massive black canvases with a muted color hue .
I applaud the eyes who can see anything other than depression in this dreadfully cold space .
I forced myself to sit down on one of the benches .
I tried to give the space a chance to communicate .
I looked up at the oculus and had some deep thoughts .
DEEP THOUGHTS : The use of natural light is pretty neat .
I like the way it ’s splayed into 8 beams .
An octagon : the shape of a stop sign .
It ’s as if this hunk of concrete were saying , Light , stop !
But Light wo n’t listen .
Light does what it wants .
Light is protean .
It is shapeshifting .
It is divine .
And what about that gigantic black painting in front of me ?
And what about that other gigantic black painting ?
And what about that gigantic black painting over there ?
Is Rothko trying to tell me something ?
Do all people who come here to meditate or pray or worship before these canvases realize that true Light comes from the sun and not manmade creations ?
Is Rothko forcing me to follow the only true Light there is instead of some manmade religion or art ?
Then I got terribly cold .
I rubbed my arms to kindle warmth .
I tied my shoelace and hurried outside .
The Russian abstract painter died a year before the completion of Rothko Chapel .
He committed suicide in his kitchen .
A response to deep - seeded depression .

Fifteen years after the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women ’s Beijing Platform for Action proclaimed that “ shared power and responsibility should be established between women and men at home , in the workplace and in the wider national and international communities , ” people around the globe embrace the document ’s key principles .
Almost everywhere , solid majorities express support for gender equality and agree that women should be able to work outside the home .
Most also find a marriage in which both spouses share financial and household responsibilities to be more satisfying than one in which the husband provides for the family and the wife takes care of the house and children .
In addition , majorities in most countries reject the notion that higher education is more important for a boy than for a girl .
Yet , despite a general consensus that women should have the same rights as men , people in many countries around the world say gender inequalities persist in their countries .
Many say that men get more opportunities than equally qualified women for jobs that pay well and that life is generally better for men than it is for women in their countries .
This is especially so in some of the wealthier nations surveyed .
And while majorities in nearly every country surveyed express support for gender equality , equal rights supporters in most countries say that more changes are needed to ensure that women have the same rights as men .
These are among the findings of a 22 - nation survey by the Pew Research Center ’s Global Attitudes Project , conducted April 7 to May 8 .
This special in - depth look at views on gender equality , done in association with the International Herald Tribune , also suggests that , while egalitarian sentiments are pervasive , they are less than robust ; when economically challenging times arise , many feel men should be given preferential treatment over women in the search for employment .
This is especially true in the predominantly Muslim countries surveyed as well as in India , China , South Korea and Nigeria .
In these countries , solid majorities agree that women should be able to work outside the home ; yet , most also agree that men should have more right to a job than women when jobs are scarce .
For example , about six - in - ten in Egypt ( 61 % ) and Jordan ( 58 % ) say women should have the right to work outside the home , but even larger shares ( 75 % and 68 % , respectively ) say the priority should be for men to have jobs .
In some countries , male respondents are considerably more likely than female respondents to agree that men should have more right to a job than women when jobs are scarce .
For example , about nine - in - ten Egyptian men ( 92 % ) share this view , compared with 58 % of Egyptian women .
Similarly , while about three - quarters of Jordanian men ( 77 % ) say their sex should be more entitled to a job in tough economic times , a much slimmer majority of Jordanian women ( 56 % ) say the same .
Men and women also frequently offer diverging views on other aspects of gender equality , including a woman ’s right to work outside the home and the importance of higher education for boys and girls ; this gender gap is evident most consistently in the predominantly Muslim countries surveyed .
The survey also finds that women are far more likely than men to perceive gender inequalities .
By double - digit margins , female respondents in 13 of 22 nations are more likely than male respondents to say men in their countries have the better life .
And in most countries where majorities among both men and women agree that men get more opportunities than women for high - paying jobs , women are considerably more likely to say they completely agree that is the case .
Widespread Support for Equal Rights
Solid majorities in virtually every country surveyed say that women should have the same rights as men .
This opinion is nearly unanimous in Western European and Latin American countries , as well as in the U.S. , Poland , Lebanon , China , India , and South Korea ; at least nine - in - ten men and women in these countries express support for gender equality .
In Egypt , where six - in - ten say the two sexes should have the same rights , men and women offer widely different views .
About three - quarters ( 76 % ) of Egyptian women support gender equality , while Egyptian men are nearly evenly divided – 45 % say women and men should have equal rights and 47 % disagree .
Double - digit gender gaps are also evident in Jordan , Indonesia , Pakistan and Kenya ; still , majorities among both men and women in those countries agree that women should have the same rights as men .
Only in Nigeria does a majority ( 54 % ) reject the idea that women and men should have equal rights .
This primarily reflects the views of Nigerian men ; 65 % say women should not have the same rights as men , while just 35 % say they should .
In contrast , a majority of Nigerian women ( 56 % ) endorse equality , although a substantive minority ( 44 % ) does not .
Vast Support for Women Working Outside the Home
Majorities in every country polled agree that women should be able to work outside the home .
In 17 of the 22 countries , most say they completely agree with this assertion , including at least three - quarters in Brazil ( 88 % ) , Britain ( 84 % ) , the U.S. ( 81 % ) and Germany ( 79 % ) .
Support for a woman ’s right to work outside the home has increased since 2002 in four of the six countries for which trends exist .
For example , 95 % of Turks currently subscribe to the idea that women should be able to work outside the home while 85 % did so earlier in the decade ; support for this view is also more widespread since 2002 in Nigeria ( +10 percentage points ) , Pakistan ( +9 points ) and Indonesia ( +8 points ) , while Jordanian and Lebanese views have shown little change .
In a number of countries where the majority thinks women should be able to work outside the home , women are even more likely than men to strongly support this idea ; this is particularly the case in some of the predominantly Muslim countries surveyed .
For example , while 65 % of women in Pakistan completely agree that women should have the option to work outside the home , only 31 % of Pakistani men hold the same view .
Similarly , while about one - third of women in Egypt ( 36 % ) and Jordan ( 34 % ) completely agree that women should be able to work outside the home , only about one - in - ten men in these countries embrace the same opinion .
Significant gender differences also exist in South Korea , Kenya , Spain , Lebanon and Indonesia .
In Lebanon and Nigeria , views also differ along religious and sectarian lines .
More Lebanese Sunnis ( 75 % ) and Christians ( 73 % ) completely agree that women should be able to work outside the home than do Lebanese Shia ( 63 % ) .
The gap is far larger in Nigeria where 73 % of Christians are in complete agreement with the notion of a working role for women compared with 43 % of Nigerian Muslims .
Egalitarian Marriage Seen as More Satisfying
In 19 of 22 countries , majorities say that a marriage where both husband and wife have jobs and take care of the house and children is a more satisfying way of life than having the husband provide financially while the wife cares for the household .
This view is particularly widespread in Western Europe , where more than eight - in - ten in France ( 91 % ) , Spain ( 91 % ) and Germany ( 85 % ) agree that the preferred marital model is one where husband and wife share a family ’s financial burden as well as the household and child care responsibilities .
More than eight - in - ten in Brazil ( 84 % ) and Kenya ( 81 % ) and at least three - quarters in China ( 78 % ) and Mexico ( 76 % ) share this view .
Across predominantly Muslim countries , support for both spouses working is mixed .
About nine - in - ten in Lebanon ( 92 % ) favor a double - income household and an egalitarian approach to tasks at home , as do 72 % in Turkey .
In Indonesia , the majority in favor of dual workers both inside and outside the home is narrower ( 56 % ) , with 43 % of Indonesians saying that a marriage where the husband provides for the family and the wife takes care of the house and children is preferable .
Egyptians and Jordanians are more divided ; 48 % and 47 % , respectively , embrace the egalitarian approach to marriage , while about four - in - ten ( 38 % in Egypt and 40 % in Jordan ) choose a more traditional arrangement .
In contrast , Pakistanis are overwhelmingly of the opinion that a marriage where the husband bears the financial responsibility while the wife cares for the house and children is more satisfying ; nearly eight - in - ten ( 79 % ) share this view , compared with just 18 % of Pakistanis who favor a non-traditional approach .
Views of marriage have become more egalitarian since earlier in the decade in seven of the 19 countries for which trends are available .
This change has been especially dramatic in Jordan , where the balance of opinion has shifted since 2002 ; then , 37 % of Jordanians opted for a more egalitarian approach , compared with the nearly half who do so now .
In Russia , Poland , Lebanon , Mexico and the U.S. , where majorities already expressed a preference for a more non-traditional marriage arrangement in 2002 , even more say that is the case today .
For example , about three - quarters ( 74 % ) of Russians now say that a marriage where the husband and wife both have jobs and share household responsibilities is preferable , compared with 56 % in 2002 .
Similarly , in the U.S. , 71 % now hold this view , compared with 58 % earlier in the decade .
In Poland , where the change since 2002 has been less pronounced , opinion has shifted dramatically since 1991 ; currently , 68 % say an egalitarian marriage is more satisfying , compared with 60 % in 2002 and just 41 % nearly two decades ago .
French and German views of marriage are largely unchanged from 2002 , but far more in these countries – as well as in Spain , which was not surveyed in 2002 – support a more egalitarian approach to marriage than did so in 1991 .
Nearly two decades ago , 67 % in Spain , 64 % in France and 58 % in Germany found a marriage where the husband and wife both had jobs and took care of the house and children to be more satisfying than one where the husband provided for the family while the wife took care of the household ; today , 91 % in Spain and France and 85 % in Germany share this view .
In China , Pakistan and Nigeria , however , views of marriage have become more traditional since 2002 .
In Pakistan , the share who say a marriage where the husband works outside the home while the wife takes care of the house and children is a better way of life has increased by 16 percentage points from 63 % in 2002 to 79 % today .
In Nigeria , where fewer now say they prefer an egalitarian marriage than did so in 2002 ( 61 % vs. 78 % ) , the decline in support for this approach to marriage primarily reflects a change in opinion among Muslims .
Currently , 47 % of Nigerian Muslims say a marriage where both husband and wife have a job and take care of the house and children is preferable ; 70 % expressed this view in 2002 .
Changes have been less pronounced among Nigerian Christians – about three - quarters ( 74 % ) favor an egalitarian approach to marriage , compared with 85 % earlier in the decade .
Across most of the countries surveyed , opinions about what type of marriage brings the most satisfaction vary little , if at all , between male and female respondents .
In the predominantly Muslim countries of Jordan , Egypt , Pakistan and Turkey as well as in South Korea , however , more women than men favor an egalitarian approach .
For example , roughly six - in - ten women in Jordan ( 59 % ) and Egypt ( 58 % ) take an egalitarian view , compared with just under four - in - ten men in these countries ( 36 % in Jordan and 38 % in Egypt ) .
Preferential Treatment for Men in Tough Economic Times
Publics across the countries surveyed offer mixed views on whether men should have more of a right to a job than women during tough economic times .
Majorities in 11 of 22 countries surveyed reject this idea , and this is particularly true in the U.S. and Western Europe .
In Nigeria as well as in many Asian and predominantly Muslim countries , however , most respondents say that men should receive preferential treatment when jobs are scarce .
At least eight - in - ten in Spain ( 87 % ) , Britain ( 85 % ) , the U.S. ( 85 % ) , France ( 80 % ) and Germany ( 80 % ) disagree that in tough economic times , men should have more right to a job than women .
Majorities in Mexico ( 69 % ) , Brazil ( 63 % ) , Argentina ( 56 % ) , Kenya ( 53 % ) and Poland ( 51 % ) also reject this notion .
In contrast , the view that men should have more of a right to a job than women during tough economic times is prevalent in nine of the countries surveyed .
At least seven - in - ten in India ( 84 % ) , Pakistan ( 82 % ) , Nigeria ( 77 % ) , Egypt ( 75 % ) , Indonesia ( 74 % ) and China ( 73 % ) subscribe to this idea .
About two - thirds in the predominantly Muslim countries of Jordan ( 68 % ) and Turkey ( 67 % ) as well as 60 % in South Korea also say that men are more entitled to a job than women when jobs are scarce .
Opinions are more mixed in Lebanon and Russia , where about as many agree ( 51 % and 47 % , respectively ) as disagree ( 49 % in each country ) with the notion that men should have more right to a job than women in tough economic times .
Lebanese views split along religious and sectarian lines ; a majority ( 58 % ) of Sunni Muslims in that country say men should receive preferential treatment when jobs are scarce , while most Lebanese Christians ( 63 % ) reject this notion .
Shia Muslims are divided – 48 % agree and 52 % disagree that men should have more of a right to a job than women when times are tough .
In many countries , men are more likely than women to agree with the idea that men should receive preferential treatment for jobs in tough economic times .
This is particularly true in Egypt ; 91 % of men feel they should have more right to a job than women when jobs are scarce while 58 % of women hold the same opinion .
While less pronounced , a similar pattern also exists in Jordan , Russia , Kenya , Nigeria , South Korea , Poland , Indonesia and Lebanon .
In Japan , the opposite pattern in gender differences is evident ; women ( 48 % ) are more likely than men ( 33 % ) to agree that men should receive preferential treatment for jobs in challenging times .
Support for Educating Boys and Girls
Publics in 18 of 22 countries disagree with the notion that a university education is more important for a boy than for a girl .
And in 10 of these countries , many strongly reject this idea ; majorities in Lebanon ( 84 % ) , Brazil ( 78 % ) , Argentina ( 72 % ) , Britain ( 71 % ) , France ( 70 % ) , Mexico ( 65 % ) , Germany ( 64 % ) , Spain ( 62 % ) , the U.S. ( 60 % ) , and Kenya ( 59 % ) completely disagree that is it more important for a boy to receive a university education .
Still , a solid majority in India ( 63 % ) and about half in Pakistan ( 51 % ) , Egypt ( 50 % ) and China ( 48 % ) say that a university education is more important for a boy than for a girl , and sizeable minorities in several countries agree .
For example , in Jordan , 44 % agree that it is more important for a boy than a girl to get a college education ; about one - third in Japan ( 35 % ) , Poland ( 34 % ) and Nigeria ( 34 % ) also embrace this view .
Nigerian opinion is split along religious lines .
A solid majority ( 81 % ) of Christians in that country disagree that a college education is more important for a boy than for a girl .
In contrast , Nigerian Muslims are nearly evenly divided ; 50 % agree and 49 % disagree .
Muslim men and women in Nigeria offer opposing views – nearly six - in - ten ( 59 % ) Muslim men agree that it is more important for boys to receive a college education , while 60 % of Muslim women in Nigeria disagree .
A considerable gender gap in views of whether a university education is more important for boys than for girls is also evident in four of the six predominantly Muslim countries surveyed .
Majorities of men in Egypt and Jordan say it is more important for a boy to receive a university education ( 60 % and 56 % , respectively ) ; 60 % of women in Egypt and 67 % in Jordan disagree .
In Pakistan , where more than twice as many men agree ( 64 % ) as disagree ( 30 % ) that a university education is more important for boys than it is for girls , about half ( 48 % ) of women disagree and 36 % agree .
The gender divide is somewhat less pronounced in Turkey .
While most among both sexes in that country reject the idea that a post - secondary education is of greater importance for a boy than a girl , more women ( 77 % ) than men ( 62 % ) subscribe to an egalitarian approach to education .
In some countries where overwhelming majorities disagree that a university education is more important for a boy than for a girl , women are considerably more likely than men to say they completely disagree .
This is especially true in the U.S. – seven - in - ten women completely disagree that it is more important for a boy to receive a university education , compared with just about half ( 49 % ) of American men .
Women in Argentina and in all four Western European nations surveyed are also more likely than men in those countries to strongly reject the notion that it is more important for a boy to get a college education than a girl .
Wearing a Veil
In four of the seven countries where the question was asked , clear majorities of Muslims say that women should have the right to decide if they wear a veil .
This view is most widespread in Turkey , Indonesia and Lebanon .
In Turkey , where a ban on veils in civic spaces and government buildings remains , support for a woman ’s right to decide whether she wears a veil is nearly universal and intensely held ; 96 % of Muslims in Turkey agree that women should have the right to determine if they wear a head cover , including seven - in - ten who completely agree that women should have this right .
In Indonesia , where national law makes wearing a veil optional in all but the autonomous province of Aceh , an overwhelming majority of Muslims ( 92 % ) believe women should have the right to decide if they cover their heads .
Similarly , 89 % of Lebanese Muslims feel women should determine whether or not to don a veil .
A solid majority of Muslims in Pakistan ( 65 % ) also support a woman ’s right to choose whether to cover her head .
In contrast , Egyptian and Jordanian Muslims are divided .
Roughly half of Muslims in Egypt ( 51 % ) and Jordan ( 48 % ) agree that women should be able to determine if they wear a head scarf while roughly half in both countries disagree ( 48 % in Egypt and 50 % in Jordan ) .
In Jordan , support for giving women this right has declined substantially since 2008 , when about six - in - ten Muslims ( 59 % ) said women should have the right to decide if they were a veil .
Nigerian Muslims are the only ones who are more inclined to disagree ( 53 % ) than agree ( 45 % ) that women should have the right to decide if they wear a head scarf .
However , Nigerian Muslim opposition to a woman ’s right to choose whether to don a veil is down from 2008 , when 64 % disagreed that women should have this right .
In four of the seven countries , Muslim women are more likely than Muslim men to support a woman ’s right to choose whether to wear a head scarf .
For example , while 83 % of Muslim women in Pakistan agree that women should have the right to decide if they wear a veil , only 47 % of Muslim Pakistani men embrace the same view .
A similar gender divide exists in Jordan , Egypt and Nigeria .
Achieving Equal Rights
When respondents who favor gender equality are asked whether their country has made most of the changes needed to give women equal rights with men or if more changes are needed to achieve that goal , majorities in 18 of 22 countries say the latter .
At least eight - in - ten equal rights supporters in Japan ( 89 % ) , Brazil ( 84 % ) , France ( 82 % ) and Spain ( 80 % ) say their countries need to continue making changes to ensure that women have the same rights as men .
This view is shared nearly equally among both genders in Japan , Brazil and France ; in Spain , women are considerably more likely than men to say that more changes need to be made ( 86 % vs. 74 % ) .
Female respondents in the U.S. , Britain and Germany also offer far more negative assessments of their countries ’ progress on gender equality than do male respondents .
About seven - in - ten American ( 72 % ) and German ( 70 % ) women who support equality say their countries need to effect more changes to give women the same rights as men ; a much slimmer majority of men in both countries ( 55 % ) say that is the case .
The gender gap is somewhat narrower in Britain – three - quarters of women who favor equal rights say their country still has work to do , and 62 % of men agree .
Positive perceptions of how much progress their countries have made in achieving gender equality are more prevalent among equal rights supporters in Jordan , Indonesia , India and China ; more than half in those countries say that most of the changes needed to ensure this goal have already been made .
In Indonesia , more men ( 64 % ) than women ( 53 % ) believe such changes have been brought about .
Who Has a Better Life ?
Opinions about who has a better life – men or women –are mixed .
In 10 of 22 nations , majorities or pluralities say that , all things considered , men have the better life in their countries .
In 10 others , more volunteer that there is no difference than say that life is better for one sex than the other .
Only in Japan and South Korea do pluralities say that life is better for women in their countries ( 47 % and 49 % , respectively ) .
The view that men have the better life is particularly widespread in France ; three - quarters in that country say that is the case , compared with just 14 % who say life is better for women and 9 % who volunteer that there is no difference .
A majority ( 55 % ) in Poland shares the view that men have the better life in their country , as do solid pluralities in the U.S. , Germany , Spain , India , Brazil and Nigeria .
Majorities or pluralities in the six predominantly Muslim nations surveyed volunteer that life is the same for men and women in their countries .
More than half in Mexico ( 56 % ) and Russia ( 52 % ) and at least four - in - ten in China ( 49 % ) and Argentina ( 46 % ) share this view .
Across much of the world , female respondents are considerably more likely than male respondents to say that men have the better life in their country .
This is especially true in Turkey and Spain .
More than four - in - ten Turkish women ( 46 % ) say men have it better in their country , while 16 % say women do , and 36 % say there is no difference ; among Turkish men , however , just 19 % say their sex has the better life , while 38 % say women have it better and 40 % say there is no difference .
Many See Inequality in Job Opportunities
The view that men get more opportunities than women for jobs that pay well , even when women are as qualified for the job , is widespread in most of the countries surveyed , particularly those that are wealthy or have recently experienced substantial economic growth .
At least eight - in - ten in Germany ( 84 % ) , France ( 80 % ) and Japan ( 80 % ) as well as about seven - in - ten in South Korea ( 70 % ) , Britain ( 70 % ) , the U.S. ( 68 % ) , and Spain ( 68 % ) say men get more opportunities for high - paying jobs .
Similarly strong majorities in Poland ( 83 % ) , India ( 83 % ) and China ( 73 % ) say that is the case .
In contrast , many in predominantly Muslim publics reject the notion that men get more job opportunities than women .
More than half in Lebanon ( 70 % ) , Egypt ( 54 % ) and Indonesia ( 53 % ) , as well as a 49 % - plurality in Jordan , disagree that men get more opportunities than women for high - paying jobs .
This opinion is also prevalent in Mexico , where 55 % disagree and 43 % agree that job opportunities are more widely available to men than to women .
In many countries where the view that men get more job opportunities than women predominates , female respondents are more likely than male respondents to say that is the case ; in particular , women in those countries are often more inclined than men to completely agree that there is gender inequality in employment opportunities .
For example , about six - in - ten women in France ( 61 % ) and Germany ( 60 % ) completely agree that men get more opportunities than women for jobs that pay well ; in contrast , 37 % of men in France and 39 % in Germany are in complete agreement .
Tonight the President will talk to the nation about the oil disaster that has been going on in the Gulf of Mexico for over a month .
That will likely be the news story of the night , followed by the answers to the five questions that lawmakers have of BP .
By that time I will also be starting a daily visit to the National Hurricane Center to see if there are any signs of coming problems .
All of which being said , now might be a good time to talk about erosion , how it is changing the Deepwater Horizon well conditions , and why precautions about the flow increasing are probably wise .
And I am going to recap bits of an old Tech Talk , as I do so .
( It ’s partly why they are there . )
To begin with a simple point – fluid ( oil and gas ) will only move from one place to another if something is pushing it .
( Newton ’s first law ) .
For the fluid in the reservoir under the Gulf , this force pushing the oil out is the difference in pressure between the oil in the rock , and the pressure in the well .
The pressure of the oil in the rock is 12,000 psi .
When the well was drilled the pressure of the mud that filled the well was over 13,000 psi and no oil moved into the well .
Just before the disaster the fluid in the well was changed from mud to seawater .
This lowered the pressure of the fluid in the well below that of the fluid in the rock , a differential pressure now existed , and where there was a passage through which the oil and gas could flow , and they did .
The question has always been – how much ?
Gas flows more easily through cracks than oil , and the disaster was first evident when leaking gas reached the drilling rig , and then ignited .
The BOP then , at least partially , functioned .
After the rig sank , the riser also sank , bending the pipe just above the BOP .
At that time there were reports that a Coast Guard ROV examined the underwater assembly and did not see any obvious oil leaks .
A couple of days later the flow was suggested at about 1,000 bd , and this then escalated to 5,000 bd .
As cameras began to publicly monitor the outlet of the riser the estimates started to grow , but a not - well - publicized effort measured the flow out of the riser , and found that it was around 8,000 bd , with allowance for leaks , the overall flow was estimated to be perhaps 12,000 bd .
Once the broken part of the riser was removed and a cap placed over the well , a significant portion of the escaping oil was captured and could then be measured as it flowed into the surface vessel recovering it .
Those values are currently at around 15,500 bd.
BP is currently planning on additional capture this week of up to another 10,000 bd , and preparing for a worst case scenario with a flow rate of 80,000 bd .
These numbers vary a lot , and yet they could all be correct .
Why ?
Well , its called erosion , and simply put , the oil and gas that are flowing out of the rock are bringing small amounts of that rock ( in the form of sand ) out with them .
Rocks that contain lots of oil are not that strong and are easily worn away by the flow of fluid through them .
Let me make an analogy with soil .
If I make a hill of soil , and leave it sit for a while there will be a number of rainstorms fall on the soil .
Initially the surface will all erode relatively evenly under the diffused flow after the rain , but very quickly weaker parts of the soil will be removed faster and instead of a smooth surface , the soil will be selectively eroded and channels or rills will start to form on the surface .
Hillside rill channels formed as initially diffuse rainwater water flow concentrates and erodes channels
These are larger than the passageways around the individual grains of soil , and so it is easier for the water to flow in these channels , and so more water collects in them and moves through them .
As it does , because the fluid can easily get around the soil particles , and this was a weaker area already , more soil is removed , and the channels get deeper .
This is known as concentrating the flow and means that , over time the channels grow bigger , the fluid flows faster , and it has a greater potential for erosion .
This also happens when oil and gas start to flow from a reservoir .
It is generally not a good thing to allow , since the sand is still in the oil and gas when it reaches the surface and it is expensive to get out – as well as causing the problems I am about to talk about .
So to stop it , the well is fitted with a screen when it is first opened .
The screen holds the rock particles ( sand ) in place around the well , slowing if not completely stopping the creation of the channels .
But sometimes , the deposit does n’t flow very well , the oil may be heavier , or there may be other reasons , and in this case allowing those channels to develop can help production .
This technique is known as CHOPS – Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand .
( The report cited is a multi- chapter pdf ) .
The impact of allowing the sand to flow with the oil and gas ( to be produced in the terminology ) is very significant .
Simplified change in production from a well with the sand being produced ( upper curve ) relative to conventional flow ( lower curve ) .
( The curves have been smoothed and only a sample of the “ noisy ” data is shown ) .
Government of Alberta CHOPS Report
There is thus a very good reason , from the oil in the rock point of view , for the production to have been increasing the way that it has .
And for it to increase to the levels that BP are taking precautions to capture .
And because they cannot get access to the flow channels to restrain their growth and hold the sand until the relief wells are drilled that increase may well be unavoidable .
Now to the second part of the puzzle , which is what that sand does to the flow passages .
The DOE release of some of the documents from BP included pressure measurements at different points along the BOP as taken on the 25th of May .
Pressures along the BOP on May 25th ( DOE )
Because of the erosion , values only exist transiently , so dates become important .
When I cut with an abrasive slurry system , the jet flows through a nozzle that is about 1 mm in diameter ( 0.04 inches ) .
With a pressure drop of 5,000 psi across the nozzle , that jet , once formed , will cut through casing steel in around 15 seconds .
It will cut through ASTM – A108 steel to a depth of over an inch at a traverse speed of 1.5 inches a minute .
( Cement is much easier to cut ) .
In this way very small initial openings are very easily made wider , to allow a greater volume flow .
( And for those who assert that changing material properties will stop erosion , one of my upcoming papers deals with what happens to diamond . )
The pressures across the BOP do n’t show the pressure drops that they did earlier in this disaster .
At one time it was reported that the pressure below the BOP was in the 8-9,000 psi range and that above it 2,800 psi with the 2,250 psi pressure being that of the seawater outside the riser .
At that time I calculated that a flow of 500 gallons per minute ( 17,000 bd ) would only require a gap in the range of 0.5 to 0.7 inches in effective diameter to allow that flow , at that pressure drop .
The pressure below the BOP is now at 4,400 psi with a pressure drop of around 2,150 psi which will slow the erosion significantly – but not totally .
For that pressure drop to have occurred , for the same flow rate , the effective equivalent diameter through the BOP need only increase by 0.1 inches to 0.8 inches , which is not a lot .
Were the effective diameter to increase by only another 0.15 inches the flow would increase to 25,000 bd , and if the effective diameter were to double to about 1.7 inches , then the flow would reach the maximum capacity that BP will be able to handle of 80,000 bd .
Given the steady erosion that the BOP is seeing , and the fact that a slow erosion rate over time still gets to a large enough diameter , perhaps it is not foolish of BP to bring in that additional capture and storage capacity .
And since a picture sometimes helps , the following picture shows a single ASJ jet at 5,000 psi cutting the walls of the OmniMax Theater under the Gateway Arch in St Louis .
We cut the full 15 ft of the new wall exposure with the system ( to make the hole for the theater to be put into ) .
The jet flow rate was around 5 gpm .
And this was the cut after a single pass , we were cutting about 18 inches deep on a cut ( rock and cement cut a lot easier than metal – though we accidentally ran over a couple of those bolts and cut them right off ) .
Dolomite and chert cut with an ASJ in the walls of the Omnimax Theater under the Arch in St Louis .
( Its all hidden behind the concrete wall now ) .
Now you will notice that this says nothing about those ideas such as that propounded by Dougr that the casing has been cracked and oil is escaping into the surrounding rock . , and that the casing is becoming a lot weaker .
There are two reasons for this , firstly if there was a crack , in the same way as with the BOP , then over time that would have been eaten away as oil , gas and mud flowed through it .
Once a flow starts it will rapidly eat out a larger passage , as the above has demonstrated .
Once that passage was created then oil flow through it to the surface would make it impossible to see what was going on around the well ( look at the cloud above the BOP ) .
In fact there are very clear pictures from under the BOP .
This would seem to show that there is no oil leaking there at present .
The other thing to remember is that BP are planning on using the second LMRP cap effectively as a seal on the well .
They could not do that if the upper segments of the casing were damaged , and I imagine that they have enough data from the Top Kill testing to reassure themselves of that .

People on twitter are just too much fun .
Some of the people that I see and interact with just make me laugh myself silly at times … and at other times they make me want to smash my head into the wall .
The truth is that there is really a wide range of personality types floating around in the twitter - sphere .
Some of them are obnoxious and some of them are really obnoxious .
Although there are far more than five personalities found on Twitter , I ’ve decided to sum up the vast majority of Twitter users into the following five categories .
The All - Knowing Guru
Twitter is flooded with Gurus .
In their eyes , they are the go - to source for all knowledge related to their field of expertise .
They know EVERYTHING about it and they can provide you with irrefutable advice on anything related to their subject matter .
Do n’t question their advice .
It is right …. always .
Often these gurus are brand new to their respective niches but do n’t let that disillusion you as to their level of expertise .
They know exactly what they are talking about and they wo n’t stand to have you or anyone else challenge their authority on anything .
The Hyper- Motivational Life Coach
This tweeter ’s sole existence is to inspire , motivate and transform the way that you live life .
They want to fill you with passion .
They want to put a smile on your face .
They want to challenge you be better , stronger and faster .
You will hear absolutely nothing negative from this person .
They will fill their time - line with inspirational quotes , cheerful greetings , and fun challenges .
The Autonomous Robot
This avid Twitter user pushes dozens , if not hundreds , of tweets per day through their time - line with only one small problem … they are all automatically generated .
They are promoting links to their blog , website or product or they are filled with advertisements .
With as much spam as they ’re putting out , they need to be careful not to be sued by Hormel Foods for copyright infringements .
Do n’t bother sending them a message or a mention because they wo n’t notice it .
They ’re probably out on the lake fishing or in the gym playing basketball .
The one place there not at …looking at their auto - generated twitter stream .
That ’s what you ’re doing … not them .
The Shameless Self - Promoter
This person has nothing to say to you .
Well … nothing worth listening to .
They have only one agenda on Twitter and that is to promote themselves .
They are going to bombard you with links to their own site .
They ’re going to promote their own products .
They ’re going to praise themselves non-stop .
The Mind - Numbing Celebrity
For years , stalkers sought for ways to keep tabs on their favorite celebrities .
They relied heavily on the paparazzi to keep them informed of the latest divorces , fights , and to find out who ’s dating who .
And then came Twitter .
Now you can receive email alerts every time Paris Hilton thinks something is just so adorable .
Do n’t lie to me .
I know you follow her .
Just look at that smile .
Of course , you ’re probably lowering your I.Q. every time you read one of these pop celebrities ’ updates but if that ’s your thing then go for it .
Conclusion
Now honestly stop in at the comments and tell me which category you fall into .
What ’s that ?
You ’re in all five ?
Yeah …me too .

Contacts API Draft Updated The Device APIs and Policy Working Group has published a Working Draft of Contacts API .
This specification defines the concept of a user 's unified address book - where address book data may be sourced from a plurality of sources - both online and locally .
This specification then defines the interfaces on which third party applications can access a user 's unified address book , with explicit user permission and filtering .
The focus of this data sharing is on making the user aware of the data that they will share and putting them at the center of the data sharing process ; free to select both the extent to which they share their address book information and the ability to restrict which pieces of information related to which contact gets shared .

Cross -Origin Resource Sharing Draft Published The Web Applications Working Group has published a Working Draft of Cross - Origin Resource Sharing .
User agents commonly apply same - origin restrictions to network requests .
These restrictions prevent a client - side Web application running from one origin from obtaining data retrieved from another origin , and also limit unsafe HTTP requests that can be automatically launched toward destinations that differ from the running application 's origin .
In user agents that follow this pattern , network requests typically use ambient authentication and session management information , including HTTP authentication and cookie information .
This specification extends this model in a number of ways .

First Draft of XSL Transformations ( XSLT ) Version 2.1 Draft Published The XSL Working Group has published the First Public Working Draft of XSL Transformations ( XSLT ) Version 2.1 .
This specification defines the syntax and semantics of XSLT 2.1 , a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents .
The main focus for enhancements in XSLT 2.1 is the requirement to enable streaming of source documents .
This is needed when source documents become too large to hold in main memory , and also for applications where it is important to start delivering results before the entire source document is available .
The approach adopted in this specification is twofold : it identifies a set of restrictions which , if followed by stylesheet authors , will enable implementations to adopt a streaming mode of operation without placing excessive demands on the optimization capabilities of the processor ; and it provides new constructs to indicate that streaming is required , or to express transformations in a way that makes it easier for the processor to adopt a streaming execution plan .

W3C Invites Implementations of Widget Access Request Policy The Web Applications Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of Widget Access Request Policy .
User agents running widgets are expected to provide access to potentially sensitive APIs ( phone book , calendar , file system , etc. ) that expose data which should not be exposed without the user 's consent .
The purpose of this specification is to define the security model for network interactions from within a widget that has access to sensitive information .
It provides means for a widget to declare its intent to access specific network resources so that a policy may control it .
Follow the group 's development of an implementation report and learn more about the Rich Web Client Activity .
Last Call : View Mode Media Feature The Web Applications Working Group has published a Last Call Working Draft of View Mode Media Feature .
Web applications , be they widgets or in - browser , can on most platforms be run in multiple visual modes .
At times they may occupy the entire screen , at others they may be minimized to a specific docking area ; at times they may have chrome that matches the operating system 's style while at others they may be providing their own controls .
The user is generally in control of at least several aspects of these modalities , and it is therefore important for authors to be able to react to these in order to provide different styling to their applications .
In order to achieve this , this specification defines a media feature that allows different CSS style rules to be applied depending on whether a given media query matches .

Here ’s some not - so - sobering news for party people , barhoppers and clubgoers .
Individuals who inherit a particular gene variant that tweaks the brain ’s reward system are especially likely to drink a lot of alcohol in the company of heavy - boozing peers .
That ’s the preliminary indication of a new study directed by psychology graduate student Helle Larsen of Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands .
Adults carrying at least one copy of a long version of the dopamine D4 receptor gene , dubbed DRD4 , imbibed substantially more alcohol around a heavy - drinking peer than did others who lacked that gene variant , Larsen ’s group reports in a paper published online July 7 in Psychological Science .
“ Carriers of the long gene may be more attuned to , and influenced by , another person ’s heavy drinking than noncarriers are , ” Larsen says .
Her study provides the first evidence that a gene influences human alcohol use in social situations .
Scientists have yet to decipher the precise brain effects of DRD4 ’s long form .
Larsen hypothesizes that in the presence of heavy drinkers , the gene variant may increase dopamine activity in brain areas that amplify alcohol ’s appeal as a rewarding social activity .
“ If this gene - environment interaction stands , and I do n’t see why it should n’t , there is every reason to expect the effect would extend to drugs besides alcohol , as well to many motivated pursuits , ” remarks biopsychologist Kent Berridge of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , who was not involved with the new study .
Sociologist Michael Shanahan of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill lauds the new study for ruling out the possibility that carriers of the key gene simply like to drink a lot of booze and tend to do so with other heavy drinkers .
Instead , alcohol use jumped among volunteers with a long DRD4 gene who happened to see a stranger imbibe heavily for a brief time .
Larsen and her colleagues asked 60 women and 53 men to evaluate advertisements for an alcohol - abuse prevention campaign .
Each volunteer entered a room that had been furnished as a typical Dutch pub , accompanied by a person of the same sex who the volunteer thought was another participant but who was actually working with the researchers .
In between two 10 - minute evaluation sessions , volunteers and the researchers ’ confederates were given a break .
An experimenter asked them to sit at a bar stocked with peanuts , beer , wine , soda and mineral water and to drink whatever they wanted .
As instructed , confederates took the initiative and drank either two sodas , one alcoholic drink and then one soda ; or three alcoholic drinks for women and four alcoholic drinks for men over a 30 - minute period .
DNA analyses of saliva identified 31 volunteers as carriers of the long DRD4 gene , which contains an amino acid sequence that repeats seven times .
When confederates stuck to sodas or drank one alcoholic beverage , long - gene carriers and noncarriers alike limited themselves to an average of less than half a glass of wine or half a bottle of beer .
When confederates quaffed multiple alcoholic drinks , carriers of the gene variant consumed an average of almost two wine or beer servings , versus almost one serving for noncarriers .
These results held for men and women , all of whom said they drink socially , regardless of how much alcohol they reported drinking weekly .
Deceptive research techniques can backfire if volunteers see through them and do n’t admit it to researchers ( SN : 6/20/98 , p. 394 ) .
But when interviewed after testing , none of the participants guessed the study ’s real aim or the confederate ’s agenda .
Other researchers need to confirm these findings , Larsen says .
Some attempts to replicate findings from other studies of gene - environment interactions have yielded mixed results , including follow - up work on a study by researchers from Duke University in Durham , N.C. , that found that another gene variant promotes depression in people who experience stress ( SN : 7/18/09 , p. 10 ) .

use whatever references you want , and it does n’t require you to create or generate anything in the language in question , it just requires you to interpret what other people are saying .
Writing is somewhat harder because you actually have to generate content in the language in question , although you can still work as slowly as you want , plus you ’ve got the assistance of whatever references and tools you want to use ( dictionaries , online translators , online help from native speakers , etc. ) .
Comprehension , listening , is quite a bit harder because you have to move at whatever pace the speaker is speaking at , although ( unless it ’s with someone standing right in front of you ) you can still usually pause , rewind , listen again , etc .
You can look things up as you go , though this is quite inconvenient when you ’ve got someone speaking at a regular conversational rate of speed , and not really practical .
For this reason listening to TV shows and such is usually reserved until an intermediate stage of proficiency when the learner will be able to understand at least the majority of what is said without having to look it up .
Speaking is the part that , honestly , I think at least 75 % of people who start out learning a language never even get around to .
Why ?
They ’re scared .
They put it off and put it off and put it off , and then it ’s 6 months or a year later and they have n’t even begun speaking to people in Spanish ( or whatever language they ’re learning ) yet and they figure that if they have n’t even started doing that yet that it ’ll take forever to master the language ( it will if you never speak it ) and they get discouraged and drop it .
The thought process usually goes something like this ( I know because this has happened to me ) : “ Geez , it ’s been … what , 6 or 8 months since I started out ?
And I have n’t even started talking to native speakers yet , AND I do n’t think I ’ll be ready to anytime soon either , it ’ll probably be another year or so before I ’ll ‘ be ready ’ , this is just … too much , screw it , I give up . ”
You really need to start speaking much sooner , preferably immediately or very close to it .
My fellow polyglot Benny over at Fluent in 3 Months advocates this approach quite strongly , and I absolutely agree .
The sooner you start doing it the better .
There are tons of language exchange sites ( I recommend iTalki ) where you can find native speakers to help you , AND English speakers are in the greatest demand on those sorts of sites because English is the most popular second language in the world so you should have absolutely no trouble finding partners , AND Spanish is very , very prolific language with tons of native speakers on those sites so you should most especially have no trouble finding people to help you with your Spanish .
Look , I ’d recommend you take maybe two weeks to a month to learn some very basic grammar and get a few hundred words into your vocabulary so you ’ve actually got something to work with , but then you really need to throw yourself into the deep end of the pool and start talking to people .
The first few times you do it you can make it easier on yourself , since you ’ll probably be a bit nervous and scared , by typing up a few phrases and things you want to say and subjects to talk about in a word document that you can have in front of you prior to Skyping with someone , that way you know you wo n’t end up freezing up and look too stupid .
But then GO !
It ’s just like jumping into a cold swimming pool or the ocean : it ’ll be uncomfortable and a bit of a shock to the senses right at the beginning , but very shortly you ’ll acclimate yourself to it , get comfortable , and start swimming around and having fun before you know it .
Bizarre marine creatures have been caught on camera by Australian scientists hundreds of metres below the surface on the Great Barrier Reef .
Researchers from the Queensland Brain Institute used remote - controlled cameras that sat on the sea floor , 1,400 m ( 4,600 ft ) below the surface .
Images of ancient six - gilled sharks , giant oil fish , anglerfish ( pictured ) and many unidentified sea creatures were among those captured , said lead researcher Professor Justin Marshall .
The mission , known as the Deep Australia project , used special low - light sensitive cameras that had never been deployed in the country .
Osprey Reef is part of the Coral Sea Conservation Zone , described by Prof Marshall as " an area of high conservation importance " .
" We simply do not know what life is down there and our cameras can now record the behaviour and life in Australia 's largest biosphere - the deep - sea , " he said .
The scientists said the research work had become more urgent in the wake of recent oil spills affecting the Great Barrier Reef , and the impact of global warming .

Activists across the country have a message for Israel : End the siege of Gaza now .
ISRAEL'S MURDEROUS attack on a flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza on May 31 sparked protests across the U.S. to denounce the attack on fellow activists and Israel 's ongoing assault on the Palestinian people .
In Chicago , about 1,000 people crowded onto the street in front of the Israeli consulate on June 1 , forming an angry picket line with many people carrying Palestinian flags and also Turkish flags .
They chanted , " Free the flotilla now .
End Israel 's piracy now ! " and " Israel , Israel , what do you say ?
How many Turks have you killed today ? "
Despite organizers having less than 48 hours to prepare for the demonstration , buses from Ohio , Wisconsin , Bridgeview , Ill. , and other locations brought hundreds to join Chicago protesters .
Members of American Muslims for Palestine , the Chicago International Solidarity Movement and the Free Gaza Movement were there in force .
Palestinian and Arab organizations were joined by activists from the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network and Jewish Voice for Peace , as well as African Americans for Peace and Justice in Palestine / Israel .
Protesting in New York City against Israel 's massacre of humanitarian activists on board the Gaza Freedom Flotilla
Protesters listened with rapt attention as speakers provided updates on the condition of flotilla members .
Chicagoan Fatima Mohammadi , who was aboard the Mavi Marmara at the time of the attack , was missing at the time of the protest , but it has since been reported that she was in Israeli custody and awaiting deportation .
Speakers at the rally included Ali Abunimah of the Electronic Intifada , Awad Hamdan of American Muslims for Palestine and Kevin Clark of the Free Gaza Movement .
Organizers announced that the struggle to bring sorely needed aid to Gaza was far from over , as another flotilla was already on its way Gaza , an Irish ship the MV Rachel Corrie , named after the U.S. activist who was crushed beneath Israeli bulldozers as she protested the destruction of Palestinian homes in 2003 .
Local activists are planning an action later in the week protest Chicago 's " sister city " status with Petach Tikva , one of the first Jewish - only settlements in Palestine .
Several speakers stressed boycott , divestment and sanctions ( BDS ) against Israel 's apartheid , comparing it to the campaign that helped end apartheid in South Africa .
In a victory for BDS activism , just days after the raid on the humanitarian aid flotilla , students at Evergreen State College in Olympia , Wash .
-- Rachel Corrie 's alma mater -- announced that the student body voted overwhelmingly in support of divestment from companies that profit from the Israeli occupation .
A resounding 79.5 percent voted for divestment , and almost 72 percent voted to make their campus Caterpillar - free .
In New York City , Palestinian activists organized three emergency response rallies in a matter of days after the assault on the Freedom Flotilla for Gaza .
More than 1,000 turned out to Times Square on Memorial Day .
The actions were organized by several organizations , including Al - Awda NY , the Gaza Freedom March and American Muslims for Palestine .
In Boston , as many as 500 people turned out on May 31 after Palestine solidarity activists spread the word within hours of hearing about the attack on the humanitarian aid flotilla .
The loud , young protesters , many of them Arab and Muslim , marched through Downtown Crossing to Faneuil Hall and back to Park Street .
They were greeted warmly by passersby .
The next day , about 100 protesters came out again , and staged a die - in in front of the Israeli consulate .
In San Francisco , Palestinian activists and supporters turned out to two protests only days apart , 200 on May 31 and 400 the next day , in response to the murder and kidnapping of members of Gaza flotilla .
Medea Benjamin of Code Pink denounced Democratic Party California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer for repeatedly voting for aid to Israel .
" We will not allow them to spend our money on this murderous state [ Israel ] , " she said .
Palestinian activist Senan Khairie explained ,
Just the fact that they attacked the ships in international waters -- that they attacked unarmed civilians -- shows the brutality of the Israeli Army and the fact that they are afraid of activists breaking the blockade of Gaza .
It is a shame that that the rest of the world was n't doing a thing to stop the blockade .
This attack should awaken progressive people of the world to do something about it .
A recurring theme during the protest was the need for building a grassroots response to stop American aid to Israel and to spread the BDS movement to isolate Israel .
This is especially important because the U.S. and the UN are shielding Israel - - at most calling for a " thorough investigation " to be conducted by Israel itself .
We have to build the kind of pressure from below that exact a toll from governments that stand by Israel .
Pro-Palestinian activists the world over are taking up this fight .
Protests were spreading worldwide , notably in Istanbul and Greece , where marchers attacked the Israeli consulate .
And the BDS movement is gaining ground , winning the support of unions , cities , universities and artists -- for example , musician Elvis Costello 's recent cancellation of his performances scheduled in Israel .
In Los Angeles , 400 rallied at the Israeli consulate on June 1 , waving Palestinian flags and signs that called for " Justice for the heroes of the Free Gaza Flotilla , " " Free Palestine " and " Stop U.S. funding of Israel 's terror . "
The crowd , which included Palestinian students , families and solidarity activists , expressed their horror and anger .
Significantly , the pro-Israel supporters that usually make a presence across the street from these protests did n't appear today -- apparently even they could not defend Israel 's actions this time .
Speakers from Al - Awda - The Palestine Right to Return Coalition , BDS -LA and others emphasized the importance of the growing struggle for justice for Palestinians internationally , the growing awareness of nature of the Israeli state and the need for continued pressure on the Obama administration to end its defense of Israel .
In Washington , D.C. , 300 people picketed at the Israeli embassy the day after the savage Israeli assault on the Gaza Freedom flotilla .
In the blazing Memorial Day heat , marchers -- many of whom heard about the emergency action just hours before via e-mail and text messages -- carried signs and banners and chanted " Shut down the embassy , Stop Israeli piracy . "
The crowd , which included many young people and a large number of participants from the Arab community , picketed around the Israeli embassy 's perimeter .
A popular chant was " Not another dollar , not another dime .
No more money for Israel 's crimes . "
After the two - hour protest , many demonstrators many made their way to another demonstration in front of the White House , a small contingent of them marching the three miles with signs , banners and flags .
Several groups organized for the event , including Code Pink , the ANSWER Coalition , the Washington Interfaith Alliance for Middle East Peace , DCMetroBDS , the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation , the International Socialist Organization , Veterans for Peace and many others .
Some protesters were preparing to return to the White House the next day for a previously planned demonstration to coincide with Obama 's meeting with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
In Atlanta , as many as 200 protesters gathered at the Israeli consulate in a response to a call by the local grassroots Movement to End Israeli Apartheid Georgia which was formed in January 2009 after Israel 's siege on Gaza .
The demonstration was mostly comprised of the Arab and Persian communities and local progressives .
By far the most vocal of the crowd was a small group of high school - aged Palestinians wearing keffiyehs and face paint .
Petitions were being handed around to make local politicians aware of the general upset over the situation , and to put pressure on Georgia State University President Mark Becker over the Georgia International Law Enforcement Exchange , which facilitates police training exchanges through GSU between Atlanta and Israel .
In Portland , Ore. , 150 people gathered on Monday evening and marched through downtown Portland for over an hour , chanting " Palestine under attack !
What do we do ?
Stand up , fight back ! "
The march was organized in a matter of hours by Students United for Palestinian Equal Rights , Americans United for Palestinian Human Rights and the Portland Peaceful Response Coalition .
Representatives of these groups , as well as organizations such as the National Lawyer 's Guild and Amnesty International , took turns speaking to the crowd .
A great deal of emphasis was put on the potential of the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions movement and many signs carried by protesters had " BDS " written on the back .
A human rights lawyer stated that , in this conflict , the U.S. is the issue , as it is the main political and financial supporter of Israel and that this " implicates us every step of the way . "
In San Diego , Students for Justice in Palestine members at the University of California called on students and faculty to gather for a silent emergency response .
Wearing all black , more than 100 people marched around the chancellor 's complex and the student center with a banner " End the humanitarian Gaza crisis now " and chanting " Hey , hey , ho , ho !
The occupation has got to go ! "
One student held a sign that read , " This was not a confrontation , this was a massacre , " countering the justification by the Israeli government that its military commandoes were defending themselves from the activists onboard .
After the march , protesters sat in the middle of the Library Walk as they listened to speakers .
Graduate student Lila Sharif explained how the activists on board the flotilla prepared for the confrontation by raising white flags to show they were coming in peace , but the Israel military instead opened fire before seizing the ships .
" Gaza is under siege , " said Sharif .
" The air , land and water ports have been closed off -- Palestinians live in an open - air prison .
Palestinians have been living this every single day !
The siege of Gaza needs to end and free those people that were trying to bring aid ! "
Over a dozen people stood side by side to represent those who had so far been killed in the raid .
Remembering the fallen , a former member of the Israel Defense Force ( IDF ) said that the IDF opened fire killing unarmed civilians whose only crime was oppose the state of Israel .
" They gave their lives to peace and justice . "
Another speaker talked about the survivors of the Israeli commando attack .
" Let us not forget about the 681 that are risking their lives for the betterment of the Palestinians .
Let us not forget about the people fighting for justice and human rights ! "
Organizers gathered signatures to a petition calling on Rep. Susan Davis ( D - Calif. ) to condemn the attacks on humanitarian aid activists just like leaders of France , Sweden , Turkey , Greece and Spain have already done .
They also asked Davis to demand an end to the humanitarian aid blockade on the Gaza Strip , and that the Israeli government be held accountable to the laws passed by the Geneva Convention and the UN .
The protest ended with a moment of silence in honor of the slain activists .
A downpour of rain could n't stop 75 activists at the University of Wisconsin ( UW ) in Madison from voicing their opposition to Israel 's war crimes on June 2 .
" I 'm frustrated by what Israel gets away with , " said UW freshman Kris Didrickson , who saw a poster for the protest shortly before it began and rushed over to join it .
" If it was Iran [ attacking a ship ] , we probably would 've started a war over it . "
The protest was organized by activists from Madison - Rafah Sister City Project , Madison Area Peace Coalition , the International Socialist Organization and American Jews for a Just Peace .
The same group is planning an educational teach - in on Palestine on June 4 , followed by a candlelight march up State Street , which connects the campus to the state capitol building .
Friday is a significant day to hold a teach - in , organizer Anna Day explained , because it 's the one - year anniversary of Obama 's speech in Cairo , where he called for an end to Israel 's illegal settlements in Palestine .
Students for Justice in Palestine chapters on several campuses are planning events that day to hold Obama and Israel to that demand , Day said , including an educational event at Texas A & M University and a University of California Berkeley student march on the Israeli consulate .
Faculty members at Penn State and Purdue University are also organizing petitions for referenda against Israel 's flotilla attack .
The Madison teach - in will feature eyewitness testimony from Gaza 's siege and aims to connect the recent attack to the wider questions of Israeli occupation .
In the words of Madison West High School senior Zeyad El Omari , " I 'm Palestinian , and my view is that we need one peaceful state , with Israelis and Palestinians living in peace and in equality . "
In Austin , Texas , about 50 activists came out on May 31 , many holding signs with information about what has been banned from Gaza during Israel 's blockade .
Braving the Texas sun for three hours , protesters chanted , " Netanyahu you can't hide !
We charge you with genocide ! " and " Justice is on demand , there 'll be no peace on stolen land . "
A vigil was also in the works for the next day .
In Charlotte , N.C. , 30 protesters , including students and members of the Palestinian community , picketed and made plans for a peace vigil later in the week .
In Rochester , N.Y. , some 25 people turned out to a protest at the Federal Building .
Among the demands were justice for the victims of the attack on the humanitarian aid flotilla , and end to U.S. funding to Israel and a boycott of Israeli goods until the siege of Gaza is ended .
A number of activists had friends on the convoy who they had yet to hear from as many of the boats ' passengers had been detained .

Ford has confirmed it has approached Sebastien Ogier in an attempt to sign the Frenchman for next year 's World Rally Championship .
Ogier 's contract with the Citroen Junior Team ends at the close of this season and Ford 's offer has left him with a straight choice between the WRC's two current manufacturers for next year .
Ford of Europe motorsport manager Gerard Quinn admitted a meeting had taken place between him , Ogier and his manager .
" We have spoken to Sebastien Ogier , " said Quinn .
" We are always looking for ways to strengthen our competitiveness and an opportunity came our way .
His management wanted to talk to us and we took the move to do that .
" It 's important for us to look at our team position , we have two very good drivers in Mikko [ Hirvonen ] and Jari-Matti [ Latvala ] and having somebody like Ogier would be good .
It would be unfair of me to say anything other than that . "
Quinn refused to be drawn on the precise nature of the talks , adding : " That 's the subject of a private discussion . "
He denied that Ogier would be brought into the team to replace either Hirvonen or Latvala , but would drive alongside the Finns .
" We would have to look at how to arrange the team , " Quinn said .
Ogier acknowledged that Ford had approached him but declined to comment further .
" I have nothing to say for the moment , " he said .
" Yes , I have the proposition from them and I look at this proposition and the Citroen proposition and I can give you more information soon . "
The Rally of Portugal winner said he would make his decision between Ford and Citroen before the end of the month .
" I think it 's fair for everybody if I decide before Rally Finland , " he said .
" At the moment , my focus is on this rally in Bulgaria but after that I have to decide - it's a straight choice between Citroen and Ford . "

For over four years , Israel has subjected the civilian population of Gaza to an increasingly severe blockade , resulting in a man-made humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions .
Earlier this month , John Ging , the Director of Operations of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees ( UNRWA ) in Gaza , called upon the international community to break the siege on the Gaza Strip by sending ships loaded with humanitarian aid .
This weekend , 9 civilian boats carrying 700 human rights workers from 40 countries and 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid will attempt to do just that : break through the Israel 's illegal military blockade on the Gaza Strip in non-violent direct action .
In response , the Israeli government has threatened to send out ' half ' of its Naval forces to violently stop our flotilla , and they have engaged in a deceitful campaign of misinformation regarding our mission .
Israel claims that there is no ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza .
Every international aid organization working in Gaza has documented this crisis in stark detail .
Just released earlier this week , Amnesty International 's Annual Human Rights Report stated that Israeli 's siege on Gaza has " deepened the ongoing humanitarian crisis .
Mass unemployment , extreme poverty , food insecurity and food price rises caused by shortages left four out of five Gazans dependent on humanitarian aid .
The scope of the blockade and statements made by Israeli officials about its purpose showed that it was being imposed as a form of collective punishment of Gazans , a flagrant violation of international law . " [ 1 ]
Israel claims that its blockade is directed simply at the Hamas government in Gaza , and is limited to so - called ' security ' items .
Yet When U.S. Senator John Kerry visited Gaza last year , he was shocked to discover that the Israeli blockade included staple food items such as lentils , macaroni and tomato paste .
[ 2 ]
Furthermore , Gisha , the Israeli Legal Center for Freedom of Movement , has documented numerous official Israeli government statements that the blockade is intended to put ' pressure ' on Gaza 's population , and collective punishment of civilians is an illegal act under international law . [ 3 ]
Israel claims that if we wish to send aid to Gaza , all we need do is go through ' official channels , ' give the aid to them and they will deliver it .
This statement is both ridiculous and offensive .
Their blockade , their ' official channels , ' is what is directly causing the humanitarian crisis in the first place .
According to former U.S. President Jimmy Carter : " Palestinians in Gaza are being actually ' starved to death , ' receiving fewer calories per day than people in the poorest parts of Africa .
This is an atrocity that is being perpetrated as punishment on the people in Gaza .
It is a crime ... an abomination that this is allowed to go on .
Tragically , the international community at large ignores the cries for help , while the citizens of Gaza are treated more like animals than human beings . " [ 4 ]
Israel claims that we refused to deliver a letter and package from POW Gilad Shalit 's father .
This is a blatant lie .
We were first contacted by lawyers representing Shalit 's family Wednesday evening , just hours before we were set to depart from Greece .
Irish Senator Mark Daly ( Kerry ) , one of 35 parliamentarians joining our flotilla , agreed to carry any letter and to attempt to deliver it to Shalit or , if that request was denied , deliver it to officials in the Hamas government .
As of this writing , the lawyers have not responded to Sen .
Daly , electing instead to attempt to smear us in the Israeli press .
[ 5 ]
We have always called for the release of all political prisoners in this conflict , including the 11,000 Palestinian political prisoners languishing in Israeli jails , among them hundreds of child prisoners . [ 6 ]
Most despicably of all , Israel claims that we are violating international law by sailing unarmed ships carrying humanitarian aid to a people desperately in need .
These claims only demonstrate how degenerate the political discourse in Israel has become .
Despite its high profile pullout of illegal settlements and military presence from Gaza in August �September 2005 , Israel maintains " effective control " over the Gaza Strip and therefore remains an occupying force with certain obligations . [ 7 ]
Among Israel�s most fundamental obligations as an occupying power is to provide for the welfare of the Palestinian civilian population .
An occupying force has a duty to ensure the food and medical supplies of the population , as well as maintain hospitals and other medical services , " to the fullest extent of the means available to it " ( G IV , arts . 55 , 56 ) .
This includes protecting civilian hospitals , medical personnel , and the wounded and sick .
In addition , a fundamental principle of International Humanitarian Law , as well as of the domestic laws of civilized nations , is that collective punishment against a civilian population is forbidden ( G IV , art . 33 ) .
Israel has grossly abused its authority as an occupying power , not only neglecting to provide for the welfare of the Palestinian civilian population , but instituting policies designed to collectively punish the Palestinians of Gaza .
From fuel and electricity cuts that hinder the proper functioning of hospitals , to the deliberate obstruction of humanitarian aid delivery through Israeli - controlled borders , Israel�s policies towards the Gaza Strip have turned Gaza into a man-made humanitarian disaster .
The dire situation that currently exists in Gaza is therefore a result of deliberate policies by Israel designed to punish the people of Gaza .
In order to address the calamitous conditions imposed upon the people , one must work to change the policies causing the crisis .
The United Nations has referred to Israel�s near hermetic closure of Gaza as " collective punishment , " [ 8 ] strictly prohibited under Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention .
All nations signatory to the Convention have an obligation to ensure respect for its provisions . [ 9 ]
Given the continuing and sustained failure of the international community to enforce its own laws and protect the people of Gaza , we strongly believe that we all , as citizens of the world , have a moral obligation to directly intervene in acts of nonviolent civil resistance to uphold international principles .
Israeli threats and intimidation will not deter us .
We will sail to Gaza again and again and again , until this siege is forever ended and the Palestinian people have free access to the world .

Article 42 of the Hague Regulations stipulates , a " territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army , " and that the occupation extends " to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised . "
Similarly , in the Hostage Case , the Nuremburg Tribunal held that , " the test for application of the legal regime of occupation is not whether the occupying power fails to exercise effective control over the territory , but whether it has the ability to exercise such power . "
Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip , like those in the West Bank , continue to be subject to Israeli control .
For example , Israel controls Gaza�s air space , territorial waters , and all border crossings .
Palestinians in Gaza require Israel�s consent to travel to and from Gaza , to take their goods to Palestinian and foreign markets , to acquire food and medicine , and to access water and electricity .
Without Israel�s permission , the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) cannot perform such basic functions of government as providing social , health , security and utility services , developing the Palestinian economy and allocating resources .

New oil spill in Michigan by Canadian company by Joseph Ernest July 27 , 2010 Newscast Media Battle Creek Mich -- The Lakehead System Oil line carrying oil Sarnia , Ontario has leaked over 800,000 gallons of oil , endangering wildlife and birds in southwestern Michigan .
The pipe belongs to Calgary - based Enbridge Inc. , and carries crude oil from Griffith , Ind. , to Sarnia .
Gina Jordan an Enbridge spokeswoman said , " We know that leak has had a major impact on people in that community and on the environment and on wildlife .
Our crews are currently working on containment using booms and oil skimmers and vacuum trucks . "
Enbridge does not know yet what caused the leak , but are working closely with the U.S. Fishing and Wildlife Services .
The leak started Monday and residents in the Battle Creek and Emmett Townships have been warned by authorities about the strong odor in the area .
" There are confirmed reports of birds impacted by the oil … we 're also working with Focus Wildlife , a rehabilitation contractor who is on site and they are setting up a decontamination and handling site for any affected wildlife .
We 're very much focused on the cleanup of the spill .
There will be a thorough investigation of the incident , " said Jordan .
This is the second major oil spill this year .
It comes right after BP is said to have contained the first one that occurred in the Gulf coast area .

In his final dispatch from Bilderberg 2010 , Charlie Skelton concludes that the gathering has finally broken out into the awareness of the press and public
I found out this week , as I always deep - down suspected , since the age of about four , that I 'm actually a spy working for Her Majesty 's Secret Service .
I 'm annoyed that I did n't know sooner , as I would have used my immunity from prosecution and begun bumping people off much sooner .
I can't wait to get back to the UK .
I 've got a serious backlog .
The revelation emerged during an impromptu news conference on a hot roundabout , with one of the more famous Bilderberg documentarians , Daniel Estulin .
Someone had mentioned one of my articles , and he said : " Forget about that guy , he 's an MI6 agent . "
If you think it was a surprise for me , you can hardly imagine how my handlers in Whitehall took it .
There 's no greater shame for an agent than a blown cover .
It 's worse than throwing the wrong person off a multistorey car park .
If I 'm not careful , I 'm going to find myself spending the next 18 months decrypting Russian interceptions on a north sea trawler .
I think Daniel Estulin is annoyed with me because I 'm not Daniel Estulin .
I rather suspect that he sees the dawning new world order as a giant metaphysical battle between lone crusader Daniel Estulin and the ranged powers of evil .
Which does n't mean to say that he 's wrongheaded about what goes on in Bilderberg .
His sources are good .
It 's just that he loves playing to the crowd , and is prone to making statements which are as bold and flashy as his silk trousers .
Turns out I 'm in good company : Estulin also branded Jon Ronson as MI6 , which is an even more fantastical assertion .
Ronson , as everyone knows , is MI5 .
So yes , I 'm a government agent .
It really is a gun in my pocket , and I 'm not pleased to see you .
I half thought a bit of disinfo - mud might be slung my way , but I was n't expecting it from this side of the police tape .
( Not helpful , Mr Estulin .
Really not helpful .... )
The word " Bilderberg " attracts mud like lazy thought processes attract idiots .
For decades now , one mention of " Bilderberg " has been enough to brand you a nut .
An ultra - left / right / whoknowswhat - wing paranoid nut with some kind of existential dysmorphia and a coathanger wrapped round your head so you can pick up drivetime radio on Neptune .
These days , it 's changed .
These days , if you do n't know what Bilderberg is , you look out of touch .
If you chuckle it off , and say it 's just an over - 70s golf weekend , you sound ill - informed .
If you think it 's a " conspiracy " you need to flick back a few pages in the dictionary .
The word you 're looking for is " conference " .
A four - day conference held in secret , with a € 10 m security budget , run by David Rockefeller , Henry Kissinger and the Queen of the Netherlands .
Nothing weird about that .
Nothing to see here .
Move along .
What undoubtedly was weird about Bilderberg 2010 is that Kissinger chose to hold it in Spain .
He 's not exactly on Spain 's Christmas card list .
" If he was here now , if Henry Kissinger was here , I was arrest him , and it would be " – and here the police officer noosed his fingers around his throat , and delivered the universal sound of a wrung neck – " it would be kkkkkrrrchkk " .
The policeman did n't seem to see the absurdity of the situation .
He was a Spanish policeman who'd just spent four days standing outside a Spanish hotel , protecting a man wanted for questioning in Spain about war crimes .
People were getting arrested for trying to take photographs of someone who should have been getting arrested .
Some comfort : at least we got the photos .
( Well done Quierosaber , it was worth the dehydration cramps ) .
It 's an odd thing .
George Osborne goes four times in a row to Kissinger 's long and lavish conference , no one raises an eyebrow .
But if he so much as popped his head into Broadmoor for Peter Sutcliffe 's birthday party , there 'd be an outcry .
I do n't get it .
Another thing I do n't get : the consensus that Bilderberg is supposed to form and its relationship to all our welfares .
But that discussion is for another time – perhaps sooner rather than later .
For now , it 's just incredible that we can talk about Bilderberg at all : we can start addressing its agenda ( as published on its website ) .
We can examine its role in the formation of public policy .
These are questions for serious people : the spectrum of political debate must expand to fit the facts .
Morons will still twirp out their " tin hat " halfwitticisms , but they sound oddly dated .
I do n't want to sound too much like Carlos Castaneda , but there 's been a shift in consciousness .
The word " Bilderberg " has broken out into the awareness of the press and public , exactly like Robbie Williams never did in America .
For the first time , the press took note , camera crews made the journey , and last shreds of secrecy and shame were torn away by our photos of the delegates .
I 've never quite understood the shame of attending Bilderberg .
The jacket sleeves in front of the face , the blackened limos .
Back before it started , we overheard some conference organisers saying that there were fewer delegates this year , because " many of them were worried about the publicity " .
Heaven forbid someone should see you at Bilderberg !
The very thought !
That sort of thing feels very " old politics " , very pre-coalition , jarring with the openness of Cameron , the transparency of Clegg .
David Cameron attended Bilderberg in 2008 .
I 'm sure he'd be glad to talk about it , and not stoop to what Tony Blair did ( Bilderberg 1993 ) and lie to parliament about going .
The lies of Bilderberg are melting away as it steps out into the Spanish sunshine .
The question of how Bilderberg has remained so long in the shadows is a big one , and not to be dismissed with a lame little : " no one 's interested in the natterings of a retirees ' lunch party " .
A couple of things I 'd like to share with you .
The first is a pair of screengrabs taken last night from the Reuters and AP news searches :
Screengrab of search for ' Bilderberg ' on Reuters and AP news wires
So if you think Reuters and AP provide the world with some kind of pure news - stream of undiluted fact truth , you 're plainly mistaken .
Quite how " managed " they are , I can't say .
The second thing is a conversation I had with the BBC foreign news desk .
I 'd been talking to them about maybe running a story on Bilderberg 2010 .
Everything was sounding positive , until I made a follow - up call .
This is what I was told .
" Ah , yes , sorry , Bilderberg 's been taken off our diary . "
" Excuse me ? "
" Um ... It was n't my decision . "
Do I think that the Bilderberg group does its best to keep off the news wires ?
Absolutely .
Do I think it has an active PR - policy of " ignorance management " ?
Absolutely .
Do I think that tactic will work any more ?
Absolutely not .
The cat 's out of the Bilderbag .
Last weekend , the Bilderberg group launched its own website ( confirmed by German attendee Olaf Scholz as genuine ) .
In 2011 , I predict , there will be a press release in advance of the meeting .
In 2012 , a press statement at the police cordon .
In 2013 , a press conference in the hotel itself .
If there is one , I wo n't be there .
Proper reporters will be there instead , asking proper questions .
Until such time as a press conference happens , I 'll go along and chew away at the absurdities of this cloak and dagger forum .
Until it stops being absurd .
And many others will come besides .
Last year there were fewer than a dozen .
This year , maybe 150 .
Ten or so came to Sitges who'd read my reports from Vouliagmeni and emailed me afterwards .
From around Europe , dozens of student activists made the journey .
Almost all of them blokes .
I swear , if you 're a single girl interested in geopolitics , you could do a lot worse than Bilderberg 2011 .
I spent the week surrounded by probably the most switched on , articulate , interested young men I 've ever met .
( The guys from We Are Change Belgium are so clued - up and full of energy they scare me ) .
Where 2009 was a dystopian nightmare , 2010 was hopeful , comradely and fun .
2011 will be bigger , more determined , and friendlier than ever .
Provided they do n't shift the whole operation to Beijing .
Provided we do n't get peppersprayed by the Chinese police .
If you want to join in , email us on : bilderberg2011@yahoo.co.uk .
Maybe you could help out with some expertise ( technical , photographic , web , PR , legal advice ... whatever you think would be useful would probably be useful ) .
Best of all , just turn up .
One hundred and fifty of us did this year , and it only rained on the Sunday .
Next year , four straight days of glorious sunshine .
I promise .
The latest casualties , which come in the wake of the killing of three British soldiers by a rogue member of the Afghan National Army , will raise more questions about the west 's long - term strategy for bringing peace and security to Afghanistan .
Every comments thread on every internet site on the world which has discussed the Israeli naval murders , has been inundated by organised ZIonist commenters stating that the Israeli action was legal under the San Remo Manual of International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea .
They ignore those parts of San Remo that specifically state that it is illegal to enforce a general blockade on an entire population .
But even apart from that , San Remo simply does not apply .
The manual relates specifically to legal practice in time of war .
With whom is Israel at war ?
There is no war .
Israeli apologists have gone on to say they are in a state of armed conflict with Gaza .
Really ?
In that case , why do we continually hear Israeli complaints about rockets fired from Gaza into Israel ?
If it is the formal Israeli position that it is in a state of armed conflict with Gaza , then Gaza has every right to attack Israel with rockets .
But in fact , plainly to the whole world , the nature and frequency of Israeli complaints about rocket attacks gives evidence that Israel does not in fact believe that a situation of armed conflict exists .
Secondly , if Israel wishes to claim it is in a state of armed conflict with Gaza , then it must treat all of its Gazan prisoners as prisoners of war entitled to the protections of the Geneva Convention .
If you are in a formal state of armed conflict , you cannot categorise your opponents as terrorists .
But again , it is plain for the world to see from its treatment and description of Gazan prisoners that it does not consider itself to be in a formal position of armed conflict .
Israel is seeking to pick and choose which bits of law applicable to armed conflict it applies , by accepting or not accepting it is in armed conflcit depending on the expediency of the moment .
I have consistently denounced Hamas rocket attacks into Israel .
I have categorised them as terrorism .
If Israel wishes now to declare it is in armed conflcit with Gaza , I withdraw my opposition and indeed would urge Hamas to step up such attacks to the maximum .
Does Israel really wish to justify its latest action by declaring it is at war with Gaza ?
That is what the invocation of San Remo amounts to .

It reads like a passage from a horror story : a monster 15 meters long with gigantic , gnashing teeth capable of tearing apart other whales .
But it ’s not fiction .
Researchers recently discovered the fossils of an extinct sperm whale with teeth bigger than a human head .
It has , however , been given a storybook name .
The new species is known as Leviathan melvillei , a name borrowed from Herman Melville , author of Moby Dick .
Klaas Post , honorary curator of fossil mammals at the Natural History Museum Rotterdam in the Netherlands , and his colleagues were traveling through a stretch of desert about 50 kilometers southwest of Ica , Peru , in 2008 when they spotted what at first looked like elephant tusks .
But they turned out to be teeth from an even less - likely animal : a giant sperm whale .
Perhaps the discovery should n’t be a complete surprise .
Fossils of the great shark , Carcharocles megalodon , have been found in the same region .
Both animals would have lived about 12 million to 13 million years ago during the Miocene .
And like megalodon ( at 20 meters long , thought to be one of the biggest fish to have ever roamed the sea ) , L. melvillei is breaking a few records of its own .
With jaws more than 5 meters wide , it had the biggest bite of any mammal to have ever lived .
But L. melvillei was quite different from modern sperm whales ( hence scientists gave it a new genus name ) .
Today , sperm whales ( Physeter macrocephalus ) have fairly small lower teeth and almost no teeth on the upper jaw .
They primarily eat squid , which they pull in via suction .
But L. melvillei had teeth as large as 12 centimeters wide and 36 centimeters long on both its upper and lower jaw , which would have afforded it a much different tactic for hunting :
According to the paper published today in Nature , the researchers suspect that the aggressive whale grabbed prey with its teeth , living off of smaller baleen whales ( whales with comb - like dental plates instead of teeth , such as the humpback ) .
L. melvillei ’s discoverers believe that a changing climate and a drop in the diversity of and an increase in the size of prey toward the end of the Miocene led to the downfall of the great whale .

Norway has launched the innovative AISSat - 1 spacecraft to monitor shipping in its territorial waters .
The small satellite will track vessels over 300 gross tonnes by picking up the signals from their AIS ( Automatic Identification System ) transponders .
AIS is a safety and navigation tool , and can be used by the authorities near the coast to keep watch on cargo , passenger and fisheries activity .
AISSat - 1 will enable Norway to see what is happening over a vast area .
" Norway has the largest sea area to manage in Europe , and this area is the source for a lot of Norwegian income , from oil to fisheries , " explained Bo Andersen , the director general of the Norwegian Space Centre .
" We want to manage these resources in the best possible manner ; and we do that now with radar satellites that give us quite a good overview about where ships are .
But they do n't give us knowledge about which ships they are .
" Of course , the fisheries authorities and the coastguard can go out in aeroplanes and check the ships , but we are talking about an area that 's bigger than the Mediterranean .
So we want a more efficient system . "
The nano - sat - it is a 20 by 20 by 20 cm cube - was one of five payloads launched on an Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle from the Sriharikota Spaceport in Andhra Pradesh .
The primary payload was India 's 700kg Cartosat - 2B , a high - resolution imaging spacecraft .
Mr Andersen confirmed that the Norwegian mission team had successfully made contact with AISSat following its separation from the rocket .
AIS data is transmitted via a VHF signal and identifies the ship , its position , course , and speed .
Norway has already demonstrated how this information can be picked up from orbit .
A receiver called NORAIS was recently installed on the International Space Station ( ISS ) , and plotted the movement of ships around the globe .
NORAIS is part of a project that could eventually lead to a space - AIS solution for the whole of Europe .
Norway is keen to stress , however , that AISSat - 1 will be keeping watch over its national waters only .
" AISSat - 1 is a simple demonstrator , " Mr Andersen told BBC News on Monday .
" If it works , it will be put into operation and we may launch new ones , also .
Image caption
The satellite is very small , weighing less than 7kg
" Right now , it seems everything is working as planned and we will use the next few days to check out its systems .
Then we 'll turn on the instrument and I expect we 'll get the first AIS data quite soon , in one to two weeks . "
At a recent Earth observation symposium in Bergen , Trond Giske , the Norwegian space minister , said he was hopeful AISSat could develop into an ongoing operational system .
" If this is successful , we will definitely look into doing another one ; we will consider that strongly , " he told reporters .
The spacecraft 's 600 km - high polar orbit means it will get sight of Norway 's economic zone every 100 minutes .
The 4.4m - euro ( 35 m Kroner ; £ 3.7 m ) satellite has been funded by the Norwegian Space Centre .
The satellite bus , or chassis , was provided by the University of Toronto , Canada .
The payload was developed by Kongsberg Seatex AS in co-operation with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment ( FFI ) .

Feeling more insecure than you did in the past ?
it 's not just the recession :
Americans Are Increasingly Insecure , by Conor Dougherty : The Rockefeller Foundation has released a new “ Economic Security Index ” that measures the effect of income loss and rising medical costs on Americans .
The verdict :
The recession has made Americans a lot less secure , but security was slipping long before the recent recession .
The Economic Security Index , which was developed by Yale political scientist Jacob Hacker , measures inflation - adjusted income that ’s available after medical costs .
It captures Americans who have had a year - over - year fall of 25 % or more in income after medical costs but do n’t have enough savings to offset the plunge .
...
The results :
The ESI was at 12.2 % in 1985 and has grown steadily ever since ( with year - to - year fluctuations that track the economy ) .
In 2007 , the ESI was at 13.7 % and is projected to hit 20.4 % for 2009 .
...
There are myriad reasons why economic security has become increasingly wobbly , but Mr. Hacker points to three main culprits .
One is that men ’s earnings have become a lot more unstable since the 1970s , and since many men are still breadwinners that has led to more erratic household income .
Government transfer benefits have also become a lot more unstable .
And while there are more dual - income families the extra income is not enough to offset growing insecurity .
...
The rising uncertainty is yet another dose of cold water for an economy still on the mend .
Mr. Hacker says that it takes somewhere between 6 and 8 years for people to recovery from an income loss of 25 % or greater , a shock that can crimp consumer spending and lead greater income inequality even after the economy recovers .
...
If you are a big bank that loses a big part of its income , the government comes to your rescue .
But if you are an individual wiped out by health costs , tough luck for you .

OpenShot Video Editor recently introduced stunning new 3D animated titles effect .
Now , they have added a new blender template as well .
The OpenShot developers claim those templates to be highly flexible and good looking .
They have a video showcasing the 3D animated titles effect and the new blender template .
As the developer puts it , " As you watch this video , I want you to think about the following question .
So , What do you think ?
Have you had your coffee yet today ?
Do you feel that caffeine is helpful , perhaps even necessary , to being alert and energetic ?
You may want to reconsider regular use of caffeine .
Caffeine is one of the most , if not the most , commonly consumed drugs among humans .
A 2005 extensive survey found that 87 % of Americans consume caffeine regularly , with an average intake of 193 mg per day .
The most common sources of caffeine are coffee ( 71 % ) , soft drinks ( 16 % ) , and tea ( 12 % ) .
Other sources include chocolate , over - the - counter medications ( like headache or cold medications ) , and dietary supplements .
Caffeine derives from the coffee bean , cocoa bean , kola bean , and the guarana fruit .
While many people feel that caffeine is a performance enhancing substance , the evidence has been largely against this notion , if somewhat mixed .
But a recent large study strongly supports the evidence against any true cognitive or alertness benefit for caffeine .
The study authors looked at 162 non / low caffeine users and 217 medium / high caffeine users .
They were also interested in the effects of specific genetic variants , ADORA2A and ADORA1 polymorphism , that render people more sensitive to certain caffeine effects .
They had participants refrain from caffeine use then challenged them with increasing doses of caffeine or placebo , and assessed their anxiety , alertness and headaches .
They found that caffeine withdrawal ( giving placebo to high caffeine users ) caused increased headaches and decreased alertness .
This is no surprise and supports prior research .
In my own practice I see a great deal of caffeine withdrawal headaches and can sometimes “ cure ” patients just by having them stop their daily caffeine use .
When regular caffeine users were given caffeine this simply returned them to their baseline , and did not enhance their alertness .
Non caffeine users saw no benefit from taking caffeine .
Caffeine also caused anxiety in non caffeine users , especially those with certain genetic variants .
However , it did not increase anxiety in regular users , who therefore seem to be tolerant to the anxiety - producing effects of caffeine – even if they had the susceptible gene variants .
The take home is that regular use of caffeine produces no benefit to alertness , energy , or function .
Regular caffeine users are simply staving off caffeine withdrawal with every dose – using caffeine just to return them to their baseline .
This makes caffeine a net negative for alertness , or neutral at best if use is regular enough to avoid any withdrawal .
Meanwhile , regular caffeine use ( even without withdrawal ) can increase blood pressure , worsen headaches , cause palpitations , insomnia , and jitteriness .
Intermittent use can also increase anxiety , although this study showed regular users become tolerant to this effect .
I am not trying to be down on caffeine , just report the research .
This research also shows that caffeine is generally safe , and while it does increase blood pressure ( a risk factor for heart disease ) caffeine is not an independent risk factor for heart disease itself .
There is also evidence that regular caffeine use ( perhaps just coffee use ) decreases the risk of Type 2 diabetes .
Pregnant women should avoid caffeine because of potential effects on fetal growth and spontaneous abortion .
Migraneurs should also avoid caffeine as it can worsen a migraine syndrome .
But if you do not have any specific medical condition that caffeine can exacerbate , regular moderate caffeine use appears to be safe .
Just do n’t fool yourself into thinking it is helping you stay alert or function better .
Chinese search for Ming shipwreck off Kenyan coast Published duration 26 July 2010
image caption Zheng
He is China 's most famous explorer
Chinese archaeologists are due to begin searching for the remains of a Chinese ship believed to have sunk off the Kenyan coast 600 years ago .
The shipwreck could provide evidence of the first contact between China and east Africa .
The three - year project will search in northern Kenyan coastal waters off Lamu island and Malindi .
The joint initiative by China and Kenya comes after porcelain from China 's Ming dynasty was found in the area .
Eleven experts will excavate key sites on land , ahead of the arrival of the maritime team in August .
The ship is believed to have sailed during China 's Ming dynasty as part of a fleet led by Adm Zheng He , who reached Malindi in 1418 .
Half a century before Columbus , Adm Zheng is said to have commanded huge expeditions in an effort to increase recognition and trade for Ming rule , which began in 1368 .
' Sultan 's village '
Herman Kiriama , Kenya 's head of coastal archaeology , said he hoped the project would make some important findings about early relations between China and Africa .
" It will be a big achievement because it will tell us a lot about what happened in the Indian Ocean before the European powers - Spain , Portugal - started their trading routes to India , " he told the BBC .
" We have a lot of mixed Chinese pots dating back to that period so we know the ship must have sailed sometime here " .
He says they hope to find out more about ship engineering from that period .
The team , which is due to arrive later on Monday , will try to find the original village of the Sultan of Malindi - who is rumoured to have given Zheng a giraffe as a gift - by digging up areas near the village of Mambrui .
According to legend , some sailors survived the ship 's sinking , swam to shore , and were allowed to stay after they killed a deadly snake .

With summer comes the perennial debate about showing skin : do women bare their limbs to keep cool , to look good for themselves , or to " inspire lust ? "
And would the last one really be so bad ?

Kim Kardashian ruffled some feathers by objecting to public breastfeeding , but now one blogger is objecting to her public breasts .
Says Danielle Bean of the National Catholic Register ,
I did not see the nursing mother in question , so I do n't know exactly how " covered " or " uncovered " she was .
I do know , however , that it does n't take many clicks on the internet to find photos of Kim Kardashian and her siblings wearing less clothing than I consider appropriate .
The idea of this young woman , who does not hesitate to use her own cleavage for the purpose of promoting her career and making money , being disgusted by a mother showing " too much " while feeding her infant is not making a whole lot of sense to me .
Public displays of female body parts are acceptable — as long your purpose is to tantalize and inspire lust ?

Often enough , the " purpose " of showing skin in the summer is not to fucking die of heat stroke — in many places I 've lived , going sleeveless in summer is pretty much a necessity , and long pants are a sentence to severe discomfort , if not actual fainting .
But as Sadie pointed out , loose and floaty often beats tight and skimpy where sheer heat control is concerned .
Sometimes , some of us don booty shorts , low - cut tops , or miniskirts because we like the way they look .
And sometimes , we do want people to look at us .
It 's this last point that seems so controversial .
First of all , it 's not true of everyone — plenty of women choose not to show skin for religious reasons or because of simple personal preference .
And some argue that the choice to wear modest dress can be empowering in a society so focused on women 's bodies .
But the opposite — actually inviting this focus — can be empowering too .
For those with bodies devalued by mainstream ideas of attractiveness , showing skin can be a fuck - you to those who demand their invisibility .
But even for those who conform to those mainstream ideas ( whether Kardashian herself does is a complicated issue ) , to simply acknowledge that sometimes you dress to look sexy can be a surprising relief .
We 're often told that dressing in such a way is " tantalizing " — that if we want to show our bodies , we 'd better be prepared to give them up to the first man who wants them .
But telling women that if they look a certain way they 'd better behave a certain way — that if they do n't want to have sex with any dude they meet , they 'd better cover up — puts women and men in an extremely restrictive box .
And dressing however the fuck you want while behaving however the fuck you want is one way of breaking out of it .
In Full Frontal Feminism , Jessica Valenti writes ,

Wear high heels , mascara , and whatever else you want .
I sure do .
But let 's not forget that by doing this , we 're adhering to a narrow , male - created vision of hotness .
Again , this is n't to say it 's wrong to want to look " hot , " and to go along with the status quo from time to time , but let 's not call it empowered .
Call it what it is — fun and easy .

I 'd amend this .
Whether you have a socially privileged body or not , dressing " hot " is n't necessarily easy .
You have to contend with attention — and while you may want attention from a certain person or set of people , you 're going to get it from everyone .
You 're also going to get negative attention — from critics like Bean who condemn you for " inspiring lust , " from those who do n't like your looks and think your body should get out of their eyespace , and from those who think your outfit gives them permission to harass you or worse .
Putting on short shorts in the summertime certainly is n't the be-all and end - all of empowerment , and it certainly can play into restrictive mainstream notions of sexuality and sexiness ( the line between owning your sexuality and simply performing for society what it wants to see is a subject for a whole other post ) .
But in a culture where merely having a female body invites constant judgment and criticism , saying " look at me " can also be feminist .
Kim Kardashian Urges Women To Dress More Modestly [ National Catholic Register ]
In the second installment in our series on “ Sin Taxes , ” we present a graphic which illustrates how much money individuals are being taxed to consume alcohol , and subsequently how much the Federal and State governments are generating in tax revenue .
There is also a breakdown of how different types of alcohols are taxed in the various states , as well as international comparisons — to put thing in perspective .

McLaren has confirmed that Lewis Hamilton 's penultimate - lap crash at last weekend 's Spanish Grand Prix was caused by a wheel rim failure .
Hamilton looked set for a comfortable second place in the race , but crashed at the high - speed Renault corner when the rim failure caused his left - front tyre to deflate and sent him across the gravel and into the tyre wall .
Team principal Martin Whitmarsh said that the cause of the rim failure had yet to be determined though , and that an investigation remains ongoing .
" The analysis of the part came back yesterday [ Monday ] ...
We had Bridgestone here , " Whitmarsh told a Vodafone teleconference on Tuesday .
" As we said at the time , we did not believe that the deflation was caused by a puncture or a tyre failure in that all the evidence told us that the rim failed , which caused the deflation .
" The rim failure is being investigated .
It could be debris - related , it could be that a lack of tightness of the wheelnut allowed some flexing .
What we know is that the rim failed , probably a human error somewhere in the process to cause it , and that led to the deflation and the accident . "
Hamilton 's crash left him sixth in the World Championship , 21 points behind his championship - leading McLaren team - mate Jenson Button .

One evening about 20 years ago , someone with a “ Middle Eastern accent ” called the Knesset and said a bomb was set to go off .
I was working atthat night , and I can’t remember how much advance time the caller gave , but security guards went all around the Knesset and informed everyone , and some people left , but many stayed .
It turned out there was no bomb .
But what if there had been , and it had blown up the Knesset and killed a lot of people who ’d chosen to ignore the threat ?
Would we say of the bombers , “ Well , they warned everybody , it ’s not their fault people were killed ” ?
I ’m reminded of that evening by an interview in last Friday ’ swith Sarah Agassi , one of the two young Etzel women who called the King David Hotel on the afternoon of July 22 , 1946 and warned the British authorities to evacuate the building , which was their headquarters , because it was about to blow up .
“ They had a half - hour .
If they had evacuated people at 12:35 , it would n’t have happened , ” she said .
By “ it , ” she meant the deaths of 91 people in the hotel .
“ I do n’t regret it for a second , ” she said , blaming Sir John Shaw , the British chief secretary , for ignoring the warning .
( The British maintain they received none . )
“ It ’s because of him that so many were killed , ” she said .
We do n’t call that terrorism , though .
We do n’t call it “ glorifying terrorists , ” either , when we name highways , neighborhoods , schools and hospitals after the man who ordered the bombing , Menachem Begin .
Ninety - one people killed – Britons , Arabs , Jews and others .
“ There were other actions no less courageous that we carried out against the British , ” said Agassi .
“ For example , blowing up armored cars .
We would hide out in Rehavia , we knew their route , we ’d place the bombs and set them off when the car passed , then run away .
” Etzel ( the Hebrew acronym for “ National Military Organization in the Land of Israel ” ) killed civilians , too – Arab civilians , scores of them , in tit - for - tat bombings of Arab markets and other public places .
After the War of Independence , Begin was a terrorist in the eyes of some Israelis , but by now he is a supreme , unchallenged national hero .
Remembered as a gentleman , he is the most beloved leader in Israeli history .
We see no reason why he should n’t be .
But when the Palestinians , beginning with their leaders , eulogize Muhammad Oudeh , who planned the Munich Olympics killings of 11 Israeli athletes , or name a square in Ramallah after Dalal Mughrabi , leader of the Coastal Road bus hijacking that killed 37 Israelis , then we are outraged .
“ Whoever sponsors and supports naming a square in Ramallah after a terrorist who murdered dozens of Israelis on the Coastal Road encourages terror , ” said Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in March .
He called on Palestinian leaders to “ stop the incitement .
” But four years ago , when Etzel veterans commemorated the 60th anniversary of the King David bombing , Netanyahu , scion of a proud Revisionist family , was the featured speaker .
“ It ’s very important to make the distinction between terror groups and freedom fighters , and between terrorist action and legitimate military action , ” he told the audience .
IN THE hypocrisy that characterizes Israel ’s view of Palestinians , this is the height of it :
The greatest denouncers of Palestinian violence against Israel also tend to be the greatest defenders of pre-state Zionist violence against Britain .
After electing Begin prime minister , we elected Yitzhak Shamir , who had been one of the leadership trio of Lehi ( the Hebrew acronym for “ Fighters for the Freedom of Israel ” ) .
Lehi went Etzel one better – not only did it kill for Israeli statehood , it killed after statehood , too .
On September 17 , 1948 , Lehi men in Jerusalem shot to death Count Folke Bernadotte , the UN ’s envoy to the Middle East ( who , as a Swedish diplomat during World War II , had saved many thousands of Jews from the Nazi death camps ) .
At Lehi ’s 70th anniversary celebration in Jerusalem last month , National Union MK Arye Eldad ( whose father , Yisrael , had been one of Shamir ’s partners in the leadership ) said from the podium : “ Count Bernadotte wanted to internationalize Jerusalem .
In response , Lehi killed him .
With his death , the concept of taking Jerusalem away from the Jewish people died with him .
” Hooray .
And after Yitzhak Shamir dies , there will be highways , neighborhoods , hospitals and schools named after him , too .
It seems to me that if you are going to condemn the Munich Olympics killings and the Coastal Road Massacre , you also have to condemn the King David Hotel bombing and the Bernadotte assassination .
By the same token , if you justify or even “ understand ” Begin ’s and Shamir ’s violence , you also have to justify or at least understand the violence of Muhammad Oudeh and Dalal Mughrabi .
And if you do n’t – if violence in the name of your nation ’s freedom is what you call heroism , but violence in the name of the enemy nation ’s freedom is what you call terrorism – then you have no principles at all .
Then the only thing you stand for in this world is the side you happen to have been born on .
Exploring the surface of Mars can be a perilous endeavor for a robot .
Consider the plight of the wheeled Mars rover Spirit :
The six - wheeled , 400 - pound robot has been stuck in the Martian sand­ since January 2010 — when it was downgraded from rover to science station — and the dust collecting on its solar panels may prevent it from even being able to carry out this task .
As we look back on the successes and setbacks of the six - wheeled Spirit , researchers are testing out a variety of other rover ideas that could last longer , collect more data and go places on Mars that no bot has ever been .
One such concept is the Tumbleweed Rover — a simple , wind - powered , wheel - less rover that would roll over the Martian surface just like , well , a tumbleweed .
The Tumbleweed has inspired scientists for more than 10 years , but to date there is no consensus regarding how exactly the rover should be designed .
Now researchers at North Carolina State University have developed a computer model they say will allow engineers to test different vehicle designs and predict how they will perform on the Martian surface .
The research , funded by NASA and the North Carolina Space Grant Consortium , is described in a paper published in the Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets on June 1 .
The researchers created a two - part model .
The first part simulates the physical parameters of the vehicle itself — the radius , weight , elasticity ( how much , for example , the rover deforms when it strikes a rock ) and rotational inertia .
The second part re-creates specific features of the Martian surface , like rock fields and craters , based on video imaging data collected by NASA 's Viking and Mars Pathfinder missions .
The surface of Mars is characterized by drastic changes in landscape , and it is crucial that engineers understand the challenges each terrain type poses .
The biggest challenge in the project , according to NC State aerospace engineer and paper co-author Alexandre Hartl , was developing a detailed wind model — an extremely important element for designing the rover , given that Tumbleweed is wind - powered .
" The surface wind speeds on Mars are relatively uncharted , with limited data , so you have to make some compromises on how you model the wind flow through a rock field or crater , " he says .
" We know what the magnitude of the wind speed is , but we do n't know how it varies and its duration . "
The little data that is available comes from the Viking and Mars Pathfinder missions .
This model is not the first of its kind , Hartl says , but to date it is the most detailed .
" We consider a lot more dynamic phenomena , " Hartl says .
" We 're not the first one , but I think we 've used it in the most sophisticated sense . "
Of course , getting a Tumbleweed Rover to the surface of Mars is still , at best , years away .
But NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Langley Research Center are both currently developing prototypes , and the North Carolina State model will now bolster those efforts .

The GOP is the party of irrational fear mongering .
Here are a few of their favorites , used to scare ignorant , brain - washed sheeple .
… So , here are ten of the most interesting things that absolutely terrify Wingnuttia .
First , a few terrors of the real hard - core Right .
For the Tea Partier , the midterm GOP primary voter , it ’s not just the anxiety over social change that typifies more traditional conservatism .
A broad chunk of the GOP base today is animated by wildly unrealistic terrors — monsters stalking them as the sun sets , perhaps hovering just beyond their peripheral vision .
1. Government Concentration Camps
… Fear of Obama ’s Kenyan shock troops rounding up good conservatives and throwing them into Thunderdome - esque detention centers is nothing new on the Right …
2. Moooslims !
If you pay attention to the Right , you might think there are large Islamic armies occupying a few majority - Christian countries these days instead of the other way around …
3 . They ’re Coming to Take Your Guns
… This irrational fear is cause for a certain amount of rational fear among others .
There have been at least two incidents of ( no doubt already unhinged ) people who took this threat so seriously they gunned down police officers in cold - blooded attacks .
4. Article 3 of the United States Constitution
Remember those Oath Keepers ?
They say they ’ll honor their pledge to uphold the United States ’ Constitution by defending against federal encroachment on states ’ rights …
5. Plotting Global Elites
… It ’s an increasingly popular conspiracy theory about a group of shadowy and mostly nameless international " elites " who are planning to " replace the United States " — in the words of Jerome Corsi , a key figure in the SwiftBoat Veterans for Truth project and a leading NAU conspiracist — with a transnational government …
6. The Decline of Married White Christians
This one worries the operative class : the decline of married white people who identify as “ Christians . ”
The GOP relies on them — they represent the party ’s most loyal demographic .
To be clear , there are a lot of white people , a lot of married people , and a lot of people who say they ’re Christians .
But the share of American voters who are white and married and identify as Christians has been in a long and steep decline , and by every estimate will continue to fall …
7 . The Graying of the Culture Warriors
Because the plenty - plaint is so flexible , you can rest assured that tomorrow ’s conservatives will never run out of wedge social issues .
Nonetheless , some of the most popular are n’t being embraced by the kids these days , and that ’s cause for alarm among those trying to win some elections .
An analysis by Columbia University statisticians found a “ generation - gap ” on support for same - sex marriage that they called “ huge . ”
According to the nerds , “ If policy were set by state - by - state majorities of those 65 or older , none would allow same - sex marriage .
If policy were set by those under 30 , only 12 states would not allow - same - sex marriage . ” …
8. White Minority Status
Many people believe that in 2050 , if birth and immigration rates do what experts expect them to , white folk will become a minority in the United States …
9 . And the Browning of America
Among the political class a more reasonable fear is that the base ’s boiling rhetoric over immigration will permanently alienate Latinos and Asian Americans , two fast - growing voting blocs that are heavily concentrated in a handful of key swing states .
Rather than shaking over the prospect of a white demographic minority like Buchanan , they ’re afraid the venom coming from Republicans like Tom Tancredo ( R - CO ) and JD Hayworth ( R - AZ ) will saddle them with a structural inability to win national elections for a generation …
10 . Unions
Here ’s another one that scares the Right - wing coastal elitists who in fact run the conservative movement , the operatives .
Most people understand that the Right ’s corporate patrons do n’t care for organized labor because it hurts the bottom line .
But there ’s another thing to fear : Union members are more likely to vote their economic interests than be blinded by culture war distractions …

Why
Overcoming
Consumerism ?
Imagine yourself dwelling in the following world :
You live in a safe pleasant and unpolluted community where you actually know your neighbors and interact with them , be it a small town , a suburb or even a city neighborhood .
You can easily walk , bicycle or take effective mass transit to your nearby job , giving you time to think or read as you get there .
The work that you do improves our future , benefits your community and means something to you and those with whom you interact .
You actually look forward to Monday .
The longer that you are employed the more you learn and the more valuable you become to your employer with an increasing level of pay .
Your work schedule leaves you sufficient time to enjoy your friends , family and outside interests .
Money is n't a controlling influence in your life because your needs are easily met .
Your possessions are few , yet of high quality , thus allowing your home to be small , neat and inexpensive to own or rent .
You 're connected to your surroundings , rather than just dwelling in them , your backyard , for example , provides most of the produce you might need plus a surplus that you can trade with neighbors .
You have a stake in your community and participate in local decision making at the Town Council , P.T.A. and other grass roots organizations ..
You buy what is necessary in nearby establishments whose owners are known to you and live in your community .
If you have children , they walk to a nearby well - funded neighborhood school in safety and then learn authentic social skills as they interact with a community of honorably employed adults when away from school .
Occasionally you need to travel to a large store on the edge of town .
You do this on a free shuttle bus or perhaps in a simple , older vehicle , the use and costs of which you might share with others or a car that you rent only when you need it , thus preserving for yourself the weeks or months that it takes to earn the thousands of after - tax Dollars that owning a new car would take away from you each year .
Your interests , the things that you really like to do with your mind and your hands , all the possibilities of your life , are there to be explored because you have the time , energy and money to do so .
" But this is America , you say , all this is possible . "
" Not anymore it 's not " .
( Editor 's note : that was first written in the 1990s when this page was posted .
You know what 's happened to the economy and our country since then )
There are growing forces making this way of life almost impossible to attain or maintain , even for the wealthy .
If you are among the lucky few who still have the kind of life outlined above , these same forces threaten you .
Whether you live in an isolated small town or prefer your anonymity as well as the multiplicity of things available to you in a big city , these same forces will are eroding your security and ability to make choices for yourself .
Do you think what 's outlined at the beginning of this page can only occur in some mythic long - past small town ?
Before the hegemony of consumerism and bottom - line Wall Street economics , you could do all of these things anywhere , including in our cities .
There is no reason that we cannot live like this again if sufficient people work to identify and disempower the forces that promote and profit from limiting our social and economic horizons .
These forces are manifested in our lives as consumerism .
People voluntarily hand over their soverignty as Americans and citizens in exchange for things and conveniences that sap and paralyze our ability to fight the forces that are weakening our real economy and our ability to affect change in it .
The process began innocently enough .
At first they were a growing number of pleasant conveniences for housewives in the 1950s , then a car for everyone with the gradual and inevitable erosion of mass transit , then the ubiquitousness of things and chemical products technologically unimaginable a few decades earlier .
With this came a growing a availability of consumer credit and debt to make things available , the over - dependence on labor - saving devices , total dependence on the car and absolute necessity of full time work , the two income household to pay for more and more , then the importation of cheaper and cheaper goods and the disappearance of manufacturing jobs , the commodification of labor and the discarding of loyalties to our citizens and taxpayers and now the decline of service work with professionals next to be downsized ....
The ongoing disenfranchisement of people from our own community , replaced by commercial transactions with distant strangers ... where will it end ?
When America looks like some faded Third World fragment of the old British Empire ?
An overpopulated wasteland of pollution , eroded landscapes , worn out infrastructure and hungry people digging into landfills for salvageables ?
With real unemployment above 20 % and manufacturing being outsourced at new levels , this vision is looking more and more tangible .
The Middle Class is dying .
We should n't allow this to happen .
Things may be starting to turn around in our favor .
But it takes work and time and attention to details and a willingness to try new things for our own and our children 's benefit .
There are serious changes ahead .
We can control some of these for our benefit or we can just react to them after they have happened -- or worse yet , ignore the changes and pretend that they do not matter .
Simply stated , there is a lot of money being made and a lot of power being gathered by the people that promote consumerism .
You pay for it in gradually limited economic mobility , pollution , threats to your health and a declining standard of living , as measured by the things that really matter .
This is what this site is about , identifying these forces and showcasing opportunities to lessen or eliminate their control over your life through the completion of everyday things , that in the aggregate , fight the big battles .
We 're not suggesting that you pick up guns and start blasting away .
What we advocate does far more damage than bullets to these forces and the people behind them and makes life much more enjoyable for you while it returns to you the possibility of living the way that you choose .
We can not rely on politicians because if they have any true power they have been bought and paid for and if they have n't been bought and paid for they probably do n't have any real power .
( with a few notable local exceptions ) .
In addition to the everyday things that you can do , there are concepts that need to be discussed and not just in a trite way .
The mantra " Reduce , Reuse and Recycle " is pregnant with meaning , and reflects worthwhile goals , but it hardly contains solutions to the real integral problems of the world .
For example , why does n't America have decent mass transit ?
We provide links further along in the site to allow you to see what we once had , what happened to it and what can be done to bring it back .

How this page is laid out :
How consumerism affects society , the economy and the Environment .
Economic costs of consumerism
Environmental costs of consumerism
Getting away from consumerism
How
consumerism affects society ,
the economy and the Environment .
Consumerism is economically manifested in the chronic purchasing of new goods and services , with little attention to their true need , durability , product origin or the environmental consequences of manufacture and disposal .
Consumerism is driven by huge sums spent on advertising designed to create both a desire to follow trends , and the resultant personal self - reward system based on acquisition .
Materialism is one of the end results of consumerism .
Consumerism interferes with the workings of society by replacing the normal common - sense desire for an adequate supply of life 's necessities , community life , a stable family and healthy relationships with an artificial ongoing and insatiable quest for things and the money to buy them with little regard for the true utility of what is bought .
An intended consequence of this , promoted by those who profit from consumerism , is to accelerate the discarding of the old , either because of lack of durability or a change in fashion .
Landfills swell with cheap discarded products that fail early and cannot be repaired .
Products are made psychologically obsolete long before they actually wear out .
A generation is growing up without knowing what quality goods are .
Friendship , family ties and personal autonomy are only promoted as a vehicle for gift giving and the rationale for the selection of communication services and personal acquisition .
Everything becomes mediated through the spending of money on goods and services .
Human beings who cannot spend become worthless .
It is an often stated catechism that the economy would improve if people just bought more things , bought more cars and spent more money .
Financial resources better spent on Social Capital such as education , nutrition , housing etc. are spent on products of dubious value and little social return .
In addition , the purchaser is robbed by the high price of new things , the cost of the credit to buy them , and the less obvious expenses such as , in the case of automobiles , increased registration , insurance , repair and maintenance costs .
Many consumers run out of room in their homes to store the things that they buy .
A rapidly growing industry in America is that of self - storage .
Thousands of acres of land good farm land are paved over every year to build these cities of orphaned and unwanted things so as to give people more room to house the new things that they are persuaded to buy .
If these stored products were so essential in the first place , why do they need to be warehoused ?
An overabundance of things lessens the value of what people possess .
" You work in a job you hate , to buy stuff that you do n't need , to impress people that you do n't like . "
- Fight Club
Malls have replaced parks , churches and community gatherings for many who no longer even take the trouble to meet their neighbors or care to know their names .
People move frequently as though neighborhoods and cities were products to be tried out like brands of deodorant .
Consumerism sets each person against themself in an endless quest for the attainment of material things or the imaginary world conjured up and made possible by things yet to be purchased .
Weight training , diet centers , breast reduction , breast enhancement , cosmetic surgery , permanent eye make - up , liposuction , collagen injections , these are are some examples of people turning themselves into human consumer goods more suited for the " marketplace " than living in a healthy balanced society .

The mindset of humans as consumer objects triumphs when women , failing to meet the standards dictated by the availability of the above " services " , are traded in for a " newer model " .
This same way of thinking allows parents to justify entering their little girls in beauty contests as though they were prize livestock .
Here 's the affect that unobtainable good looks have on the happiness of the " average " person :
Why beautiful people create an ugly mood by Robert Uhlig BEAUTY makes the world an unhappier place , say two mathematicians who have calculated the ideal way to match lonely hearts to their soulmates .
Conventionally good looking people such as Kate Moss , George Clooney , Brad Pitt and Jennifer Lopez , may be pleasing to the eye , but their very presence in our midst makes the world a less contented place , the research suggests .
At fault is the so - called Vogue factor , a measure of how much influence beauty has in society .
The higher the Vogue factor , the mathematicians said , the more dissatisfied and miserable we are with our sexual partners ...
" Even if the more beautiful players have a larger satisfaction by far , the general dissatisfaction in the system increases . "
With television , cinema and magazines such as Vogue bombarding us with images of beautiful women and good looking men conforming to a standardised concept of beauty , overall levels of dissatisfaction were likely to increase .
Working with Andrea Capocci of Fribourg University in Switzerland , Dr Caldarelli updated the stable marriage problem , a mathematical puzzle first examined in 1962 by two University of California researchers .
David Gale and Lloyd Shapley 's 1962 study found that provided the criteria for choosing partners - wit , beauty , intelligence , wealth or whatever - had no intrinsic value in society , then everybody should end up with a partner with whom they were reasonably happy .
New Scientist reports today .
" The result of this makes distressing reading for the plain and ordinary .
With beauty on the scene , you 're now much less likely to be matched with your number one choice , unless you happen to be one of the beautiful people yourself . "

And the following from the Wall Street Journal
" Each year an estimated 1.5 million Americans choose to have nose jobs , tummy tucks or breast enlargements .
Many of these people would be unable to afford these vital surgical procedures if it were not for the public spirited efforts of loan companies like Jayhawk Acceptance Corporation , a used car lender that has turned to covering the booming demand for elective surgery .
Lenders in this field face an unusual challenge , " explains the Wall Street Journal : " A lender can take a used car but can hardly repossess a face lift . "
Consequently lenders like Jayhawk have to charge a slightly higher interest rate , up to 22.5 % to be exact .
Says Michael Smartt , Jayhawk CEO , " We 're capitalizing on America 's vanity . "

( Actual name changed to protect the guilty ) IF you do n't look like this - well then they say that society thinks that you 're ugly !
It is impossible to win a war against yourself or your uncontrolled desires .
A good example of this is the simplistic materialist psychosis of the bumper sticker :
" He who dies with the most toys wins "
Is psychosis too strong a word to use here ?
Appreciate the following line of reasoning :
" I can imagine it , therefore I want it .
I want it , therefore I should have it .
Because I should have it , I need it .
Because I need it , I deserve it .
Because I deserve it , I will do anything necessary to get it . "
This is the artificial internal drive that the advertisers tap into .
You " imagine it " because they bombard your consciousness with its image until you then move to step two , " I want it ...etc. " This is one of the things that allows people to surrender to consumerism .
As a society we have gone from self - sufficiency based on our internal common sense of reasonable limits to the ridiculous goal of Keeping up with the Jones then to stampeding for the Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous , or at least as far as our credit limit or home equity line allows us to go .
The New Road Map Foundation illustrates with cogent statistics the dichotomy between things , happiness and the health of the environment .
Happiness can't be purchased in the marketplace , no matter how much advertising tries to convince you of it .
Market driven forces have ursurped the role once assumed by family , home , common - sense and community .
We have been programmed to believe that we should pursue more money to spend on more things offered in the marketplace , to be living mannequins for the material adornments of the hour , our worth determined by what we have or do n't have , rather than what we are , what we do or what we know .
Consumerism , already having captured death as a consumer obligation whereby sadness and regret are quenched by spending lots of money , now turns major life events like weddings and births into consumer events with their own hierarchy of demands for the things which assume a life of their own .
For example , the bride 's dress and accessories assumes far more significance in the telling than the bride 's state of mind .
Baby shower gifts take precedence over helping with the baby .
Consumerism has crossed the last frontier into memories .
Underemployed people all over America are buying supplies to start their own ' business ' selling scrapbook supplies so that people can gain the ' appropriate ' access to their own history .
Recreation has become commercialized .
Special leisure clothing , sporting equipment and attendance at expensive sporting events rife with advertising and corporate sponsorship are the manifestation of consumerism in recreation .
Oakland , California , a community with high levels of unemployment and poverty has banks that are now creating special loan categories so that people can get personal lines of credit to buy season tickets to the taxpayer - financed stadium .
" Sports is another crucial example of the indoctrination system . . .
It offers people something to pay attention to that is of no importance . . .
It keeps them from worrying about things that matter to their lives that they might have an idea of something about . . .
People have the most exotic information and understanding about all sorts of arcane issues . . .
It 's a way of building up irrational attitudes of submission to authority , and group cohesion behind leadership elements , in fact its training in irrational jingoism . . .
That 's why energy is devoted to supporting them . . . and advertisers are willing to pay for them . "
Noam Chomsky from Manufacturing Consent
Pro - sports contribute next - to - nothing to communities economically yet they are sucking public dollars that could be better spent on parks , schools and public services into millionaires / billionaire 's pockets and deluding a whole generation of at - risk youth into believing in the possibility of an " athletic career " .
Sports Still No Ticket Out Of The Ghetto
Professional sports are are just an example of synthesized and packaged reality designed to enrich people already rich , subject the observer to yet another layer of advertising , and to maintain the intellectual impoverishment of those watching .
" College - sports any better ?
Football is the S.U.V. of the college campus : aggressively big , resource - guzzling , lots and lots of fun and potentially destructive of everything around it .
Big - time teams award 85 scholarships and , with walk - ons , field rosters of 100 or more players .
( National Football League teams make do with half that . )
At the highest level , universities wage what has been called an ' ' athletic arms race ' ' to see who can build the most lavish facilities to attract the highest - quality players .
Dollars are directed from general funds and wrestled from donors , and what does not go into cherry - wood lockers , plush carpets and million - dollar weight rooms ends up in the pockets of coaches , the most exalted of whom now make upward of $ 2 million a year .
. . College sports now consists of a class of super - behemoths -- perhaps a dozen or so athletic departments with budgets of $ 40 million and up -- and a much larger group of schools that face the choice of spending themselves into oblivion or being embarrassed on the field . "
N.Y. Times Magazine 12/22/02
Take all the mental and sometimes physical energy , the money and the time that the average American spends on professional and college sports and divert it to the care and maintenance of local public schools ; we could be the best educated people in the world !
Notice how recent talk about revitalizing our schools revolves around the purchase of computer equipment rather than raising teacher 's salaries and spending more money per pupil ?
Local sports teams and activities like Little League and Youth Soccer are healthy and wonderful .
There is however , a tendency of the ongoing commercialization of even these IF people allow it .
The constant cycle of work and consumption is destructive enough of values , but when extra hours must be worked to maintain the same level of consumption , or when insufficient work , or no work at all is available , and a family goes into debt to accumulate more things , or feels worthless because of a lack of the " right " possessions , consumerism is slow societal suicide .
Time , the precious shrinking commodity of our lives , is exchanged for money to buy things that there usually is little time to enjoy .
What time is left after work is often devoured by television , basically a series of ever - more mediocre filler programs inserted between ever - more - spectacular commercials whose purpose is to stoke further desire for more things .
When these insatiable material desires fail to be satisfied , people grow unhappy with their lives and in extreme cases riot and loot to get that they have been " programmed " to want .
People become used to the intrusion of advertising into their consciousness in the form of television or the massive bundle of advertising pulp that masquerades as a Sunday newspaper and and so they fail to protect themself , or worse , their children from being seduced by it .
Convinced that their self worth is based on $ 500 athletic shoes or designer clothing , children are already on the road to spiritual dissatisfaction and resentment as well as a perception of diminished self - worth .
When they become adolescents they are probably not going to be happy or productive even were they provided with an endless supply of things that few parents could afford .
An extreme example of this is when some , usually poor adults , who could often better use the money for education , nutrition and improved housing , demonstrate their self worth and strength of character by turning themselves into human billboards in plastic clothing advertising millionaire 's sports franchises .
Their children may , to the detriment of education , pin all hopes on an athletic " career " , i.e. lots of money for endorsing consumer items .
This is nation building ?
Where once parents shared the home with their adult children , acting as baby - sitters and providers of wisdom and tradition , we now have corporate owned day care and rest homes .
This preservation of nuclear family ties is one reason that some immigrant groups are still able to excel economically until the second generation ( usually ) becomes affected by consumerism , abandons its parents ' values and then often goes overboard using material objects as a means of self - identification with American society .
" Quality Time " has become a commodity unto itself .
Unfortunately , there is no marketplace for quality time , you have to preserve it for yourself .
Why not use the time in your life , skip the money and the taxation and go straight for the happiness that usually comes from the non-material ?
This process is part of overcoming consumerism .
Economic
COSTS OF CONSUMERISM
The more consumerism spreads , the weaker is the incentive to manufacture long - lasting , quality products , and the greater the likelihood that cheaply made products will instead be imported from the lowest - wage , environmentally unregulated overseas manufacturer that mobile capital , ever seeking the highest return , can find .
The nationwide loss of manufacturing jobs leads to a corresponding growth in unemployment and the number of welfare recipients , less personal wealth , a shrinking tax base , fewer public services , and greater public and private debt , hopelessness for job seekers and a growing negative balance of trade .
Americans can't really afford to buy the house next door but guess who has lots of dollars to spend here because of the money that we 're exporting to buy their cheap junk ?
By facilitating the sale of whatever is advertised and sold , without examination by the purchaser of quality , origin , environmental degradation or traditions of manufacture , Consumerism fuels the destruction of the productive economy .
That was written in 2002 .
So how 's that Global Economy doing for you and your family now ?
What about the argument that " we are in a global marketplace and exports ( and therefore imports ) create jobs ? "
The flood of spending on imports creates a need for compensating export earnings .
This quest for export earnings turns the U.S. into a traitor to principles that this nation supposedly fought for in several recent wars , and generates an eagerness to embrace potential export markets , no matter what the human rights or environmental records of these countries may be , or how much damage this does to American workers .
Another part of this attempted juggling act of trade balances is to justify the further strip - mining of our own natural heritage in order to gain further export earnings , i.e .
Redwood logs from our ancient cathedral forests are sent to Mexico to be milled on machinery that once was tended by well paid Americans in the U.S. or Alaskan oil drilled in wildlife refuges is sent to Japan .
The boots and uniforms worn by US soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq are made in China .
The Keystone Pipeline from Canada to Texas that is being considered will create incredible pollution in Canada , along its route through the breadbasket of America and in Texas .
It will produce bottom of the barrel sludgey diesel that will be exported .
Imports may create a few loudly touted jobs , but their main product is quiet but spectacular profits for transnational corporations that export our employment while importing low quality products and selling them here for a slight or no reduction in price .
" Free trade " laws are promoted so that American corporations can export pollution finally regulated here and import tariff - free goods back into the US from their foreign subsidiaries in whatever Sweatshop Republic they can find the cheapest workers .
NAFTA is a codified example of this policy carried out at a national level .
More recent attempts at promoting other free trade agreements have been thwarted by citizen activism .
Some of the corporations behind nafta
Here 's a little historical tidbit from the link :
" Both GE workers and the community of Fort Wayne got swindled .
In 1988 , the employees had agreed to a $ 1.20 per hour wage cut to prevent their jobs from being moved to Mexico .
Then in 1992 , GE managed to squeeze a $ 485,290 tax cut out of the local government , claiming it was necessary to defray the cost of new machinery needed to preserve jobs .
Once NAFTA passed , the wage cuts and the tax breaks were not enough to keep those jobs in Fort Wayne . [ they went to Mexico ]
As one longtime GE employee put it , " You give them all your life , and this is what they give you . "
( Wonder if he and his family and friends will actively boycott G.E. products and services ?
We hope so . )

Maytag : Hecho en Mejico
" They want Americans to buy their products , but they do n't want to put Americans to work making those products . "
Published on Tuesday , December 31 , 2002 by the Chicago Tribune The Big Lie About Free Trade Turns out it 's American workers who are waving goodbye to their jobs by Bernie Sanders Though I am a congressman from Vermont , it outrages me that Maytag Corp. will shut down production at its refrigerator factory in Galesburg , Ill. , and lay off the plant 's 1,600 workers by late 2004 .
Maytag is using the North America Free Trade Agreement , which I opposed , to move its plant to Mexico .
In Mexico it will be able to hire workers at $ 2 an hour , rather than pay the average wage of $ 15.14 earned by workers in Galesburg .
And the Newton , Iowa , appliance manufacturer is closing its Illinois plant despite recent concessions from the union and substantial sums of corporate welfare given it by city , county and state governments .
Illinois citizens should have no illusions that what is happening in Galesburg is unique .
I can tell you that the same thing is happening in my state .
In fact , it 's happening in many regions of the country .
In Vermont , in recent years , as a result of such disastrous trade policies as NAFTA , most - favored - nation status with China and permanent normal trade relations with China and other trade agreements , we have lost thousands of decent paying jobs in Shaftsbury , Newport , St. Johnsbury , East Ryegate , Island Pond , Randolph , Orleans , Bennington , Springfield and Windsor - - among other communities .
The simple truth is that our nation 's manufacturing base is collapsing .
As unemployment rises , more and more Americans are searching for non-existent jobs .
In the past two years we have lost just under 1.8 million factory jobs nationwide , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , and , at 16.5 million , we now have the lowest number of factory jobs in 40 years .
As the U.S. produces less and imports more , we have developed a huge trade deficit of more than $ 400 billion , including an $ 80 billion trade deficit with China .
Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages , many of them at part - time or temporary jobs with minimal benefits .
And yet , despite all of this , President Bush , almost all Republicans and many Democrats in Congress continue to spout the corporate line about how wonderful unfettered " free trade " is .
And the establishment media continue , in editorial after editorial , to repeat that big lie .
The simple truth is that American workers cannot , and should not , be " competing " against desperate workers in developing countries who are forced to work for pennies an hour .
This is creating a horrendous " race to the bottom . "
Aaron Kemp is a Maytag worker in Galesburg .
He expressed a lot more understanding of our current trade policies than most member of Congress when he told a reporter ; " This is heartbreaking .
This is one of the most unpatriotic , most un -American things I can imagine a company doing .
They want Americans to buy their products , but they do n't want to put Americans to work making those products . "
Clearly , we need fundamental changes in our trade policies .
If the American economy is going to survive , if our workers are to earn a living wage , corporations are going to have to start reinvesting in the United States .
In Washington , everybody knows what the story is .
President Bush and many members of Congress have received hundreds of millions in campaign contributions from the corporations that benefit from our free trade policies .
They have taken those donations -- and sold out American workers by giving their support to a trade policy that is destroying our economy .
If the U.S. is going to survive as a great economic power , we must rebuild our manufacturing base and create jobs that pay workers a living wage with decent benefits .

" Last August , construction - worker Troy Renault , his wife Tammy , and their five children were living in a comfortable , three - bedroom home in Lebanon , Tennessee .
Mike Osborne reports for Voice of America
News that the family now resides in a donated trailer on a local campground , having downgraded from about 1900 square feet to about 215 .
The Renault family 's slide into homelessness started nearly two years ago when Troy lost his construction job .
Troy Renault told Osborne that when the money got tight , the family started having to make some difficult choices .
" You wind up starting to think to yourself , ' Okay .
Do we go ahead and make the house payment and keep a roof over our head but have no lights and no water , or do you go ahead and keep those utilities on and forego the house payment , and hope that you can get it caught up ? '
And it just kept going where it got further and further behind until we wound up losing the home . "
The actual manufacture of products becomes almost a nuisance for conglomerates anxious to grow their capital and maximize profits through buying and closing factories , raiding pension plans , firing workers and using the paper losses to offset profits made elsewhere .
That 's what slaves in foreign countries are for .
BUT , how will Americans buy thier products if they no longer have jobs and if they do have jobs why should n't we go out of our way to boycott these job destroying companies ?
After reading the above story we will do everything we can to encourage everyone we know to boycott all Maytag products .
According to the highly respected and non-commercial Consumer Reports Magazine they were never that good to begin with .
( based on hundreds of thousands of subscriber surveys detailing the strengths and weaknesses of consumer goods )
Even service jobs are now also vulnerable to export .
Some companies are now using low wage workers in Ireland or India to staff their technical - support and order - taking phone lines or do insurance underwriting .
There is no technical reason why any person answering a telephone or sitting at a keyboard has to be physically located in the U.S.
What we 're talking about is you calling a softwear or warranty line and talking to someone making $ 1.10 a day in India or China .
Nor are professionals immune from this .
The same blind , unquestioning acceptance of consumerism will allow the export of even these service jobs if the companies that attempt this are not challenged by consumers .
Environmental
COSTS OF CONSUMERISM
Consumerism causes the wasteful use of energy and material far above and beyond that needed for everyday living at a comfortable level .
Money is not the only way to measure the cost of an item .
When one adds up all the raw materials and energy that go into the goods and services consumed over an individual 's lifetime , the toll on the environment is staggering .
When this cost is multiplied out over the lifespan of families , cities and countries , the proportions are incredible .
An example : 220 Billion cans , bottles , plastic cartons and paper cups , are thrown away each year in the " developed " world .
" Disposable " items exemplify this .
Rather than compete on quality or reliability , products are made for a one time use .
" Fun " is a catchword discarding notions of inherent value , longevity , and the environmental consequences of manufacture and disposal of the product .
Buying quality products that are warranteed against failure or wearing out , learning about the materials that things are made of , their national origin and the conditions of the workers that make them , are some ways of resisting consumerism and waste .
While there may be some new appliances and cars that are more productive and energy efficient , discarding the old often leads to an almost total waste of the energy and material already invested in these products .
This alone may more than nullify the energy savings of the new .
Getting
AWAY FROM CONSUMERISM
Having fewer things means enjoying what you have more and actually getting to use it , thereby raising its intrinsic value .
The less clutter that one has in their surroundings , the fewer distractions there are from the essentials such as family , friends , food , nature and study .
With less clutter , one needs a smaller space in which to live comfortably and thus needs to work less to pay rent to store things .
If you have n't used something in the last year , how much likelihood is there that you ever will use it ?
" The most important assets are brands .
Buildings age and become dilapidated .
Machines wear out .
Cars rust .
People die .
But what lives on are the brands . "
Hector Liang
Chairman , United Biscuits
" Products are made in the factory , but brands are created in the mind . "
- Walter Landor
Industrial Designer " When people have lost their authentic personal taste , they lose their personality and become instruments of other people 's wills . "
Robert Graves
Can brands survive ecosystem collapse or the fall of our government ?
Making do with less allows one to distance themself from the tendency of the victims of advertising to self - define according to the material objects possessed or not possessed , driven , drunk , worn , used , seen with or abused .
You usually see people thus affected in public places , lurking around a piece of machinery , such as a car or a boat .
They bask in its radiance , act respectful and imply knowledge about its quality and providence .
They act as they feel that they should act , making sure that others see them acting this way in the presence of the thing .
They can only communicate with each other through the medium of the object , the cold piece of metal , in the presence of which they feel that they can speak to each other and actually show some emotion and interact .
The thing , the product , becomes a longed for goal , a means of justifying their existence , a way of envisioning themself in a different world with possession of the thing being the key tenet .
Particular speech patterns often develop around things to the exclusion of the personal qualities of the speaker , as in
" I used to have a ..... " /" Yeah , friend of mine , he 's got a " 57 ..... " , " last night I drank two .... and a six pack of .... " , " she was wearing ... " , " we did two .... then a .... have you seen the new ... " " ... how about those Forty - Niners ?... "
" Look what I got ... " " what do you think about American Idol ? "
Empty , hollow words , bespeaking a personal void filled by the pursuit of things .
Getting away from need for things is at least a start in allowing people to communicate and then once communicating , beginning to solve real problems in their home , community , nation and the world .
*********************************
This then is the problem .
Are there any personalities that are responsable for the negative influence of consumerism ?
All of us of course - how can any one individual be at fault in this ?
There IS one man who bears inordinate responsability for this , as a sidebar to this page we would like to introduce you to a little known man who took the techiques of his uncle , Sigmund Freud and turned them into tools to sell to , demoralize , impoverish some people while enriching certain others : here is his story :
http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-century-of-the-self/
Bernays invented the public relations profession in the 1920s and was the first person to take Freud 's ideas to manipulate the masses .
He showed American corporations how they could make people want things they did n't need by systematically linking mass - produced goods to their unconscious desires .
Bernays was one of the main architects of the modern techniques of mass - consumer persuasion , using every trick in the book , from celebrity endorsement and outrageous PR stunts , to eroticising the motorcar .
His most notorious coup was breaking the taboo on women smoking by persuading them that cigarettes were a symbol of independence and freedom ...
There are a growing number of people who are aware that these aspects of consumerism are some of the main obstacles to living in a pleasant safe community , seeing their children well - educated and living long healthy productive lives , without squander and waste .

Rupert Murdoch .
The Wall Street Journal online edition is the poster child for the argument in favor of paid subscriptions for news Web sites .
WSJ.com has 400,000 paid online subscribers ( hundreds of thousands more get the site along with their print subscription ) , giving other publishers hope that some way , somehow , someday , they can charge for online content .
Well , I ditched my WSJ.com subscription last month , after almost 15 years ( I was a charter subscriber , in fact ) .
Why ?
At $ 155 a year , it was just too expensive — even as a business - expense writeoff , which btw is a major reason why WSJ.com is an outlier in the online - subscription argument .
Insanely , I could only reduce the cost of the annual subscription if I agreed to receive the printed Journal , as well .
( Yes , you read that right . )
Then I 'd just pay $ 99 a year .
The wacky logic of this continues to escape me , and I just do n't want that newsprint piling up in the recycling bin , untouched .
So I canceled .
And I have n't missed a thing .
This is the dark secret , and the Achilles heel , of the Journal 's — and Rupert Murdoch 's — paid - content business model aspirations .
It turns out that most of the key content of the supposedly for - pay Journal is available online for , um , free .
And it 's not hard to find .
No , Google is n't stealing it , nor is some aggregator .
It 's all sitting right there on the WSJ.com site , if you know where to find it .
Hiding in plain sight ( or site ) , as it were .
This is n't rocket science .
Basically , I just had to change a couple of my longstanding Journal URLs .
It turns out that about half the paper — especially the excellent " soft " features in Personal Journal and Weekend Journal , among the WSJ 's best content — is readily available on the WSJ site , unprotected by the paywall , for some reason .
( You 'd think that 's the kind of unique stuff they 'd want to charge for . )
The best of the Journal 's technology coverage , including Walt Mossberg 's computer column , is free on Mossberg 's affiliated site , AllThingsD .
My most personalized use of WSJ.com , the stock portfolio ( and related news coverage of specific companies ) is on the " free " side of the WSJ.com paywall , though it 's easily replaceable elsewhere .
Even the legendary Wall Street Journal a-heds — the quirky , eminently readable front - page features that have been sadly diminished under Murdoch — are on the free side of the WSJ.com paywall .
And just about everything else — even breaking stories — can be found ... well , I wo n't give it away .
But it involves using Google in a quite obvious way .
OK , I 've lost access to the WSJ archives — but I rarely used that feature anyway .
In sum , life without a paid subscription to the Wall Street Journal turns out to be not much different than it was when Dow Jones was dinging my credit card for ever larger dollar amounts every year .
And I 've now got a spare $ 155 to blow on iPad apps ( though not the Journal 's ! ) .
All of this , of course , assumes that the financial and business coverage that the Journal provides is so unique that anyone should be paying for it .
Sometimes , that 's true — when the Journal is at its best on business stories , there 's little better .
But huge amounts of what the Journal covers — the daily flotsam and jetsam of corporate news , numbers , reports , etc. , is available all over the Web , on sites like Yahoo Finance , or from CNBC 's excellent — and free — iPhone app .
Besides , the Journal feels less and less like the Journal anymore , anyway .
Increasingly , as Murdoch pursues his war of attrition with The New York Times , the Journal is devoting more and more attention and space to non-business national and international stories that are widely available elsewhere .
Problem is , there 's really nothing that unique about the Journal 's coverage of the oil spill , or the Kagan nomination , or the British election ( or New York City ) .
There are countless free sources to replace or substitute for them .
This , of course , is the deepest flaw in any online - subscription theory : that equivalent coverage is available for free , a click or two away .
Even the Journal can't enforce the kind of exclusivity that would make it worth paying for — it 's too easy to look elsewhere .
And by pursuing his Times - killing strategy — which is nonetheless fascinating in its own right — Murdoch is watering down the product that I previously was happy to pay for .
So I 'm no longer a subscriber to WSJ.com .
But I 'm still a reader .
That will make the advertisers happy , I suppose .
But somehow it should n't be so easy .
One last thing :
When I called Dow Jones customer service to cancel my WSJ.com subscription , the response was , simply , " OK , thanks . "
HUH ?
You 're losing a paying customer , people .
At minimum you should ask why — and try to convince me to stay on .
But nope , there was zero objection .
Nada .
Nothing .
Same thing happened when I canceled my print subscription to The Washington Post a few years back ( and I 've encountered other folks who've had the same experience canceling The Post and other papers ) .
Memo to newspapers :
When losing customers is a critical problem , you might want to try a little harder to keep them from simply leaving , OK ?
You should n't let them go without a fight — or at least a discount offer .
Then again , I 'd assumed that I 'd allow myself to be lured back to WSJ.com by an inevitable ( I think ) discount pitch after a few months as a non-subscriber .
Now , after seeing what I can get without paying for it , I 'm not so sure .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Angry Turks mourned activists killed in Israel ’s seizure of a Gaza - bound aid ship , as Israel sought Thursday to deflect U.N. demands for an international inquiry by offering its own probe with outside observers .
But a new potential crisis loomed in Israel ’s four - year blockade of the Gaza Strip , as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed the military to prevent another pro-Palestinian ship from reaching the territory .
“ We will not permit the ship to enter Gaza , ” an official in his office quoted Netanyahu as telling a forum of senior cabinet ministers Thursday .
Crew of the MV Rachel Corrie say the ship will reach Gaza by Saturday .
Netanyahu said attempts to persuade the vessel , named after an American woman killed by an Israeli bulldozer in Gaza in 2003 , to dock at the Israeli port of Ashdod for inspection had been rejected .
He also ordered Israeli forces to exercise “ caution and politeness ” in handling the ship so as to avoid harm to any passengers , an official in his office said .
Officials said Netanyahu was considering some form of international role in enforcing an arms embargo on Gaza , while letting in civilian goods , but then declined to elaborate .
Israel says its blockade is vital to prevent missiles from reaching fighters who will fire them from Gaza into Israel .
President Barack Obama was quoted in a interview with CNN as saying Israel “ has legitimate security concerns ” about the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip .
But he also said Israel ’s blockade was preventing Gaza ’s people from pursuing economic opportunities , CNN reported .
Obama described this week ’s flotilla incident as a “ tragic situation ” but also said it needed to be used as an opportunity to advance the Israeli - Palestinian peace process .
Turkey continued to fume over the killings of nine of its nationals , one of whom also held U.S. citizenship .
Thousands thronged an Istanbul funeral for eight of the pro-Palestinian activists who died in Monday ’s naval commando raid .
“ Turkey will never forget such an attack on its ships and its people in international waters .
Turkey ’s ties with Israel will never be the same again , ” President Abdullah Gul said of once - close relations with a strategic ally .
ISRAELIS PROTEST
In Tel Aviv , nearly 1,000 Israelis , seething at world criticism of what they saw as a defensive act , held a flag - waving protest outside the embassy of Turkey , a nation Israel until recently viewed as a key Muslim ally in the region .
Slideshow ( 27 images )
Many chanted slogans denouncing Turkey ’s leaders , and an Israeli television station showed one protester waving a doctored photograph that depicted Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan , lately a leading critic of Israel , as Hitler .
Pro-Palestinian activists from the ships seized by Israel , freed after two days incommunicado in Israeli jail , described Monday ’s raid as a “ bloodbath , ” with people on the Gaza flotilla shot dead and desperate efforts to treat the wounded .
Israel says its troops fired only in self - defense after meeting fierce resistance aboard the cruise liner Mavi Marmara .
Slideshow ( 27 images )
Bulent Yildirim , the head of a Turkish charity that organized the flotilla , denied Israeli claims that the activists opened fire first , with guns seized from the Israelis .
He said activists had seized guns but threw them overboard .
Israeli military spokesman Captain Ayre Shalicar said the resistance from those on board had been unexpected .
He repeated allegations that the activists had fired guns they had seized .
Andre Abu Khalil , a Lebanese cameraman for Al Jazeera TV , said activists initially wounded and captured four Israelis from a first wave that boarded the ship .
A second wave of troops tried to storm the ship after the four were taken below decks .
Amid a global outcry which included Turkey recalling its ambassador from Tel Aviv , U.S. Vice President Joe Biden suggested an Israeli probe with international involvement , a proposal embraced by Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman .
“ I am in favor of an investigation .
We have enough high - level legal experts ... if they want to take on observers from the outside , they can invite observers , ” Lieberman said on Israel Radio .
Israel opposes a wholly independent probe after being stung last year by a U.N. inquiry into an offensive it launched in Gaza in December 2008 .
That inquiry found evidence Israeli forces committed war crimes , which it denies .
In the occupied West Bank , U.S. Middle East envoy George Mitchell said the “ tragedy of the last week ” must not undermine indirect negotiations he is mediating between Israel and the Palestinians , which he said were making some progress .
In his interview with CNN , Obama , who meets next week with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Washington , also said he hoped the incident could provide an opportunity to advance recently renewed Israeli - Palestinian peace talks
Athletes are a notoriously superstitious lot .
For years , Michael Jordan wore the shorts from his national - championship - winning University of North Carolina days under his Chicago Bulls uniform .
Serena Williams wo n’t change her socks at tournaments she ’s winning .
Other professional athletes carry lucky charms or perform rituals , like bouncing a basketball in elaborate sequences before a free throw or kissing the golf ball before a putt .
Jason Giambi ( the former Yankee and current Colorado Rockies first baseman ) has said that he slips on a pair of “ lucky ” thong underwear when his batting average falls .
The thong ’s reputation is so potent that slumping teammates reportedly beg to borrow it .
Despite this fidelity to charms and rituals , however , there has been little scientific proof that such superstitions work .
Does believing in luck actually make you a better athlete ?
Or would Michael Jordan have been just as successful without his undershorts ?
A new study published online in the journal Psychological Science provides some intriguing answers and makes a compelling case that each of us should find lucky underwear of our own .
For the study , researchers in the psychology department at the University of Cologne in Germany completed a series of experiments .
In the first , they recruited 28 college students to try to make as many putts as possible on a putting green .
Before his or her first attempt , each participant was handed a golf ball .
Some were told , “ Here is your ball ; so far it has turned out to be a lucky ball . ”
The rest were told , more blandly , “ This is the ball everyone has used so far . ”
Each student putted 10 times .
The students using the “ lucky ” balls sunk significantly more putts than those who did n’t .
Next the researchers had a different group of students complete a dexterity test .
The students were given a plastic cube containing 36 balls and a shelf dimpled with 36 holes .
They were told to dip and twist the box until the balls rested in the holes .
First , though , they were given instruction from a moderator , who told some of the volunteers , “ I press the thumbs for you , ” a German idiom that means , approximately , “ I ’m keeping my fingers crossed for you ; good luck . ”
The rest received neutral directions .
By a fairly significant margin , the volunteers who had been offered good luck maneuvered the balls into position fastest .
Finally , the researchers tested whether people performed mental tests ( of memory and vocabulary ) more proficiently when they had a lucky charm with them .
As it turned out , they did .
They also reported feeling more confident about their ability to perform the tasks when their chosen charm was tucked up beside them than when it was in the next room ( ostensibly to be photographed ) .
Perhaps most tellingly , they tended to work harder and persevere longer at the tasks than the charmless group — apparently believing that since luck was with them , they should n’t quit too soon .
The conclusion from these combined experiments was fairly obvious .
“ Activating a good - luck superstition , ” the authors wrote , “ leads to improved performance by boosting people ’s belief in their ability to master a task . ”
More precisely , they added , “ the present findings suggest that it may have been the well - balanced combination of existing talent , hard training and good luck - underwear that made Michael Jordan perform as well as he did . ”
But while this study suggests that superstitions can improve performance , the underlying physiological mechanisms remain complex and rather mysterious .
Does the confidence inspired by lucky underwear lower nervous - system arousal , for instance , or otherwise reduce physiological stress ?
A number of scientists are looking into those issues .
But for now , what psychologists — and fans — suspect is that superstitions are more common among the best athletes , the most invested and the hardest - working , the very people you might expect not to need luck .
Another telling recent experiment found that superstitions flourish particularly in situations where talent is nearing its limits .
In the 2008 work , researchers at Colorado College in Colorado Springs , had a group of students putt .
The first round of putts were easy , measuring only three feet to the cup .
The second round consisted of nine - foot putts .
Each volunteer putted 20 times at each distance .
Students could choose their balls for each putt from a basket containing four different colors .
During the easy round , the best putters pulled balls out at random ; they were n’t interested in the colors .
But the less - able students , those who were n’t good at putting , tended to pick the same colored ball after any successful putt .
( It had become their “ lucky ” ball . )
When the testing moved to the longer putts , the better golfers started picking the same - colored ball after successful putts .
As their skills were being challenged , they began turning to luck to increase their chances .
Meanwhile , the less - talented putters , who generally missed all of the longer putts anyway , no longer seemed to care which ball they used .
Luck could n’t help them now .
The lesson from this and the other experiments is , at its most basic , that being superstitious is a sign not of weakness but probably “ of hope , ” says Kristi Erdal , a professor of psychology at Colorado College and the senior author of the putting study .
You may be turning to an external , intangible force , but you have n’t given up .
Of course , there can be a downside to being superstitious in sports .
“ If athletes focus their energies on minor superstitious behaviors over training , ” Ms. Erdal said in an e-mail message , “ or if the superstition is so entrenched that its disruption ( someone steals Jordan ’s shorts ) leads him to play horribly because of the associated anxiety , ” then good luck becomes its opposite .
For most of us , though , most of the time , being superstitious is not wholly negative , she wrote .
A lucky thong could probably help each of us perform at our best .
Francisco Olvera says all he did was take a cop 's photo with his cell phone .
And for that , he claims , he was thrown into the back of a police car , handcuffed at the police station , made the butt of racist jokes by officers , and jailed on false charges .
Olvera , of Sealy , a small town of about 6,000 souls about 50 miles from Houston , is now suing that city , its police chief and the arresting officer in federal court .
As first reported by Courthouse News Service , Olvera says he was at home working on a project out on his patio last October when he turned on some music using his 4 - inch computer speakers .
Soon after , he jumped in the car to get supplies at a hardware store , but when he returned , a cop appeared on his patio , allegedly there to check - out a complaint about the music .
Olvera says that the officer never asked him to turn the music down , but did want to see an ID .
When Olvera walked inside to grab his wallet , which was on the kitchen counter , the officer apparently followed him inside .
That 's when the trouble seems to have begun .
Olvera claims that since he never invited the officer inside , he believed the cop had no right to follow him indoors .
To document this , Olvera says he yanked out his cell phone and snapped a shot of the officer standing in his home .
According to the lawsuit , the officer quickly became angry and told Olvera he was engaging in " illegal photography . "
The officer then saw a can of beer on the kitchen counter , Olvera claims , which prompted the officer to slap handcuffs on Olvera , put him in his police car and take him to the police station .
While at the station , Olvera claims , he was the subject of racist remarks .
Olvera says that the arresting officer said , " Do you know what I tell Mexicans when they get loud ? "
" What ? " replied another cop .
" No chinges con migo pinche culero . "
According to the lawsuit , the arresting officer translated it to mean , " Do n't be fucking with me . "
Olvera says he was then moved to the city jail , charged with public intoxication and " loud music . "
Three months later , Olvera says , a jury acquitted him on all charges .
Olvera 's civil rights lawsuit claims that he was illegally charged without probable cause , jailed illegally , and was the victim of an unreasonable search .
His attorney , Roland Darby , could not be reached .
COLUMBUS , Ohio --
He was called the " Assassin . "
Jack Tatum was one of the hardest hitters in the NFL , a Pro Bowl safety who intimidated opposing players with bone - jarring tackles that helped make his Oakland Raiders one of the toughest teams of its era .

He 's also a player who will always be tied to one of the game 's most tragic moments -- a hit in a preseason game that left New England Patriots receiver Darryl Stingley paralyzed from the neck down .
Tatum died Tuesday at age 61 in an Oakland hospital .
The cause was a massive heart attack , according to friend and former Ohio State teammate John Hicks .
Tatum had battled diabetes and other health problems for years , Hicks said .
The collision with Stingley happened Aug. 12 , 1978 , at Oakland Coliseum .
Stingley was cutting inside when he lunged for a pass which fell incomplete .
Bearing down at full speed from the opposite direction , Tatum met Stingley while the receiver was off balance and leaning forward .
Stingley crumpled to the ground , his fourth and fifth vertebrae severed .
Over the years , Stingley would regain limited use of his body , but he spent the rest of his life in an electric wheelchair .
He died in 2007 .
There were never words of consolation or an apology from Tatum , and the two players never spoke after the hit .
" It was tough on him , too , " Hicks said of Tatum .
" He was n't the same person after that [ hit ] .
For years he was almost a recluse . "
Tatum said he tried to visit Stingley at an Oakland hospital shortly after the hit but was turned away by Stingley 's family .
" It 's not so much that Darryl does n't want to , but it 's the people around him , " Tatum told the Oakland Tribune in 2004 .
" So we have n't been able to get through that .
Every time we plan something , it gets messed up .
Getting to him or him getting back to me , it never happens . "
Tatum , though , showed no remorse for his headhunting ways in a 1980 book , " They Call Me Assassin " and the follow - ups " They Still Call Me Assassin : Here We Go Again " in 1989 and " Final Confessions of an NFL Assassin " in 1996 .

So , is there an actual quote , comment or provable fact anywhere in this story ?
It seems like more conspiracy fodder , which io9 is usually smart enough about to at least present sarcastically .
It seems you 're going out of your way to present Apple as the evil monster in a story where the only demonstrable fact is that comedy central is a whiny smart - ass who picks fights then immediately grovels for forgiveness at the first whiff of controversy ( let alone actual resistance ) .
There is absolutely zero evidence that Apple itself has been involved at all , yet the accusation presented is that Apple mysteriously made it happen behind the scenes .
Paranoid ?
Gizmodo fallout ?
When you 've got a real quote from someone involved , then it 's news .
Otherwise it 's link - bait , and it 's lame at that .
Go pick on Disney .
Less well - off consumers remained more frugal , most likely constrained by unemployment , declines in home values and the disappearance of easy credit .
So the savings rate actually rose last year for those in middle - income brackets as they cut spending .
Job losses have disproportionately hit those at the lower end of the wage scale .
According to the Labor Department , the unemployment rate among people in management , business or financial occupations was 4.8 percent in June , compared to 9.5 percent over all , 18.2 percent in construction and 12.1 percent in production .
As a result , the affluent generally maintained their spending power at a time when others were losing it .
“ High - income households drove the economy out of recession into recovery and powered the recovery through its first year , ” Mr. Zandi concluded .
He added that although the incomes of the richest people might have been affected by swings in dividend payments or bonuses , the change in their savings rate was most likely driven by increased spending .
Affluent spenders “ began to come out of the bunker about this time last year , ” Mr. Zandi said , “ and part of it was related to the revival in the stock market . ”
Other economists suggest that while Mr. Zandi ’s conclusions make some sense , the data is hazy on the precise role that the rich have played in consumer spending .
“ We have tried to do other things like look at consumer expenditures on products mainly purchased by the rich and could never get anywhere , ” said Barry P. Bosworth , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution .
On the ground , those whose sales depend on affluent buyers have seen definite patterns .
Last year and early this year , when the major stock gauges were rising , “ everybody seemed to be a little bit more optimistic , ” said Tom Hauswirth , general manager and partner of Moritz Cadillac , BMW and Mini in Arlington , Tex. , near Dallas .
“ Then I think everybody was affected when they saw the stock market go below 10,000 , ” he said .
“ Even though it may not affect their ability to buy or not , it affects their thinking . ”
The President is emboldening critics who think he could use a shakeup in commanding generals to change the war plan .
Obama losing
Hill liberals on war
As President Barack Obama reaffirms his Afghanistan policy , he ’s also emboldening critics in Congress who think he should use a shake - up in commanding generals to change the course of what they believe is an intractable war .
“ I think he has to reassess the strategy , ” Rep. Jackie Speier ( D - Calif . ) said Thursday .
“ I ca n’t believe for a minute that he ’s not rethinking it . ”

Massachusetts Democrat Jim McGovern fired off a letter Wednesday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , asking her to hold off on a war - funding bill until Congress can assess the full fallout of a Rolling Stone article that concluded — without correction from the White House — that the president and his commanders have been backing off plans to withdraw starting in July 2011 .
The bottom line :
The president and congressional critics , long on a collision course over the war in Afghanistan , are hurtling ever faster toward each other since the ouster of Gen.
Stanley McChrystal , and doves on Capitol Hill are feeling a little tougher right now .
The anti-war coalition continues to be a thorn in the side of Democratic leaders , who are trying to find a way to move a war - funding bill over liberal objections and past a Republican Party unified in its opposition to using the must - pass $ 33 billion measure as a source of domestic spending .
War critics say Obama is missing a golden opportunity to use the McChrystal flap as an excuse to reshape his policy in Afghanistan .
Instead , he ’s reaffirming a policy that was shaped in large measure by McChrystal and using acclaimed Gen .
David Petraeus to execute it , leaving himself little room to cast blame should things go wrong .
“ He ’s doubling - down , ” said a senior Democratic congressional aide .
It ’s not clear how the funding fight , or the larger battle over conduct of the Afghanistan war , will be resolved .
But no one is backing down .
For 48 hours , Obama has been saying he ’s not interested in a recalibration of his policy , even gently mocking those who hope for a quick exit next summer .
“ We did not say , starting in July 2011 , suddenly there will be no troops from the United States or allied countries in Afghanistan , ” Obama said Thursday .
“ We did n’t say we ’d be switching off the lights and closing the door behind us . ”
But the firing of McChrystal — and the choice of Petraeus — has cleared the way for a fresh debate over the war .
And while Petraeus should cruise to confirmation , it ’s clear that many Democrats may love the general but are starting to hate the war .
“ Until a full and complete explanation of these [ McChrystal ] comments and views are presented to Congress , we believe that a vote of the House of Representatives on the administration ’s request for a supplemental appropriation for the war in Afghanistan would be inappropriate , ” McGovern and 29 colleagues wrote to Pelosi .
Of the McChrystal - Petraeus trade , McGovern said , “ Same menu , different waiter . ”
Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to be the peacemaker between the anti-war critics in her caucus and the president .
“ The president is the commander in chief , and we all stand by him in the decision that he made in terms of who would be in command in Afghanistan , ” she said .
“ So we ’ve trusted him before , we trust him now ; it ’s just a question of where people stand on our involvement in Afghanistan . ”
Petraeus , who was on Capitol Hill Thursday , will be back in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday for a hurriedly planned confirmation hearing .
The last time he met with the senators , he fainted during a round of questioning from Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , who has been among the lawmakers critical of the conduct of the war .
Rep . Joe Sestak , a retired Navy admiral who is the Democratic nominee for Senate in Pennsylvania , said Obama needs to give Congress a better sense of how he measures success in Afghanistan , so that lawmakers can make informed decisions for their constituents .
“ We have n’t gotten those metrics , ” he said .
“ The strategy may be working .
We just do n’t have the metrics . ”
Still , lawmakers hope there ’s room to revisit the policy after Petraeus is confirmed .
“ [ Obama ] would be imprudent not to have Gen .
Petraeus report back to him based on what he finds on the ground , ” Speier said .
Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) , a conservative on the Armed Services Committee , said after a Tuesday meeting with Petraeus that he is confident a fresh pair of hands will reshape the policy .
“ Anytime there is a change of command , there is an opportunity to fine - tune the approaches and strategies being used on the ground , ” Inhofe said .
“ After meeting with him in my office this morning , I know that is his plan going forward .
If anyone can take control of the effort in Afghanistan and see it through to a successful completion , Gen. Petraeus is that person . ”
Obama and war critics do agree on one key aspect :
They agree that the general is not as important as the policy .
“ We ’ll see how it works out , ” said Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla. ) , an outspoken opponent of the war .
“ It ’s too early to say .
But policy is more important than personnel .
Clearly , someone has to be in charge over there . ”
While most lawmakers are supportive of the Petraeus pick , some say no one — not even Ulysses S. Grant — could win the war .
“ That McChrystal thing is just a symptom of what we wo n’t face up to , which is that it ’s a totally failed policy , ” Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) told POLITICO .
“ If we were on the verge of a great success , do you think we ’d fire the general ?
So it was an absolute confirmation of the failed policy and yet the policy does n’t change .
They should have changed the policy and kept the general .
“ Maybe that would have been better , ” Paul said , before going on to say that it is the policymakers — not the military brass — who are to blame .
Defeat .
Boredom .
Lack of meaning in your life .
All these symptoms , and many others , of course , are a sign that you need to start fresh .
To run again .
To leave the old behind and embrace the new .
To ignite a new spark that will light a new life , with a deeper meaning , broader experience and much more fulfillment than you had so far .
A rebirth .
I started fresh for many times in my life , and , hopefully , I ’ll start fresh again .
Because , like it or not , change is the only permanent thing in this Universe .
Here are 50 proven ( and I ’m not kidding you ) ways to start fresh .
1. Accept Change
Sometimes starting over means accepting that you ’re no longer the person you used to be .
You ’re no longer attracted by the same things or persons , you ’re no longer driven by the same goals .
It ’s ok .
Do n’t blame yourself for it and do n’t try to resist .
Start over .
As hard as it may seem in the beginning .
You ’ll be surprised how fast things will fall into places again .
2. Just Leave
Quit the boring job , the abusive relationship , the past .
Embrace the unknown .
Make the first step .
Every trip starts with just one step .
You ’re resisting to this impulse because leaving is associated with letting someone else down .
Well , you wo n’t let nobody down if you ’ll step out of an abusive relationship .
But if you wo n’t leave , you will let down somebody very important : you ..
3. Accept To Meet Someone New
Too often we ’re unconsciously rejecting other people by habit .
Well , make a fracture in that habit .
Do n’t put a label on every person you meet , assuming you know beforehand who they are , what they do and how they can interact with you .
Open up , let yourself flow and look for the signs .
Many times my life was truly changed when I just accepted to meet someone new .
4. Accept Defeat
And move on .
Yes it hurts .
Yes , you lost something , or somebody .
Yes , your hopes are broken down and maybe so is the heart .
Accept it .
Close the battle and move on .
There is this very simple thing which many people are just blindly ignoring : you ca n’t have a new victory until you close your current battle ( by accepting defeat , if that ’s what just happened ) .
5 . Talk to somebody
It does n’t have to be a friend .
Anybody willing to listen will do it .
Just take it out of our chest .
Transform your experiences in words and let them out , transfer your story to somebody else .
Not only you ’ll feel a little better , but you may also find a new idea , a surprising solution or just the courage you lack to start fresh .
Let the others be the triggers of your change .
6. Do Something Reasonably Risky
Bungee jumping , for instance , if you ’re the physical type .
Or , if you ’re the shy guy , do a public speech in front of one thousand people .
The more consuming the challenge you ’re embracing , the faster you ’ll get out of your comfort zone .
And by getting out that comfort zone , you literally stretch your limits up to the point you ’re forced to break up with the past .
ZenTasktic – Productivity , Zen included
7. Go To A Live Event
A concert or other stuff involving hundreds or thousands of people .
Be in a crowd .
In something way bigger than yourself .
Blend in and lose your sense of identity ( which is false anyway , we ’re all part of something bigger ) .
Confronting your own tiny ego with this Â huge surrounding energy will make any decision you embrace much easier .
Especially a new start .
8. Write A Story About Your Past
Do n’t make it a novel and do n’t aim at publishing it .
Just write down in your own words what happened to you .
Describe the sequence of steps which drove your life to its current position .
Be verbose .
Do n’t rush .
And little by little you ’re going to realize that once you put it in words , your past will become more manageable and you ’ll be able to break up easier .
9 . Make A Plan
And stick to it .
10 . Enjoy The Victory And Move On
You do n’t have to start fresh only after a big defeat .
Victory is just the other face of the same coin .
Do n’t get too addicted to it , or you ’ll end up in a continuous frustration loop .
Attaching yourself to an already consumed victory is as bad as not accepting defeat .
Just because your prison cell is pink , that does n’t make it less of a prison cell .
Yes , you won this one .
Next .
11 . Make Peace With The Past
Accept ALL your past defeats and victories .
Accept all your past mistakes or brilliant decisions .
Accept that the moment you stepped out of a second , there ’s no way to live it again , because it ’s gone .
The past does n’t really exist , it ’s a human invention , just like the future .
Look around and accept that the only option you have is to live now .
Or not at all .
12 . Write Down The Worst Case Scenario
Ok , you wanna change , but you ’re not yet sure .
Then write down the worst case scenario .
What could go wrong ?
Pick the worst possible case .
Write it down and be very careful at the details .
It will not only make you more aware about what you really are up to , but it will also reveal that it ’s much more easier than you feel .
Hoping for the best and preparing for worse .
13 . Clean Up Your Closet
Throw away clothes , things , devices , memories .
They drag you down .
Clean up your room , wipe the dust , get rid of the clutter .
The more you do that , the more you ’ll realize that things are not you .
The more you let go , the more lighter you ’ll feel .
And that will make you move easier and faster .
Change will look like a natural path , not an effort .
14 . Limit The Stuff You Own
Get rid of your possessions .
Do it until your life will finally become a matter of enjoying your time here and not managing your stuff .
I ’m sure everybody was there : you badly need something , you get it and enjoy it , but after a certain time ( and a certain number of things you own ) you spend more time managing your inventory than living your life .
15 . Format Your Hard-disk
If your brain could be assimilated to a computer hard - disk , do a raw format .
“ Accidentally ” lose some data .
Re-arrange drastically all your information and intently destroy some of your hard - disk sectors .
After you ’ll finish moaning the “ disaster ” , you will will have no other chance than to push yourself forward , in order to be functional again .
16 . Update Your Life Device Drivers
Redesign your social circle , your friends , your goals .
Continuing the metaphor above , if your brain is a computer hard - disk , than your interactions will be assimilated to the drivers .
Re -write them .
Re-engineer your social life at a much deeper level .
Ignore the old devices , update and upgrade .
The old you is obsolete and your old life is deprecated .
17 . Break Up A Habit
Sometimes all you need in order to ignite a bigger change is just shifting some small , unconscious behaviors .
Like a habit , you know .
Before engaging in a bigger change , start by breaking up a small habit .
Tiny moves ( or baby steps , if you prefer ) are easier to do and to monitor .
Just stack small victory over small victory .
You ’ll soon be there .
18 . Create A New Habit
But , as hard as it may be to understand and accept , we are living huge parts of our life on auto - pilot .
By habit .
So , breaking up a habit will only take you half way .
From there , you gotta try to build a new habit .
The good thing is that you ’re consciously choosing a new habit now .
There is not any bad thing about starting a new habit , by the way . 🙂
19 . Find Out What Went Wrong
And write it down somewhere visible .
Keep it in front of your eyes .
Day in and day out .
If you really did something wrong , then make it painfully obvious .
If somebody else did something wrong to you , remember it .
In both cases , tell to yourself : “ I wo n’t do this anymore ” .
This aggressive visualization will push you to something new .
And maybe better .
20 . Commit To Someone New
A new friend , a new personal relationship or a new business partner .
The keyword here is “ commit ” , not “ new ” .
Be there for somebody else , hook up to something or somebody .
Too often we ’re hit by life when we try to unglue , to subtract ourselves , to give up , to avoid .
Exercising commitment to someone new will help you avoid this situation .
21 . Reconnect With An Old Friend
Find somebody you did n’t speak to in the last 10 years .
Re-connect .
Start understanding his or her life , see how your paths took different ways .
Your life will certainly look different after this reconnection .
By shifting your perspective , you ’ll start to understand which parts of you are the same , and which ones are changed .
Like in a spiral path .
22 . Move Somewhere Else
Live in another place .
Your physical environment has a memory of itself , interlinked with yours .
Changing your current surroundings will make those dragging memories fade away .
Moving in a different city , or even a different country will push you to completely redesign your life .
It may be stressful and painful in the beginning .
But , eventually , it will change .
23 . Flip A Coin
The elders had a name for it : asking the gods .
If a coin wo n’t do the job for you , feel free to use whatever divination method you ’re comfortable with : dice , yi-king , astrology , whatever .
Just keep in mind there will be a significant amount of hazard in this .
And sometimes hazard is exactly what you need in order to destroy a poisonous structure .
24 . Restart Your Morning Routine
Mornings are certainly underrated .
They have a huge influence on our lives .
A small insertion in your morning routine could have incredibly deep effects .
In fact , the way you ’re starting your morning will completely shape the way you ’re spending the whole day .
A butterfly flapping its wings in Venezuela can generate a storm in Australia , they say .
25 . Create And Keep Close A Minimum Survival Kit
It ’s not about clothes or food , this minimum survival kit .
It ’s more about a certain attitude and life skills .
Be prepared , keep hope and avoid excessive baggage .
Stay thin .
If you ’re on the adventurous edge , you can also stay fool and hungry , that will certainly bring some excitement in your life .
But do n’t forget that survival kit , it ’s incredibly useful .
26 . Change Your Game
We ’re all playing games .
Even if we think we do n’t , we do .
We play the game of the career , the game of the family , the game of being rich or poor .
By transforming every part of your life into a social game , you will empower yourself .
It ’s much easier to start a game than to repair a serious situation .
It ’s just a game , what could go wrong in a game ?
27 . Do The Magic Fairy Exercise
Every time you ’re stuck , go meet your fairy tale .
I know , we ’re not all having our personal fairy tale , floating around ready to fulfill our deepest , craziest desires .
And yet , you can do something else : you can pretend that that fairy exists and that she can really fulfill you any desire .
Just be very careful about what you ’re asking .
Because you ’re going to get it , eventually .
28 . De-virus Your Mind
If you ’re going to start fresh , one of the things that would really help is to realize your mind is not perfect .
In other words , do n’t believe everything you think .
Your mind may be the victim of many social viruses , and you ’re certainly not aware of many of them .
Just take some distance from your own thoughts every once in a while .
De-virus your mind .
29 . Laugh More Often
It may be that you ’re fighting to get back your life , to find your purpose or to attain your goal .
Be there , be a warrior , but do n’t forget to laugh .
Even in the most difficult part of your lives you can find reasons to laugh .
Too much commitment , too much strain , too much seriousness will have in the end the opposite effect .
They ’ll drag you down .
30 . Start Teaching Others
You do have a talent .
You do have some special skills .
That talent , it does n’t really have to be spectacular , you know , but it ’s really something that defines you .
Use it , do n’t loose it .
Sometimes the only way to learn something new is to teach others .
By sharing your knowledge , time and experience , you ’ll in fact ignite new ways to live your life .
31 . Write A Book
Any book .
Unblock your thoughts , if you ’re the organized type and just got stuck , or get the courage to imagine new worlds , if fantasy is your type .
Chose a topic you know or like and stick with it .
A book is wonderful milestone .
Even if it wo n’t change your entire life immediately , something important will shift inside .
Creativity is a magical thing .
32 . Practice Your “ Yes ”
Real , sustainable change is never about negativity .
You can not change as long as you are in denial , right ?
This is what denial means , by the way : resistance to new .
Any genuine change will be fueled by your capacity to say “ Yes “ .
The good news is that this ability can be strengthened the same way you strengthen your muscles at the gym .
Practice your “ Yes ” .
33 . Practice Your “ No ” Too
It goes hand in hand with the one above .
Learn how to say “ No “ .
To an abusive relationship , to a boring job , to a limiting context .
The more you practice , the better you ’ll get at .
Do n’t take anything for granted .
You have the power to say “ No ” to certain things in your life .
You have the power to say “ No ” to the past , and “ Yes ” to the present .
34 . Quit Being A Quitter
Quitting something ( your job , your family , your friends ) does n’t mean you start fresh , it means you ’re not finishing your stuff .
Quit doing this , take responsibility and do your part of the job .
If you committed to something , finish it .
It may be difficult , but until you consume everything you set up for that meal , you wo n’t be able to fill your plate again .
35 . Keep ( And Read ) A Log Of Your Breakthroughs
Sort of a personal history of things your consider important in your life .
It may be the fact that you had the courage to speak to somebody , or the fact that you climbed the Everest .
If you think it will help , you can share them , but that ’s not compulsory .
What is compulsory is to read them from time to time .
It will pump you up beyond expectation .
36 . Learn How To Be Ridiculous
Too often we ’re rejecting change and fail to start fresh by fear of rejection .
What if I ’m going to be laughed at ?
What if people will reject me because I will be clumsy or shy in the beginning ?
Well , they may reject you .
You will be ridiculous if you start something completely fresh .
And that ’s the good news .
Learn how to be ridiculous .
It ’s an art .
37 . Take An Interview With Yourself
Yes , you ’re a star and yes you deserve exposure .
You can light this world with awesomeness .
Take an interview with yourself .
It does n’t necessarily have to contain exactly these questions , but you can start with them .
Just be honest .
Put it aside for a week or two and then come back and read it .
You really want to be that person ?
38 . Practice Hazard
Learn how to get from A to B in 5 easy steps .
Leave your mind free and see where it goes .
That ’s a great exercise not only for enhancing your creativity , but also for strengthening your change muscles .
While it will not directly build up your courage to take action , you ’ll learn how to spot opportunities and broaden your vision .
39 . Keep Your Brain Fit
The most important tool you have is your brain .
You have this amazing engineering machinery with you all the time and yet , you chose to use only a tiny percent of its capacity .
You would n’t be able to climb a mountain without a fit body , right ?
Then be sure you would n’t go through a complex and difficult change without a fit and agile brain .
40 . Clean Up Your Lenses
The road to meaningful change may be right in front of you , but you may not see it .
Why ?
Because your life lenses got blurred .
It ’s like a camera which does n’t know how and where to focus .
Move it back and forth a few times and see what picture it shows .
That ’s equivalent with shaking a bit things around .
In the end your lenses will be cleaner .
41 Act. Do n’t React
If you ’re reacting to what ’s happening , you ’ll never start fresh .
Change by reaction is rooted in fear and is just a form of escapism .
Even more , you ’ll end up continuously being chased by what you ’re running from .
Make your own judgment and do n’t react to pressures like lack of money and social rejection .
That too shall pass .
42 . Stop Solving The Wrong Problem
Focus on what matters .
What they say about you is not that important .
What you really do with your life , that ’s important .
We do have a tendency to get lost in the details and start solving the wrong problems .
Cut it short .
Those tiny little things you want to “ solve ” around will soon grow to the size of the swamp .
Do n’t allow that to happen .
Stay sharp .
43 . Forget “ I Can ” , Embrace “ I Do ”
You ’re largely what you ’re saying to yourself .
You actually do what you continuously tell to your brain to do .
Insert yourself in this process and change all the “ I Can ” ‘s with “ I Do ” ‘s . “ I Can ” may be empowering but “ I Do ” is truly life changing .
You ca n’t start fresh without taking action .
Change this monologue .
You ’ll be amazed by the results .
44 . Pay Yourself First
So you can pay others too .
Altruism does n’t worth a nickel if you ca n’t make ends meet .
Giving and giving and giving away , without taking care of yourself , will eventually drain you out .
Turn your face to yourself and find out what you really need .
Start getting it .
Forget the blame and the shame .
That change alone could spark a new beginning for you .
45 . Shift Your Focus
One thing we often ignore , is that our reality is generated by our focus .
Whatever we ’re focusing on , it grows .
So , a new beginning could be in fact just the result of a focus shift .
Place your attention on other things .
It may be difficult in the beginning , so start training .
46 . Take A Long Distance Trip
Traveling long distance is an art .
Whenever I did a very long trip something changed inside .
A new perspective , some unexpected ideas , something fresh and surprising emerged from that trip .
Whenever you feel prisoner of a lifestyle you do n’t want anymore , do your best to travel far and away .
You ’ll be back , most of the time , as a different person .
47 . Stop Trying To Be Perfect
Perfection is a big mind trap .
It ’s nothing more than a state of suspension in which you ’re not really alive .
Perfection means you reached the end of the journey .
And the understanding of this end , for us , as human beings , is being dead .
Just try to be better instead .
Being better will always give you room for change .
Chasing perfection will not .
48 . Eliminate Self Sabotage
What if I ’m going to tell you that the biggest enemy of yourself is … you ?
What if I ’ll tell you that you ’re afraid of success ?
What if I ’ll tell you that you do n’t live up to your dreams by fear of failure ?
All of these mindsets are forms of self - sabotage .
And they are more dangerous than you think .
Thinking that change is impossible is a form of self - sabotage .
49 . Get Rid Of Your Guardians
They ’re living inside of you , as images of authority .
Or they live with you , in imbalanced relationships , based on power games .
Whatever the place , those guardians have only one mission : to keep you in a perpetual state of slavery .
To prevent you from growing , by selling you the illusion of safety .
You ’re much better off .
As scary as it may be .
50 . Recycle Aggression
You need it .
You have it in yourself because deep down , when you were just a sparkle in the dark , you had a deep need to survive .
And you survived .
Aggressiveness is not toxic , the way you use it may be .
Re-channel that huge force , that immense energy flow you get from aggression and put it to good work .
Do n’t bottle it deep down , let it out .

Three Australian Commandos and a US soldier have been killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan .
The diggers were among 10 Australians from the Special Operations Task Group on the coalition forces helicopter when it went down in rugged terrain in Northern Kandahar .
The chief of the Defence Force , Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston , said the crash at 3:39 am ( Afghanistan time ) was not the result of enemy action .
He said the seven other Australians on board the helicopter are being treated for their wounds .
" Two are very seriously wounded with one undergoing surgery and one is in intensive care at an ISAF medical facility , " he said .
" These soldiers , along with one of the less seriously wounded , will be moved to the US military hospital in Bagram later today once their condition stabilises . "
A NATO spokeswoman in Kabul confirmed that a US soldier was also killed in the crash .
Air Chief Marshal Houston said as operations were ongoing he was unable to provide more details , but he did confirm all three of the soldiers killed had previously served in Afghanistan .
" These three soldiers were members of a very impressive group of soldiers who were highly skilled and highly motivated , " he said .
" Just last week they were involved in an operation at Shah Wali Kot which dealt a major blow to Taliban insurgents in Northern Kandahar province . "
The crash was Australia 's deadliest single incident in the nearly nine - year conflict .
Air Chief Marshal Houston said the cause of the crash would be investigated .
The deaths bring the number of Australians who have died during operations in Afghanistan since 2001 to 16 .
Earlier this month , a roadside bomb killed Sappers Jacob Moerland and Darren Smith of the Australian mentoring taskforce .
Condolences
Air Chief Marshal Houston expressed his condolences to the families of the " three fine commandos we lost this morning " .
" I have nothing but admiration and respect for these very brave and committed Australians , " he said .
" I ask you now to be there for each other . "
Defence Minister John Faulkner said the loss of the " three courageous soldiers " was a tragedy .
" This most dangerous theatre of operations has claimed five Australian lives in just two weeks and it's with very great sadness that we are here today to inform you of these casualties , " he said .
" This is a tragic day for Australia and the Australian Defence force and an absolutely devastating day for the families and friends of these young men .
" Three brave young men died today serving our nation .
I assure you that the commitment , dedication and sacrifice of these soldiers will not be forgotten . "
He said the wounded soldiers are receiving the best medical care .
Senator Faulkner said Australia 's commitment to Afghanistan is important .
" While our mission in Afghanistan is difficult , it is vital for international stability and for the security of Australia , " he said .
" Our men and women in uniform continue to do outstanding work in this demanding and dangerous environment . "
He said the deaths will delay an announcement that he was planning to make tomorrow about Australia 's contribution to the war in Afghanistan .
He was intending to make a ministerial statement to Parliament tomorrow , particularly about the timing of the training mission that Australian forces are involved in in Afghanistan .
Both Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott paid tribute to the soldiers in Parliament .
Mr Rudd said the soldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice for their nation .
" All Australians owe them a debt of gratitude for their service and sacrifice , " he said .
Mr Abbott said the deaths show the high price soldiers pay in serving Australia .
" Our soldiers are made of great character , " he said .
" The families ... of those killed in action ... will be devastated . "
Beer : Make way for the brewpubs
Capitol City Brewing is looking for a new location for the Capitol Hill branch , which will close next May .
( Capitol City Brewing Co. )
Opening a brewpub in the Washington area , in some ways , is even more difficult than opening a brewery that kegs and bottles beer for offsite consumption .
“ It ’s a very expensive effort , ” says Bill Madden , alluding to the high cost of real estate in the area ’s better neighborhoods .
Ideally , you want a long - term lease of 10 years or more .
And you ’ve also got to find a building with a reinforced floor : " Brewing equipment is very , very heavy . ”
That all factored into Madden ’s decision to start his own brewpub — a longtime dream — at Waterford ’s Spectrum , a mixed - use development at 444 West Broad St. in Falls Church , about midway between the East Falls Church and West Falls Church Metro stations .
He ’s shooting for a July 12 opening for Mad Fox Brewing Co. .
The moniker is an amalgam of his surname and his wife ’s maiden name : " I ’m mad , and she ’s the fox . ”
Madden , who has previously brewed at Capitol City Brewing Co. and for Vintage 50 in Leesburg , has been working on this project since June 2008 .
The economic meltdown “ put us on mothballs until spring 2009 , ” but proved a blessing in the long run .
A pizzeria , which was originally intended to be the anchor in the Spectrum development , fell through , making room for the brewpub .
Relations with the other tenants have been cordial .
“ According to the landlord , some people have purchased condos based on the fact that a brewery is opening here this year , ” says Madden .
Mad Fox will feature American fare : sandwiches , salads and Neapolitan and New York - style pizzas .
The first half - dozen beers planned for the taps will include two styles that Madden has perfected at his previous brewing stints and which have won medals in national competitions .
Kolsch is a pale gold German - style ale , light , refreshing and pilsner - ish .
Wee Heavy is a deep ebony color with a silky smoothness and immense malty body .
Also look for an American pale ale , a saison , a porter and an ESB .
And yes , Madden will continue his tradition of offering a “ stealth beer ” : a connoisseur ’s beverage , not listed on chalkboard or menu , that you have to request .
Madden ’s 15 - barrel brew house and six 30 - barrel fermenters will be capable of turning out about 2,000 barrels of beer a year , an unusually large amount for one location .
( Average production for the nation ’s 981 brewpubs last year was 708 barrels , according to Brewers Association figures . )
“ Maybe down the road we ’ll open up satellite locations , ” muses Madden , all of which would be supplied by the Falls Church brewery .
But that ’s a project for the indefinite future , as is the brewpub that restaurateur Robert Wiedmaier ( Brasserie Beck , Brabo ) is contemplating .
Wiedmaier 's brewpub will be somewhere in the DC area and will specialize in Belgian beer styles , says Thor Cheston , beer director for Brasserie Beck .
But other details , including a tentative opening date , are yet to be worked out .
“ It ’s a very young idea , ” admits Cheston .
“ We ’re toying with a number of different concepts . ”
At the moment , Wiedmaier ’s primary concern is Mussel Bar , a casual pub and eatery ( no reservations , waitstaff dressed in jeans , loud rock ‘n roll ) set to open at 7262 Woodmont Ave. in Bethesda the first week in July .
That establishment will feature nine drafts , including the Belgian pale ale Antigoon , Brasserie Beck ’s house beer .
Finally , Capitol City Brewing Co. will search for a site to replace the Capitol Hill location ( 2 Massachusetts Avenue NE , across the street from Union Station ) that ’s set to close May 2011 .
“ We did n’t get our lease renewed ; we would have stayed there otherwise , ” says Mike McCarthy , Capitol City ’s director of brewing operations .
He added that the brewing equipment will be moved to Capitol City ’s Shirlington branch to expand production .
The Shirlington site will continue to brew for its own patrons and to supply the non-brewing Capitol City on New York Avenue in the District .
“ Having opened that location in 1996 , I think it ’s a shame to see it happen , ” said Bill Madden , former Capitol City brewer , of the closing of the Capitol Hill brewpub .
He recalls that installing the 15 - barrel brew house was an ordeal .
“ It came through the second - floor window over the large marble portico .
It took two nights to install . ”
Moving the equipment out wo n’t be much fun either , he suspects .
All the more reason why prospective brewery owners should seek a long - term lease .

Image caption Archaeologists from Somerset County Council excavated the jar and coins
One of the largest ever finds of Roman coins in Britain has been made by a man using a metal detector .
The hoard of more than 52,000 coins dating from the 3rd Century AD was found buried in a field near Frome in Somerset .
The coins were found in a huge jar just over a foot ( 30 cm ) below the surface by Dave Crisp , from Devizes in Wiltshire .
" I have made many finds over the years , but this is my first major coin hoard , " he said .
After his metal detector gave a " funny signal " , Mr Crisp says he dug down 14in before he found what had caused it .
" I put my hand in , pulled out a bit of clay and there was a little Radial , a little bronze Roman coin .
Very , very small , about the size of my fingernail . "
Mr Crisp reported the find to the authorities , allowing archaeologists to excavate the site .
Offering to gods
Since the discovery in late April , experts from the Portable Antiquities Scheme at the British Museum have been working through the find .
The coins were all contained in a single clay pot .
Although it only measured 18in ( 45 cm ) across , the coins were packed inside and would have weighed an estimated 160 kg ( 350 lb ) .
" I do n't believe myself that this is a hoard of coins intended for recovery , " says Sam Moorhead from the Portable Antiquities Scheme .
" I think what you could see is a community of people who are actually making offerings and they are each pouring in their own contribution to a communal ritual votive offering to the gods . "
It is estimated the coins were worth about four years ' pay for a legionary soldier .
" Because Mr Crisp resisted the temptation to dig up the coins , it has allowed archaeologists from Somerset County Council to carefully excavate the pot and its contents , " said Anna Booth , local finds liaison officer .
Somerset County Council Heritage Service now hope the coroner will declare the find as treasure .
That would allow the Museum of Somerset to acquire the coins at market value with the reward shared by Mr Crisp and the land owner .
The story of the excavation will be told in a new BBC Two archaeology series , Digging for Britain , presented by Dr Alice Roberts and made by 360 production , to be broadcast in August .
Iceland has passed a sweeping reform of its media laws that supporters say will make the country an international haven for investigative journalism .
The new package of legislation was passed unanimously at 4 am yesterday in one of the final sessions of the Icelandic parliament , the Althingi , before its summer break .
Created with the involvement of the whistleblowing website Wikileaks , it increases protection for anonymous sources , creates new protections from so - called " libel tourism " and makes it much harder to censor stories before they are published .
" It will be the strongest law of its kind anywhere , " said Birgitta Jonsdottir , MP for The Movement party and member of the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative , which first made the proposals .
" We 're taking the best laws from around the world and putting them into one comprehensive package that will deal with the fact that information does n't have borders any more . "
Wikileaks has been involved in the drafting of the package of laws alongside Ms Jonsdottir from the beginning of the process more than a year ago .
Its founder , Julian Assange , worked from Iceland on the organisation 's release of the incendiary video of an apparently unprovoked American helicopter attack in Iraq that left eighteen people dead , including two journalists .
Mr Assange did not respond to requests for comment via email yesterday .
But in February , he wrote : " All over the world , the freedom to write about powerful groups is being smothered .
Iceland could be the antidote to secrecy havens ... it may become an island where openness is protected – a journalism haven . "
Because the package includes provisions that will stop the enforcement of overseas judgements that violate Icelandic laws , foreign news organisations are said to have expressed an interest in moving the publication of their investigative journalism to Iceland .
According to Ms Jonsdottir , Germany 's Der Spiegel and America 's ABC News have discussed the possibility .
More immediately , it is hoped that the changes will rebuild the Icelandic public 's belief in the press .
" Trust in the media was very high before the crash , but then it sank , " said Hoskuldur Kari Schram , a reporter with Stod 2 television in Reykjavik .
" Maybe this will be a step in the right direction . "
Mr Schram added that it would have an immediate effect : " It will affect my relationship with sources right away .
It will make my job a whole lot easier . "
But there was doubt overseas that the international ramifications would be as powerful as the law 's Icelandic proponents claim .
" As an exercise in aspirations , it 's a bold and important endeavour , " said Professor Monroe Price , founder of the programme in comparative media law at Oxford University .
" But if it 's a significant issue like a national security question , then the charging jurisdiction will figure out ways of asserting its power . "
UK media organisations will watch developments closely .
The British system has come under particular scrutiny recently , facing criticism that it is too easy to exercise censorship of stories and over libel provisions widely perceived as excessively favourable to complainants .
Last year California enacted a law that allowed local courts to refuse to enforce British libel judgements .
Herculean Task Ahead Is It Already Too Late to Save Greece ?
The International Monetary Fund and the European Union are coming to Greece 's aid with a financial commitment worth billions .
But is it already too late to rescue the cash - strapped country ?
By SPIEGEL staff .
New South Wales Opposition Leader Barry O'Farrell is lying low after posting an embarrassing message yesterday morning on the social networking site Twitter .
Believing he was sending a private message to journalist Latika Bourke 's Twitter account , Mr O'Farrell opened up on his thoughts about the delay on candidate selection .
With confirmation of a federal election possibly just days away , the Liberal Party is yet to select its candidates for the federal seats of Greenway and Parramatta .
It was supposed to be a " deeply off the record " direct message , but it had been re-tweeted by Twitter users before he had the chance to delete it .
" Deeply off the record - I think the timetable and struggle to get candidates reflects internal poll - pre and post the ranga , " he tweeted , a reference to Prime Minister Julia Gillard .
Mr O'Farrell , who recently debated New South Wales Premier Kristina Keneally on Twitter , has since deleted the tweet .
He is not commenting on the Twitter gaffe - leaving it to the Nationals Leader Andrew Stoner .
" There 's a few pitfalls involved , I think Barry has learned one of those pitfalls but we all make mistakes , " he said .
Ms Keneally weighed in from China , saying she is certain Mr O'Farrell is very embarrassed .
Parramatta is held by Labor on a margin of almost 10 per cent while Greenway is up for grabs after boundary redistributions .
It is on a notionally Labor margin of 5.7 per cent .

See the first machine designed to reproduce itself
I , replicator ( Image : Peskimo at Synergy Art
I AM standing in a cold north London workshop looking expectantly at a bizarre metal and plastic contraption .
An acrid smell drifts from the machine as a length of plastic is drawn into a barrel at its centre and heated up .
The molten plastic squirts from a nozzle onto a platform moving beneath it , drawing a pattern .
The nozzle also moves up and down to build the design upwards like an expert cake icer .
Over the next few minutes , this “ MakerBot ” will do something I can only dream of doing : it will create a spare part of itself as an insurance against future mishaps .
Staring at the Heath Robinson - style kit before me , it is hard to believe that it – and a few hundred other devices – are paving the way to an era of desktop machines that can make just about anything , including copies of themselves .
It could be a revolutionary age .
MakerBot is one of a range of desktop manufacturing plants being developed by researchers and hobbyists around the world .
Their goal is to create a machine that is able to fix itself and , ultimately , to replicate .
To find out how close we are to that goal , I have come to the London Hackspace , a communal workshop where Russ Garrett , a software developer by day , keeps his MakerBot .
Like 900 other enthusiasts , Garrett bought a mail - order kit from MakerBot Industries of New York for $ 750 , and built the machine himself .

MakerBot and most of its kin are essentially a cut - price reinvention of the 3D printer .
While professional machines still cost upwards of tens of thousands of dollars , a coalition of academics and tinkerers has created versions that do much the same thing for much less .
Anyone with a few hundred dollars and some spare time can build their own 3D printer from a set of plans distributed free on the internet .
“ Anyone with a few hundred dollars and some spare time can build a 3D printer from a set of free plans ”
These machines can build any number of things , including everything from coat hooks to ipod docking stations .
One MakerBot owner even made his engagement ring with it .
But key to MakerBot ’s popularity is its ability to make its own spares .
Every kit contains a handful of parts made by other MakerBots , linking them in a mechanical family tree .
The MakerBot lineage is descended from RepRap ( see “ The replicant ” ) – the first machine designed to replicate parts of itself and brainchild of Adrian Bowyer , a mechanical engineer at the University of Bath , UK .
In 2006 he started the project with two goals : to create a 3D printer that anyone could make and use , and to make it capable of self - replicating .
Most importantly , it would have an open - source design to encourage anyone to modify and improve it .
At the moment , RepRap can build about half of its own parts , including joints and casings .
Some components , such as steel rods and microprocessors , are beyond its capabilities as yet .
Still , Bowyer ’s mechanical progeny reached a major milestone in November 2008 , when Canadian Wade Bortz announced he had used his RepRap to create all the parts of a replica that it was possible to print – the first time this had been done “ in the wild ” outside Bowyer ’s lab .
It was sold online a few months later for a case of beer .
Bowyer ’s first design , called Darwin , has since been replaced by Mendel , which is smaller and more reliable .
“ Mendel can , if you discount nuts and bolts , print 50 per cent of the machine ’s parts in under three days , ” says Bowyer .
Mendel can make about the same proportion of its own parts as Darwin , but Mendel is a simpler , smaller and more reliable machine .
It can also make much larger things than Darwin can .
Since then , tens of others have made mothers out of their machines , sometimes selling their offspring for hundreds of dollars to other enthusiasts keen to get a machine of their own .
This has led to a veritable ecosystem of RepRap - type machines – an estimated 3000 exist – and while Bowyer is now focused mainly on making Mendel more robust and user - friendly , the RepRaps in the wild have begun evolving into different forms .
While exploring the RepRap forums , I come across one with the potential to be more self - replicating than any before , and it is provoking some excited comments .
The poster , Frank Davies , based in Houston , Texas , is the proud owner of a RepRap ingeniously built using parts salvaged from a dot matrix printer and a Xerox photocopying machine , and he is now working on making his RepRap totally printable .
NASA engineer ’s double life
Davies , by day a NASA engineer on the space shuttle programme , is effectively replacing RepRap ’s skeleton with one of his own making .
In place of the tracks along which the print nozzle glides are plastic concertina - like mechanisms called Sarrus linkages , originally used to ensure steam pistons moved in straight lines in an era when reliably straight rods were n’t available .
Two perpendicular hinges connect the moving parts such that they can move only along the remaining , unrestricted axis .
“ Another member of the community mentioned this linkage , so I Googled it and ran with the idea , ” says Davies .
The result is a prototype whose platform moves in two directions without using a single steel rod .
Davies is working on adding the third axis and print head to make a species of RepRap able to print an unprecedented amount of itself .
“ If it goes well , it should be done in a few months , ” he says .
“ Since I ’ve got a printer that can make arbitrarily shaped objects , it ’s not hard to try new things out . ”
Other attempts to make more parts printable include replacing the machine ’s rubber belts with printed rack - and - pinion gears .
But there is a limit to how much of a machine can be made with plastic alone .
What we need is a machine that can create parts made from a number of different materials .
The search leads me to Neil Gershenfeld , head of the Center for Bits and Atoms at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Gershenfeld is busy promoting FabLabs : rooms the size of a squash court packed with all the equipment necessary to take any design and make working products at a quality to match that of a professionally commissioned prototype .
He has been spreading the word – so far there are FabLabs in Afghanistan , the Netherlands , Costa Rica , Ghana , the UK , Kenya , and the South Bronx in New York .
In the process he has realised that what FabLabs really need is to be able to make themselves .
“ The tools will have really succeeded when they can do that , ” he says .
In a year or two , FabLabs will simply be made inside existing ones , Gershenfeld promises .
“ We ’ll still buy some components , like microcontrollers and stepper motors , but we ’ll make everything else . ”
A machine called MultiFab , created by recent MIT graduate Ilan Moyer , backs up that claim .
Like RepRap , it is made from parts and materials costing just $ 400 .
It too can print plastic , but it can also wield milling and cutting toolheads to carve shapes in wax , cut vinyl , mill light plastic and wood , and carve out the conductive traces of custom circuit boards .
The first thing the completed machine did was to carve out a circuit board to replace one of its own .
Moyer has experimented with using it to perform sequential operations – printing a structure , and then putting the finishing touches to its shape with a milling tool – and plans to add a laser cutting head .
“ Eventually I want to be able to put a FabLab in a briefcase , ” he says .
Still , ingenious as these machines are , they merely churn out piles of parts .
What about assembly ?
A heap of plastic and metal is not a machine , just as you do n’t have much in common with a pile of flesh and bones .
Greg Chirikjian , a roboticist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland , agrees .
“ When a prototype only makes parts , the machine that made those parts was n’t reproduced , ” he says .
A true self - replicator must handle both fabrication and assembly .
Chirikjian and his colleague Matt Moses are aiming to achieve this with a kind of Lego set that does n’t need anyone to play with it .
The pair have already demonstrated key parts of such a system , using around 100 plastic blocks .
Although it cannot yet fabricate these blocks itself , the machine is able to move in 3D to pick up and bind them into larger structures .
Moses is currently working on having it make a complete replica of its own structure using Lego - like bricks , though the machine still relies on conventional motors – which have to be installed by hand – to drive its activity .
The blocks are simple rectangular plates with two threaded holes and four cone - shaped connectors , shot through with metal wiring so they can be used to create electronic circuits if need be .
The machine uses a screwdriver - like tool to pick up , stack or secure blocks together .
A line of basic blocks assembled together can act as a slide along which other components – made from groups of their siblings – can move driven by an attached motor .
The blocks are made from polyurethane , and the processes needed to make them could be mastered by a desktop machine , says Chirikjian .
The machine could squirt a substance such as silicone over a spare part of itself to make a mould , before pumping in polyurethane to reproduce the original .
The pair have shown that gaps left for wiring can be filled by a RepRap head modified to deposit a low - melting - point alloy .
With the addition of a few magnets , Moses has now made a functional , if weak , motor .
This looks really promising : desktop machines capable of making complex electrical components should in theory be able to create copies of their own electronic brains .
Hod Lipson , a robotics researcher at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , says much more is possible .
His students run a RepRap - like 3D printer project called Fab@Home , whose design boasts two syringes allowing it to squirt out two materials at a time .
Researchers in Lipson ’s lab are using a similar multi- barrelled approach to collapse printing and assembly into a single step , by printing fully functional modules that do not need to be assembled .
“ We ’re at the transition from printing parts to printing systems , ” says Lipson , “ and working hard on printing a complete robot . ”
The team will know when that milestone has been reached , he says , on the day the thing they print walks , or more likely crawls , from the printer under its own power .
So far the team has managed to print out working versions of the major components of a robot : electronic muscle actuators , relays , transistors , batteries and circuitry .
Electrodes and wiring , for example , can be made using silver particles mixed into silicone , while the bulk of a battery can be made using a paste of zinc particles and liquid electrolyte .
A robotic arm stands by to swap syringe cartridges as required .
Although the components are far inferior to off - the - shelf parts , Lipson is confident that his team need only find the right materials .
His goal is to find a relatively small palette that can be mixed to create a wide range of components .
“ Just as red , green and blue can be used to print full colour , this will be very powerful . ”
“ The goal is to find a small palette of materials that can be mixed to create a much wider range ”
Lipson ’s team still has a mountain to climb before it can print the sort of microchips that control his machines , and besides that , replicating machines have a fundamental limitation , he says : “ The thing you print ca n’t be as accurate as the thing you printed it with . ”
Though the machines ’ offspring may be perfectly functional for several generations , tiny errors will gradually accumulate so parts will periodically need to be replaced .
And they will never be as precise as the originals .
This by no means sounds the death knell for self - replicating machines , says Bowyer .
Every living thing can be seen as a self - replicating machine that relies heavily on components and assistance from others , he says , so why should machines be any different ?
Plants , mosquitoes and viruses are all accepted as self - replicating but rely heavily on other species to achieve it .
It would be churlish to expect replicators to be any different .

Enlarge By Cliff Owen , AP Former vice president Dick Cheney said in his statement that he expects to resume an active life .
Cheney recuperating from heart implant operation Former vice president Dick Cheney , 69 , announced Wednesday that doctors implanted a small pump in his chest last week to support his failing heart .
Cheney , who has suffered five heart attacks since the age of 37 , says doctors at Inova Heart and Vascular Institute in Northern Virginia implanted the pump to remedy his " increasing congestive heart failure . "
" The operation went very well and I am now recuperating , " Cheney said in a statement released by his office .
He said the pump will allow him to resume an active life .
About 5 million people in the U.S. suffer from congestive heart failure , a chronic progressive weakening of the heart muscle that results mainly from heart attacks or infections .
Over time , the heart expands and grows so thin that it can no longer pump blood .
The heart pumps , called left ventricular assist devices , were once used only to keep patients alive until they could obtain a transplant .
But donor hearts are hard to find , with just over 2,000 available for the 150,000 people who need them each year .
In January , the Food and Drug Administration approved a second - generation device , Thoratec 's HeartMate II , that is designed to be used for a lifetime .
Two - year survival is about 60 % , about the same as a transplant .
Cheney 's statement did n't say what pump his surgeons used .
" In general , when we 're considering ( heart pumps ) for our patients , it 's because their options are limited .
They 've reached a very advanced stage of heart failure , " says Samer Najjar , head of the heart failure program at Washington Hospital Center .
Late last month , Cheney was admitted to George Washington University Hospital for a few days after reporting he was not feeling well .
In that episode , he received medication to treat a fluid buildup related to his aggressive form of heart disease .
The pump is implanted in the chest next to the heart 's main pumping chamber .
A tube shunts blood from that chamber into the pump , which propels it through the aorta to the rest of the body .
Although Cheney said in his statement that he expects to resume an active life , Najjar says the pump imposes limitations .
A power line exits the abdomen and connects to a battery pack and controller worn in a sling or a belt .
Patients usually charge the batteries at night , with their pumps plugged in to a charger .
They must carry spare batteries and other hardware with them in case of failure , Najjar says .
And the device must be shielded from water or it can short - circuit .
Nevertheless , he says , the pumps offer an alternative to many heart failure patients who have none .
They are no longer as short of breath , and they may travel , shop , play golf and engage in many other normal activities .
The former vice president offered thanks to those who have kept him in their thoughts .

Rising levels of antidepressants in coastal waters could change sea-life behaviour and potentially damage the food - chain , according to a new study .
Research into the behaviour of shrimps exposed to the antidepressant fluoxetine , showed that their behaviour is dramatically affected .
The shrimps are five times more likely to swim toward the light instead of away from it -- making them more likely to be eaten by fish or birds , which could have devastating effects on the shrimp population .
" Crustaceans are crucial to the food chain and if shrimps ' natural behaviour is being changed because of antidepressant levels in the sea this could seriously upset the natural balance of the ecosystem , " said Dr Alex Ford from the University of Portsmouth 's Institute of Marine Sciences .
" Much of what humans consume you can detect in the water in some concentration .
We 're a nation of coffee drinkers and there is a huge amount of caffeine found in waste water , for example .
It 's no surprise that what we get from the pharmacy will also be contaminating the country 's waterways . "
The research is published in the journal Aquatic Toxicology .
The study found that the shrimps ' behaviour changes when they are exposed to the same levels of fluoxetine found in the waste water that flows to rivers and estuaries as a result of the drugs humans excrete in sewage .
Dr Ford 's research was motivated by a species of parasite which can alter the behaviour of aquatic creatures through changing serotonin levels within the brains of the organisms .
Serotonin is a neuro - hormone found in many animals , including humans , known to control types of behaviour , such as modulating mood and decreasing anxiety .
Drugs to combat depression in humans are often designed to target levels of serotonin which led to the question of whether they could also alter the behaviour of marine organisms .
Dr Ford said : " Effluent is concentrated in river estuaries and coastal areas , which is where shrimps and other marine life live -- this means that the shrimps are taking on the excreted drugs of whole towns . "
Prescriptions for antidepressants have risen rapidly in recent years , according to the Office for National Statistics .
In 2002 , there were 26.3 million antidepressant prescriptions handed out by doctors in England and Wales -- yet the environmental effect of pharmaceuticals in sewage has been largely unexplored .
Dr Ford is hoping to carry out future research on a number of other prescribed drugs on the market known to affect serotonin .
Head of the School of Biological Sciences , Professor Matt Guille , said : " Dr Ford has conducted some beautifully simple research , which potentially shows huge ecological consequences .
I hope it will lead the way for further study of prescribed drugs and other substances impacting on the country 's marine - life . "
Nickname bestowed on Pakistan after it was ( inaccurately ? ) reported that the country led the world in Internet searches for adult material .
In a Fox News report titled “ No. 1 Nation in Sexy Web Searches ?
Call it Pornistan , ” Kelli Morgan wrote :
They may call it the “ Land of the Pure , ” but Pakistan turns out to be anything but .
The Muslim country , which has banned content on at least 17 websites to block offensive and blasphemous material , is the world ’s leader in online searches for pornographic material , FoxNews.com has learned . …
Google ranks Pakistan No. 1 in the world in searches for pornographic terms , outranking every other country in the world in searches per person for certain sex- related content . …
A later report by ANI questioned these claims , stating :
Google has officially denied the accuracy of its search trends that claimed Pakistan is the world ’s leader in online searches for pornographic material . …
Google ’s public affairs head of South - East Asia said that the statistics were based on limited data therefore they cannot be regarded as final opinion .
I do n’t have a firm enough grip of economics to decide with any confidence whose predictions to believe about the direction of the economy .
And there ’s enough different about this recession from all or most of those of the post - war era to give me some pause when people cite historical norms for how recessions operate .
But we do seem to be seeing more and more evidence that the recovery is at risk of stalling , if not falling back into recession , which seems possible too .
And as that is happening , both the elite and the popular / political policy debate seems to be going to those who believe we should ramp back government spending even though history suggests that is the best way to choke off the recovery and toss the economy into a double dip recession or worse .
What ’s particularly chilling is that the elite and popular policy debates are moving in the same direction .
The professional economists , international financial agency types , etc are pushing for retrenchment .
They seem to have won the argument at the G20 meeting .
And at the same time , Republicans are pushing the argument that the stimulus spending which probably forestalled a Depression actually did n’t do anything or even caused the problem .
And the public seems open enough to that interpretation of events that Democrats have written off any new stimulus spending because they ’re scared off by the mid-term election .
And because the Democrats have , Obama has .
None of this is anything that Krugman and Yglesias and a million other people have n’t been saying for months .
And hopefully everybody making this argument is wrong and the economic recovery is more robust than they think ; it ’s certainly possible .
But the economic and political repercussions seem both vast and perverse — perverse because the people pushing the policies that could kill the economy seem most likely to gain from the damage politically .
It all has the look of watching a car head off the edge of a cliff in slow motion .
Telstra chief executive David Thodey tonight revealed that the telco was talking with its joint venture partner Foxtel to bring the payTV service to Telstra ’s T - Box internet television platform launched last month .
“ I ’m delighted to say that we ’re working with Foxtel to put Foxtel content on the T - box as well , ” Thodey said at a ritzy party in Sydney tonight to launch the T - Box — attended by True Blood star , Aussie actor Ryan Kwanten .
“ Kim Williams is here somewhere , ” Thodey laughed , referring to the Foxtel chief executive .
Foxtel sells pay TV services over satellite and Telstra ’s HFC cable network , and will continue to do so , even though Telstra will cease to sell broadband services over the network as part of its deal with the company which is building and operating the National Broadband Network .
The ties between Telstra and Foxtel have run deep for many years .
The pay TV operator was established in 1995 and is a joint venture between Telstra – which owns 50 percent of the company – and News Corporation and Consolidated Media Holdings , which own 25 percent of the company each .
Foxtel content is available , for example , on mobile phones on Telstra ’s Next G network , but not through other mobile networks .
However , Foxtel has also long had a content sharing arrangement with rival payTV provider Optus .
The news comes as Telstra and Foxtel look to have been increasing the closeness of their ties .
In early June it was revealed that the pay TV operator had asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to let it provide what appears to be Telstra content ( normally provided through the T - Box ) through its iQ and iQ2 set - top boxes on the condition that customers have a broadband connection with Telstra .
The move may breach the Trade Practices
Act – which broadly prohibits one company from requiring a customer have a relationship with another company before selling them a service .
But Foxtel is also looking to provide its content through other channels such as Microsoft ’s Xbox LIVE platform – announcing in late May that Australians would be able to watch Foxtel programs on their Xbox 360 console from the end of the year .
And Telstra too is diversifying its content partnerships through the T - Box .
“ Suddenly we ’re opening up this whole , wonderful area of great television – we ’re also working with a number of other providers to make sure it has this great experience going forward , ” said Thodey tonight of the T - Box .
The news also comes as rival telcos such as iiNet are simultaneously launching internet video ( IPTV ) platforms — iiNet demonstrated its platform to journalists in Sydney today .

Ofcom has rejected complaints about an on -air clash between Sky News political editor Adam Boulton and former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell .
More than 1,000 complaints were received by the media watchdog , with some viewers describing the exchange as " horrendous " and " offensive " .
The pair were seen arguing about coalition options following the general election in May .
But Ofcom found the debate was " within the requirements of due impartiality " .
This is live on television .
Dignity .
Dignity .
Alastair Campbell , Sky News , 10 May 2010
" While the conduct and manner of the discussion was certainly unusual , in terms of impartiality we consider that relevant views and issues were aired , " Ofcom concluded .
The watchdog said that since Campbell had " effectively accused " Boulton of " wanting a Conservative Prime Minister " during the discussion , it was " not unreasonable " for Boulton to " defend his position " .
Ofcom also said it should be noted that the " discussion at no time resulted in any abusive language or gratuitous insults . "
At one point , Campbell told Boulton : " This is live on television .
Dignity .

Boulton responded : " Do n't keep telling me what I think ...
This is what you do .
You come on and say no - one won the election , and you clearly did worse .
" I 'm fed up with you telling me what I think . "
The regulator dismissed separate complaints about Sky 's coverage of its leadership debate before the general election .
I 'm fed up with you telling me what I think .
Adam Boulton , Sky News , 10 May 2010
Ofcom received 671 complaints about the 22 April broadcast - many felt that a reference to an unfavourable Daily Telegraph story about Nick Clegg were unfair .
Ofcom also rejected more than 1,000 complaints regarding an interview between Sky News presenter Kay Burley and David Babbs , executive director of campaign group 38 Degrees , two days after the election .
It was alleged that Ms Burley was rude and aggressive during the interview , about the UK 's voting system , but the watchdog said Sky News had not been in breach of its rules .

Modern Healthcare Webinar Wednesday , July 14 , 2010
8 am pacific | 9 am mountain | 10 am central | 11 am eastern | Register Now $ 79
Ever since a surge in cases of patient exposure to excess amounts of radiation during diagnostic procedures , pressure has been mounting for healthcare providers and equipment manufacturers .
The FDA has already taken action , including a call for stepped - up training for practitioners and a more stringent approval process for radiation - emitting equipment .
… I could n’t stop thinking about it .
Overexposure to radiation is something I ’ve thought about for many years .
In fact , I ’m pretty sure that , short of cancer victims , I ’d be the poster child for this for Boomers .
Let me count the ways .
Every time I went to my family doc as a kid for anything except a strain or a splinter , he ’d zap me with the fluoroscope , just for good measure .
Then , when we went shopping at Buster Brown ’s , in order to determine my foot length and width , I ’d get my feet x-rayed .
After that , I played too much trumpet and had to have my lip radiated because of a blemish that would n’t go away .
There were at least seven radiation sessions with Dr. Jacob , a dermatologist who reminded me of Dr. Jekyll .
He zapped me because that ’s what they did in “ those days ” for blemishes .
He would lay me on the table , cover me in lead , and zap my lip with radiation .
Thank goodness for the lead .
As a young adult , my Internal Medicine doctor had his own x-ray equipment and used to say , “ Okay , time for your chest x-ray . ”
Problem was , he did it every single time I went to him .
Once , however , when I went there , there was no x-ray .
I asked the nurse why and she laughed and said , “ Oh , that old piece of junk … it was zapping all of us with radiation . ”
Later that week I heard on the radio that he had donated his unit to a small hospital .
As a teacher , chest x-rays were a requirement .
We would be invited to go onto an old x-ray bus every two years and they would light us up on a piece of x-ray equipment that probably put out more radiation than the bombs dropped at Nagasaki and Hiroshima .
All in the name of TB checks .
Bronchitis visited me regularly over the past several decades , and chest x-rays were always part of those visits .
So were dental x-rays , over and over and over again .
The MRIs do things a little differently , but I ’m sure there ’s still some type of telltale exposure there , and I ’ve had three or four of those .
Annual physicals now include chest x-rays , thallium stress tests , et al , and visits to the bone docs required x-rays , too .
Oh yeah , and the heart caths ?
They fill you with dye and then they light you up with the ol ’ fluoroscope … did that three times .
And do n’t forget the “ new fangled invention that ’s perfectly safe , ” the heart screening on the 2 , 16 , 64 and then 128 slice PET / CTs .
Did that three times , too .
BUT let ’s get to the real exposure — playing in the sunshine , sans any type of sun tan lotion or sun screen .
Okay , I guess that ’s an exaggeration .
We used to mix Merthiolate with baby oil , or sometimes just use baby oil to ensure a nice brown cooked look .
Every year I looked like a half Italian coffee bean .
It was more than a tan .
It was a deep fried , make your teeth look whiter than snow , fun in the sun , ai n’t wearin ’ no shirt , nature is good for you , sun tan with burns that preceded the tans every year .
So , when people tell me to eat organic , I smile and think , “ Yep , that will erase all of those rads that filled me up like a Rocky Mountain boulder , ” but I do what they say and just wait and pray that the radiation devil will not come my way .
If the sickness wo n’t kill you , the cure will , and that ’s the truth .
At least you wo n’t ever need a night light .
Albert Torres writes for Book of Eli helmer Albert Hughes ; visual artists in pre-production
The Collider.com movie news website interviewed producer Andrew Lazar ( Jonah Hex , Space Cowboys , Get Smart ) on the planned live - action Akira films , and Lazar revealed that his Akira team hired a new writer named Albert Torres to work with director Albert Hughes ( Menace II Society , From Hell , The Book of Eli ) .
Lazar said that Hughes is " off conceptualizing the movie with a bunch of visual artists " in pre-production development .
When asked about the challenges of getting the project made as a big - budgeted , high - profile studio release , Lazar responded :
Akira happens to be something that Warner Brothers management loves .
They see the value in the title .
They see the value in the franchise , and what the underlying property meant .
It 's a pretty seminal piece .
And so they think that , with a guy who is a visionary director like Albert Hughes , it 's not pushing a boulder up the hill for Akira because , quite frankly , the studio is really enthusiastic about it .
Lazar also confirmed that the first film will cover Katsuhiro Otomo 's first three Akira manga volumes , and the next three volumes will be covered " hopefully , if we 're fortunate enough to do a second one . "
Screenwriter Gary Whitta was previously attached to the project , which actor Leonardo DiCaprio ( Titanic , The Aviator ) is producing through his Appian Way production company .
According to ComingSoon.net , Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby also worked on the films ' scripts before Torres was hired .

[ This post is by Dan Morrill , Open Source & Compatibility Program Manager . — Tim Bray ]
At Google I/ O 2010 , we announced that there are over 60 Android models now , selling 100,000 units a day .
When I wear my open - source hat , this is exciting : every day the equivalent of the entire population of my old home city starts using open - source software , possibly for the first time .
When I put on my hat for Android Compatibility , this is humbling : that ’s a whole lotta phones that can all share the same apps .
Another thing we launched at Google I/O was an upgraded and expanded source.android.com .
The new version has refreshed info on the Android Open - Source Project , and some new tips and tools for device manufacturers — useful if you ’re an OEM .
However , it also has details on the Android compatibility program , now .
This is also aimed mostly at OEMs , but Tim Bray suggested that developers might be interested in a peek at how we keep those 100,000 devices marching to the same beat , every day .
So here I am , back on the blog .
The F - word , or , Remember remember the fifth of November
I remember sitting with my colleagues in a conference room in Building 44 on November 5 , 2007 , listening to Andy Rubin and Eric Schmidt announce Android to the world .
I remember a lot of the press stories , too .
For instance , Android was “ just words on paper ” which was especially entertaining since I knew we were getting ready to launch the first early - look SDK a mere week later .
Another meme I remember is ... yes , “ fragmentation ” .
Literally before the close of business on the same day we announced Android ( 4:46 pm to be precise ) , I saw the first article about Android “ fragmentation . ”
The first day was n’t even over yet , and the press had already decided that Android would have a “ fragmentation ” problem .
The thing is , nobody ever defined “ fragmentation ” — or rather , everybody has a different definition .
Some people use it to mean too many mobile operating systems ; others to refer to optional APIs causing inconsistent platform implementations ; still others use it to refer to “ locked down ” devices , or even to the existence of multiple versions of the software at the same time .
I ’ve even seen it used to refer to the existence of different UI skins .
Most of these definitions do n’t even have any impact on whether apps can run !
Because it means everything , it actually means nothing , so the term is useless .
Stories on “ fragmentation ” are dramatic and they drive traffic to pundits ’ blogs , but they have little to do with reality .
“ Fragmentation ” is a bogeyman , a red herring , a story you tell to frighten junior developers .
Yawn .
Compatibility
Now , that ’s not to say that there are n’t real challenges in making sure that Android devices are compatible with each other , or that there are n’t very real concerns that keep app developers awake at night .
There definitely are , and I spend a great deal of time indeed thinking about them and addressing them .
The trick is to define them clearly .
We define “ Android compatibility ” to be the ability of a device to properly run apps written with the Android SDK .
This is a deceptively simple way to frame it , because there are a number of things that can go wrong .
Here are a few :
Bugs - devices might simply have bugs , such as a buggy Bluetooth driver or an incorrectly implemented GPS API .
Missing components - devices might omit hardware ( such as a camera ) that apps expect , and attempt to “ fake ” or stub out the corresponding API .
Added or altered APIs - devices might add or alter APIs that are n’t part of standard Android .
Done correctly this is innovation ; done poorly and it ’s “ embrace and extend ” .
Each of these is an example of something that can make an app not run properly on a device .
They might run , but they wo n’t run properly .
These are the things that I spend my time preventing .
How It Works
As stewards of the platform we realize that it ’s vital to allow only compatible devices to participate in the Android ecosystem .
So , we make compatibility a strict prerequisite for access to Android Market and the right to use the Android name .
This means that developers can rely on the fact that Android Market — the keystone of the Android ecosystem — will only allow their apps to run on compatible devices .
It ’s pretty self - evident that a single app ecosystem is better than many small ones , so OEMs are generally pretty motivated to ship compatible devices .
But motivation alone does n’t get us very far without tools to actually ensure compatibility , which is where the Android compatibility program comes in .
This program is like a stool with three legs : the Android source code , the Compatibility Definition Document , and the Compatibility Test Suite .
It all starts with the Android source code .
Android is not a specification , or a distribution in the traditional Linux sense .
It ’s not a collection of replaceable components .
Android is a chunk of software that you port to a device .
For the most part , Android devices are running the same code .
The fact that all Android devices run the same core Android code goes a long way toward making sure those devices all work the same way .
However , this does n’t solve the problems of missing components or altered APIs , because the source code can always be tweaked .
This is where the Compatibility Definition Document ( or CDD ) comes in .
The CDD defines in gory detail exactly what is expected of Android devices .
It clearly states , for example , that devices may not omit most components , and that the official Android APIs may not be altered .
In a nutshell , the CDD exists to remove ambiguities around what ’s required of an Android device .
Of course , none of that overcomes the simple reality of human error — bugs .
This is where the Compatibility Test Suite comes in .
The CTS is a collection of more than 20,000 test cases that check Android device implementations for known issues .
Device makers run the CTS on their devices throughout the development process , and use it to identify and fix bugs early .
This helps ensure that the builds they finally ship are as bug - free as possible .
Keeping Up with the Times
We ’ve been operating this compatibility process with our OEM partners for over a year now , and it ’s largely responsible for those 60 + device models being interoperable .
However no process is ever perfect and no test suite is ever 100 % comprehensive , and sometimes bugs get through .
What happens then ?
Well , we have great relationships with our OEMs , and like I said , they ’re motivated to be compatible .
Whenever we hear about a serious bug affecting apps , we report it to our partners , and they typically prepare a bugfix release and get it out to end users .
We will also typically add a test case to the CTS to catch that problem for future devices .
It ’s an ongoing process , but generally our partners are as interested as we are in the user experience of the devices they sell .
The mobile industry today is “ very exciting ” , which is code for “ changes painfully fast ” .
We believe that the only way Android will be a success is to keep up with that change , and ultimately drive that change .
This means that over time , the CDD will also change .
We ’ll add new text to handle problem cases we encounter , and the actual requirements will change to accommodate the innovations happening in the field .
For example , in the 2.1 / Eclair CDD , we tweaked the CDD slightly to make telephony optional , which allows Android to ship compatibly on non-phone handheld devices .
Whenever we do this , of course , we ’ll make corresponding changes to the Android APIs and Android Market to make sure that your apps are protected from ill effects .
On a somewhat related note , a lot of ink has been spilled on the fact that there are multiple versions of Android out there in users ’ hands at the same time .
While it ’s true that devices without the latest software ca n’t run some of the latest apps , Android is 100 % forward compatible — apps written properly for older versions also run on the newest versions .
The choice is in app developers ’ hands as to whether they want to live on the bleeding edge for the flashiest features , or stay on older versions for the largest possible audience .
And in the long term , as the mobile industry gets more accustomed to the idea of upgradeable phone software , more and more devices will be be upgraded .
What It Means for You
All that is great — but what does it mean for developers ?
Well , we put together a page in the SDK Documentation to explain this , so you should take a look there .
But really it boils down to this :
As a developer , you simply decide what features your app requires , and list them in your app ’s AndroidManifest.xml .
The Android compatibility program ensures that only compatible devices have access to Android Market .
Android Market makes sure your app is only visible to those devices where it will run correctly , by filtering your app from devices which do n’t have the features you listed .
That ’s all !
There almost certainly will be devices that have access to Android Market that probably were n’t quite what you had in mind when you wrote your app .
But this is a very good thing — it increases the size of the potential audience for your app .
As long as you accurately list your app ’s requirements , we ’ll do the rest and make sure that your app wo n’t be accessible to a device where it wo n’t run properly .
After all , we ’re app developers ourselves , and we know how painful it is to deal with users upset about an app not working on a device it was n’t designed for .
Now , that ’s not to say that we think our current solution is perfect — no solution is .
But we ’re continuously working on improvements to the SDK tools and Android Market to make your life as an Android developer even easier .
Keep an eye on this blog and on the Android Market itself for the latest info .
Thanks for reading , and happy coding !
" I was pretty clear over the last couple of weeks about addressing our defense .
By getting Paul Martin and Zbynek Michalek , I think we 've done that .
We 've got a great corps of defensemen right now that are signed for a number of years .
They 're at the right age I think .
That 's the area we targeted to improve our team the most .
Today , we 're pretty thrilled . " -- Penguins ' GM Ray Shero
Pittsburgh GM Ray Shero had a Plan B all along – and he had to put it into motion at noon ET Thursday when Sergei Gonchar became an Ottawa Senator and it became clear he was n't going to sign Dan Hamhuis The Penguins erased the sting of losing Gonchar , their best defenseman over the last five years , by signing a pair of stalwart blue - liners in their own right .
First they went with the powerful , stay - at - home type in Zbynek Michalek for a five years and $ 20 million , and then they went with the slick , puck - moving type in Paul Martin for a five years and $ 25 million .
The team released the terms of both contracts .
Shero was able to add an element to the blue line that was missing last season ( power ) and replace the element that he lost ( offense ) when Gonchar signed with Ottawa for three years and $ 16.5 million .
Martin , who is also seven years younger than Gonchar , also comes off the roster of one of Pittsburgh 's Atlantic Division rivals ( New Jersey ) , and that always helps .
He should slide in as one of the Penguins ' top defensemen and a key man on the power play , just like Gonchar was for the last five seasons .
Pittsburgh , which also lost Jordan Leopold to Buffalo and expects to lose Mark Eaton as well , now has a blue line that includes Michalek , Martin , Brooks Orpik Kris Letang and Alex Goligoski .
The first four are signed through 2014 and Goligoski will be a restricted free agent after the 2011 - 12 season .
" I was pretty clear over the last couple of weeks about addressing our defense , " Shero said in Pittsburgh Thursday .
" By getting Paul Martin and Zbynek Michalek , I think we 've done that .
We 've got a great corps of defensemen right now that are signed for a number of years .
They 're at the right age I think .
That 's the area we targeted to improve our team the most .
Today , we 're pretty thrilled .
" A second - round draft pick of the Devils in 2000 , Martin played six seasons in New Jersey , piling up 163 points and a plus - 55 rating in 400 games .
He was limited to only 22 games this past season and had to back out of playing for Team USA in the Olympics due to an arm injury that required surgery in December .
Eleven of his 26 career goals have been scored with the man-advantage .
He led all Devils ' defensemen with 18 power - play points in 2008 - 09 and 14 in 2007 - 08 .
" Nobody is going to replace Sergei Gonchar .
Sergei is an extremely talented offensive player , good for 50 , 60 points , " Shero said .
" What we 'll get in Paul Martin is a really smooth skating defenseman , great stick , good defensively .
His offensive production might be a little bit better than what he 's had in the past .
He 's a real solid all - around player .
He can play lots of minutes , an effortless skater .
" Michalek was considered one of the pieces the Coyotes could not afford to lose because he was the anchor in front of Vezina Trophy - finalist Ilya Bryzgalov .
TSN reported before noon Thursday that Phoenix was trying to work out a deal to keep Michalek , but apparently could n't get it done in time .
" I really enjoyed my time in Phoenix but at the end of the day it did n't work out and I have a chance to play with Pittsburgh now , " Michalek told the Penguins '
Web site .
" I am coming to a really great organization with a lot of talent .
They compete for the Stanley Cup every season so that is something I was looking for because I am a competitive guy and I want to win .
I see a really good chance to do that in Pittsburgh .
"
It 's possible that Shero saw how difficult it was for the Penguins to contain Michael Cammalleri in the playoffs this past spring and realized the need for a stalwart , stay - at - home blue - liner was there .
Pittsburgh won the Stanley Cup in 2009 with Hal Gill and Rob Scuderi as its stay - at - home pair .
Michalek reportedly earned $ 1.5 million last season when he had 17 points in 72 games but was 15th in the NHL in blocked shots with 156 .
He also led the Coyotes in ice time per game ( 22:38 ) , a significant stat for a guy that played on a team that won 50 games .
" When I talked to Ray and Dan ( Bylsma ) they said they are looking to improve the defensive play of the team , " Michalek said .
" They want me to play the same defensive style that I played in Phoenix .
I had a defensive role in Phoenix where blocking shots was a big part of my game .
I will keep trying to work on that and keep getting better because that is one of my strengths .
" Shero confirmed reports that he offered Gonchar a two - year contract and he was n't willing to go any further .
He said it was all business and he praised Gonchar for being " a fantastic player and maybe a better person on and off the ice .
" Shero said Gonchar will be missed .
" We went into the last day , really the last night , about 11:30 p.m.
I texted Sergei and asked him to consider one more thing .
It was n't meant to be , " Shero said .
" He 's had a fantastic stay here , five years , a Stanley Cup , classy and dignified , represented us really well .
I 'm really happy for him .
They got the three - year deal they were looking for .
Ottawa will be a great place for him .
" There was little concern expressed for Evgeni Malkin 's state - of - mind now that his good friend and buffer , Gonchar , is off to Canada .
" He has assured me that if Gonch does n't come back that that is Gonch 's decision and that he will be fine , " Shero said .
" He has a number of good friends on this team .
He has been over here for four years now and he is out ( living in Pittsburgh ) on his own .
" Having said that , what Sergei and ( his wife ) Ksenia did for Geno , you can't pay that back .
They will still be training together in the summer .
Geno is going to be fine and he will be ready to come back and have a real good year for himself .
" Shero also said he was in negotiations with Hamhuis prior to noon Thursday , " but we never got close before 12 o'clock . "
He gave up a third - round pick to get Hamhuis ' negotiating rights .
" I would do it again , " Shero said .
" It 's competitive to get defensemen when they are free agents .
I had four days to talk to Dan Hamhuis and I did n't have to spend time talking to him today .
If I did n't have that opportunity maybe I would have missed out on somebody .
I think it worked out well .
" With his defense taken care of , Shero said he 'll turn his focus to wingers .
Bill Guerin remains an unsigned unrestricted free agent and an option to return to Pittsburgh , and Shero said he hopes to hear from Guerin 's camp if they get an offer from another team .
" I can't say Billy is out of the picture at this point , " Shero said .
" We 'll see how things shape up .
The one promise I have to Billy is if we are going to move in another direction we are going to call him and let him know and vice versa . "
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - General Motors Co GM.UL plans to buy auto finance company AmeriCredit Corp ACF .N for $ 3.5 billion in a cash deal financed by government bailout money and aimed at removing a major investor concern before a planned IPO .
The deal announced Thursday would give GM an in - house lending arm for the first time since it sold a controlling stake in GMAC in 2006 and a chance to compete with faster - growing rivals led by Ford Motor Co F.N , by offering riskier forms of financing including subprime loans and leases .
The move also represents an admission that the go - it - alone strategy of past GM management had failed and a bet that the government - owned automaker can improve returns for taxpayers by drawing down part of the cash cushion left from its bailout .
Many GM dealers have complained that lack of financing options for consumers has cost them sales in a U.S. auto market stuck in a slow grinding recovery .
Analysts said the AmeriCredit deal addresses a risk to GM ’s sales momentum as it prepares for a stock offering this year that is intended to lower the government ’s nearly 61 percent stake .
But by bringing financing back in - house , GM is also taking on risk by stepping back into an area that forced the automaker to take massive charges as recently as 2008 .
“ It is going to be much more beneficial for GM to have a captive finance arm when they go to do their IPO .
Without it , it puts them at a disadvantage , ” said Autoconomy.com analyst Erich Merkle .
Mike Jackson , chief executive of the No. 1 U.S. auto dealership group AutoNation AN.N , said the AmeriCredit deal shows that GM is executing on its turnaround plan .
“ I have said it to anyone and everyone who would listen , ” Jackson told Reuters .
“ I would n’t run an auto manufacturer without a captive finance company .
I think it ’s that strategically crucial . ”
GM plans to pay AmeriCredit stockholders $ 24.50 per share .
AmeriCredit closed up 21 percent at $ 23.91 on Thursday .
‘ CORE ’ OF A NEW FINANCE ARM

AmeriCredit , which has $ 9 billion in auto loans , would become the “ core ” of a new GM finance arm .
Other major automakers , including Ford Motor Co F.N and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T , have in - house financing arms they use to provide loans to dealers and car buyers , often at subsidized rates to help sell vehicles .
GM 's move leaves Chrysler , controlled by Fiat SpAFIA .
MI , as the only large automaker without a dedicated financing arm .
GM Chief Executive Ed Whitacre said the automaker recognized it could not compete without owning its own lending arm .
That reverses a stance that dates to 2006 when it was scrambling to raise cash under former CEO Rick Wagoner and sold control of GMAC .
“ We were not as competitive as we could be , and it hurt our ability to meet rising demand for GM cars and trucks , ” Whitacre said .
“ Now we are going to fix that . ”
GM ended the first quarter with $ 36 billion in cash and securities .
It will pay for AmeriCredit from that cash , funding left over from the Obama administration ’s $ 50 billion bailout .
U.S. officials have said they would not interfere with decisions by GM .
A spokesman for the U.S. Treasury said the department had been notified in advance of the deal but played no role in it .
GM management moved to close the AmeriCredit deal quickly when it was presented , Whitacre said .
GM expects the deal to close in the fourth quarter .
An earlier plan GM officials had considered would have seen the automaker take back the auto financing operations of GMAC , essentially combining parts of two government - owned firms .
Detroit - based GMAC , now known as Ally Financial GKM.N , is 56 - percent owned by the U.S. Treasury after the government injected $ 17 billion as part of a restructuring that also saw the finance company become a commercial bank .
‘ BUILDING BLOCK ’ TO IPO
GM Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said the deal would help GM repay its taxpayer investment by providing a “ building block ” toward a more successful IPO .
With Fort Worth , Texas - based AmeriCredit operating as part of GM , the automaker expects to offer more loans to subprime buyers and to sell more vehicles on lease .
GM ’s sales to subprime customers could rise to 5 percent or 6 percent of sales from 4 percent now , Liddell said .
GM ’s lease rates as a share of sales will also rise from 7 percent closer to the 21 percent that the rest of the industry averages , he said .
The goal is to lift GM ’s U.S. sales which trailed the industry in the first half .
GM had 14 percent growth while U.S. sales jumped 17 percent .
Jesse Toprak , an analyst with market tracking firm TrueCar , estimates that about 25 million U.S. car shoppers have been pushed into the subprime credit category because of difficulties in restructuring their mortgages .
Most of those consumers could afford monthly auto payments if they could find financing at dealerships and those loans would be less risky than simple credit scores would suggest .
“ I think this is a smart move by GM and if they get this right , they can see sales rise significantly , ” said Toprak .
A subprime borrower is generally defined as a customer with a credit score below 620 .
Such borrowers can account for up to 25 percent of car shoppers in some markets , dealers say .
Gainesville , Fl – A Florida church with “ Islam is of the devil ” signs in its front lawn plans to host an “ International Burn A Quran Day , ” on the ninth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks this year .
The Dove World Outreach Center , a non-denominational church in Gainesville , has marked the date in previous years with protests against Islam .
The church holds protests on other issues , such as homosexuality , same - sex marriage , and abortion .
Pastor Terry Jones said members of the church plan to be at the Gainesville City Hall on Aug. 2 to protest the election of the city ’s openly gay mayor .
Church - state groups had previously accused the church of illegal politicking for its “ No Homo Mayor ” signs .
Jones , who is also the author of a book titled “ Islam is of the Devil , ” said protests are key to the mission of his church .
“ We feel , as Christians , one of our jobs is to warn , ” said Jones .
The goal of these and other protests are to give Muslims an opportunity to convert , he said .
In response to the posting of the event on Facebook a little more than a week ago , Jones said that people have been mailing Qurans to the church to burn .
He said organizers got the idea , in part , from another Facebook page , called “ Everybody Draw Muhammad Day . ”
Sept. 11 will fall during the Eid al - Fitr holiday this year , when Muslims mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan .
Local Muslims are planning to use the feast as an opportunity to share Islamic traditions and Qurans with the church members and the wider community .
“ We do n’t want to do anything that would be reactive , ” said Ramzy Kilic , communications director of the Tampa Chapter of the Council on American - Islamic Relations .
On May 10 , a pipe bomb exploded in the Islamic Center of Northwest Florida in Jacksonville .
No worshippers were hurt , but Kilic said the planned burning of Qurans could escalate tensions in the area .
MIAMI --
The mere hint of LeBron James coming to Miami made the Heat winners -- at the box office .
Season - ticket sales for the coming Heat season were suspended Thursday afternoon after the entire supply of available seats sold out .
That does n't mean all 19,600 seats are gone for the 41 home games .
Not every seat has been released for sale and some will be held back for single - game purchases .
James chose the Heat on a made - for - TV special on ESPN shortly before 9:30 p.m. ET .
By mid-afternoon , a message was posted on the Heat website inviting fans to call the team ticket office directly for purchase - related questions .
Earlier Thursday , season packages were available starting at $ 4,300 , and the auction sites like eBay had some packages offered for as much as $ 18,500 .
The Heat declined comment , although it 's expected that on Friday more tickets will be available .
Heat fans have been encouraged to buy them for months , even getting told during in - game announcements last season that prices would go up as the 2010 - 11 campaign drew nearer .
Meanwhile , the Florida Panthers could n't resist getting in on the ticket frenzy .
South Florida 's NHL team , which plays its games about 30 minutes north of the Heat home in downtown Miami , offered James a nod with a " Seats Fit For A King " promotion .
Through Monday , the Panthers were selling season tickets with a per-game price of $ 23 -- King James ' former jersey number -- in their lower bowl , and for $ 6 -- his new jersey number -- in the upper bowl .
" Based on the hype surrounding rumors of a new King headed to South Florida , we wanted to remind our fans that we want them to feel like royalty , " said Panthers president and chief operating officer Michael Yormark .
" Certainly , it 's an exciting time to be part of the South Florida sports industry . "

COMMODORE'S new Amiga A1000 computer was unveiled at Lincoln Center last week amid flashing lasers , rip - snorting jazz , rented tuxedos and rented celebrities , including Andy Warhol , who was there to bestow the first 15 minutes of fame on the machine .
Yet even surrounded by all the glitter , the Amiga stood out clearly as the evening 's star performer .
When it reaches the stores here in mid-September it will be one of the most technologically advanced computers available for the home and business markets .
Whether it will sell is another matter .
In the currently turbulent computer industry , even a dazzling machine like the Amiga - it has been described as a color Macintosh that works faster than an I.B.M. PC AT - has to fight for display space in the stores and is not guaranteed success .
Two major hurdles must be cleared if the Amiga is to survive its infancy .
The first is identity .
At $ 1,295 , plus $ 500 for a color monitor , it is too expensive for the casual home user , who may not know what to do with Amiga 's impressive horsepower .
And as a new , untested machine from a company that has previously sold its products in toy stores , Amiga faces a tough challenge in cracking the conservative business market .
Commodore officials vow that Amiga is the flagship of an armada of business products that will transform the company into a major international force in technology .
The second is software and peripherals .
About 15 programs will be available at Amiga 's debut , but only three are considered to be useful business tools .
As a consequence of the flawed highway reauthorization bill ( known as SAFETEA -LU ) enacted in 2005 , the highway trust fund ran out of money in fiscal year ( FY ) 2009 and has since been subsidized with general revenues from the Treasury .
Funded by a per-gallon fuel tax paid by truckers and motorists , the highway trust fund had a surplus as high as $ 23 billion in FY 2000 but — absent a bailout — would have turned negative in 2009 , because SAFETEA -LU authorized a level of annual spending in excess of tax revenues received .
Once a moneymaker for the federal government , the trust fund has become a money loser at a time when exploding government budget deficits are a threat to the health of the economy .
With future trust fund projections showing that the fund ’s financial problems will worsen in future years , the time is ripe to reform the system by returning surface transportation responsibility to the states along with the right to levy the 18.3 cents per gallon federal fuel tax .
How Bad Is It ?
A recent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) reveals that legislation already enacted will shift $ 67.3 billion of general revenues into the trust fund and to other transportation spending between FY 2008 and FY 2012 .
[1 ]
Unless transportation spending is cut from current levels or federal fuel taxes are increased substantially , an additional $ 56.1 billion will be added to the deficit over the five following fiscal years ( 2013 to 2017 ) .
Between 2013 and 2020 , the CBO estimates that trust fund losses will accumulate to $ 93.9 billion .
Importantly , the CBO ’s loss estimate can be viewed as fairly conservative in that it assumes federal transportation spending will increase each year at a rather modest rate — less than 2 percent .
Congress , however , has other plans , and House Transportation Committee Chairman James Oberstar ’s ( D–MN ) draft reauthorization legislation , the Surface Transportation Authorization Act ( STAA ) — and his new high - speed rail subsidy program — propose to spend a total of $ 500 billion over the next six fiscal years , compared to the $ 285 billion spent over the preceding period through SAFETEA -LU .
Obviously , if Oberstar succeeds in his plans , the trust fund deficit — and thus the federal budget deficit — will be very larger than the estimates provided by the CBO .
In this Chaos Lies Opportunity
The policy risk is that this fiscal dilemma will yield conventional solutions that might better be ranked by which one is worse than the other .
However , fiscal conservatives , advocates of limited government , and supporters of improved surface transportation and enhanced mobility might want to take a page from the Rahm Emmanuel playbook and embrace his dictum that “ you never want a serious crisis to go to waste .
What I mean by that is an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before . ” [ 2 ]
At the moment , that opportunity exists for transportation policy , thanks in large part to a combination of the serious fiscal deficiencies created by the ill conceived SAFETEA -LU , the Obama Administration ’s whimsical obsession with bicycles , and the introduction of Oberstar ’s bloated and bureaucratic reauthorization proposal : the STAA .
What to Do
Now is the time to consider the proposal put forth in 1995 by former Senator Connie Mack ( R–FL ) and former Representative John Kasich ( R–OH ) to return to the states the responsibility for operating the federal surface transportation program and to fund it by giving states the authority to collect the 18.3 cents per gallon fuel tax now collected by Washington .
This proposal is called “ turnback , ” to reflect its goal of restoring surface transportation policy to the states , where it was once held .
By shifting resources and responsibility to the states , turnback offers the traveling public five key benefits :
The motorists and truckers who fund the system would get a more equitable return on the taxes they pay , and overall mobility would improve ;
The inequitable geographic allocations in the current system would be eliminated ;
It would end the corrupt congressional earmarking process in transportation ; Transportation priorities would be set by state officials , not by Washington bureaucrats ; and Reform - minded state officials , no longer hobbled by federal prohibitions and costly mandates , could introduce promising reforms .
Most turnback plans establish a gradual phase - out of the federal fuel tax while maintaining minimum spending levels on a series of mandated projects to smooth the transition from federal to state control .
At the same time , the federal fuel tax would be reduced each year from its current level of 18.3 cents per gallon to , say , 16.3 cents in the next , 11.3 cents in the third , etc. , until it is eliminated over a five - year transition period .
As the federal fuel tax rate declines , states could , if they so desired , raise their own fuel tax by the amount that the federal fuel tax declines , thereby maintaining total transportation spending in their state by replacing lost federal resources with new state resources , with no change in the total tax burden on truckers or motorists .
Other Costs and Benefits
Some worry that a turnback program might lead to the neglect of the interstate highway system , which , while owned by the states , is viewed as a federal responsibility .
To the extent that that is a legitimate concern — and some question this because the current poor condition of the interstate under federal stewardship leaves much to be desired — turnback legislation could link the privilege of leaving the federal system with the responsibility of maintaining the interstate up to a certain standard .
Others note that , absent the current federal general fund bailout , the quality of surface transportation could fall if spending was limited just to gas tax revenues .
While nominally true , motorists could still gain because a turnback plan would also end the non-road diversions now mandated by federal law , which today siphon away about 30 percent of federal transportation spending .
Once in a Decade
With current proposals from Congress and the Administration promising to make things worse for American motorists , reformers have a once - in - a - decade opportunity to reform the federal highway and transit program in a way that would give greater responsibility and decision - making to the states and metropolitan areas that are confronting costly congestion and growing repair backlogs .
To this end , governors and state departments of transportation should take the lead in this effort to turn the program back to the states .

A few years back my wife and I were selling our townhouse , and the market was at it 's height .
Sellers were easily getting the asking price for their homes , and some were even getting more than one offer – sometimes above the asking price .
Times were good if you were a seller , however , the problem was that if you were selling your home , you are also probably looking to buy a new home .
We ended up selling our house for the asking price – and then we turned around and probably overpaid for our new home .
If only we had known what the market would do , we could have waited a few years after selling – and bought a new home at a bargain .
What 's that they say about hindsight ?
The market has now been going down for a couple of years , and homesellers are having a tough time selling their homes .
For many homeowners they bought their homes with little or no money down , and they 're now finding themselves underwater on their mortgage – they owe more than the house is worth .
From bloomberg.com
Continues after Advertisement
Almost one - quarter of U.S. mortgage holders owed more than their homes were worth in the second quarter and that figure may rise to as much as 30 percent by mid-2010 as job losses and foreclosures climb , Zillow.com said .
With so many underwater mortgages many people are just walking away from their homes .
When those people walk away the banks end up foreclosing .
That means the market now has a glut of foreclosed homes on the market .
In fact accordingto RealtyTrac.com there has already been 1,654,634 foreclosures so far in 2010 !
With all those foreclosures in addition to all the short sales , your competition is stiff .
You need to make sure to give yourself every possible advantage .
Here are some tips that will hopefully help you to sell your house fast .
9 Tips To Help You Sell Your Home
To help you sell your house in a down market , here are some things you can do .
Your pricing is extremely important :
If you want to sell quickly when the market is bad , you might have to make some leeway when it comes to your price .
Many areas ( including mine ) have been hurt by all the foreclosures and short sales , and prices are depressed .
While you do n't have to price your home like a foreclosure , you 'll still want to figure out what a reasonable price in your area is , and try to undercut your competition if you can .
The price you give your house is one of the more important pieces – so try not to get emotionally stuck on a certain price you were “ hoping to get ” .
Make sure it looks nice from the street :
While you can't always beat all the foreclosure and short sale homes on price , you can usually make sure your house has better curb appeal .
The foreclosure home may have an un-cut lawn , scraggly plants and garbage in the driveway – while yours should be spotless .
Get the home power washed , paint the trim and the doors , put on new exterior lights and / or knockers , and put in some nice new plants .
If the buyers do n't like how your house looks on the outside , you might not even get them through the door .
If it does look nice , you 'll give them a great first impression !
Put all your junk away ! :
When you ’re living in a home , you end up having bills on the counters , photos of your family on the wall and all sorts of other personal clutter that has grown over the years .
But when you ’re selling a home you want the people walking through the door to picture themselves being at home in your house .
Take down Billy 's class photos for the past 10 years off of your living room wall , and replace them with a nice piece of neutral wall art .
Clean off your kitchen counters .
Take extra furniture and put it in storage .
Remove unnecessary items from the house in general and put them in storage to make the house feel bigger .
Fix problems big and small :
If your house has a big problem of some sort that is glaringly obvious , get it fixed .
Broken window ?
Put in a replacement .
Dirty carpeting ?
Put in some new carpet .
Sometimes you can also have smaller problems that might not be so obvious , but that could still make a bad impression .
For example , when we sold our house we went around and repainted several rooms because of small marks and scratches on the wall .
The result was that our house almost looked brand new !
Stage your house to give a better impression :
We staged our home with my mother in law 's help when we sold our home .
It made our home feel more spacious , made it feel less cluttered and allowed buyers to picture themselves in the home .
We removed several larger pieces of furniture , and put some smaller plusher pieces from our parent ’s houses in the living room .
We took our personal photos down and put up framed art pieces .
We removed all the magnets and photos from the fridge , and put some strategic accessories around .
We watched a lot of HGTV and picked up tips from the experts on how to stage our home .
Give a bonus to buyers or agents :
You might want to think about offering to pay the closing costs for a homebuyer , or offering a signing bonus for an agent who brings in a full price offer .
Some folks have even thought to offer things like pre-paying homeowner 's association fees for a year or two .
Put your thinking cap on to think of bonuses , it does n't have to cost a ton if you do n't want it to .
Use non-traditional means to market your house :
While listing your house with your agent is a good first step , try other online and offline venues to market your house .
Put up a craigslist ad and use sites like zillow.com or trulia.com .
Try buying a domain name using your house 's address ( 1500 ParkAve.com ) , and put up a wordpress site to post pictures and details about your house .
Let people you know that the house is for sale and post it to Twitter , Facebook and other social media outlets .
Put up flyers at the local supermarket !
Find a good agent who will help you sell : Selling your house is one of the biggest financial transactions you 'll have .
It 's not a good time to do your crazy uncle Bob who just got his real estate license a favor and let him sell your house , especially if he 's not a good agent .
Call some agencies and ask for their top salesperson .
Get a good word of mouth recommendation and interview a few agents and ask them what their marketing plan for your home would be .
Use someone who knows how to market on the internet , the importance of good wide angle interior photos , and someone who understands your particular market .
Keep your house clean for when it shows - and do n't be there ! :
One of the things I hated doing while we were selling our house was keeping the house clean at all times in case there was a showing .
It stunk , but it paid off .
We also made sure not to be at home when the house was showing , because buyers hate nothing more than feeling like the owners are staring at them as they check out the house .
Finally , consider doing some baking before a showing , or light one of those cinnamon roll candles .
Anything you can do to make people feel at home is a plus .
Getting your house sold when the market is this tough is n't going to be an easy prospect – but it can still be done .
Just follow the tips above , have a little bit of patience , and you 'll be well on your way to putting that sold sign in your front yard .
Have a tip for something you did that helped your home sell fast ?

Robert Hall makes a telling point in Jon Hilsenrath ’s article today examining the effect of the stimulus program :
Robert Hall , a Stanford University professor , says there has n’t actually been that much extra government spending overall , because the increased federal spending has been largely offset by a large contraction in state and local government outlays .
By the third quarter of 2009 , he notes , federal government spending added $ 66 billion to economic output , less than 0.5 % of total output , offset by a $ 43.1 billion contraction in state and local government spending , he says .
Another way of saying this is that without the stimulus , overall government spending would have dropped sharply because state and local spending was dropping sharply .
One way to see this is to look back to the early months of 2009 .
At the time , the tax money flowing into state and local governments was falling rapidly , as was their spending .
In the spring — shortly after the passage of the stimulus , as state and local officials were finding out roughly how much federal money they would be receiving — tax revenue continued to drop , but spending jumped .
There is , of course , a strong connection between spending by state and local government and the number of people that state and local governments employ .
Without money , they have to lay off police officers , teachers , firefighters , emergency medical technicians , clerical workers and others .
That is what many governments are starting to do now that the federal stimulus money is running out .
The fact that state and local governments did n’t have to make drastic cuts at the nadir of the Great Recession is one more sign that the stimulus , despite its imperfections , has worked .
And it helps explain why all of the non-ideological analyses of the program — by the Congressional Budget Office , by Macroeconomic Advisers , by IHS Global Insight , by Moody ’s Analytics — suggest the stimulus is responsible for something like 2.5 million jobs that would not otherwise exist today .
Latest news
These films are in no particular order and are n't all films I like .
I wrote this post to be a companion piece to Kurt Halfyard 's wonderful Brave New Worldview â€ “ 30 Science Fiction Films of the 21st Century posted over at Row Three , so read this and then piece it together with his and we think you 'll have a pretty comprehensive list of important genre stuff from the new millennium to catch up with .
Here 's the thing ; we love the post apocalypse around here .
No foolin ' .
For those of you just tuning in , Quiet Earth started life as a site dedicated to the genre .
And while we cover the whole gamut of weird and wonderful genre film from around the globe now , we still like to think of ourselves asgo - to - guys on the subject .
From , to , to , we 've seen and read it all and we hope we 've alerted you all to some cool projects along the way .
Now , onto some thoughts about the epic list below .
A lot has transpired in the realms of post - apocalyptic cinema and television in the last ten or so years .
The first thing you 'll notice is that Kevin Costner no longer rules the wasteland and , of course , zombies do .
Seriously , there is more zombie material released daily than births in the USA ( Editor 's note : this is not based on an actual stat , but it is funny ) .
Another big change we 've seen in the new millennium , is that the apocalypse genre has shifted away from the high adventure of the Road Warrior and Waterworld and more into the realms of horror .
After going through this list , it is clear that the PA visions we 've been getting are bleaker , meaner , more cynical about our culture and technological dependence .
They also tend to feature a higher body count and often end on a " downer .
" This of course , leads us right into our first feature ...
The Signal is a surreal trip into a very dark apocalypse that is brought on by a mysterious signal that changes the majority of the population into ultra-violent , paranoid schizoids .
It takes the form of three different stories directed by three different directors , but still includes a main story of two lovers trying to find each other .
The film 's ability to turn from terrifying to humorous to touching on a dime made it an indie favorite back in 2008 and it holds up to this day , making it a standout of this list .
Danny
Boyle single handedly re-animated the lifeless corpse of the zombie apocalypse genre with his insanely frenetic .
Fast zombies , Godspeed you Black Emperor , and some insane hand - held photography made 28 Days Later the most exciting apocalypse flick anyone had seen in years .
Of course , Boyle did n't re-invent the wheel here .
Issues of militarism and the story of a small band of survivors is n't anything we have n't seen in any Romero movie , but Danny made it modern and we loved it .
So much so that a sequel followed and we may even be getting a threequel before the 21st century is over .
Jericho .
God , it seems like a lifetime ago that we followed the exploits of Skeet Ulrich and his fellow small towners as they attempted to keep their shit together after a series of terrorist attacks left America in post - apocalyptic turmoil .
In classic CBS fashion , the show straddled the line between family drama and 24 and was canceled after just one season , but was quickly given a seven episode second chance when fans sent pallets of nuts to the network in protest .
Watch it again on DVD and you 'll be surprised to find it a fast paced and timely conspiracy thriller representative of these cynical times .
Seriously , I think Jericho is a seminal PA series .
Period .
And , I hope it returns in one form or another .
put Zack Snyder on the map and proved that remakes can actually work .
Not all of us agree that this film holds a candle to George Romero 's 70s classic , but there 's no denying it captured the horror world when it was released in 2004 .
It took up the gauntlet that Boyle laid down with fast zombies and has one of the best apocalyptic openings ever .
And Sarah Polley .
Enough said .
Ah , The Dark Hour or " La Hora Fria " as it's called in its native Spain .
This is such a classy film , so beautifully shot that you'd be forgiven for thinking it was an old Guillermo del Toro production .
The story , told form the perspective of a young boy , is about a group of survivors who live underground to avoid the plagues and nasties of the world outside .
Every night at a specific time they have to lock their doors to avoid a sinister cold brought on by an unknown supernatural force .
A great foreign PA title worth checking out in my view - unfortunately , it was never released on R1 DVD .
You can pick it up overseas though .is a newish short film that comes from Danish filmmakers Jens RaunkjÃ¦r Christensen and Jonas Drotner Mouritsen who classify it as a " sci - fi western . "
Set in the distant future , Connected is a story about survival and greed in a post apocalyptic wasteland .
Two survivors of an unknown disaster shuffle through a desolate landscape tied to each other 's oxygen tank .
It quickly becomes clear that not everybody has the strength to survive .
This film is about ideas more than excitement , but it 's a striking vision .
You can watch the whole short here
If you 're wondering whyis on this list then you either , have n't seen the show , or , were n't paying very close attention .
BSG might be a high - tech space opera , but it 's also about the end of times .
The first season in particular is a well written apocalypse parable that has its characters as concerned about where to find water and food as how to escape from evil robots .
Regardless of how you felt about the series as a whole , when BSG was on it was REALLY on .
Ron Moore and his team took apocalyptic scifi tv to a whole new level with it and the reverberations of its success will be felt for years to come I 'm sure .
Even though this low - budget British endeavor gives us wilderness survival meets the zombie apocalypse , The Vanguard will mostly likely be remembered for introducing us to its dual axe wielding , Elvis shades wearing , bike riding main character , Max .
One of the last people alive in England , Max lives off the land , hunting " biosyns " along the way .
When he becomes involved with some AWOL military guys he learns more about the conspiracy that brought on the end .
It may be low budget , but The Vanguard was one of our favorites a couple years back and deserves a look if you have n't already seen it .
Oh Eden Log , you could have been so good , but you were too French for your own good .
As much as the slow pace and obtuse narrative of this movie frustrates me , I can't help but marvel at how beautiful it looks .
Not enough to recommend it whole heartedly , but it the film at least took a different kind of narrative approach by telling the story of a civilizations downfall in reverse .
The film is from the perspective of a single survivor who wakes up underground with on memories .
As he climbs up to the surface through the remains of a once technologically powerful world he learns the story of what happened and fights mutants .
French director Franck Vestiel paints a powerful vision , but tells his story in a most boring possible way .
It 's too bad , because this movie could have been as good as Pandorum if executed differently .
Easily one of the most anticipated post - apocalyptic movies of the last ten years , was also the most universally disappointing .
Are those two facts related ?
I do n't think so .
The fact is , The Happening deserves its famous re-titling of " The Crapening , " because its crappy .
Forget the fact that the cast is weak and has no chemistry , it 's premise it so outrageously ridiculous and illogical that it's hard to even give it points for originality .
I mean , the characters run from wind .
You can't outrun wind .
You just can't .
It 's all around you if it 's there .
As much as we all dislike this film , there 's no denying it was an important 21st century entry into the genre so it makes the list .
Why isincluded and notor ?
Simple .
Because LOTD marked the " triumphant " return of zombie maestro George Romero - arguably the father of modern zombie anything .
Personally I do n't much care for Land .
In the eighties Romero became obsessed with this notion that maybe zombies were people too , capable of learning and feeling emotions .
As soon as that zombie gas attendant picked up a machine I thought " uh oh " and it was pretty much downhill from there .
This is daft stuff , but it was fun to have Romero take us back into his world and I know this film has its fans .
Definitely an important one in the long run .
Carriers is another film that has its detractors , but I loved it enough to have seen it a few times now and I think it will rise in popularity once the dust settles around its slow and somewhat lackluster release .
What on the surface looks like another plague movie featuring the walking dead turned out to be anything but .
In Carriers , directed by brothers Alex and David Pastor , the plague does n't do much but kill you - and that 's really scary .
The film is essentially a post - apocalyptic road movie where a group of characters encounter strange folk and have adventures as they make their way across the America wasteland towards the west coast .
It 's bleak and heartbreaking and full of some tension and has a likable young cast .
was a TV show produced by Showtime back before they hit it big with shows like Weeds and Californication .
It only ran for two seasons .
The story is loosely based on Belgian writer Hermann Huppen 's comic book series , " Jeremiah , " but series showrunner J. Michael Straczynski took a lot of liberties .
In the show , the year is 2021 and it has been 15 years since a plague killed everyone over the age of puberty ( so no adults ) .
The children who survived are now grown , and must choose between either scavenge off the diminishing remains of the old world , or begin trying to rebuild .
It stars Luke Perry and is actually pretty decent and full of some interesting twits and turns .
Season 2 was recently released on demand from Amazon so the whole series is out there , ready to be rediscovered .
is a totally underrated post apocalyptic kids adventure about a city underground whose lights are slowly burning out .
At its core , City of Ember is a parable about keeping the faith in a secular world and moving up towards the light - but I do n't care about that stuff .
For me , the film was a wonderfully staged and often funny story about growing up in a world run by dimwitted adults who can't see beyond their own noses and are destined to destroy their world .
Plus it features some truly stellar production design .
Directing team Michael Bartlett and Kevin Gates ' first time out of the gate was a bonafide international hit that put them on the post apocalyptic film map and set them up for a ton of good stuff to come .
On the downside , the quick financial success of the film got it scooped up by Weinstein 's Dimension Extreme label who mis-marketed the found - footage film Stateside making it look like Dawn of the Dead 2 and turning casual viewers against the film .
If you have n't seen it , The Zombie Diaries is a very realistic feeling film about a media crew who are doing a story during a pandemic only to find themselves in the thick of a full on viral apocalypse .
Is the monster apocalypse that happens inhappening worldwide , or just in Maine where the film takes place ?
Well if the film had ended like Stephen King 's novella there would be a good case that it was worldwide and humans were hooped .
Darabont sees it differently , but despite the changed ( and shocking ) ending , The Mist remains a seminal apocalyptic vision of the 21st century .
Not universally liked upon release , the film is very quickly picking up fans who are finding it , or revisiting it on DVD and blu-ray .
One of the things that makes The Mist so great , is its ensemble cast .
It feels like a King story and the film proves that Darabont is the only guy who should be touching the prolific writers work for the screen ( Maybe " The Stand " next , Frank ? )
One of the more controversial television productions among PA fans was the recent BBC remake of the classic Terry Nation show , .
A hit and miss hodge - podge of 12 episodes , the series had a hard time maintaining a consistant tone and , a little like Jericho , flip - flopped between wanting to be both a family - friendly show and a hard - edged PA thriller .
The fact that it was on BBC 1 probably had a hand in that , but ultimately I think Survivors will be remembered because of its relationship to the original series more than what it offered the genre .
Still , it 's a production that got us talking so it makes the list .
You really can't downplay the importance of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's .
It spawned years worth of copycat zomedies ( certainly the movie below would never have existed without it ) .
It also proved the Brits were still in the game and had their uncanny self deprecating sense of humor intact .
I 'm sure you 've all seen it all so that 's enough out of me - suffice it to say Shaun of the Dead has proved and important import .
Zombieland is a textbook case of right place , right time .
Premiering right when worldwide zombie mania was at it's apex , ( you could argue that apex is still rockin ' on ) Zombieland cleaned up at the box office and introduced fanboys to cute - as - a - button indie darling , Emma Stone ( move over Zooey ) .
As stated above , it would never have existed without Shaun of the Dead , but at the same time it 's not a copycat .
Its humor is decidedly American and its obvious also owes a lot to Apatow productions .
Too early to tell is it's a seminal PA flick , but its certainly important here and now .
F***K
I love this movie and I do n't care who knows it .
With Doomsday , British genre guru , Neil Marshall , introduced his true intentions as a filmmaker .
Screw The Descent .
Claustrophobic horror was a means to an end for Marshall who so clearly wants to make brawling action horror for adults .
Some would argue that Doomsday is n't PA because the wasteland is n't worldwide but trapped behind a wall .
I say the outside world is dead and it just does n't know it yet .
The only thing that rots about this film is the Road Warrior style car chase at the end .
Marshall had the chance to beat out Miller and sort of failed , relying on fast cuts .
Having said that , there 's no question that Doomsday is on b - a - d - a -s-s PA actioner .
And now for something completely different .
To quote myself from 2008 ; " Right at your Door does what every great indie film working on a minimal budget needs to do .
It exploits a suspenseful high concept plot device only to morph it into an intimate and ultimately human story ...
It tells the story of Brad and Lexi , a young couple whose new life together is turned upside - down when a slew of " dirty bombs " are detonated in L.A. , releasing toxic gas into the atmosphere .
Told by the media to seal the house , Brad grudgingly quarantines Lexi outside where she must wait for help .
" Informed by a post 9/11 America , the film provokes questions about our new - found paranoia while it divulges just how severely we 've come to distrust authorities who are as likely to hurt us as help us .
The editing is sharp , the acting is superb , and the story is as riveting as it is devastating .
A must see .
When I read Cormac MaCathy's " The Road " I had a feeling it would be adapted for the screen , but I did n't think it would translate that well .
Not because what happens in the book complex , in fact quite the opposite .
The book is reflective and quiet and subtly terrifying - all things that drive people away from the cinema .
Luckily John Hillcoat , Viggo Mortensen and Aussie composer Nick Cave banded together to do the best they could .
Held back for a year and marketed like a cannibal film , the good vision managed to prevail and we have , what I consider to be , a faithful and seminal PA movie here .
Blindness is based on JosÃ© Saramago 's novel about a plague of blindness that effects 90 % of the world .
It 's a very cerebral and powerful film about human nature and to quote Marina , who loved the film : " visually , Meirelles does not disappoint .
His vision of a city in collapse is eerily reminiscent of 28 Days Later , itâ€™s follow up 28 Weeks Later and even children of Men .
Meirelles uses the decaying surroundings as a metaphor for the corruption of society and the result is an ugly marvel ; a cityscape crowded by garbage , bodies and animals . "
This is a dark one folks .
This one , however , is not a dark one .
As you would expect from a Roland Emmerich disaster flick , is bloated , silly and has CGI destruction up the wazoo .
A more epic vision of world - wide destruction there has never been though so , if you 're in the right frame of mind , 2012 can be a fun ride .
Having said that , one gets the feeling that the real story begins when the movie ends - on those giant arks that look like floating Battlestars .
There 's a good tv show in there somewhere .
Too bad Emmerich ditched it .
( " AdÃ¡s " ) is a Hungarian film that has n't been released wide yet , but based on some good early reviews ( here and here ) , I 'm including it on this list anyway .
Directed by Roland Vranik , the film is about a technological apocalypse where computers , TVs , cells , and other telecom devices no longer work and the people are suffering severe withdrawal pains .
Three brothers try to overcome their own major personal problems as the society slowly begins to find alternative ways of living .
In true European fashion , the film less concerned with chaos and destruction and more with people .
Personally I can't wait to check it out .
Cargo 's story may take place on a rickety old space freighter , but the tone of the entire film is certainly informed by post - apocalyptic overtones and a healthy of dose of mistrust of authority .
In the film , the earth is uninhabitable and humans float in space , looking for a new planet to settle on .
A stunning dystopian vision made on a dime , the film looks far more expensive than it is , but has been criticized for its resemblance of other space station scifi movies .
An unfair quibble in my mind , considering the genre is built on that kind of thing .
Oh well , people are picky I guess .
I 'm not a big fan of this series , but I think the third film , , is probably my favorite just because it takes us into a classic apocalypse with a convoy of survivors , zombie crows - the whole nine yards .
Mutant Alice is sort of badass , the fast zombies are sort of scary , but there are also too many one liners and tongue - in - cheek moments for my liking .
( or " Tag 26 " in its native Germany ) is a stellar post - apocalyptic short from 2003 by Andreas Samland .
Inspired by TarkovskijÂ´s
Stalker the film is shows how two survivors of a biological disaster are able to subsist when their bodies are n't able to come in contact with the world .
It 's a very realistic and haunting vision .
The entire shot appeared online a few months back and you can watch it here 9 is directed by Shane Acker , but the average Joe thinks its from Tim Burton .
Burton actually co-produced this animation anomaly with Russian wunderkind Timur Bekmambetov and the results are , well , middling at best .
The film looks gorgeous and the story is original , but it feels like a first course .
The film is all action and little else so by the end you feel less entertained than stimulated .
I think the film is already starting to be forgotten , but it was a film that garnered a lot of buzz upon release and it is certainly important in the 21st century PA pantheon , so I decided to include it here .
I feel bad leaving this list on a sour note , but I just could n't in good conscience leave the bomb that is Terminator : Salvation off this list .
As the only of the Terminator series that takes us fully into " Judgment Day " everyone was expecting great things - particularly when some stellar trailers started to make their way online .
And yes the film looks great , but the script is just abominable .
Abysmal .
Atrocious .
A$ $ .
A great cast could n't even save the haphazardness of it all .
It all just feels rushed and it's too bad because the premise is exactly what were we waiting for after three films that just riffed on the same time - travel premise .
Oh well , you win some , you lose some .

Art collector Charles Saatchi is gifting more than 200 works and his Saatchi Gallery to the British public , it has been announced .
The artworks , including Tracey Emin's My Bed and Chapman brothers works , are worth more than £ 25 m ( $ 37.7 m ) .
The 70,000 sq ft Saatchi Gallery in Chelsea , owned by Cadogan Estate , will become the Museum of Contemporary Art for London ( Moca London ) .
The museum will meet all costs and " no charges will fall to the state " .
The gallery 's management are in talks with the government to find a department " which would own the works on behalf of the nation " .
The gallery said in a statement that Saatchi felt it was " vital for the museum always to be able to display a living and evolving collection of work , rather than an archive of art history " .
It said the gift would ensure that , when Saatchi retired , Moca would have " a strong , rotating permanent collection of major installations " .
Moca will be free to display the works at all times as well as to lend them to other institutions .
' Actively involved '
Tracey Emin said she was thrilled by Saatchi 's donation and wished " more people had that kind of vision " .
A permanent collection of works by high - profile British artists , including Emin , forms part of Saatchi 's gift .
This is fantastic news - I 'm very proud to be part of another national institution Grayson Perry
It includes Richard Wilson 's Oil Room installation which is currently on display at the gallery .
It also includes Tragic Anatomies , by Jake and Dinos Chapman , which features mutated mannequins in a garden , and an installation by Emily Prince made up of thousands of drawings of US military personnel killed in Afghanistan and Iraq .
A wall of bones which form the text of a Gandhi speech - by Indian artist Jitish Kallat - and French - Algerian artist Kader Attia 's room of life - sized praying figures made from aluminium foil also form part of the collection .
Further gifted pieces which do not form part of the permanent collection could be sold by Moca to raise cash for new works .
Image caption Tragic Anatomies , by Jake and Dinos Chapman , is among the gifts
New acquisitions will be added to the foundation 's holdings , enabling the museum " to remain actively involved in the newest developments in contemporary art " .
The gallery 's managers say they will make sure free entrance continues by raising money from sponsorship and hosting events , and using revenues from its facilities .
Turner Prize winner Grayson Perry , whose pieces are among works gifted , said : " This is fantastic news - I 'm very proud to be part of another national institution . "
Culture Secretary Jeremy
Hunt said : " Charles Saatchi has built up a collection of huge international importance .
" His decision to gift these works to the nation is an act of incredible generosity and I 'd like to thank him on behalf of the government .
" Philanthropy is central to our vision of a thriving cultural sector and this is an outstanding example of how Britain can benefit from individual acts of social responsibility . "
FaceTime and the iPod Touch
That FaceTime is currently only available when connected to Wi-Fi is , obviously , a limitation .
But that it uses Wi - Fi — data , rather than voice networking — is an indication of just how big a deal it is .
It ’s the beginning of Apple ’s end - run around the phone carriers .
You can switch to FaceTime from a call that started as a voice call , but as Dan Frommer reported at Business Insider this week , once you switch to FaceTime , you ’re no longer using voice minutes .
The voice call ends once the FaceTime connection is made .
More importantly , you do n’t need to initiate a FaceTime call using a voice call .
You can start the call using FaceTime directly , in which case the entire process takes place over IP networking .
The advantage to starting with a voice call is that you ’ll get a voice connection even if the recipient is n’t on Wi-Fi at the moment .
But consider the implications of the fact that you do n’t need to start with a voice call .
That means you do n’t , in theory , need to start with a phone .
A hypothetical camera - equipped iPod Touch could make FaceTime calls .
So could a hypothetical camera - equipped iPad .
Or even an Apple TV .
This notion occurred to me during the WWDC keynote , when Steve Jobs said that Apple expected to ship “ tens of millions of FaceTime devices ” ( emphasis added ) this year alone .
( Skip to around the 1:33:30 mark in the keynote . )
Today , a FaceTime - capable iPod Touch would not be a proper replacement for a phone .
You could neither send nor receive calls when not connected to a Wi -Fi network , nor send or receive calls with anyone using a device that does n’t support FaceTime .
( The Wi-Fi limitation similarly anchors Skype - equipped iPod Touches today . )
But surely , someday , there will be a non-phone - carrier wireless networking technology with far greater range than Wi-Fi .
FaceTime , I think , is a first step in the direction of a mobile “ phone ” with no mobile carrier .
If and when FaceTime is supported over 3G in addition to Wi -Fi , it ’ll be data , not voice — megabytes , not minutes .
And immediately , starting today , it ’s a step away from tying your iPhone ’s “ calls ” to your carrier ’s network .

Rick Norsigian made one of the best yard sale deals ever .
Ten years ago , the California painter bought two boxes of photographic plates for $ 45 , after he bargained the owner down from $ 75 .
Today , they are worth an estimated $ 200 million .
So what was in those boxes ?
Sixty - five glass negatives made by Ansel Adams , the iconic American nature photographer , CNN reported .
Experts thought the negatives were lost in a 1937 darkroom fire that destroyed 5,000 plates .
Treas .
Reg. § 1.61 - 14 ( a ) provides that “ [ t ] reasure trove , to the extent of its value in United States currency , constitutes gross income for the taxable year in which it is reduced to undisputed possession . ”
The leading case is Cesarini v. United States , 296 F.Supp. 3 ( D. Ohio 1969 ) , in which a husband and wife who purchased a used piano at a 1957 auction for $ 15 in 1957 and discovered $ 4,467 in cash in the piano in 1964 were required to report the $ 4,467 in income in 1964 .
But Mr. Norsigian 's case is distinguishable and he would not have to report the $ 200 million of gain ( less his $ 45 basis ) until he sells the photographic plates .
See Joseph Bankman , Thomas D. Griffith & Katherine Pratt , Federal Income Tax : Examples and Explanations ( Aspen , 5th ed. 2008 ) :
[ T ]he circumstances in Cesarini should be distinguished from situations in which a taxpayer discovers that something that he had bought was worth more than he originally paid for it .
In the latter situation the taxpayer would not have an income inclusion until the property was sold or exchanged -- in other words , until the gain was " realized . " ...
In year one , Ellie pays $ 300 for an antique dresser at an estate sale .
... [ I ] n year three , ... Ellie discovers that the dresser is a rare antique , worth $ 10,000 .
Later , in year five , Ellie sells the dresser for $ 12,000 .
... [ Answer : $ 11,700 of gain in year five . ]

SINGAPORE — Almost overlooked amid BP ’s debacle in the Gulf of Mexico was an oil spill in the Singapore Strait , where in late May two tankers collided and disgorged the equivalent of 18,000 barrels of oil into one of the world ’s busiest shipping lanes .
The Singapore incident was small compared with the 87 - day catastrophe bubbling away in the gulf , and the Singapore authorities , responding with characteristic efficiency , mopped up the mess with booms and chemical dispersants in just six days .
But the accident served as a reminder that Asia is not invulnerable to an environmental disaster on the scale of the BP spill .
Singapore is a major refining center and transshipment point for crude oil shipments between markets in East Asia and the other oil - rich Gulf region .
The quest for more plentiful and less expensive oil for fast - growing Asian economies has also brought a wave of offshore drilling from India and the Gulf of Thailand , to Vietnam and Bohai Bay , on the northeast coast of China .
In considering this risk and the increasing evidence of the toll that rapid economic development is already taking on Asia ’s environment , economists and other experts in Asia have taken up the call to re-examine the prominence of economic growth as a measure of policy success , particularly the use of gross domestic product .
For Palenque inhabitants , marine fossils were the convincing proof of the land being covered by the sea long time ago , and parting from this fact they created their idea of the origin of the world .
MEXICO CITY .-
Recent interdisciplinary investigations regarding 31 marine fossils found at Palenque Archaeological Zone , in Chiapas , reveal that Maya people conceived their beliefs parting from this kind of vestiges , so their idea of the underworld was associated to water .
For Palenque inhabitants , marine fossils were the convincing proof of the land being covered by the sea long time ago , and parting from this fact they created their idea of the origin of the world , declared archaeologist Martha Cuevas , responsible , with geologist Jesus Alvarado , of research conducted by the National Institute of Anthropology and History ( INAH ) and the National Autonomous University of Mexico ( UNAM ) .

Since 1982 , the Siena Research Institute has polled presidential scholars on whom they view to be best and worst presidents in American history , based on a variety of issues from “ integrity ” to economic stewardship .
This year ’s poll [ PDF ] of 238 scholars found that President Franklin Roosevelt was once again ranked on top , joined by Presidents Lincoln , Jefferson , Washington , and Teddy Roosevelt to complete the top five .
However , President George W. Bush did not fare well since the last poll was conducted in 2002 .
He dropped 16 places to 39th , making him the worst president since Warren Harding died in office in 1923 , and one of the bottom five of all time , according to the experts :
Today , just one year after leaving office , the former president has
found himself in the bottom five at 39th rated especially poorly in handling the economy , communication , ability to compromise , foreign policy accomplishments and intelligence .
Rounding out the bottom five are four presidents that have held that dubious distinction each time the survey has been conducted : Andrew Johnson , James Buchanan , Warren G. Harding , and Franklin Pierce .
Bush was rated second from the bottom on “ intelligence , ” “ foreign policy
accomplishments , ” and “ handling of U.S. economy . ” … [ emphasis original ]
Introduction
Web applications have become a major part of many people ’s lives , so much so that many of us use them all the time .
Would n’t it be great if we could use them even when offline ?
Until recently , there was n’t any viable way to do this – however , with the introduction of the W3C HTML5 application cache feature , it is possible to make your web applications run offline as well as online .
Let us see how …
Why have your app run offline ?
Web applications are becoming more complex and capable every day .
There are many examples of web applications doing the same job as desktop applications in various fields ( think about Google Docs , Picasa , etc. ) .
However , one major disadvantage is that they cannot work when the user is not connected to the Internet .
This is where HTML5 's new offline storage comes in .
It tries to remove that disadvantage by defining a way to store files in a cache , so that when the user is offline , the browser still has access to the necessary files .
These can be HTML , CSS or JavaScript files , or any other assets the site needs to run .
Saving your files for offline use with the application cache
HTML5 has a feature for offline web applications called application cache , or AppCache for short .
Files stored in this AppCache are available to the application even when the user is offline .
You can specify which files you want to store in the AppCache using a manifest file .
How is the application cache different from the normal browser cache ?
There a number of ways in which AppCache is different from the browser 's normal cache .
First of all , is the intention behind the two .
AppCache is intended for proper web applications whereas the browser 's cache is for normal web pages in general .
The normal cache will cache pretty much any page whereas the AppCache will only cache pages which are specifically included in the manifest file .
Plus , the normal cache is unreliable , as we dont know which pages ( and which resources within those pages ) will be available for sure .
AppCache is exciting because now the developer has much more programmatic control over the cache , which means much more certainty and control over how web applications could behave offline .
Also to note , is that you can have multiple pages share the same AppCache .
Also , with AppCache , you can make use of the API to determine what is the state of the AppCache , and then even have it update itself .
The manifest file
This file resides on the server and dictates which files should be stored client - side in the browser 's AppCache , in readiness for the user going offline .
Let 's delve a bit deeper in into how it works .
You can give the manifest file any name you want , but best practice dictates that you give it an extension of . manifest .
Every manifest file has to start with CACHE MANIFEST , after which you list the files you want to be stored and made available for offline use .
Comments can be made by putting # at the beginning of a line .
A very simple manifest file looks like so :
CACHE MANIFEST
# You can also use the CACHE : section header to explicitly declare the following three files .
style.css script.js index.htm
The manifest file has to have the correct MIME Type , which is text / cache - manifest .
To deal with these , you could have an extension . manifest for the manifest file , and add the following in the .htaccess file on your server : AddType text / cache - manifest .manifest
Linking the HTML file with the manifest file
Now that you have created the manifest file telling which files need to be cached in your application , you need tell the HTML page to use that cache .
To do this you have to link the page to the manifest file by including the manifest attribute in the < HTML > tag of your page .
For example :
< html manifest=” demo.manifest ” >
If your web application has more than one page , make sure that all the pages link to the manifest file in this way , otherwise they wo n't be part of the AppCache , and wo n't work offline .
Using section headers for better control over the AppCache
So far , we 've seen a very basic example of how to use the manifest file .
With the use of section headers , we can actually specify exactly how a certain file is to be cached , or not .
Explicitly defining the files to be cached
You can use the CACHE : section header to explicitly declare which files need to be cached .
For example , the previous example of the manifest file can be written like so , and it will function in exactly the same way :
CACHE MANIFEST CACHE : style.css script.js index.htm
The only difference is that in this example we have explicitly declared that all those files will be part of the application cache .
Here is a very simple example page that uses the CACHE : section header .
It is important to note that the path mentioned for the files should be relative to the location of the manifest file .
In the examples here , we are assuming that the files mentioned are in the same directory as the manifest file .
You can use relative as well as absolute URLs when stating the files in the manifest file .
The files specified as part of the CACHE : will load from AppCache ( not the server ) even if you are online , provided that there is no change in the manifest file .
If , however , the browser finds an updated manifest file , then the new cache will once again be downloaded according to the what new manifest file says .
So AppCache may not be suitable for sites with fast moving content like news blogs , for example , but can be very useful for web applications which do a particular thing and want to work offline ( for example , a calendar app , or a to - do list , etc. ) .
What if I want a file to bypass the cache and load directly from the server ?
If a page is associated with a manifest file , then only those files mentioned in the manifest file will try to load regardless of whether the user is online or offline .
Now , there may be situations where you might want some file to bypass this cache when the user is online , so that it connects and downloads fresh from the server instead of the cache ( For example , some dynamic content from a CGI Script ) .
Basically , if a page is associated with a manifest file , then all network traffic for its files is blocked , and files either have to be loaded from the AppCache , or fail to load .
The NETWORK : section header gives exceptions for this rule .
You can use the NETWORK : section header to declare which files should NOT to be cached , so that they are downloaded from the server , and never be part of the application cache .
The NETWORK : section header respects the browser 's normal cache header .
So if a file is supposed to be cached by the browser 's normal cache , then it will still be cached by it ( just like any other file not specified in the AppCache ) , even if it 's specified under the NETWORK : section header .
CACHE MANIFEST CACHE : style.css script.js index.htm NETWORK : style2.css
In the above example , style2.css will always be downloaded from the server and never be part of the application cache .
Keep in mind that it may be the case that you have too many files to list which need to bypass the cache , making writing them all down under the NETWORK : section header cumbersome .
In this case you can use the asterisk character ( * ) , so that all urls are allowed to go online if you are online .
Check out my example that uses a manifest file employing a NETWORK : section header .
You will notice what when you are offline and re-load the page , the page does reload , but the background styling disappears .
This is because the background styling in this example is in the file style2.css , which is under the NETWORK : section header , meaning that it is not cached and will only load when you are online and re-load the page .
Providing fallback content
The FALLBACK : section header is used to define fallbacks to be used in place of files that fail to load ( or load incompletely ) :
CACHE MANIFEST CACHE : style.css script.js index.htm NETWORK : style2.css FALLBACK : main_image.jpg backup_image.jpg
The fallback content is supposed to be cached and only used in case the main content does not load .
In the above example , backup_image.jpg is cached by AppCache so if main_image.jpg cannot load , backup_image.jpg will load in its place .
Check out my manifest backup example — if you go to this page , and disconnect from the internet and then re-load the page , the browser will try to load the image , but since you 're not online ( and the image is not cached ) it will not load , and hence the fallback content will load in its place instead .
( The browser will first take a little time trying to load the main content , and only then load the fallback content ... so be patient ! )
This manifest file is utilized in my example that provides fallback content for a number of images .
Using the application cache API and events to make sure the latest files are used in your cache
One of the great things about application cache is that now you , the programmer , have access to how the cache could behave .
You have access to events which can tell you about the current state of the application cache , and have functions to asynchronously update it too .
For example , you can use window.
applicationCache to find out if the browser supports application cache or not .
Let 's take a look at some other ways in which you can gain programmatic control over the application cache .
Statuses
You can check the current status of the application cache using window.applicationCache.status , which returns a numeric value mapped to the following states :
0 - uncached If the page is not linked to the application cache .
Also , the very first time the application cache is being downloaded , then during the time it is being downloaded , the AppCache will have a status of uncached .
1 - idle
When the browser has the latest version of the AppCache , and there aren no updated versions to download , then the status is set to Idle .
2 - checking
The duration of when the page is checking for an updated manifest file , then the status is set to Checking .
3 - downloading
The duration of when the page is actually downloading a new cache ( if an updated manifest file has been detected ) , the status is set to downloading 4 - updateready
Once the browser finishes downloading that new cache , it is ready to be used ( but still not being used yet ) .
During this time , the status is set as updateready 5 - obsolete
In case the manifest file cannot be found , then the status is set to obsolete and the application cache gets deleted .
It is important to know , that in case the manifest file ( or any file mentioned in the manifest file except those which have a fallback ) fail to load , then it will be counted as an error and the old application cache will continue to be used .
Events
Certain events also get fired , depending on what going on with the AppCache at the moment .
checking
This gets fired when browser is checking for attempting to download the manifest for the first time , or is checking if there is an updated version of the manifest file .
noupdate
If there is no updated version of the manifest file on the server , then noupdate is fired .
downloading
If the browser is downloading the cache for the first time , or if is downloading an updated cache , then this is fired .
progress
This is fired for each and every file which is downloaded as part of the AppCache .
cached
This is fired when all the resources have finished downloading , and application is cached .
updateready
Once resources have finished re-downloading for an updated cached file , then updateready is called .
Once this happens , then we can use swapCache ( ) ( as explained later in the article ) to make the browser to use this newly updated cache .
obsolete
This is fired if the manifest file cannot be found ( 404 error or 410 error ) .
error
This can be fired for a number of reasons .
If the manifest file can't be found , then the application cache download process has to be aborted , in which case this event can be fired .
It can also be fired in case the manifest file is present , but any of the files mentioned in the manifest file can't be downloaded properly .
It can even be fired in case the manifest file changes while the update is being run ( in which case the browser will wait a while before trying again ) , or in any other case where there is a fatal error .
The event handlers for these events are all prefixed by ' on ' .
For example , onchecking , onupdateready , onerror , etc .
The application cache API has a few things worth noting :
window.applicationCache.update ( ) :
This will trigger the application cache download process , which is nearly the same as reloading the page .
It simply checks if the manifest has changed , and if so downloads a fresh version of all the content in the cache ( respecting any cache headers ) .
Note that even though a new cache is created with this , the page will continue to use the old cache .
To make the page use the new cache you have just downloaded , you must use the swapCache ( ) function .
window.applicationCache.swapCache( ) :
This function tells the browser to start using the new cache data if it is available .
It is important to note that even if there is a new manifest file , the application will still continue using the old cache ( as specified in the old manifest file ) until swapCache ( ) is called .
Once swapCache( ) is called , then the cache will be used as specified from the new manifest file .
Normally you wo n’t need to use the update ( ) function , as the browser should automatically do this when reloading a page .
Most commonly the swapCache ( ) function will be used in conjunction with the onupdateready event .
In the following example , if you change the manifest file and reload the page , the browser will download the new files in the cache , and then switch to the new cache ( as the swapcache ( ) function is called ) :
< html manifest =" demo.manifest " > < head > < script type =" text / javascript " > window.applicationCache.addEventListener('updateready ' , function ( ) { window.applicationCache.swapCache( ) ; } , false ) ; </ script > </ head > < body > ... </ body > </html >
If the page you build is unlikely to be reloaded by the user for a while , then you could periodically call the update ( ) function to check for new updates to the manifest file , and if so , call the swapcache ( ) function on an updateready event to download and switch to the new cache :
setInterval ( function ( ) { window.applicationCache.update( ) ; } , 3600000 ) ; //
Check for an updated manifest file every 60 minutes .
If it 's updated , download a new cache as defined by the new manifest file .
window.applicationCache.addEventListener('updateready ' , function ( ) { // when an updated cache is downloaded and ready to be used window.applicationCache.swapCache( ) ; // swap to the newest version of the cache } , false ) ;
This code will check for an updated version of the manifest file every 60 minutes .
If it finds a different version of the manifest file on the server than it previously encountered , it will download a new cache based on this new manifest .
Once that happens , an updateready event will be fired , stating that an updated copy of the cache has finished downloading and is ready to be used .
We can then explicitly use the swapCache ( ) function to swap the old cache with the new one we just downloaded .
In this way , you can ensure that the user 's cache will stay updated .

In 1982 a trial was held in Rangoon , Myanmar .
This trial caught the world 's attention .
Two ex U.S. Marines - Major W. H. Schwartz and Lieutenant Steve Blackthorpe , and an American businessman , Henry Wheaton , were on trial for the assassination of the president of Myanmar , Min Tyint .
The three were found guilty and summarily executed by hanging , but the media were more interested in the method of assassination .
Never before had the murder methods of the world 's leading countries been available to the public .
The international presses covered the trial extensively , but this coverage ended abruptly as reporters began disappearing and dying of , apparently , natural causes and accidents .
This persuaded the reporters who were not yet dead to stop covering the story .
The United States government began an extensive cover up operation , and the government 's secrets were soon forgotten .
But not completely forgotten .
I bring you here one of the most chilling true stories of all time - the U.S. government 's dispatching of several third world leaders in the 70's and 80's .
o-----o-----o
After the Vietnam War , the United States realised that they could not tolerate another war , and began developing new methods of ' dealing ' with foreign countries they disagreed with .
The most obvious ( and effective ) method was simply to dispatch of the leader and either replace him with a ' puppet ' , or simply hope that a better one will take his place .
In the late 1970's and early 1980's , the United States executed no fewer than 13 heads of state , all leaders of third world countries .
But not a single shot was fired , and only in one case , in Myanmar , was the assassination traced back to the United States .
How did they do it ?
o-----o-----o
" These people can't even make an omelette !
How can I teach them how to make a coulis ? ! " - Chef Jacques Brille to Major General Jeff Tynes , 1975 ( recorded conversation )
After the Vietnam War , several handpicked soldiers were taken from their units and put in a special training facility .
They were to become America 's executioners .
They were put through a rigorous training schedule , decided upon by professors from leading universities , most notably Yale Harvard and University of Wyoming , all experts in their fields .
Among the trainers were officers chefs and even several male prostitutes .
This was an operation never before attempted in the world of combat .
Several methods of execution were considered , but finally one was agreed upon , because it could be undertaken in any third world country , was efficient , deadly and untraceable .
Also , it required very few weapons , namely a butt plug and a litre of raspberry coulis .
Therefore , as part of their training , the agents learned how to make raspberry coulis and how to insert a butt plug .
o-----o-----o
" The brightest minds in the world today . " - General Harold Tinmeyer , address to U.S. Congress , 1976
While researching the project , Prof. John Adams , a geography professor from Princeton , noticed that all third world countries had either rainforest or desert as a large part of their land area .
This on one hand posed a problem - the climates were very different .
On the other hand , it was encouraging , as if a common denominator could be found between the desert and the rainforest , the solution might be nearer .
The common denominator turned out to be a single enzyme .
Gibbons and mongooses are the only mammals with the enzyme β glutamide .
Gibbons live in rainforests ; mongooses live in deserts .
β glutamide is an enzyme that is used for the generation of parts of the cornea , but interestingly enough , also has a catalytic effect in the transformation of typtophyl chloride to serotonin .
Normally , in animals , only tryptophan is converted to serotonin , but mongooses and gibbons can also manufacture serotonin from tryptophyl chloride .
Another interesting fact is that while only 1 % of tryptophan is converted , virtually all tryptophyl chloride will be converted to serotonin .
Tryptophyl chloride is found naturally in very few plants .
Its highest concentration is in raspberry .
For those of you unfamiliar with serotonin - it is a neurotransmitter .
Too much serotonin in the bloodstream leads to mania .
Although the course of action was becoming clear - one major obstacle remained - how to get the mammals ' bodies to produce large amounts of β glutamide ?
After about 6 months of research , it was found that stimulation of the prostate gland will cause the body to produce copious amounts of the enzyme .
Luckily , mongooses and gibbons have similarly sized anuses .
And their anuses are very large for their bodies .
In fact , their anuses are approximately the same size as a human anus .
So their prostate can easily be stimulated with a butt plug .
o-----o-----o
" Do not become too friendly with the gibbon . " - Speaker identity unknown , U.S. Secret Agent Training Video
Following is the outline for assassination in the manual the soldiers were given .
This is an actual transcript of part of the manual .
How it was procured is not important .
What is important , however , is the bone - chilling detail in which every step in the murder of a world leader is described .
Note :
The following are instructions for a single assassin .
Instructions for multiple assassins ( as was the case in Myanmar ) are not given here as they are very similar and this is for illustrative purposes only .
Arrive in third world country as a businessman , wanting to trade in the country 's primary export .
Credentials will be provided by the U.S. government .
Seek an audience with the president .
Because the primary export accounts for over 50 % of the country 's income in over 70 % of third world countries , this should suffice to ensure a meeting will take place .
Make 1 litre of raspberry coulis , as taught by Chef Brille .
Set out to catch a male gibbon / mongoose .
With both gibbons and mongooses , the male is easily discernable from the female : the male has a penis .
Use 100 ml of the coulis to catch the gibbon / mongoose .
The 900 ml will be used later .
Capturing the animal will be as follows : pour 100 ml of the coulis on the ground , and when the animal comes to drink it , capture it .
Before meeting the president , take a long shower , making sure you are well washed .
This will remove most of your body odor , ensuring the president will have a stronger odor than you .
20 minutes before meeting the president , feed the rest of the coulis to the gibbon / mongoose .
Assure the security personnel the gibbon / mongoose is your pet , and enter the waiting room .
When you are called to enter the meeting , firmly insert the butt plug up the animal 's butt , and twist it gently at least 5 times ( like you practiced in training ) .
Enter the meeting , holding the animal by the nape with one hand , with the other hand securing the butt plug .
Insist that the meeting is to be in private .
The credentials supplied should be enough to assure this .
When the animal is reaching a high point of mania , release it into the president 's face .
Gibbons have incisors that are over an inch long .
Likewise mongooses .
They are also surprisingly powerful .
With such a high concentration of serotonin in the blood , they will kill the president with a 98.7 % certainty .
They will not attack you , as the president 's body odor should be much more powerful than yours .
( addendum )
Further studies have shown that while the butt plug is firmly inserted , the animal 's inability to defecate inhibits the natural signals from the brain to the stomach to signify satiety ( fullness ) , and thus to stop eating .
Therefore , the gibbon or mongoose will in fact begin to eat the president and not stop .
This will give the mongoose a bloated appearance , but is in fact possible , as 80 % of the body is water , which will be lost through involuntary urination .
In 5 minutes , the president will have disappeared and all that will be left is a pool of water .
Pick the animal up by the nape again , exit the room and tell the secretary it is late and you are tired of waiting for the president to come .
Say you will call to reschedule .
Certain the president was in the room before but seeing evidence to the contrary , the secretary will be confused .
You must use this opportunity to exit quickly .

Thanks to an unnamed source for bringing these atrocities to my attention .
This document has been published at great personal risk to the author .
It has been published in order to bring to public awareness the horrendous acts of inhumanity undertaken by the United States government , in hope that these acts will never be repeated .
This was pretty popular in Russian blogs lately , so we post it here .
So what you see is what to be said an entry level test leaked from Russian army .
Here is the translation : “ Six questions that help to identify any hidden psychological diseases young soldier might .
If the soldier ca n’t see the number in one of the 6 circles on the test picture , the he likely might having :
Ca n’t see circle 1 : High agression , proneness to conflict , the recommendation is to add more physical excercise and cold showers .
Ca n’t see circle 2 : Possible low than average intellectual abilities , ca n’t serve with sophisticated equipment .
Ca n’t see circle 3 : Possible debauchery , soldier should get increased daily ration , should get more physical activity tasks , should not be connected to food supplies , etc .
Ca n’t see circle 4 : Possible inclination to violence , can be assigend as a leader to his unit , as he can preserve discipline .
Ca n’t see circle 5 : Possible latent homosexuality .
Can be light uncontrolled accesses of attraction to the same sex .
Ca n’t see circle 6 : Possible schizophreanic tendency .
Required additional inspection .
Every soldier should be tested before assignment , according to the order # 2299 . ”

Deconversions and conversations about abandoning faith
Individual stories
After revealing to my wife I am atheist / agnostic she told my old pastor .
He asked why .
This is my response
I did believe in Jesus and took my Christianity very seriously .
I do n't think the ferverence that I had for God could be faked .
However , hindsight being what it is , I look back on my Christian faith as something that feels almost faked .
As if I were trying so hard to achieve something that was never there .
I threw myself into community , into the word , into prayer .
All these things feel as if they were done in vain .
I never truly felt the presence of God .
I tried , I tried ever so hard but it never seemed to come .
That personal relationship with God ?
Not there .
The things that kept me pursuing God were quite a few :
My wife believed and required my belief to be with her I had great friends that all believed , and believed in an accessible way to me .
( Not condemning homosexuality , understanding sin as I felt Jesus portrayed it with forgiveness , a healing heart and listening ears ) I used the times of confrontation with my belief to learn more about what I felt God was leading me to .
These things , though , could n't overcome what had been there before I truly searched for God .
That is , my doubt and logical problems with an Omnipotent , Omnipresent , Omniscient God and Jesus .
Things started to fall apart with my faith in a very real way when we lost that Christian community that held my beliefs up .
The fallout with our friends and our inability to find a church where we really belonged allowed the doubts in my mind speak more clearly .
As I said , the great friends in God were what helped blind me to my doubts .
Some things that led to my questioning :
A . In a men's group one day , one of the men said " I sometimes have a hard time believing God is behind something .
Like , I know I am supposed to thank God for everything , but how do I know it was direct intercession by God that made that thing happen ? "
To which I had a prompt reply , " If you attribute the great things in your life to God , he will continue to bless your life .
We can easily dismiss things as coincidences or happenstance , but if we take them as from God , you can see more clearly that it is God providing it in the first place . "
This is something that seemed right at the time , but nagged at me for the weeks following .
It is something I encountered a lot in my Christianity , and that is providence by attribution and circular reasoning thereof .
It 's the whole " The Bible is truth because God wrote it .
How do we know God wrote the Bible ?
The Bible says so . "
While the Bible provides a wealth of spiritual guidance and much of it can be uplifting to the human existence , the circular reasoning of it 's divine origins posits a problem .
The same thing happened in my mind about the " How do we know God did this directly ? " question .
B. I began listening to worship music all the time .
If I would listen to anything else , I would feel dirty .
I would wake up with worship songs on my mind and on my lips .
I felt that this was a sign from God that I was on the right track .
Though , I started to question it as I listened to solely worship music .
I began to consider the human condition and how I felt .
Is this a physiological reaction ?
I apply a meaning to the music , therefore the music means something .
The highs that it would cause are very much like the highs that many people in tribes gain from their music and / or rituals .
Once I stepped back from it , I began to see it as a sort of brainwashing tactic .
Not purposeful of course , but it showed me that it meant more to me as I made it mean more to me and it became more important to me .
C. I started to have issues with the God -Men arguments being presented .
I would often scoff at Mithra and Krishna and Horus arguments .
Most atheists seemed to push them as direct corollaries when they definitely are n't .
But they are close enough .
Much of my faith in Jesus blossomed from the uniqueness of his story .
It is n't that unique .
A God dying for his believers safety - Jesus is far from the first .
Jesus ' time in exhile before his ministry began is a large question as well , with what religious or spiritual training he may have received .
This of course , brings up some other important spiritual questions :
If Jesus was both God and Man , was his sacrifice truly a sacrifice ?
http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-11708-Philadelphia-Reason--Religion-Examiner~y2009m6d17-Was-the-crucifixion-of-Jesus-a-sacrifice
" Did Jesus know he was God ( as well as human ) ?
If he did know he was god , then did he have all of the knowledge of god ?
If he did , then he knew that he would die on the cross -- incarnated knowing so , in fact -- and did nothing to stop it .
He knew he could n't actually die , and that the crucifixion would be only symbolic , so how was it a sacrifice ?
This seems no different than me playing some online game and sacrificing my character in order to allow the rest of the team win the mission . "
If God is both Omnipotent and Omniscient then can he truly be all - loving as we believe ?
I 've read books after books on this .
In the end they all say " It is God 's and he does as he will and we can't fully understand since we do n't have God 's perspective . "
This feels like quite a cop out argument .
As Dawkins says in The God Delusion : " Incidentally , it has not escaped the notice of logicians that omniscience and omnipotence are mutually incompatible .
If God is omniscient , he must already know how he is going to intervene to change the course of history using his omnipotence .
But that means he can't change his mind about his intervention , which means he is notomnipotent . "
While not bullet proof , there is some contradiction here .
Even if we can accept these 2 other minor logical problems , there is the problem with those of faith differentiating on so many core issues , as well as the change of the Christian faith throughout time seems to follow social changes .
One thing that incited a great RAGE in my heart was the Westboro Baptist Church .
While claiming God 's divinity through Jesus Christ , they all the while slandered and threw hate at anyone who did not share their beliefs .
Strong evangelists and conservative baptists would call the Vineyard coalition " Christianity Lite " and even venture that those at the Vineyard would not go to heaven because of their beliefs .
Catholicism , Mormonism , Jehovah 's Witnesses all take the sacrifice of Jesus as part of their teachings , but it is quite apparent that many churches believe that many others just have it wrong .
In the Vineyard we believed that as long as you held strong to the faith of Jesus ' sacrifice , that is all that was required .
Any other beliefs were left to the grays .
This is a difficult proposition when we see the grand strokes of Black & White painted in Leviticus and Deuteronomy .
Things like the uncleanliness of a girl child to her mother being twice that of a boy child ( Leviticus 12: 1 - 5 ) or what about Deuteronomy 22:23 - 27 .
Even if we accept a new covenant , we must accept that God has a certain view of right and wrong , even if all the wrong things we do are covered with the blood of Jesus .
God must have a view on right and wrong ( Absolute truth right ? ) even if we are shielded from such things .
There are also some fundamental logical issues with " chosen " people .
Afterall , we are to believe God chose his followers before time began .
Then we are to have free will to chose or not chose God through Jesus .
How can it be free will if he has already chosen us ?
Ok , so God is omniscient , so he would pre-know we would chose him , so he chose us .
Wait , does that mean he even chose us ?
D. Many atheists I know have a saying , something along the lines of " I have no problem with Jesus , it 's his fan club that I do n't like " .
This is what finally broke me .
The thing that put me over the edge .
All my doubts were nothing in comparison with the murder of Dr Tiller .
How many Christians reacted to this was " Thank God he killed that man ! "
I can show you some great quotes from twitter or blogs , or even TV SHOWS that said that it was about time ( Thanks Fox news ) .
This is along the same lines of the Westboro Baptist Church from point C.3 .
How can those who proclaim the name of Jesus do so many horrible things .
I used to think I could have the same belief as these people , yet stand apart on my philosophies .
HOW can God allow so many greivious things from people that could possibly be saved through their faith in Jesus ?
I mean , a couple was baked to a crisp in Acts when they said they gave everything to the church but kept some .
How could God allow these things be done in his name ?
Really , there are so many reasons I have come to this decision .
I can't really get into every single detail at the moment , but these are a start .
This comes down to the concept of " Beyond a reasonable doubt . " - I have lots of reasonable doubt cast upon the diety of God and Jesus . [ 1 ]

This is a semi- humorous biographical film about the men who made the world of technology what it is today , their struggles during college , the founding of their companies , and the ingenious actions they took to build up the global corporate empires of Apple Computer Corporation and Microsoft Inc. Written by Flotis
Reporting from Johannesburg , South Africa — Controversies over the officiating at soccer ’s World Cup are causing as much noise as the plastic horns that are blown with uninterrupted vigor by fans at all the stadiums .
“ I think it ’s been one of the worst - refereed World Cups that we ’ve seen over the last four or five , ” said Marcelo Balboa , who played 127 games for the U.S. , including three World Cups , and now is a commentator for Futbol de Primera , the U.S. - based Spanish - language radio network .
On Sunday , teams from England and Mexico both were victims of bad calls that influenced the outcome of the games .
The U.S. also was hurt by poor officiating .
Yet the sport ’s rulers and rule - makers have been slow and stubborn when it comes to helping .
FIFA , the sport ’s international governing body , has resisted the introduction of such technological aids as goal - line cameras and instant replay , arguing that those devices would rob the sport of its human element and interrupt the game ’s continuity .
And it wo n’t be until the next World Cup — Brazil 2014 — when five pairs of officials ’ eyes will be employed instead of the current three .
It would “ not make sense to stop play every two minutes to review a decision as this would go against the natural dynamism of the game , ” Joseph “ Sepp ” Blatter , FIFA ’s 74 - year - old president , said in April , shortly after the idea of using technology was firmly voted down .
Proponents of change are n’t giving up .
On Monday , Guus Hiddink , who has coached two World Cup semifinalists and is one of the world ’s most respected soccer authorities , said that Blatter should resign immediately if he was n’t willing to implement video replay .
Hiddink ’s comments came one day after England ’s match against Germany in Bloemfontein , in which British midfielder Frank Lampard fired a shot that banged into the German crossbar and bounced down , clearly a foot or two over the line and into the goal .
A goal would have tied the score , but it was never officially counted — even though British bookmaker William Hill paid those who had bet on Lampard scoring at the World Cup — and Germany went on to win , 4 - 1 , knocking England out of the 32 - team tournament .
Blatter , watching the game at Free State Stadium , had no comment .
But plenty of others acknowledged the mistake .
After watching the game on television while attending an economic summit in Toronto , Germany ’s leader , Angela Merkel , reportedly told David Cameron , Britain ’s prime minister , that the goal should have counted .
“ The referee made mistakes ; this is football , ” said England ’s Italian coach , Fabio Capello , who angrily questioned why FIFA was so reluctant to embrace technology as other sports such as tennis , cricket and rugby have successfully done .
Said Lampard : “ I do n’t know whether goal - line technology will change things , but technology would have made it 2 - all today and given us big belief and confidence that we could beat the Germans . ”
Later on Sunday , Mexico played Argentina in Johannesburg .
Midway through the first half , Lionel Messi , FIFA ’s reigning world player of the year , clipped the ball to Argentine teammate Carlos Tevez , who headed it into the net .
The goal was allowed , even though Tevez was a yard or more offside — in other words , behind the final defender — as television replays and the huge in - stadium video screen at Soccer City Stadium again clearly showed .
“ We knew we had to worry about Messi for this game , but we did n’t count on also having to worry about the officials , ” Mexico forward Adolfo Bautista said .
“ We lost our concentration after that , and it hurt us . ”
Mexico lost , 3 - 1 , and , like England , was eliminated from the tournament .
Referees have been instructed not to talk about specific incidents and FIFA has been silent about the controversies .
The organization ’s lone statement during the World Cup : “ FIFA will not make any comments on decisions of referees on the field of play . ”
However , on Monday it did acknowledge a misstep during the Argentina - Mexico game .
Nothing about the officiating , though .
Instead , it banned re-showing questionable plays on in - stadium big screens , saying the decision to do so was a “ clear mistake ” because it incited fans and ignited arguments on the field .
Balboa , the former player turned commentator , said the speed of the game has caught referees flat - footed .
“ You ’re running on a field with 22 top athletes who can run like the wind , ” he said .
“ The game is just too fast now for one referee to see everything and call it in a split second . ”
In other major sports , advances in television — more cameras with additional angles and the advent of super slow - motion technology — resulted in calls for instant replay to ensure the accuracy of on - field decisions .
In the recent NBA Finals between the Lakers and Boston Celtics , for example , there was one late - game sequence in which officials ’ possession decisions were overturned three consecutive times down the floor .
And in the NFL , a “ coach ’s challenge ” — the decision by a team to challenge the accuracy of an official ’s ruling — has become part of the sport ’s vernacular .
Even in baseball , the slowest - moving of America ’s pastimes , video replay is now used to determine a home run — whether the ball was fair or foul or left the playing field .
( However , it ’s still not used on other close plays , such as the recent missed call at first base that thwarted Detroit pitcher Armando Galarraga ’s bid for a perfect game . )
In soccer , it was at Mexico City ’s Azteca Stadium in 1986 that a missed call allowed Argentina ’s Diego Maradona to successfully pull off the most brazen bit of cheating the World Cup has ever seen .
Leaping into the air and punching the ball past England goalkeeper Peter Shilton , Maradona completely fooled Tunisian referee Ali Bennaceur and his two assistants , who failed to spot the infringement .
Maradona ’s goal put Argentina on its way to a quarterfinal victory and an eventual world championship .
“ The hand of God , ” Maradona dubbed it at the time , and the phrase has been a part of international soccer ’s vocabulary ever since .
Sunil Gulati , the president of U.S. Soccer , said Monday he was confident FIFA would consider making adjustments , including some “ limited form of goal - line technology . ”
“ It ’s the toughest sport in the world to officiate , ” he said , “ the size of the field , one person , the speed and physicality of the players has increased dramatically , it ’s a low - scoring game , so one goal usually makes a difference , and then there are so many decisions . ”
But , he added , “ Can you possibly stop all of them for a replay ?
I do n’t see how . ”

Supported by many BitTorrent sites and other major players in the P2P - scene , the exclusive BitTorrent release of the first episode of Pioneer One has become a huge success .
With more than a million downloads in two weeks , and over $ 20,000 in donations to work on future episodes , the project 's success has exceeded the expectations of its makers .
Two weeks ago the first episode of Pioneer One was released to the public via the VODO distribution platform .
With support from all the big players in the P2P - scene , this BitTorrent only TV - series quickly gained a huge audience .
At the time of writing , Pioneer One is still the best seeded TV - show on BitTorrent with more than 20,000 people sharing the file simultaneously .
Even more impressively , the number of downloads exceed those of traditional TV - shows such as True Blood , Family Guy and Doctor Who that were released in the same time period .
Thus far , the regular quality release of the episode has been downloaded well over a million times , with another 300,000 downloads for the high definition release .
To find out how the makers view events of the past weeks TorrentFreak decided to catch up with Josh Bernhard , who started the project together with Bracey Smith and is currently working on future episodes .
“ The response to the pilot was unbelievable , ” Bernhard told TorrentFreak .
“ It took a week for it to really sink in that so many people had seen it and liked it .
It was also particularly gratifying to see so many people responding to the story the way we intended .
I ’ve never been able to get that kind of feedback from an audience on this scale .
It ’s kind of validating , and gives me even more confidence moving forward . ”
“ It was also really amazing to see people starting to pick apart the science and the details .
People were actually debating the authenticity of the spacesuit !
How cool is that ?
That tells me that they ’re taking us seriously enough to pick apart .
People are really thinking about it , which is fantastic .
And aside from a couple of gaffes that slipped by us during our breakneck production schedule , it held up to scrutiny . ”
Aside from the many positive responses , we asked Bernhard about the donations that came in after the release .
The funds to shoot the first episode were crowdfunded though a Kickstarter project , but to finish the full series the crew has been looking for donations from new people who want to support the project .
“ The donations were even better than we expected , ” Bernhard said .
“ I did n’t know if we ’d be able to raise $ 20,000 , but we did it in 10 days .
That money is going to carry us through pre-production on the first production block of 3 episodes which we plan to start shooting in September .
I ’ve taken up residence in a cave to concentrate on writing the scripts , and we ’re starting to cast new characters , figure out what our workflow is going to be , what kind of cameras we ’re going to shoot with , etc . ”
“ We ’re still looking for more solid backing toward our ultimate financing goal , but the donation money was absolutely crucial for us to move forward .
We have some promising prospects , and we ’ll know more on that within a couple of weeks . ”
That brings us to the question of when the next episode will come out .
Although the makers have no fixed date yet , they do intend to carry on the project and release the remaining episodes of the first season in a fixed schedule similar to regular TV - shows .
“ Producing a series is a different beast than producing a one - off feature , or a single pilot episode , ” Bernhard said .
“ We ’re shooting them together so we do n’t keep people waiting an uncertain amount of time between episodes .
We want to have a release schedule and stick to it , so we can build an audience like a ‘ real ’ TV series .
I already saw a comment on YouTube wondering why 1×02 was n’t out yet , since it had been more than a week since the first already ! ”
“ Everyone is working really hard to make sure this thing comes together in the best way possible .
It ’s the most exciting thing I ’ve ever been a part of , ” he concluded .
For those who have n’t seen the first episode yet , it ’s available for download on every major BitTorrent site , or you can grab a copy on the official release page .
If you like what you see please consider donating to the project .
Although this type of production may not be the future of TV , it is a triumph for BitTorrent and a paradigm shift that might inspire traditional TV - production houses to think outside of ‘ the box ’ .
I ’ve been having this same conversation with a variety of programmers in recent days , and so I ought to share it with the world .
I think it would be nice if you could build Android apps in other languages .
The leading candidates seem to be Ruby and Python .
People are working on it .
This is my take on the state of play .
[ Sidebar : ]
As it says in the sidebar , I do n’t speak for Google , which is especially true here .
The Android leadership at this point is focused on improving the platform , the devices , and the current programming tools ; nobody has a mandate to work on other languages .
Of course , I would n’t be paying such close attention if I did n’t think this work would give Android a major shot in the arm , but do n’t expect any Google VIPs to agree .
Why · I like the Android platform a whole lot , with its Activities and Services and Intents and Listeners and ContentSources and so on ; it seems to have pretty well everything you need to write interesting apps , and there ’s very little about it that gets in the way or requires unnecessary work .
I also like it that it assumes the presence of the Apache Harmony libraries , which are comprehensive , robust , and well - debugged .
On the other hand , I do not particularly like the Java programming language .
Hmm ... that ’s an overstatement .
In those situations where I want a C - flavored statically - typed language with a really good compiler , Java is the way to go .
On the other hand , I can get more work done faster in a dynamically - typed language like Python or Ruby .
Also , any given task usually requires fewer lines of code , which is an unambiguously good thing .
Also , programming with them is more fun ( if you think that does n’t or should n’t matter , you ’re wrong ) .
Also , they make it easier to do good unit testing without jumping through dependency - injection hoops .
This view is not shared universally .
Plenty of people , in including many at Google , feel that static typing is essential to developing serious industrial - strength software .
I am generally unpersuaded except perhaps in the case where there ’s a substantial team building a big sprawling system ; but then , most Android apps are n’t like that .
And finally , as a citizen primarily of the Web , I ca n’t help but notice that in recent years , its interesting bits ( Facebook , Wikipedia , Twitter , 37 Signals , Ravelry ) are largely not being built in Java .
I know first - hand that there is a substantial community of really first - rate programmers , people I admire , who for one reason or another just do n’t want to deal with Java ; and I ’d like some of them to become Android developers .
What · I ’m focusing on Python and Ruby , because they are the most mainstream of the dynamic languages .
Yes , I know about Perl and Clojure and Scala and Factor and Lua and any number of Lisps and JavaScripts .
Thus , here are the conditions that I think , if met , would define success in this project .
A version of Python or Ruby that is more or less feature complete on Android , and which runs at acceptable speed ; in particular has no perceptible startup latency , and makes it easy to build real Android applications .
That is to say , offers access to each and every function and data field in the Android API in a way that ’s simple and idiomatic .
How ·
One obvious idea , since both Python and Ruby now have implementations written in the Java language , and although Android is n’t a Java platform it can compile such programs , would be to run Jython or JRuby .
In fact , this has been done for JRuby ; you can go get Ruboto right now in Android Market ; with an IRB command - line and simple script editor , even .
JRuby also appears in Scripting Layer for Android ( SL4A ) , formerly the Android Scripting Environment , of which more later .
Ruboto meets criteria # 1 and # 3 , but not # 2 ; it takes several seconds to start up and initialize itself so it ’s not practically usable .
I know the JRuby community thinks they can make huge strides in startup time and if they ’re right , this would be a very attractive candidate .
Jython as a project has n’t been making very fast progress ; since Frank Wierzbicki left Sun , nobody ’s getting paid to work on it .
I suspect there may be some architectural issues in getting Jython to work on Android , based on the way it generates runnable code ; but nothing that could n’t be fixed given some dedicated resources .
Then we ’d find out whether it met criterion # 2 .
But maybe we ’re barking up the wrong tree ; both Python and Ruby are written in C and run well on Linux boxes , which is what Android devices are .
In fact CPython has already been ported to Android as part of SL4A ; I ca n’t imagine that Ruby would be that much harder .
Also , I ’m confident that they ’d start up quickly and run acceptably fast .
That would leave criterion # 3 ; hooking them up to the Android APIs so you could write real Android apps .
You can in fact call back and forth between C code and the Android application framework using the JNI bridge , but it involves a certain amount of ugliness , and that ’s not acceptable ; I want , in Ruby or Python , to write a one - liner to make a phone call or connect to a data source .
When I talk to Rubyists about this , they invariably get misty - eyed and start muttering about DSLs ; well , maybe .
So I suspect that designing and engineering the connector code would be quite a bit more work than porting the actual language .
SL4A accomplishes this via a “ facade ” mechanism that I have n’t really studied but involves messaging with a JSON payload , and does n’t so far cover the whole Android platform .
Having acknowledged the difficulty , I ca n’t think of an architectural reason why this C - language approach should n’t work .
The Android team takes game developers seriously , and their problems are similar : they want to hook up great big globs of C/ C++ to the Android platform to build the game packaging ; the parts that are n’t about squeezing the max frame - rate out of OpenGL .
Another approach is to change the language .
An example of this approach would be the project launched by Charles Nutter originally called “ Duby ” but now known as Mirah ; it ’s a very - much - like - Ruby language that ’s had the addition of just enough explicit static typing to make it compilable into conventional bytecodes , whether Java or Dalvik .
It ’s not just a theoretical project ; follow the pointers from Charles ’ tweet to run a silly program called Garrett on your Android , or to view its source code .
Unlike the other approaches I ’ve touched on so far , Mirah meets both criteria # 2 and # 3 .
The question is whether it passes test # 1 ; will it become “ really Ruby ” to the extent that it makes Rubyists happy ?
And is there an equivalent for Python ; are PyPy and RPython relevant here ?
SL4A · Whatever the right answer is , some of the work done in what we used to call the Android Scripting Environment will surely go into it .
They ’re not trying to solve the same problem I am ; they want to empower people to knock off little scripts right there on the phone ; which is interesting , but I want to write big substantial Android apps using the nice tools on my computer with effortless built - in access to all those nice Android APIs .
But they ’ve cracked some very nontrivial porting nuts and figured out one instructive way to expose Android ’s APIs to whatever programming language comes along .
My Bet · Someone will have something running well enough to be useful by early 2011 .
If you ’re working on something in this space , please make sure I ’m aware of it .
My Jesus Cheetoh
Hello .
My name is Dorothy Dursley of Rio Rancho , NM , and I have a story I have GOT to share !
I 've had a weight problem for a long time .
I 've tried everything - Weight Watchers , Atkins , Slimfast , you know the drill !
I just have n't been able to keep the pounds off !
Then , last February , I found myself full of remorse as I pulled down yet another bag of Cheetohs .
I said " Jesus , I know you want me to lose weight somehow .
Please , Lord , give me a sign to help me find the courage to do what I need to .
I 'm so weak - HELP ME , JESUS !! "
And that 's when the Miracle happened .
I opened the bag , full of guilt , and pulled out a Cheetoh , and THERE WAS LORD JESUS STARING ME IN THE FACE !!!
Here are some pictures of this Blessed Message .
Praise Jesus , I have not eaten one Cheetoh since then .
PRAISE HIM !
Love , Dorothy
Share This Message of Love With Your Friends !
Greetings parental Fold !
How many times have you seen this played out ?
You always let someone in … and that ’s the downfall .
That ’s where the end always begins .
Name some examples !

WASHINGTON – In the first 18 months of the Obama presidency , national health care reform was passed , SCHIP was expanded , the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was passed , and the Recovery and Reinvestment Act created or saved millions of jobs .
Additionally , millions of working families received tax relief and got tax credits towards the purchase of a new home or car , and the Credit Cardholders ’ Bill of Rights was passed .
Furthermore , we are on the verge of passing the most sweeping financial reform legislation since the New Deal .
That ’s what many speakers said to the 1,000 progressives , union members and community activists at Campaign For America ’s Future conference , “ America ’s Future Now ! ” , June 7 , in here in Washington , D.C .
Arlene Holt Baker , executive vice president of the AFL - CIO , pointed to the pro-people accomplishments of the Obama administration and progressive movement .
At the conference , the “ great debate ” centers on the role of progressives in the Obama era .
In one of the many conference workshops Holt - Baker pointed out , “ We need to have our finger on the pulse of the American people , of working people . ”
Political strategist Celinda Lake talked about the “ mood of the public . ”
She said , “ People want a sense of direction .
The recession has settled in on the state and local levels .
Things are getting worse .
Americans have their back against the wall . ”
According to Lake , “ The public believes that big banks and corporations have benefitted from current policies .
People are angry , and there is a very anti-corporate dimension to the anger . ”
However , she added , “ Voters still want change , progressive change .
They want someone to address their economic concerns . ”
“ This is a very fluid moment , ” Karen Nussbaum told participants .
“ We have to compete with the right - wing message machine , especially at people ’s front - doors . ”
Nussbaum should know .
Her organization , Working America , represents over 3 million people .
She said , “ We have 25,000 conversations a week with people , 100,000 conversations a month , and 1 million conversations a year .
We talk to people about solutions .
They are open to alternatives , and they want to be part of an ‘ us ’ that has a different point of view . ”
Working America currently has active canvass programs in eight states , including Arkansas , Colorado , Minnesota , Nevada , New Mexico , Ohio , Oregon and Pennsylvania .
Seventy percent of their members define themselves as moderate or conservative ; 33 percent own guns ; 33 percent are weekly churchgoers ; and 82 percent are active voters .
For Working America , educating and mobilizing middle - of - the road swing voters is central to long - term electoral success .
Nussbaum added , “ If you do n’t struggle for the hearts and minds of working people , you lose . ”
With the mid-term elections just months away , it is more important than ever to begin to communicate directly with voters , she said .

At least 10 Florida counties have identified possibly fraudulent voter registration forms turned in by a firm working for the state 's Republican Party , election officials said today .
Problems first emerged earlier this week in Palm Beach County with forms turned in by Strategic Allied Consulting , which the Republican National Committee paid $ 3.1 million to register voters in Florida and six other swing states .
Palm Beach prosecutors are examining 106 voter registration forms submitted by one Strategic Allied Consulting worker , some with apparently forged signatures .
Read what Strategic Allied says about the allegations and its " quality control . "
Thursday , the RNC severed its ties to the Virginia firm and filed a voter - fraud complaint .
Florida GOP spokesman Brian Burgess told the Associated Press today , " We are doing what we can to find out how broad the scope is . "
The Los Angeles Times reports that Florida election officials have identified suspicious voter registrations turned in by the state GOP in nine other counties -- Lee , Bay , Clay , Santa Rosa , Escambia , Okaloosa , Pasco , Miami - Dade and Duval .
Santa Rosa County elections officials found 100 problematic forms out of about 400 turned in by the state Republican Party .
Most did not include Social Security numbers .
Others had date of births that did not match the names .
Some listed fake house numbers .
" It was that flagrant , " elections supervisor Ann W. Bodenstein told the paper .
" In no way did they look genuine . "
" Anyone with any sense would have known there was something wrong , " she said .
" Most were changes in current registrations filed in the names of real voters , but signatures were spelled differently than the applicants ' names . "
Vicki Davis , president of the Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections , told the Times the the number of suspicious applications was unusual .
" There might be an occasional one , but I do n't think we 've ever had this number of counties that have had this number of cases all at the same time , " she said .
Strategic Allied Consulting was also paid to work in Nevada , Colorado , North Carolina and Virginia .
Republican officials in Ohio and Wisconsin had not yet paid the company money the RNC gave them for Strategic Allied 's services .
The company is run by an Arizona - based conservative , Nathan Sproul , a former head of the state GOP .
The Times writes that he " has been dogged by charges in the past that his employees destroyed Democratic registrations .
No charges were ever filed . "
In an interview Thursday , the Times writes , he told the paper that the Palm Beach problems were the result of one individual and that his firm had offered to help elections officials in other counties identify problems .
The Florida Democratic Party wants election officials to " revoke " the state GOP 's ability to register voters .
The deadline is Oct. 9 for the Nov. 6 election .
For electronics hobbyists , the open source chipset BeagleBoard that packs as much punch as a smartphone processor might seem like the key to paradise .
Yet it is the relatively underpowered 8 - bit microcontroller Arduino that has captured the attention of DIYers .
Arduino began as a project in Italy in 2005 and since then has turned into an open source hardware movement .
There are thousands of Arduino projects today such as electric meters , guitar amplifiers and Arduino - based gadgets that can tell you when your plants need water .
The Arduino community is at least 100,000 users strong .
But it is not alone .
Other open source projects like the BeagleBoard , which is shepherded by Texas Instruments , are trying to win Arduino fans over .
The Beagleboard is a low - power , single - board computer , whose latest version is based on the same 1 - GHz ARM Cortex A8 processor that drives the most sophisticated smartphones today .
That gives it far more processing power than the Arduino .
Yet the BeagleBoard has n't hit the same kind of chord with hardware hackers that the Arduino has .
" The BeagleBoard is not for a novice , " says Phil Torrone , senior editor at Make magazine and creative director at Adafruit , a company that sells DIY electronics and kits .
" With an Arduino , you can get an LED light blinking in minutes . "
Fundamentally , BeagleBoard and Arduino are two different systems :
The former is a single - board computer , while the Arduino is just an 8 - bit microcontroller .
The BeagleBoard - xM includes a 1 - GHz processor , on - board ethernet , five USB 2.0 ports and 512 MB of memory .
What they do have in common is that both represent possibilities : the potential to use your technical and creative skills to make a concept come alive .
Here are five reasons why the Arduino is more popular than the BeagleBoard :
Starter Projects — — — — —-
Editing and rewriting is often easier than writing from scratch .
It 's the same with electronics .
It 's easier to mod an idea than start with a blank slate .
That 's where the BeagleBoard falls short .
" It has virtually no example application that you can just copy and hack to learn from , " says Massimo Banzi , one of the co-founders of the Arduino project .
The Arduino has hundreds of projects and ideas that are cooked up and shared by its users .
For instance , check out this list of 40 Arduino projects that includes ideas such as a Wiimote - controlled Espresso machine , a biking jacket that flashes a turn signal and a wireless electricity monitor that tweets your power usage .
It 's a chicken - and - egg problem for the BeagleBoard .
Unless there are more example codes out there , it is difficult to draw in the audience .
And without the audience it is challenging to get enough sample projects into the community .
Cost and Durability — — — — — —-
At $ 30 a piece , an Arduino is an inexpensive investment for someone who wants to try it out .
" It 's the price of a few sandwiches , " says Torrone .
Compare that to the BeagleBoard - xM , which costs $ 180 .
One reason why the Arduino is so cheap is because it is easy to clone .
The microcontroller is completely open source so the " components are all commodity , " says Torrone .
With the BeagleBoard , hobbyists do n't have the same amount of freedom .
They have to work closely with Texas Instruments or its partners , says Torrone .
Arduino is also very resilient .
Drop it , smash it and it still stays alive .
Add to that its low - power requirement , and the product becomes a must - have for DIYers .
An Arduino can run on a 9V - battery for days .
" The BeagleBoard is fast and powerful but that also means lots of energy is needed , which makes it difficult for simple projects , " says Torrone .
A Thriving Community — — — — ——
–
Arduino 's popularity means it 's easy to get started .
Companies such as Adafruit , SparkFun and Liquidware not only sell chips , but they also host blogs that suggest ideas on how to use your Arduino while providing extensive project plans to guide you in completing your creations .
Will Chellman , a student who has played with Arduino for years , says he's now experimenting with the BeagleBoard .
But finding documentation and information to work off is not easy , he says .
The lack of well - documented projects done with the BeagleBoard can be intimidating to new users as well , says Banzi .
" There 's lots of of interesting stuff ( about the BeagleBoard ) but it is very technical , " he wrote in a comment recently on Gadget Lab in response to the launch of BeagleBoard - xM .
Banzi says BeagleBoard documentation is also scattered and fragmented .
" Parts of it have aged and you spend quite a bit of time jumping from wikis to mailing list to track which specific bit of documentation applies to your board , bootloader etc. , " he says .
Maturity Is the Key — — — — — —-
Arduino has had a head start on the BeagleBoard .
By October 2008 , about 50,000 Arduino boards had already been shipped .
That year , the first BeagleBoards started making their way into the hands of hardware enthusiasts .
" The BeagleBoard is just two years old .
Since it has n't been around long enough , there 's not enough people building apps based on it , " says Chellman .
That 's not to say that BeagleBoard is n't catching up .
Earlier this month , we showed five projects ranging from a videowall to the iPad of ham radios that use the BeagleBoard .
There 's also a build - your - own tablet kit that is based off the BeagleBoard .
If DIYers take a shine to it , expect to see more ideas like these .
Simple Is Attractive — — — — ——
–
With its single - board computer configuration , 1 - GHz processing power and the choice of accessories , the BeagleBoard is a creative engineer 's dream come true .
But the same reasons make it intimidating to those who want to geek out on a DIY project but do n't have the technical know - how .
Arduino users point out that it is simple to connect external sensors to the board , and the example codes out there make it easy to get started quickly .
Arduino is a simple system designed for creative people with little or " no prior knowledge of electronics , " says Banzi .
" It 's cheap and open source with lots of documentation written in a not too technical language .
Above all , it has a very welcoming attitude towards beginners and tries not to scare them too much . "

Tuesday , July 6 , 2010 – 4:30 p.m. Meet at : Tribune Tower , 435 N. Michigan ( at the River ) Organized by the Chicago Committee on the Gulf Crisis ; For information , contact : chicago.savethegulf.committee ( at ) gmail.com
Not only is BP destroying the Gulf , but it 's transporting dirty tar sands for refining on the shores of Lake Michigan as well .
What happened ?
How did BP shift from being the " cleaner " of the energy companies , to * this * ?
It 's time we start asking the hard questions and demanding real answers :
* Why were federal regulations ignored ?
And who in government allowed this ?
* People died on the Deepwater Horizon rig .
BP and the regulators knew regulations were ignored .
Why are n’t people in jail for this ?
* Will those people who lose their livelihood in the Gulf be fully compensated for a lifetime of loss ?
Join us to show your outrage at the lack of federal regulation and corporate responsibility that allowed this tragedy to happen !
Let ’s open a discussion about the local issues this disaster raises , from the pollution of coal - fired power plants in Pilsen and environmental racism , to the tar sands brought to the shores of Lake Michigan , to organizing around the Clean Power Ordinance .
We invite everyone to come and voice your concerns and share ideas for action .
We demand :
* Begin aggressive and full enforcement of government regulations on all energy companies
* Stop all offshore drilling until we know it is safe
* Hold fully accountable all those who damage our environment
* Stop piping or shipping of tar sands into , through or near the Great Lakes -- 20 % of the Planet ’s surface fresh water , and drinking supply of tens of millions of people !
* Immediate and full compensation for all parties affected by the Gulf leak -- we will not tolerate another Katrina response !
In public , White House officials continue to argue that Mr. Obama struck the right balance last December , and sent the right signals , when he called for a short - term troop increase followed by a drawdown .
“ America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan , ” he said then , quoting President Eisenhower about the importance of balancing America ’s foreign commitments with its domestic needs .
But when granted anonymity , some senior White House officials who a few months ago said that this would be “ the year of Kandahar ”  referring to plans to retake control of the city that was the spiritual center of the Taliban  now acknowledge that the chances of progress there are growing more remote .
From the start of Mr. Obama ’s review of the war ’s strategy last year , he and his advisers debated the debilitating effects of what one called “ the weariness factor . ”
Their calculation was that the withdrawal from Iraq , combined with the 18 - month limit on the troop increase established by Mr. Obama , would quiet critics in his own party .
That assessment proved optimistic .
Earlier this month , 153 Democrats , including the speaker of the House , Nancy Pelosi , voted in favor of an amendment that would have required a clear timetable for withdrawal .
Only 98 Democrats joined Republicans in defeating it .
But over the long term , what may be more damaging is the fact that members of the foreign policy establishment , even those who vigorously supported ousting the Taliban in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks , are gaining traction with arguments that the White House has simply failed to make the case that the rising cost is worth it .
“ After nearly nine years of war , ” Richard Haass , the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a senior official in Mr. Bush ’s State Department , wrote over the weekend in Newsweek , “ continued or increased U.S. involvement in Afghanistan is n’t likely to yield lasting improvements that would be commensurate in any way with the investment of American blood and treasure .
It is time to scale down our ambitions there and both reduce and redirect what we do . ”
Mr. Haass is not recommending full withdrawal .
Instead , he said in an interview , “ I ’m talking about reducing combat troops and operations and costs and casualties by more than half , ” leaving mostly Special Forces , air power and trainers for Afghan troops in the region .
In Kabul on Tuesday , President Karzai talked about having Afghan soldiers and the police taking responsibility for security by 2014 .
“ Why should we be confident of that , ” Mr. Haass asked , “ given the history of Afghanistan ? ”
With the NHLPA officially filing a grievance today against the NHL on behalf of Ilya Kovalchuk , the league and players ’ union will now battle out whether the 17 - year , $ 102 million dollar contract is legitimate .
If the NHLPA wins , the Devils get their player .
But if the arbitrator rules in favor of the NHL , the Devils could face harsh penalties .
After reading several reports about what exactly comes next , I wanted to outline the following steps .
Big credit to Tom Gulitti of the Bergen Record for the information .
With the NHLPA filing their grievance , both sides will look to find a “ systems ” arbitrator .
The neutral arbitrator will conduct a full hearing with witnesses , oral arguments and written briefs presented to the arbitrator .
Both sides , however , can choose not to have the formal hearing .
The arbitrator can call anyone involved in the process as a witness .
Kovalchuk , his agent Jay Grossman , Devils owner Jeff Vanderbeek and general manager Lou Lamoriello can all be called on for the case .
The Los Angeles Kings , who Grossman and Kovalchuk negotiated with , can also be called in .
The site of the hearing would be up to the NHLPA and NHL to decide .
After the hearing , the arbitrator will have 48 hours to issue a ruling .
If the Arbitrator Rules In Favor of the Contract …
If the arbitrator rules that the NHL was wrong to reject the offer , the NHL will have to immediately approve and register the contract .
It ’s that simple .
If the Arbitrator Rules In Favor of the NHL …
If the arbitrator upholds the NHL ’s rejection of the contract , then the deal would be dead and Kovalchuk would become an unrestricted free agent .
Kovalchuk could then re-negotiate a deal with the Devils or sign with another team .
But it ’s not that simple .
The arbitrator also decides whether or not the Devils attempted to circumvent the cap .
If the arbitrator believes the team attempted circumvention , commissioner Gary Bettman can then impose hefty fines against the club .
According to Article 26.13 of the collective bargaining agreement :
if the system arbitrator finds that a circumvention has been committed by the club , the commissioner has the power to impose of fine of up to $ 5 million in cases of circumvention of the salary cap .
It also says “ if such a fine is assessed against a club , that club ’s payroll room shall also be reduced by such amount for the following league year . ”
The Devils , who would have $ 3.5 million this season in cap space , would then have to shed salary to accommodate the fine .
Bettman can also take draft picks of any position and any year away from the team .
Kovalchuk could also face penalties .
Bettman can fine him between $ 250,000 and $ 1 million for circumvention , and the arbitrator can recommend suspension of Kovalchuk if it ’s found that he tried to circumvent the cap .
I do n’t think the NHL will take a hard - line stance , but the Devils , who are bystanders in the process , can potentially lose out on more than Kovalchuk if the arbitrator rules in favor of the NHL .

There ’s nothing quite like driving through Europe in the summer .
In the past week , I ’ve seen the beautiful Val d’Aosta , the Swiss Alps , the Cathedral in Chartres , and travelled through the Channel Tunnel as I road - tripped from Milan to Geneva , Zürich to Stuttgart , and on through Paris to London .
Why the burst of mileage ?
Well , I ’ve been testing Google Maps Navigation version 4.2 .
Yes , road - testing it around Europe was a grueling process , but somebody had to do it :)
Today we ’re launching Google Maps Navigation version 4.2 in Austria , Belgium , Canada , Denmark , France , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Portugal , Spain , and Switzerland for Android devices 1.6 and higher .
Google Maps Navigation is an Internet - connected GPS navigation or ‘ satnav ’ system that provides turn - by - turn voice guidance as a free feature of Google Maps .
On my test trip , I found a number of Navigation features useful :
While driving through the Loire Valley , I put my French language skills to the test by finding my destination with Search by voice ( now launched in French , German , Italian , and Spanish for Android 2.0 and higher ) ;
I previewed a typical British roundabout with Street View to see exactly where I ’d need to exit before getting there in person ;
I satisfied my craving for moules frites by searching for it along my route ;
I kept the gas stations layer on to ensure I ’d always know where the nearest petrol station was , just in case ;
And , of course , the turn - by - turn voice guidance kept me on - track to my destination -- despite my sometimes spotty connection in mountain tunnels -- thanks to the way Maps Navigation saves the route on your device when you start .
Google Maps Navigation ( beta ) with Google Maps Navigation ( beta ) with Search by voice is available in version 4.2 of Google Maps , on Android devices 1.6 and higher .
To download Google Maps version 4.2 , search for Google Maps in Android Market .

Try Google Maps Navigation in your local country and language today -- and have a great time touring around the Continent this summer if you get the chance !
If there 's one thing the world needs it 's a few more tablets , tablets with fancy multitouch screens , and that 's exactly what Synaptics is helping to spread .
The company has announced a suite of touchscreens called the ClearPad 7200 series in sizes up to 10.1 - inches , each offering the 10 - point multitouch capacitive juju we 've come to expect from the company .
All support Windows 7 as well as Android and other Linux - based OSes , meaning they could start showing up all over the place .
Speaking of , the screens appear to be available to OEMs nowish ahead of products using them coming to retail by the end of the year .
No word on cost , but if you were looking to buy a couple - hundred thousand of them Synaptics would surely be happy to make you a deal .
As the U.S. struggles with the prospect that thousands of file - sharers will receive threatening letters in the now - famous Hurt Locker lawsuit case , over the pond in the UK there is a continuing escalation of the ' turn piracy into profit ' bandwagon .
A new firm of lawyers has entered the market and while their business model appears identical , they are attempting to sugar - coat their actions .
While all the main tech news sites and blogs have extensively covered the ‘ Hurt Locker ’ lawsuits in the U.S. , over in the UK the ‘ turn piracy into profit ’ business model is making stateside efforts seem small by comparison , but with nowhere near the levels of publicity .
For 3 years threatening letters have been dropping through the doors of UK Internet users warning them that unless they pay up a huge fee , they could be ruined through the courts .
As we now know , those threats have continually come to nothing and the lawyers involved have been subjected to unprecedented levels of complaints and bad publicity .
But as they say in Britain , “ where there ’s muck , there ’s brass ” , and that ’s enough to attract more lawyers and more rightsholders to this most profitable of honeypots .
Last week , BeingThreatened , a consumer group dedicated to supporting those wrongfully accused in these cases , informed Torrent Freak of a new entrant to the market .
According to their website , Gallant Macmillan “ is a niche media and litigation law practice with an international focus , ” which claims to offer lawyers with skills in “ reputation management , commercial litigation and intellectual property . ”
The law firm lists many high - profile companies as its clients including The Jerusalem Post , Claims Direct , Ted Baker , Kookai and airport giants Servisair , but of current interest is its work with night club and dance label , Ministry of Sound .
“ Unlawful file - sharing is a serious problem for Ministry of Sound , reducing income for the musicians and composers it works with and diminishing the funds needed to invest in new talent , ” states the settlement letter sent out to unlucky recipients during the last week .
Accused of sharing the £ 8.75 Ministry of Sound – The Annual 2010 , recipients are given the option to settle out of court for £ 375 , an amount Gallant Macmillan says is intended to cover various costs including damages , evidence collection , dealing with ISPs , court attendances and sending the letter of claim .
“ This offer to settle remains open only 21 days from the date of this letter , ” warn the lawyers .
Failure to comply , of course , means that they “ reserve the right ” to commence proceedings .
It has been well documented that other lawyers previously involved in this type of work , such as ACS : Law , have been heavily reported both to the government and to organizations such as the Solicitors Regulatory Authority ( SRA ) .
Indeed , ACS : Law have proven record - breaking in this respect .
However , when looking at the website set up by Gallant Macmillan ( GM ) for the purposes of this work , it seems that they have done their homework on the problems and criticisms faced by other companies .
Perhaps in a preemptive move , rather than hiding the fact that they are regulated by the SRA , the company mention it prominently on every page of their site , often twice .
While ACS : Law act on behalf of “ middle man ” companies behind which rights - holders have the opportunity to shield their identities and reputations to some extent , GM say they will only act for brand owners “ who are prepared to sue in their own names ” and will not represent companies seeking settlements over porn movies .
GM also appear to be trying to show a more , for want of a better word , ‘ humane ’ approach to their dealings with settlement recipients .
“ We understand that threatening legal proceedings can be distressing .
Whilst committed to act in our client ’s best interests , we strive to communicate with the recipients of our letters in a respectful and courteous fashion , ” write the company .
Although thus far GM only detail a time and date for single infringement on the letters seen by TorrentFreak , the company claim that their focus is the pursuit of what they describe as “ multiple offenders ” .
A huge criticism of both ACS : Law and previously Davenport Lyons is that the companies make threats of taking people to court but never do .
It seems that GM wish to address this too .
“ If we are unable to reach an agreement with the recipient of our letters , and still consider that our client has a good claim , we shall sue , ” they state .
“ We recognise that it is not appropriate to make threats of proceedings and to not then follow through with those threats in appropriate cases . ”
Another little twist to the approach is that while other lawyers demand that letter recipients delete the material they are accused of sharing from their hard drives , Gallant Macmillan say that as part of the settlement those accused can keep the album they are accused of sharing , in this case a Ministry of Sound compilation .
At £ 375 , this must be the most expensive album ever .
Despite the very clear attempts at presenting a more acceptable side to the copyright settlement business , thus far the ‘ meat ’ of this operation seems to be no different to those that have gone before .
It will remain to be seen if Gallant Macmillan will weather the storm that caused lawyers Tilly Bailey and Irvine to jump ship .
All letter recipients are advised to read the Speculative Invoicing Handbook .
It was written with earlier cases in mind , but is just as relevant today .
Ladies and gentlemen , you are about to witness the end of Mel Gibson 's career :

[ Warning :
The recording contains lots of profanity , so turn down your speakers or put your headphones on .

The conversation begins with Gibson ordering his girlfriend to " fucking get rid of " the " foreign bodies " in her breasts .
Then he rambles about her wearing " tight pants so you can see your fucking pussy . "
He calls her a whore and tells her he does n't love her .
" Stay in the fucking house , " he yells .
" But I do n't want you anymore . "
And , to the steel - stomached few who got through the entire recording :
Is it just me , or does the infamous " fucking pig in heat " line sound more like " fucking bitch in heat " ?

At the end of June this year , nine sites connected to movie streaming were targeted by the U.S. Government .
The operator of one of those sites , NinjaVideo , has now issued a plea for funds to fight back against what is undoubtedly a formidable force .
" We are looking at six to seven digits and it 's going to be pure hell , " she explains .
" We have nothing .
Nothing at all .
They took ... everything . "
By now , you know the background .
Last month “ Operation In Our Sites ” targeted nine domains connected to the offering of first - run movies without consent from the copyright holders .
The authorities moved to seize several domains including TVShack.net , Movies - Links .
TV , FilesPump.com , Now -Movies.com , PlanetMoviez.com , ThePirateCity.org and ZML.com .
US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ’s Homeland Security Investigations ( HSI ) also seized assets from 15 bank , PayPal , investment and advertising accounts .
The operators of two other domains were also targeted – NinjaVideo.net and NinjaThis.net .
According to authorities the site had been subjected to a months - long operation .
This is something Torrent Freak can confirm .
Following a tipoff from a very reliable source , we informed NinjaVideo months ago that they were being watched and their hardware was being interfered with .
It ’s almost certain that they were powerless to do anything about it .
Now , the charismatic and somewhat larger - than - life leader of NinjaVideo , a young woman by the name of Phara , has returned to the spotlight .
Never one to understate an issue , Phara is known for her forceful leadership style and colorful , often dramatic writing on various site issues from the small , to the very large .
The seriousness of the situation she currently finds herself , however , is off the scale .
“ We need you .
Our lives , our very freedom depends on this .
We ca n’t do it alone , ” pleads Phara .
“ We have nothing .
Nothing at all .
They took … everything . ”
“ Precedents are being made upon our heads .
Never before has a site like ours been targeted in this way .
We ask you … if you are vested in this case , this landmark case on the future of Internet Sharing and Internet Rights , that you speak to your friends , your family , your co-workers , your bosses , ” she continues .
The gravity of the situation is clear .
There can be little doubt that the U.S. Government will seek to make a very large example of NinjaVideo ’s operators – a likelihood which does n’t escape Phara .
To this end she is calling for heavyweight help .
“ Perhaps you are affiliated with the ACLU , Google , Youtube , MegaUpload , Rapidshare , The Pirate Parties around the world .
Perhaps you are financially comfortable and you feel passionately about the issue at hand .
We need … NEED … legal sponsorship in addition to legal donation , ” she pleads .
“ Perhaps the future of your own site is at risk and it is this case that will put it in the crosshairs of the next raid .
Perhaps it will be you who will see your home , dear lord , your home , ripped apart by THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY . ”
NinjaVideo was a free resource and never took money from its users but due to the unbelievably difficult situation its operators now find themselves in , pleas are now being issued for people to donate to the site ’s fighting fund .
“ We are up against the Federal Government of the United States .
They are petrifying .
PETRIFYING , ” concludes Phrara .
“ And they are backed by Hollywood .
And they have chosen us to be an example .
I think you understand how much money is on the other side . ”
Lots .
Lots and lots of money .
There can be little doubt about that .
Phara fears the worst .
“ They want to cage us .
They most likely will , ” she warns ominously .
“ Please do n’t let them .
All it takes is $ 1 from each of you . ”
In return for large donations – four digits or more – Ninja are offering benefactors a prominent position “ behind the scenes ” , presumably connected with defense .
What these positions entail exactly remains to be seen .
“ Your prayers , your posts , your words , your art … your support in general is priceless .
Unfortunately , in the world we live in , it will be your money that gives us a fighting chance .
The former gives us the strength to close our eyes and take it one breath at a time , the latter gives us the opportunity to take that breath outside of a prison cell , ” Phara concludes .
“ We love you , NinjaVideo .
We always will . ”

Lest CHS be accused of civic sensationalism , we try to follow up on some of the fantastic ( and less so ! ) ideas that people float across Capitol Hill .
With another for the civic fantasy file coming in this weekend — a year - round Capitol Hill Block Party in Pike / Pine ? — we thought it might be good to check in with another recent urban planner fever dream : the city ’s plan to invite street food entrepreneurs to set up shop on Broadway and create a Capitol Hill street food court .
“ We have to go through huge hoops with the city , health department and other agencies to get our licenses , and pay a lot of money to serve food in the city of Seattle , ” said Karsten Betd , co-owner of Julia ’s on Broadway .
“ Some of us have lost 10 to 20 percent of our business already , because of the economy and [ light rail ] construction .
We ’re still here , we ’re stuck in our leases for five , 10 or 15 years .
Put more competition in there , and what are we going to do ? ”
Another Broadway restaurant owner declined to be identified because , as the owner told us , their long - running restaurant needs all the business it can get and ca n’t afford any backlash sparked by opposition to the popular street food plan .
“ I honestly feel , in this business climate at this particular point in time , the last thing we need is more competition from operations that have n’t put in near the amount of time and money that [ Broadway restaurants ] have invested , ” said the restaurateur .
“ The time and money spent on equipment , lavatories , garbage pickup , water and many other things needed to run a business … the costs street vendors will pay pales in comparison to what brick and mortar businesses are paying . ”
Michael Wells , president of the Capitol Hill Chamber of Commerce , said that the community ’s overall opinion on the matter is so divided that the Chamber is not able or willing to take an official stance on the issue at this time .
The Broadway Business Improvement Association , also headed by Wells , has n’t chosen a side , either .
“ Neither one has taken a stance , and I do n’t know if either one will , ” said Wells .
Brick and mortar businesses , said Wells , are concerned that moving food vendors with lower price points and lowered standards from the Health Department will run them out of business .
“ Some of the folks working in the traditional realm feel nervous about a shifting dynamic in the way people think about the dining experience and pricing .
That ’s justified , ” said Wells .
“ It ’s a difficult time for all small businesses .
If it feels like an unfair playing field and there are certain inequities in the way a business is run , I can respect and understand those concerns . ”
While the Chamber does recognize the struggles that brick and mortar restaurants could face with an increased amount of competition , part of their mission is to evaluate what ’s best for the neighborhood , which could mean increased foot traffic and vitality , a proven outcome in other cities like Portland that offer food truck service .
“ It ’s very interesting , the way that [ street food vendors ] could activate spaces and create new food experiences , ” said Wells .
“ It ’s a valid economic model and very sexy right now .
People are excited about it . ”
One compromise being discussed that could lessen the blow of increased competition is a full - blown street fair , where people could sell things like watches , t- shirts and other goods , much like New York City .
This could bring more foot traffic to the area and give people from outside the city more of a reason to visit — and eat .
An issue that has n’t been fully addressed by DPD regarding street food vendors is bathroom accessibility .
The city famously tried — and failed — to offer sanitary public restrooms on Broadway once before , but now , outside of Cal Anderson , bathroom options are limited to paying customers in brick and mortar businesses .
If food vendors are serving food outside , where will their employees use the restrooms and wash their hands ?
Where will their customers go ?
Some restaurants fear that those customers will roam Broadway , going into other businesses just to use their bathrooms .
Business owners are also worried about increased trash in the streets and wonder who will pick it up .
“ I ’ve been to Portland and other places near fast food or quick service areas , and there ’s trash everywhere , it ’s rather unsightly , ” said the anonymous restaurant owner .
“ It does n’t smell good , there is water in the streets … it ’s unsanitary , a huge health risk and a nuisance . ”
One thing to keep in mind while debating the pros and cons of the issue , said Wells , is to “ level the playing field and play fair . ”
That statement can be used on both sides of the argument .
“ I think these are all real world concerns and needed to be respected as such , ” said Wells .
“ These restaurant owners put their heart , soul and family savings into creating a business on Broadway . ”
UPDATE :
We received this e-mail from the new owner of the Broadway Grill who read this post and wanted to add his voice to the conversation .
If you have have more to say and want to let us know about it , you can reach us at CHS@capitolhillseattle.com
As a brand new business owner of one of the largest restaurants on Broadway , I understand the concerns of my fellow Broadway restaurant owners .
I get that it is incredibly expensive to run an establishment on the hill .
When first taking over the grill , I was shocked by the amount of rent / taxes etc. that has to be paid monthly , but that is the price you pay for guaranteed foot traffic .
On the other hand , I sympathize with the community about wanting food cart vendors .
I too enjoy a greasy hot dog slathered with cream cheese upon leaving The Cuff after one too many vodka tonics .
Is n’t there a solution that would favor everyone ?
Perhaps we could have a tax for the food vendors to pay for extra garbage clean - up and help “ level the playing field ” so to speak .
I think that if we do accept the food vendor idea , they should be responsible for supplying compostable utensils and food containers that would help with the amount of waste created .
I also am interested in the street fair concept .
I think that both are wonderful ideas to help increase the popularity of Capitol Hill .
After living in New York for five years and spending a lot of time in Portland , the street activities were some of my favorite things in both cities .
The street fair concept would help limit the amount of food carts allowed possibly helping to ease the amount of competition for Capitol Hill restaurants , also helping to fill the “ dead zone ” between John and SCCC until the light rail construction is finished .
To me , this is not a problem … this is an opportunity for growth .
Re-evaluating how we run our businesses could be the best thing that ever happened to us .
Why is everyone so afraid of change ?
To close , I would like to caution others of the criticism towards Michael Wells and The Capitol Hill Chamber , they are working to find a solution that will benefit everyone .
If you have a comment or criticism , attend a meeting and let your voice be heard .

Andrew Exum ’s Times ’
Op - Ed pretty much encapsulates the new conventional wisdom on Wikileaks ’ Afghanistan document dump .
After laboring to show that there ’s nothing new or interesting in the revelations , he tells us how awful they were :
The Times , The Guardian and Der Spiegel did nothing wrong in looking over the WikiLeaks documents and excerpting them .
Despite the occasional protest from the right wing , most of the press in the United States and in allied nations takes care not to publish information that might result in soldiers ’ deaths .
But WikiLeaks itself is another matter .
Mr. Assange says he is a journalist , but he is not .
He is an activist , and to what end it is not clear .
This week — as when he released a video in April showing American helicopter gunships killing Iraqi civilians in 2007 — he has been throwing around the term “ war crimes , ” but offers no context for the events he is judging .
It seems that the death of any civilian in war , an unavoidable occurrence , is a “ crime . ”
If his desire is to promote peace , Mr. Assange and his brand of activism are not as helpful as he imagines .
By muddying the waters between journalism and activism , and by throwing his organization into the debate on Afghanistan with little apparent regard for the hard moral choices and dearth of good policy options facing decision - makers , he is being as reckless and destructive as the contemptible soldier or soldiers who leaked the documents in the first place .
US Weekly has nothing on us here at The Quad , where we can land celebrity interviews with the best of them .
In this week ’s edition of the Q&A , we sat down with college football ’s most popular couple , Ian and Chrissy Johnson .
As you likely recall , Ian capped Boise State ’s thrilling Fiesta Bowl victory last year by getting on bended knee and proposing to Chrissy .
Suddenly , an epic game had a transcendent pop culture hook that thrust Ian and Chrissy into the American mainstream .
In a whirlwind , they found themselves on “ Good Morning America ” and getting recognized by Paris Hilton and Peyton Manning .
They got hitched in July , but needed six police officers in attendance because of a barrage of racist threats from people who were against their mixed - race marriage .
The wedding went perfectly , though , and the two are happily living in Boise .
Ian is having a strong junior year for the underrated Broncos and Chrissy is working full time , as Ian jokingly refers to her as his Sugar Mama .
Here ’s a wide ranging interview that covers meth labs , corn snakes , Keith Urban , Dance Dance Revolution , blue license plates , plumbing , monkeys , Appalachian State , pedicures , kids , autograph seekers , drinking , mortgages , agents , “ biffing ” , racism , prairie dogs , football , metrosexuals , Chelsea soccer and , of course , lightning striking on the night that Ian and Chrissy met .
Tell me a bit about your animal obsession .
Ian : I got another cat as an end - of - two - a - days present from her .
We have two .
Their names are Biff and Bella .
Biff is from the movie “ Back to the Future . ”
Chrissy : Biff is part from the movie and part because when we got him he was the clumsiest cat ever .
Everywhere he went he would fall .
I : He biffs it all of the time .
It ’s a phrase that I learned when I got to Boise .
Biff it means fall .
Biff is the old one and Bella is the new one .
I ’m really into animals , so anything she ’ll let me get , I ’m taking .
When I first got to Boise State I had four snakes .
My freshman year I went through four .
I had a bull snake .
It mimics a rattlesnake .
It ’s got a little tail that shakes and hisses at you .
They ’re mean .
I had two corn snakes .
Those ones are so nice .
Then I had a python .
They were all nice guys .
Then I moved in with one of the football players , Bush Hamdan , and I had the snakes .
For a while , I moved in with these snakes .
Bush was like , ‘ I.J. , you can move in , but no snakes . ’
I was like , ‘ O.K. , ’ and I hid them in my closet for a long time .
Everyone thought this was a funny joke .
There were five guys living in the house and we were all playing around with these snakes , except when Bush was around .
I finally got someone to come buy them , and he showed up when I was n’t there .
He said , ‘ Hey , Bush , what ’s up , I ’m coming to get the snakes . ’
Bush was like , ‘ What snakes ?
What snakes ?
There ’s no snakes here . ’
He runs to my closet and sees these snakes .
He freaks out , calling me , ‘ You never told me there were snakes here . ’
Chrissy , where are you from ?
C : I ’m from New Jersey .
A little place called Pompton Plains , near Wayne .
Right by the Giants Stadium area .
In the past year we ’ve seen my family three times .
In the past eight years I ’d only seen them twice .
My dad ’s job brought me out here .
I grew up in New Jersey through fourth grade .
My parents lived there their entire 35 , 36 years .
We would go back each summer and a lot of my relatives still live there .
Every summer , we ’d spend two weeks at the shore .
I have a lot of Springsteen on my iPod .
My dad worked for Hewlett Packard .
We had a choice between Georgia and Boise and my dad chose Boise .
I : Wise choice .
I went to Georgia once and it was n’t a good experience .
( Everyone laughs , acknowledging the Broncos ’ 48 - 13 loss to open the season there two years ago . )
That was a very nice game for my very first college football game ever .
How did you guys meet ?
C : Hawaii .
I : I ’ll tell the story .
So we ’re in Hawaii and we had never really met before .
We ’d crossed paths .
But it was one of those things where you just see people .
The whole entire time at the game , my family was there so I never went out with my friends .
She hung out with some of my friends .
The last night after the game , we ’re released until we have to be on the plane .
I finally go out .
None of us were 21 , so we were walking around Honolulu .
We ’re just walking around and the first thing we do is see some girls across the way .
I did n’t know that we were meeting up with them .
But I saw her and was like , ‘ Wow . ’
I thought , ‘ It ’d be super to hang out with them . ’
The next thing I know , we ’re all getting introduced to each other and hanging out .
It was like , ‘ Wow , this is crazy . ’
Then we split off .
Some guys started walking off .
Me and Dave Shields , who was my roommate at the time , were walking behind them and singing some country , Keith Urban .
It was a break - up song .
Me and Dave were singing as loud as we could .
It ’s just some sad song .
She was just so surprised to see two black guys singing country music at the top of their lungs in Honolulu .
So , eventually we ended up just mingling together and talking .
She and I started talking .
We just jelled and we were goofing around the entire night .
C : We were walking down the street and we looked around and all of a sudden , all of our friends were gone .
I : I guess it ’s just us now .
C : Then we went to Game World and played Dance Dance Revolution .
Well , he did it and I just watched .
I : D.D.R. I used to have the pads at my house so I showed off my skills .
Then we ended up swimming on the beach at like 3 a.m .
C : We met back up with everyone and all went down to the beach .
It was awesome .
There was a strike of lightning off in the distance .
It was the best setting ever to meet the one that I was going to marry .
I : After that night we kind went our separate ways .
I wanted to , but I never asked for her number .
I kind of just figured , I just met a great person , but I ’m never going to see her again .
C : That ’s exactly what I thought .
My friends said , ‘ He ’s a football player , forget about it . ’
I : We ran into each other the next morning and just kind of caught each other staring the entire time .
C : It was so awkward .
Then he chucked a pillow behind him .
I was a couple of rows behind him on the plane .
He was getting a little restless .
I : I threw it at her on purpose .
When we got back to Boise , she tried to find me .
One of the things that I told her was that my cousin worked at Hollister .
It ’s a store at the mall , kind of like Abercrombie .
She actually goes looking for my cousin and can’t find him .
C : Its turns out he has n’t worked there for like a year .
I : The next thing that you know , Dave has birthday party .
He lives with us .
When you open the door to my bedroom , there ’s a bathroom door .
I literally open the door to my bedroom and she opens the bathroom door .
I said , ‘ Hey , whoa , where did you come from . ’
C : I ran up to him and gave him the biggest hug and said , ‘ I ’ve been trying to find you . ’
I : It was like two weeks after we met .
That night , we just hung out the whole entire night .
We just talked until 4 a.m .
C : We sat on the couch and made fun of the people drinking because we do n’t drink .
Neither of you drink ?
I : I ’m 20 , so it would be illegal , so that ’s a big part of it .
She was raised not to and a lot of her friends do n’t .
How seriously did you guys take the racial threats you received before your wedding this summer ?
I : We were probably in the dark about them for a good month or a month in a half .
They were n’t coming to us become I ’m unlisted .
C : My last name was Popadics , we ’re the only people in Idaho with that name .
I : Her parents were getting them only .
My parents are unlisted .
So people looked up her parents .
They found them and were sending them a lot of letter .
There was a number of things .
One person sent five letters .
C : My mom was so angry , she was burning them .
She ’d never experienced anything like that before .
I : It ’s extremely sad .
It was worse because I brought them into the situation because the way I did my proposal .
They were so distraught , they ended up getting caller ID .
They ’d get these calls that would say , ‘ Are you so - and - so , ’ and then they would just start yelling at them .
They ’d say , ‘ I ca n’t believe that you ’d support this and what kind of father are you . ’
They ’d get mail .
It was from all across the country .
Once people started figuring out what we were using for our venues .
We were going to use the art museum for our venue .
We were going to have a certain number of police officers at the art museum and a bomb dog come in and sniff it .
The threats that they received were so significant that they requested that we do that or else they were n’t going to allow us to have our wedding there .
So we had to spend a couple thousand dollars on security .
We had to pay the police officers overtime rates and the dog alone was going to cost $ 150 for 30 minutes of work .
You have to pay for the dog and the guy .
It was so ridiculous .
I had to sit down and actually do an escape plan for my wedding , if something was to go wrong .
C : You did n’t tell me that .
I : I did n’t want to scare you .
That was when it became real .
They asked , ‘ Which would you rather prefer , would you prefer us making a circle around you and getting you to the limo and following you out with police cars or would you prefer us running you to the clubhouse and then barricade two doors between you and having us stand at the only entrance and line up six police officers at the only entrance ? ’
C : I had no idea about any of this until right now .
I : We even opened up an F.B.I. case .
What we do now , anything we get we forward on to them unopened .
They even found one of the guys .
They charged him with harassment and gave him a couple thousand dollar fine .
C : The date of the wedding got out .
We had news people at our wedding at 6 a.m. setting up .
We got married in a big cathedral downtown and the country club was in Eagle , about 30 minutes away .
The country club was really private .
We invited family only to that .
The news found out about it by 10 p.m. and showed up .
We were in the middle of dancing and did n’t want them in .
It was a circus .
They were interviewing people outside the church .
There was a guy on a bike with no shirt on taking pictures on his cellphone camera .
I : We took enough precaution to where we were set up .
There were only two entrances to the country club .
When you came in , you could n’t help know that there was police presence there .
If someone was going to do something , they were going to get caught .
We had two police officers shadowing us at all times , unmarked .
How many police total ?
C : There were only two .
I : No . Actually there were two unmarked following us .
There were two in the cars at one entrance .
Two in the cars at another entrance .
I went over this with them .
There were six total .
C : There were only two .
I : No , there were six , we did n’t want to freak you out on your wedding day .
C : Good , I was stressed out enough .
What do you think about living up here ?
I : I grew up outside of Anaheim and would go to Disney Land , and I ’m right near the beach .
I ’m definitely from around a lot of different cultures .
So when I got here , the biggest thing was , wow , there ’s a very vanilla culture here .
You ca n’t go into the city and not be able to speak the same language .
It ’s not just Spanish .
There ’s Korean and Japanese .
Here , you just came in and everyone was just so nice .
Its something else you do n’t get in California .
People are so nice that it ’s obnoxious sometimes .
People were so nice and genuine .
One of the big things for my parents with me coming up to Idaho is that they did n’t know what it was going to be like .
I ’m mixed race , and you hear all of the stories about the Aryan Nation being from Idaho .
My mom actually came up with me on my recruiting trip .
She was like , ‘ They ’re going to show you the glitz and the glamor .
They ’re going to sell you .
I ’m want to be sold myself . ’
She went out and was mingling and walking around and at the park .
She was sitting down and some dude came up with his dogs and sat down next to her and started talking to her for an hour .
She said that it would n’t happen in California .
She said this was not just a good place for sports , but it ’s a good place to be a good person .
C : ( Appetizers had just landed on the table , including bruschetta . )
Sorry to interrupt , but you may want to note that he ate tomatoes .
I : I just tried tomatoes and I do n’t really eat tomatoes .
She wants to make sure that everyone knows when I eat something .
I ’m very finicky .
I like very plain stuff .
I eat a hamburger with ketchup .
That ’s it .
Back to Boise
I : We got here and it was n’t as small as I thought it was .
As I ’ve come to live here , it ’s really a growing town .
It has a lot of things that other cities have to offer .
There ’s just not a hundred of them .
It really is a great place to raise a family .
As I was getting more mature , I do n’t think I want my kids to grow up in California .
Around here , there are n’t as many negative influences .
You can kind of mold your children to the life you want them to lead without so many outside influences .
It ’s definitely a great place .
The people have been so great and the town is so supportive of the sports teams .
They have that whole blue - collar thing with everything they do .
If football works out for you professionally , you ’re still going to live here ?
I : Yeah , even if it was like what Derek Schouman is doing .
He has a condo in Buffalo where he ’s playing in the N.F.L. , and has his house here that he rents out .
I ’d keep my small house here .
Well , my parents bought the house , and we ’re renting it from them .
We pay the mortgage .
What ’s it like where you live ?
I : We do n’t live in the best neighborhood .
C : Yeah , there ’s a couple of meth labs on our street .
I : We went out to Taco Bell one night and came home and there ’s SWAT vans everywhere .
There ’s a SWAT van in our driveway .
Dudes are running around in the black masks with huge guns .
It was like , ‘ What ’s going on ?
All I wanted was to get a cheesy gordita crunch . ’
The next thing you know , the guy pulls up his mask and says , ‘ Hey Ian , I did n’t know that you lived here . ’
C : Seriously , this all happened .
Then he started asking if Ian could knit them a swat team beanie .
I : They wanted me to make Boise special SWAT beanies .
They want us to making S.U.O. beanies , special unit officers .
They ’re not technically a SWAT team .
C : We always have really weird , random things happen to us .
How did you start plumbing ?
I : DeBest , the plumbing company , is one of the few places that ’s lenient with their hours .
They always need someone to do the muscle work .
Anytime a journeyman could do the muscle work for them , they ’d do it .
During the summer , every football player needs a job .
I got here and missed out my first year on being a plumber .
I was like , ‘ I do n’t want to be a plumber , that job stinks . ’
And then the next thing you know , I ’m working park lot security and everyone else is loving their job .
You ’re digging , you ’re goofing off with other players , you ’re throwing water on players , you ’re throwing shovels of dirt , you ’re playing around with your hard hat on .
The next year , one of the older guys said , ‘ Let ’s get this job .
Let ’s get on it early . ’
As soon as football season was over , we got on this job and I stayed there for a year and a half and worked there during the season last year .
It was flexible enough with hours and I showed up there in the morning .
How many hours a week did you work during the season ?
You led the country in touchdowns and finished eighth in the Heisman balloting .
I : It was about 20 hours a week .
It was to the point where I could n’t be an apprentice because you needed to take the classes at night , I was actually learning the trade .
I ’d go out with any of the journeymen without an apprentice there .
I ’d take out the chop saw and start cutting pieces .
I had a tape measure that I was so proud of .
But it got to the point where the two jobs were getting to be too much .
I got a better offer at a different job , working for an investment group .
How did you go from plumbing to investing ?
It does n’t seem like a natural progression .
I : Someone I knew in the football program , I told him I needed a new job .
Someone he knew was coming up to Boise to fire part of his staff .
My guy told him he knew someone looking for some job experience and his major in entrepreneurial management .
He told him to bring me in and see what he can do .
It was about May , and I got on this job it was actually like a real job .
I had an office and everything .
It ’s called the Trada Group .
What they do is that they ’re an investment , development and management group .
They find investors for whatever their current project is .
They develop the land .
I was on the construction site and do warranty coordinating .
I ’d basically go in there and look at apartment complexes and go through and make sure everything covered under our warranty before they were up , the subcontractors would come in and fix .
Just making sure before they close these buildings , before they become our liability , that everything is up to our standards and our investor ’s standards .
Are you doing it now ?
I : I ’m on break from it now .
During football season , I ’m not going to be able to do it .
They ’re 100 percent O.K. with me coming back after the season .
That ’s actually one of my job opportunities if football goes awry .
I can join in and do this as a full - time job and making really good money .
C : I was looking for a full - time job in May .
They found out that my degree is going to be in marketing .
They needed an additional person here at one of the properties here in Boise in property management in their marketing department .
I ’m working there full - time .
In the spring I ’m going to take classes part - time .
I ’m in upper - division classes and they do n’t have what I need at the times that I need them .
I ’m not taking classes at all right now .
I : She ’s taking the semester off so she can be my sugar mama , because I ’m not cheap .
( Laughter from both . )
She wanted to be able to take care of the finances without having to worry .
Five hundred and fifty dollars a months is n’t enough to get a college student by .
That ’s your scholarship check ?
I : Now it ’s up a little bit more since we got married .
It went up $ 100 .
When rent was $ 325 and I would eat a few hundred dollars , it would get a little thin .
I love your license plate , ILVMY41 ( 41 is Johnson ’s jersey number ) .
C : Thank you .
I : My car is CIANRUN , which I got in high school .
That ’s actually a very big bull ’s - eye when I ’m driving around .
CJ : When we park it in the driveway , people know exactly where we live .
Kids come and knock on the door and say , ‘ Hi , um , is Ian here ? ”
What ’s your life been like the past eight months ?
I : We really got thrown on the scene last year starting with Oregon State .
Until last year , I was a redshirt freshman who played a little bit .
Once in a while , someone would recognize me and say , ‘ You should have played more ’ or something .
The hard - core football fan would recognize me if they saw the 41 on my jacket .
I could wear my Boise State stuff out and rarely be noticed .
Now it ’s to the point where I went out with a Captain Jack Sparrow wig , a hat and a hood on and a little kid came up and said , ‘ I.J. , why are you wearing a wig ? ’
Oh , man , if a 6 - year - old can pick me out with all that on , there ’s no getting around it .
Now , people recognize her .
When people go out , we expect we ’ll be out an extra two or three hours .
If we do n’t have enough energy to give people an honest Ian and Chrissy , we just do n’t go out .
We do n’t want to go out and be rude to anyone .
C : We were trying to celebrate our two - year anniversary the other day .
We both were exhausted and we were like , ‘ We ca n’t go out .
We might as well sit home and watch TV or rent a movie . ’
We love renting movies .
Its not that we ’re rude .
I : Every once in a while , you feel you deserve a moment to yourself and you want to be out and do it .
But we know that this town has given so much to us that when they do ask anything of you , you want to give them everything .
If you want an autograph while we ’re eating dinner , no problem .
The times that we ’re not willing to do it , we do n’t go out .
C : We do n’t want to give anyone the wrong impression .
But there was one time , when I think that I gave the dirtiest look in the world to this woman .
We had bowed our heads to pray before dinner , and we were sitting there in the middle of our prayer .
She was like , ‘ Oh , they ’re not doing anything , can you sign this for my son ? ’
I was like , ‘ Wow , she did not just do that . ’
He hates going to church because in the middle of prayers at church , people will pull on his shirt or pass a program over to be autographed .
There ’s a time and a place for everything .
I think people get so starstruck they forget where they ’re at or what they ’re doing .
What happened to you the other day ?
I : Oh , I was on the phone with my dad and talking about our insurance .
I was in the middle of an important call and someone walked up to me was like , ‘ Hey , hey , hey , talk to my friend on the phone . ’
I was like , ‘ What ? ’
There ’s a bunch of random stuff , and if you look at it the wrong way it can take away from the experience .
But we ’re real good at looking at things with a positive attitude .
One of the biggest things we love about Boise State is how much they love their team .
That love does n’t die when the fourth quarter ends .
That loves continues Monday through Friday while they ’re waiting for the game .
C : When we got back from the ESPN awards , I had a totally different perspective of when people come up to us .
I ’m a huge Hilary Duff fan .
I saw her and I was like , ‘ This is my only chance , I ’ve got to go up and say hi to her . ’
I was so shy , but I went up and got a picture with her .
She was so , so sweet .
And I got a totally different perspective of it because she deals with this stuff all the time .
Did any celebrities recognize you guys ?
C : I think Paris Hilton figured out who we were .
I : It was really cool .
That was one of the biggest things for us .
We realized we can always give a positive attitude no matter what we ’re going through because we met so many people .
There were a lot of people at the ESPY awards that were a little rude .
We ’re not going to name anyone , but they had a rep and that just confirmed it .
But there were so many people there who had no reason to give two seconds to us and were so nice .
C : Like The Rock .
I : There were so many people that were amazing .
Peyton Manning was amazing .
Danica Patrick sat there and talked to us for like 45 minutes .
Tony Dungy was amazing .
That whole Colts team was great .
C : I did not want to go home .
I was in heaven .
I : The big thing for me was the next week .
I ’m a huge soccer fan .
We went down to see Chelsea play against the L.A. Galaxy .
And we had a little bit of a relationship going on between me and their striker , Didier Drogba .
We had done a Sports Illustrated article together and he had us come down after the game .
We went out there and met him and he gave me a jersey with my own name on it .
He was truly genuine to us .
This guy has a relationship with me .
Their captain , John Terry , he ’s the captain of the English team , has no ties to me whatsoever .
He came up to me and all my buddies and start talking to us and invites us to the locker room after the game the next day .
It was like , O.K. , it ’s beyond you to come and talk to us .
Now you ’re inviting us down to the locker room .
After the game , the lady who was mediating the whole thing told us that we could only bring one person down , and that was me .
I so was going to bring stuff for all my friends to get signed .
I ’m down there and John Terry comes up to me and says , ‘ Hey , where are all of your friends ? ’
He ’s sitting there in just shorts , no socks , no shirt and runs out .
He said , ‘ Call them on the phone , we ’re going to get them all down here right now . ’
I ’m calling all my buddies , there ’s seven of us , two were in the bathroom and missed out .
He ’s picking five guys out of this huge crowd of thousands and he ’s just like , ‘ This is John Terry , captain of the English football team , you will let these guys down . ’
He got all my buddies down onto the field .
It was so amazing that someone not only from a different country , but that I have no ties to , would be so genuinely nice to someone that they do n’t know .
It was like , wow , the next time that anyone asks for anything I ’m going that extra mile .
I want to make sure that they felt the way that I feel right now .
Have there ever been twinges of regret that with everything being so public ?
I : No , never .
There are things and responsibilities that come with what you want .
If you ’re so lucky to have people be of fan of you or to have your jersey in the shop .
What small price is there ?
Am I willing to be interrupted in the middle of a meal ?
Yes .
I never regretted this being so public and televised .
C : I think it puts him and I in a good place being a role model .
We ’re of a young age .
We do n’t go out and party and do n’t do that sort of thing .
I think that we ’re a good role model for children and even adults , too .
It always helps a little bit when you want to do something bad .
It ’s like , ‘ Hey , people are watching . ’
I : It ’s like , I ’m going to spit on the sidewalk … uh , no .
It really did help mold us .
If I was just a regular college football player , who knows what I ’d be doing right now .
I ’d be hanging out with all my buddies , trying to sneak into bars .
Instead we ’re thrown into this at the perfect time .
Instead , I ’m exactly what I wanted to be growing up personality - wise with my morals and everything .
I also happen to have some glitz and glamour and have gotten to do things .
If someone said , ‘ You get to go to the ESPYs , but every other day you have to be bothered my someone . ’
I ’ll trade it .
But it ’s so much more than that .
When did you first realize things were different ?
I : We got off the plane in New York .
People were like , ‘ Boise State . ’
We ’d walk through airports and see our face on USA Today and we were like , ‘ What ’s going on ? ’
We went home for spring break and went to San Diego , which was two hours from where I live .
We were wearing regular street clothes and there ’s people coming out of their shops saying , ‘ Hey , Boise State . ’
I have a somewhat common face in a crowd .
There ’s nothing real distinct about me .
It was gloomy outside .
I do n’t wear Boise State attire because I try and not draw attention to myself .
It was so crazy .
It was three months after it happened and people were still picking us out .
It was like , ‘ Wow , this is really different .
Its not just Idaho . ’
We say that Bronco nation is growing .
It really has grown .
C : My family in New Jersey say that they wear their Boise State stuff all the time and have people coming up to them .
My little cousin ’s optimist football team are all Boise State fans now .
How are things different on the field now ?
I : That Cinderella period is over .
And I mean last year was a great year for us .
Even though we did everything in our power to make sure we did n’t ride on last year , I mean , you could n’t help but say , we worked hard and did all this stuff .
We could not help but think that someone would step up and do what happened last year .
Someone is going to step up and be that fire .
We may even have better talent .
It was like , ‘ Bam , ’ Washington happened .
Now we ’re back in it .
Now we ’ve got to realize that what was four years in the making last year , we ’ve got to be the hungry ones .
No one is going to give it to us .
We ’ve got to earn what we get .
No one is giving us anything .
We ’ve always liked being in that position .
We love going into hostile environments , with people saying we do n’t deserve to be there .
What did you think about Appalachian State ?
I : I just loved seeing guys put it together .
You can honestly just go in there and say , ‘ This is Michigan , we have every right to lose .
Let ’s go out and play a quarter and say that I tackled Mike Hart . ’
They put it together and got it in their heads and said , ‘ Let ’s see what we can do . ’
The talent level is n’t that different anymore between the top teams and what you would consider mid-majors and Division I - AA or whatever they call it now .
Now teams realize that there ’s just as good talent across the board .
It comes down to making it happen , eliminating mistakes and controlling the ball and not turning it over and making plays when they have a chance .
There ’s great players all over place .
That ’s one of the things that Boise State has always been about .
We ’re not going to get a guy who is a great player and 6 - foot - 7 .
We ’re going to get a guy who is 6 - foot - 2 who plays like he ’s 6 - foot - 7 .
And you get a few of those together and they realize their potential and all of a sudden , size is just size .
It really comes down to making guys believe .
Just being bigger is n’t enough anymore .
You have to be better at what you do .
You can beat a big guy with speed and angles .
You can beat a fast guy by making him over pursue .
When someone brought up the N.F.L. draft to you in the locker room at the Fiesta Bowl you laughed and said no one had talked to you about it .
Do you plan on being here the next two years .
I : The way I look at it is right now , no one has talked to me .
My goal is to stay here , get a degree and be able to provide for my family .
If there ’s a better deal that comes across .
If someone says , ‘ Hey , you are a first - day - of - the - draft - type guy and you can sign a contract without bouncing around . ’
My decision is n’t going to be that I ’m going to leave early and try and make a practice squad and bounce around .
Because now I ’m thinking for two .
The last thing I ’m going to do is leave for a dream .
Whatever I have to do , it has to be for sure .
Even if it ’s next year , if someone says I have to work out for six months to try and get one for an unsigned free agent , that ’s not for me .
I love football , but I made a commitment to take care of my family .
C : Hey , I ’m all for moving around .
I ’m totally laid back .
I ’ll do anything .
I : I want to start a family and I want to have kids .
When you ’re trying to make a practice squad , there ’s so much uncertainty in that .
If you sign a contract , O.K. , that ’s great .
You can sit down and use your money to get a little house .
Without a certain level of certainty , I could be here two more years and be done with football .
That ’s fine because my goal growing up in life was n’t that I wanted to be an N.F.L. player .
I never thought that I ’d make it to college and I never thought that I ’d make it to the pros .
I do n’t base my life on if I ’m going to do that , that ’s not my success / failure .
My success / failure is if I ’m a good husband , and whether or not I can provide for my family .
My goal growing up was to have a white picket fence , a monkey and a wife and kids .
Not necessarily in that order .
I have to make the best decision for what happens with my family .
If I can sign a million - dollar contract , a million dollars is a lot of money and that ’s not something that you can just pass up .
Now , if that does n’t happen , O.K. , let ’s play another year .
I ’m in no hurry to go anywhere .
I want to be settled and say , ‘ Chris , we can start having kids in two years . ’
Whatever I do , I want to be stable .
I admire the guys that will sit there and beat at it three years on a practice squad and finally make that team .
Those three years for me , on and off teams , moving from Washington to Tampa Bay .
I do n’t know if I could do it , on practice squads and camp - to - camp pay .
There ’s other things in the world I want more .
I ’m not going to sacrifice the security I have with her .
C : Whatever you do , you know I ’ll be there .
I : I just told what my dreams are .
C : As long as in the long run I get my kids , I ’ll be happy .
About agents .
I remember Alex Smith telling me that after he had a big game the first week of his junior year a guy who looked like a used car salesman knocked on his door of his house and wanted to be his agent .
You have n’t had any contact with agents ?
I : The guy in Boise who signs all the guys who try and go as free agents has talked to me .
But they are really like local sales guys .
Drew Rosenhaus has n’t called you yet ?
I : I do n’t even know who that is .
That ’s probably bad .
You seem at peace with your limitations , football - wise .
I : I definitely know what I ’m good at , and what I can and ca n’t do .
You can always get a little bit faster and a little bit stronger .
I ’m 5 - 10 and 198 pounds .
I can go up to 215 .
I run what I run .
I ’ve run 4.4s .
My freshman year I ran a 4.43 .
There ’s a number of guys when we line up and race , they ’ll beat me .
But I know that when we put on pads , I know what I can do on the field .
Numbers are n’t always it for me .
Have you had to learn to run differently this year ?
I : One of the things last year we were able to do .
I knew exactly what we had .
We had an amazing tight end who was basically a sixth offensive lineman .
He could line up against a 300 - pound defensive end and basically stalemate him .
Now that he ’s gone , and we ’re going to get the eight and nine - man box .
We need to learn how to play the edge .
Even though we run between the tackles so much , that edge block dictates where I ’m going .
Now that we kind of understand how it ’s going to be and how it ’s not going to be sometimes .
And I definitely had to change from a straight - up seven - man box and we ’re going to have these kinds of numbers , so I can wait for my blocks .
Now there ’s two extra guys in there , if you wait for them they ’re going to come get you .
There ’s only so many people to block .
We may be out the window with this whole being patient and waiting for blocks .
No one thinks we can throw .
When I get tackled , guys say , ‘ You are never going to run on us .
That is our one thing .
Go for the deep ball . ’
Guys will tell you that .
They ’ll be laying on top of me and say , ‘ I do n’t care what happens , you ’re not going to get another yard . ’
Southern Miss said that .
Washington , the first thing they said was , ‘ You ’re not going to get 50 yards rushing . ’
It ’s definitely a different world out there this year .
We do n’t have that supporting cast that everyone remembers from last year .
We rode into the year with these wide receivers who could burn you on routes and then discovered we had a running back .
Who knew ?
Now we ’ve got the running back and those wide receivers are gone .
We ’ve got some good guys and some good recruits .
But they have n’t seen anything , nothing that will make you sit and play four guys back .
They ’re still going to drop the safety down a bit and have our corners play inside - out and they ’re reading run .
How much have you seen city and program evolve in four years ?
I : The city itself , aside from football , it has grown so much .
When I was plumbing , we were always building new construction .
Just from that point , wow .
We went from just having a mall to now there ’s just so many other things here .
To see the school itself , two additional parking structures , the indoor facility , we ’ve got the stadium expansion going on right now .
We ’ve got two new dorms .
We ’ve got a new interactive learning center on campus .
We ’ve got an engineering program .
When we got here , we wanted to be a metropolitan university of distinction .
And its happening .
There ’s so much going on with the team , big - time businesses like HP and Ore-Ida .
There ’s so many things going on .
This team is growing at almost the same rate as the city is growing .
C : My mom teaches at Boise State and says there ’s so many students coming in from all over the place .
She asks what they ’re doing here and a lot of them say the football team attracted them to it .
Then they found out what a great school that Boise State is .
He would never say it , but the football team is seriously growing that school .
And the other athletics , too .
I : We should have blue license plates .
That would be great .
I ’ll talk to the governor , Butch Otter .
He ’d probably do it .
He ’s that kind of a guy .
C : Instead of “ Famous Potatoes ” it should say , “ Famous Blue Turf . ” ( Everyone laughs ) .
Have things gotten back to normal for you guys ?
I : I would n’t say that it ’s back to normal .
I would say that this is our new normal .
Its ’ definitely died down a little bit from everyone being all about the Fiesta Bowl .
It ’s still been very much the same since the Fiesta Bowl .
If we go out to anywhere ; this is an upscale restaurant , so people are n’t going to mess with us .
But if we still go out and people will pull up next to us .
You ’ll go somewhere and people will be following you around .
You ’ll sit at a McDonald ’s and people will be doing the prairie dog thing .
( Johnson hunches down in his seat and then pops up and opens his eyes wide .
He repeats the motion a few times , looking like , well , a prairie dog . )
People still think that we ’re deaf , dumb and blind .
They ’ll be sitting right next to me and say , ‘ Hey , you ’re Ian Johnson . ’
It ’s like , ‘ I can hear you . ’
C : Our new thing to say to each other is , ‘ Yes , we ’re deaf . ’
Coach Petersen told me today that he knew you were different from the day you walked on campus .
When I asked why , he said he could tell by what you were wearing .
Do you remember what you were wearing ?
I : I ’m from California and I ’m from a suburban area and I ’m a beach guy .
So I had the tight jeans , I actually had a pedicure .
I was wearing sandals , even though it was cold .
I had a blue muscle t- shirt with a blue apple cap on .
I was matching 100 percent .
I definitely had a style that no one had seen in Idaho .
I think we might see it in a couple of years when things finally catch up .
What ’s an apple cap ?
I : You ’ll see guys with a lot of hair wearing them .
Its like a beanie with a brim on it .
I had a lot of hair .
It was n’t an afro because I relaxed it .
I had these huge curls .
It was kind of bushy .
I could spike it .
It was that curly , but almost straight .
If you want to say it was bushy , it was .
It was a real California look .
I came in with a air of confidence with what I was wearing .
The typical guy that comes in here from California is a second - chance guy or a guy from inner-city L.A. or Sacramento area .
I ’m from the suburbs .
There was the word metrosexual thrown around a lot .
Then , I ’d get bored in meetings and I started to crochet .
Then guys were like , ‘ You ’re not metro , you might be a little iffy . ’
They definitely thought that I was weird .
I ate nine bananas a day in meetings to stay awake during two - a - days in the summer .
Those things added up to me being a different – quote , unquote – kind of person .
I did n’t listen to rap music .
Everyone else listens to rap music .
From my area , we listen to local - band - type guys .
I listen to hard - core punk music .
Stuff with screaming .
These guys were not having it .
Everything I did , these guys were just laying into me .
I ’m a big video game nerd .
I just had a lot going .
How do you remember that well what you were wearing ?
I : Its not that I ’ll remember .
A lot of times when we get a new coach or a new person , they ’ll be like , ‘ Ian , you ’re a little weird . ’
And someone will say , ‘ Well , you should have seen him the first day that he was here . ’
It ’s gotten so out - of - hand that I was n’t wearing a blue shirt anymore , I was wearing a fishnet shirt with my hair slicked back and my nails painted with French tips .
It ’s like , ‘ Wow , how far can this story go . ’
With your career at Boise State , you ’ve already written a good story .
But for you , there ’s still a lot of golf left to play .
What do you hope your ultimate legacy is here ?
I : My ultimate legacy here , I want to say that I ended whatever happened on a positive note .
Whatever I do in the end .
Whether it ’s to end or do whatever and do it and not just save face , but end with a positive attitude and continue on to something better .
Not just float around .
I do n’t want be that guy who is doing commercials for Larry Miller Honda or whatever .
I want to be a guy who played here and then made a decision to move on and live the rest of his life with his wife or do something great at the next level .
Then that legacy ends and my next legacy begins with me as a father and a husband .
When you picked Boise , who did it come down to ?
I : The sad part is , I had no other offers .
That ’s another part of my story , you could say .
In high school , I went to a big school that was a college prep school , but we did n’t send a lot of guys to the next level for football .
We were in that area where U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. would n’t go that far .
Not a lot of teams go into California looking .
I was All - C.I.F. , I put up decent numbers .
My senior year , I found out that during my junior year my coach had actually blackballed me .
When teams would come , he ’d tell coaches , ‘ Nah , he ’s a nutcase . ’
I had a 3.5 GPA and I ’ve never had any suspensions or been in any trouble .
He ended up blackballing me when coaches would come .
He ’s say , ‘ Nah , he ’s a nutcase , but look at this wide receiver . ’
That coach ended up being fired .
When they cleaned out his office , there was a box of letters requesting game tape and film or asking if I ’d come to this camp .
By the time I got to respond to them , it was my senior year and I called teams and they said they were told that I was n’t interested .
They already had the list of guys they were looking at .
I had letters from Ivy Leagues to a number of Pac - 10 schools , Washington and U.C.L.A .
Is this something that ’s been written ?
I : It ’s been written locally .
It ’s something that I do n’t harbor any anger about .
Whatever his anger was , it got me to where I am now .
The path I ’ve taken has molded me to where I am now and to a life that I ’m not complaining about .
So , for me to sit there and tell you about this guy who was a jerk to me back in high school , that would be rude .
My senior year , my coach came in and was commuting from Northern California .
He said he ’d give us all the resources we needed to get recruited , but could n’t do it personally because he was moving his family down from California .
So it was me sitting there with two VCRs recording my own stuff and it ended up being a very poor - at - best highlight film .
It was me and my mom personally calling teams , asking if they wanted to take a look at me .
I had given up and was going to go J.C. And Boise was recruiting a guy from Rancho Cucamonga , Patrick Chung .
They were recruiting him at safety .
They showed his film and said , ‘ Who is this running back that you ’re playing against . ’
He said , ‘ That ’s Ian Johnson from Damien . ’
They said , ‘ Is it worth me going down there and looking at him ? ’
He had all the power in the world to say , ‘ Nah . ’
But he was like , ‘ He ’s definitely worth your time .
He gave us tons of problems . ’
So they came and said they loved the film and asked for another one .
Within two weeks they ’d offered me an official visit and the day before I left on my visit they ’d offered me a full ride .
Within three days I figured out that not only could I come here , but I could be happy here even if I was n’t playing football .
And it was a sold deal .
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange talks to Larry King about the 90,000 documents his site recently made public reportedly detailing U.S. war efforts in Afghanistan .
Do n't miss ' Larry King Live ' at 9 p.m. ET Monday on CNN .
( CNN ) -- WikiLeaks is n't much to look at .
The website 's homepage is largely composed of a plain - text logo and a giant hyperlink that simply says : " Submit documents . "
But there 's plenty of technical muscle and strategy behind the whistle - blowing website that 's known for leaking state secrets , including , on Sunday , tens of thousands of alleged documents about the U.S. - led war in Afghanistan .
That 's not to say WikiLeaks is immune to attacks and technical challenges , however .
The site crashes on occasion , either because of high traffic , as was the case Sunday and Monday , or because of lack of funds , which reportedly was the case when the site briefly shut down in January .
On Monday , some visitors to the site were met with this error message : " Well there was an error .
Maybe we are just overloaded , please try again in a few minutes . "
How it works
WikiLeaks , which runs on funding from donors , has been rather secretive about how it operates .
But essentially the idea behind the site is this :
People who have access to controversial or classified documents can send them to the site , either through the internet or through the mail .
Then a group of volunteer editors for the site decides what information is authoritative , what information is important , and publishes it accordingly .
In this way , the site differs from traditional " wikis , " such as Wikipedia , which can be edited and changed by anyone at any time .
Only approved information ends up on the WikiLeaks site , but anyone is free to submit documents he or she believes should be made public .
WikiLeaks offers these whistle - blowers anonymity and , to a degree , legal protection .
Technical backbone
Since WikiLeaks is in the business of publishing information that governments and multinational corporations want kept secret , the site employs some technical tricks that aim to keep it from crashing or being hacked .
The site keeps servers on multiple continents , and its sensitive information passes through countries -- such as Sweden , Iceland and Belgium -- that have offered WikiLeaks a degree of legal protection .
" We use this state - of - the - art encryption to bounce stuff around the internet to hide trails -- pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections , " the site 's controversial editor , Julian Assange , said in an onstage interview at the TED Global conference on July 20 .
The fact that WikiLeaks ' servers and volunteers are all over the globe makes it , in effect , the " world 's first stateless news organization , " writes Jay Rosen , a journalism professor at New York University .
Rosen says this is key to the site 's ability to protect itself .
" WikiLeaks is organized so that if the crackdown comes in one country , the servers can be switched on in another , " he writes .
" This is meant to put it beyond the reach of any government or legal system . "
Assange reportedly has spent his life developing the tech skills needed to set up such a system .
" As a teenager in Melbourne , Australia , he belonged to a hacker collective called the International Subversives , " writes the magazine Mother Jones .
He eventually pleaded guilty to multiple counts " of breaking into Australian government and commercial websites to test their security gaps , but was released on bond for good behavior . "
Overloaded
Despite these efforts to distribute and encrypt , however , the site faces technical challenges .
It appears to be struggling in the face of newfound popularity , both because of the leaked Afghanistan documents and because of an alleged war video from Iraq that shows about a dozen civilians being killed in 2007 .
Early Monday , WikiLeaks posted on its Twitter feed that it was " tremendously overloaded . "
It offered the public an alternate website -- called the " Afghan War Diary " -- where people could read the alleged documents from Afghanistan even if the main website at WikiLeaks.org had gone down .
On Monday , the site 's homepage was crashing from time to time .
Assange has said in recent interviews that WikiLeaks ' sudden popularity has contributed to some technical troubles .
" At the moment , we are undergoing some serious fundraising and engineering efforts , so our publication rate over the past few months has been minimized by [ the fact that ] we 're re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we 've had , " he said in the onstage interview at the TED Global conference .
" That 's a problem .
Like any sort of growing startup org , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth .
That means we 're getting enormous quantities of whistle - blower disclosures of very high caliber , but do n't have enough people to actually process and vet this information . "
In a press conference following the release of the alleged Afghanistan documents , Assange said the site has 800 part - time volunteers and a loose network of 70,000 " supporters . "
In the TED talk , he also alluded to the fact that the more information the site gets , the more difficult it is to store and protect all of it .
Here 's how he explained the site 's process for receiving and publishing information :
" We get information in the mail -- the regular postal mail -- and , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization ; format it , which is sometimes something that 's quite hard to do when you 're talking about giant databases of information ; release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable political and legal attacks . "

IT Governance is Like Pushing a Rope
IT governance has been getting a lot of attention lately in the press .
Frankly , it bothers me , since I think that a focus on IT governance is misguided .
Four years ago I wrote an article about the difference between management and leadership .
In the article I said that :
“ … management is like pushing a rope ; it works only if you make continuous small adjustments to keep the rope in line .
Leadership is like pulling a rope ; the parts of the rope that are out of line will automatically align themselves with the direction of motion .
When you push a rope you have to focus on the rope ; when you pull a rope you focus on the direction in which it ’s being pulled . ”
In my opinion , the focus on IT governance is a focus on management at the expense of leadership .
A lot of IT governance is concerned with project decisions : trying to figure out the best way to allocate scarce IT resource .
There are many ways to do this .
You can use steering committees , you can use review boards , and you can come up with complex “ impartial ” formulas for project benefit evaluation ( see my July , 2004 article to find out why I put “ impartial ” in quotation marks ) .
But all of these different approaches are pushing the rope — they ’re ways of forcing certain projects ahead of other projects without really looking at what ’s most important strategically for the business .
The optimum benefit for the business should n’t be determined by a vote .
It should n’t be determined by some complicated formula .
It should be determined by “ pulling the rope ” — by setting a strategic direction for the business and then figuring out what IT projects provide the most benefit and support for that strategic direction .
I made the comment in a meeting a few weeks ago that all of the companies who are focused on IT governance instead of strategy are in deep trouble ( actually I used another word other than “ trouble ” but the meaning is the same ) .
Some of the people at the meeting understood what I meant , but I suspect a large number of the attendees were clueless .
We tend to become absorbed by current projects — not strategy .
And we ’re too busy fighting day - to - day battles to recognize our omission .
Allocation of a scarce resource in a business is a political issue , and the larger and more complicated the business , the more political it is .
Politics is about optimizing the personal agendas of many different people .
And that ’s what IT governance is all about — it ’s a way of choosing the “ least bad ” set of solutions from a minefield of conflicting personal agendas .
IT governance is like a multi- dimensional traffic light : some projects get the green light , and some projects get the red light until it ’s their turn to go .
But projects that are more strategic are n’t typically given higher priority , and in fact there ’s often no consensus on which projects are considered to be strategic .
In many of my articles I ’ve talked about focus — the need to put your scarce resources to work on the most important things .
It ’s my experience that strategy can provide focus , but IT governance cannot .
Instead , IT governance just forces various projects through IT for all of the wrong reasons .
Is your business “ pushing the rope ” and managing your IT workload ?
Or are you “ pulling the rope ” and leading the business and IT to its strategic objectives ?
In the long run we ’ll all know because of your business success or lack thereof .
Pushing the rope is the best approach for business mediocrity .
Pulling the rope can give you superb IT and an outstanding business .

Lean back and cross your eyes so that they see four total images instead of the normal two .
Then they slowly uncross your eyes until two out of the four images overlap each - other .
Once the middle two images are perfectly aligned you start to see a single 3D image in the center .
Other people get close to the screen and let their eyes loose their focus and their brain just does the rest .
NOTE : Want to make a stereoscopic comic like this ?
I wrote a blog post explaining how .
It is business as usual in government , despite a president who was elected with a promise of hope , change , and the end of , well , business as usual .
At a conference of the nation 's governors in Boston this past weekend , the main topic of conversation was the country 's ongoing economic woes .
Above all , the governors say , their states need jobs .
California may be the headline basket case , with an unemployment rate of 12.4 percent , but my home state of Nevada is even worse — a whopping 14 percent .
So you would think a small businessman like John Stagliano would be held up as a model of entrepreneurship in the United States of 2010 .
Stagliano built his Southern California company from scratch into a business now worth millions , creating dozens of full - time jobs with benefits ( and providing well - compensated work to hundreds of others , too ) .
Included among those jobs were hires necessary for the specific purpose of compiling the bureaucratic paperwork his industry is required to maintain by various levels of government .
Despite the red tape , Stagliano's California business , Evil Angel , has thrived .
Then in 2004 , Stagliano invested millions into the Las Vegas economy with an original , dance - centered production show on the Strip .
The Fashionistas ran for years , far outlasting better known competing Broadway - generated titles such as Avenue Q , Spamalot , and Hairspray .
The show proved a surprise favorite with critics , myself included , who were awed by the artistically ambitious choreography , costuming , and tight storyline told through music and dance .
I became friends with Stagliano after he closed Fashionistas to concentrate on Evil Angel , and so it seemed unlikely I would ever be called upon to write about him again .
But then in 2008 something shocking happened : Stagliano was charged by the United States government with enough crimes to potentially put him in prison for the remainder of his life .
How could this happen ?
Because outside Vegas , Stagliano 's day job is as a pornographer .
Indeed , within the subculture of pornography , Stagliano is revered for being the originator of the " gonzo porn " genre , in which the viewer is brought more directly into the proceedings , often via performers themselves holding cameras .
Stagliano has won numerous artistic awards from his indutry peers , almost too many to count .
His movies are taught in graduate film programs , and psychiatrists have used them to treat patients with sexual issues .
Evil Angel not only distributes Stagliano 's films , but also the work of other directors he hand - picks .
In this , Stagliano turned out to be as good a connoisseur as director .
By 2008 , the year he was charged with obscenity , Evil Angel was perhaps the most successful adult DVD distributor in the country .
Stagliano was an economics major in college , and with Evil Angel he transformed the business model of porn .
Before Evil Angel , traditional adult companies gave directors a flat budget for making a movie , then pocketed the profits .
What was not spent on the actors , set , and production became the director 's take - home pay .
Once the director turned in the completed movie , he no longer held any financial stake in the project .
The obvious economic incentive was to make the cheapest porn movies possible .
Stagliano instead entered into partnerships with his directors :
They paid to make their own movies , Evil Angel paid for distribution and marketing , and the profits were split between the two .
The result was that many of the best directors in the adult movie world immediately partnered with Evil Angel in order to maintain ownership of their work and have a unique chance at earning royalties from DVD sales .
That a libertarian insight underlines Evil Angel 's business practice is no accident ; Stagliano is a committed libertarian and a donor to the non-profit Reason Foundation , which publishes this website .
Stagliano has operated Evil Angel this way for decades , which means he must comply with complicated government regulations set out specifically for his work .
( Even his current prosecutors make no claim to the contrary . )
Though the Justice Department in this case is essentially arguing that pornography is just a synonym for obscenity , that would seem to conflict with government rules such as the 2257 rule , a 1980s - era regulation requiring companies like Evil Angel to maintain documents proving that all of their performers in sexual videos are adults .
Does n't 2257 imply that pornography with adults , made for adults , is not a crime ?
Or is all pornography now obscenity ?
The answer , and its history , are complicated .
Obscenity law in the United States evolved piecemeal after the courts attempted to specifically define an obscenity exception to the First Amendment for the first time in 1957's Roth v. United States .
The Roth case , with a majority opinion written by Justice William Brennan , created the first standard for distinguishing obscenity from First Amendment - protected expression :
Whether " to the average person , applying contemporary community standards , the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest . "
This definition did not work .
In the decades since Roth , judges have tried and failed to develop an objective test separating porn from obscenity .
The problem is , quite simply , defining what obscenity means .
Currently the courts use the Miller test , which dates back to 1973's Miller v. California , again applying " community standards , " though carving out protection for works that have " serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . "
Miller , like Roth , is more than a bit antiquated in our Internet age .
But doubts about the efficacy of obscenity tests long pre-date the Web .
As the late Justice Brennan , who kicked things off with Roth , eventually came to conclude in a withering 1978 dissent :
I would place the responsibility and the right to weed worthless and offensive communications from the public airways where it belongs and where , until today , it resided : in a public free to choose those communications worthy of its attention from a marketplace unsullied by the censor 's hand .
In other words , let the consumers and not the courts decide what is too obscene for a community .
That bit of judicial wisdom has yet to take legal root .
But none of this history explains the prosecution of John Stagliano in 2010 for making movies with consenting adults and selling them to other consenting adults .
When did his business suddenly become criminal ?
Why has the power and majesty of the United States government , the financial and personnel resources of the FBI , all joined forces now to try and send Stagliano to prison ?
Here is the final piece of the puzzle .
In 2005 , under then - President George W. Bush , the Department of Justice formed the Obscenity Prosecution Task Force ( OPTF ) .
The ideological slant of the task force 's " mission " is clear from its website : " Enforcement is necessary in order to protect citizens from unlawful exposure to obscene materials . "
In Stagliano 's case , for example , an FBI special agent special - ordered movies that Evil Angel distributed .
He then purchased the DVDs on the taxpayer 's dime .
There was never a single complaint from any actual citizen .
Last week , after much delay , Stagliano 's trial finally began in Washington , D.C.
So far little has happened in the courtroom , though the tiny events have been ominous .
District Court Judge Richard Leon ruled that Stagliano cannot use expert witnesses , and shut the press out of the jury selection process ( which , after a full week , has yet to finish ) .
Things do n't bode well for a free and open trial :
The courtroom monitors that will display the crucial evidence are all arranged to be out of the sightlines of press and interested citizens , viewable only by jurors and lawyers .
If the press and the public cannot see the evidence , how will we know if the trial is fair ?
More importantly , why is this ridiculous case still going on at all in 2010 ?
Justice Department inertia and business as usual seem to be the general explanation .
The current attorney general may or may not approve of what Bush 's Justice Department did , but he clearly lacks the desire to alter those choices .
The result is that , because of Stagliano 's unique stature in the adult world , this is the most important obscenity case of the century .
Nor will it be the last clash between government and porn .
The OPTF is still out there , playing at movie critic , deciding which porn is fine and which is obscene .
Unlike previous prosecutions of more fringe figures in the adult world , Stagliano is at the center of the industry , and among the most auteur - oriented directors that porn has ever known .
If he loses this case , almost any current adult content could be declared obscene .
Is this the job you want the government doing ?
Do you feel " protected , " as the OPTF site says , by the continuing work of buying porn with taxpayer money ?
Well , forget hope and change .
The Obama administration has opted for business as usual .
Richard Abowitz has chronicled the rise and continuing fall of Las Vegas for the Las Vegas Weekly , Vegas Seven , and the Los Angeles Times , most notably at the Movable Buffet blog .
He now blogs chiefly at GoldPlatedDoor.com .
He will be covering the Stagliano trial for Reason , and can be followed on Twitter at @ RichardAbowitz .
Tonight , it 's episode seven , series three of Gok 's Fashion Fix .
He will revisit Tracy Willis from series two " whose biker image contrasted wildly with her role as mayor of Seaford .
Having previously shed her masculine look … " .
Blah , blah .
Here we go again .
We 're almost at the end of the third series of this programme , and still Gok has a very one - dimensional view of how a woman should look if she wants to be sexy .
And , that look is " traditionally feminine " .
Think floaty floral pieces that show off her " bangers " ( Gok 's word ) .
But perhaps a female biker can look good as she is ?
Maybe not all women want our bangers on show , eh Gok ?
In 2010 , are we still so narrowly constrained in our view of what femininity is to not be able to step away from old stereotypes ?
Last week ,
Gok fans saw him go to Matlock to " meet 26 - year - old CJ Rees , who 's got a curvy body , but dresses like a teenage boy " .
Do you see the theme here ?
Anything a bit boyish or masculine = ugly and dowdy .
Did the Androgynous Deyn phenomenon completely pass him by ?
What about the boyishly stunning Erin O'Connor ?
I keep watching in the vain hope he 'll wise up and put a woman in some double denim or a sharp suit like this , but I fear it 'll never happen .
Do n't get me wrong , I love Gok .
I am so immensely pleased about what he 's done to try to make different women 's shapes more appreciated .
You can tell he genuinely loves women and wants to make them feel good .
I 've even had tears in my eyes at the end of particularly emotional makeovers , touched to see one of his girl 's glowing and happy with herself .
I think most gals , boyish or not , would like a bit of Gok in their life ( well , those that are n't offended by having their breasts called " fun bags " , anyway ) .
I , personally , would love him to take me on a fabulous shopping spree , stop off somewhere fancy for lunch , have some champers and get my nails done .
I just would n't want my " 24 - piece capsule wardrobe " to involve any chiffon , an LBD or anything with the word " maxi " on the label .
I 'd feel like I was being dragged up .
It 's a tougher challenge to find boyish and beautiful looks on the high street – and I do n't know if our boy is actually up to that task .
If the programme lives to see another series – and with about 2 million viewers each episode , it should do – I am pleading with you , Gok , do some non -girly girls for us .
And ones that embrace their boyishness and understand that they do not have to switch to a stereotypical feminine image to look a million dollars .
Or better still , take Jo from the home counties out of her maxi dress and sex her up a bit with a biker outfit ?
As a trans man or woman , you soon notice how many people have what Daffy Duck called ' pronoun trouble ' .
No matter how supportive of your transition they claim to be , and how much well - intentioned advice they give you about your new hairstyle , or the name you always used in your head but only just told them about , they misgender you every other time they open their mouths , and get quite upset if you call them on it .
You 're being too sensitive , they say , or it 's too soon .
Families , in particular , think it 's too soon even after years .
Getting your name right is a minimum requirement of respect - referring to you in the third person by the wrong pronoun means that respect is only superficial politeness .
I used to think that straight men particularly tended to misgender me if they were losing an argument ; now I 've seen them do it to trans men too .
Misgendering is sometimes cluelessness , but more often it 's quiet , hostile aggression , especially if we are n't gratefully deferential for whatever crumbs of acceptance we are thrown - if we speak up as freely as if we were actual , you know , human beings .
Oh , and a word to far too many columnists and pub philosophers : the only time ' it ' is acceptable is with neutrois - identified people , some of whom regard it as mandatory .
And if that 's one rule too many to keep in your social vocabulary , well , tough .
The trans community 's internal debates about language , and our preparedness to be fussy about what people call us in public , have grown ever more intense , even acrimonious .
One way of looking at this is to say that when trans people are being murdered all over the planet , arguing about words is staggeringly trivial - minded .
Another way is to say that when people are dying , you can't let any slur go unremarked .
Trans people 's battle for language is no different from the struggle against other sexist language ; we 're not just being picky .
It 's mostly working - class trans women and men of colour in the developing world that are actually being killed , but no matter how middle class and white one is , almost every trans person sooner or later realises we walk on thin ice .
You can be a famous astrophysicist and still find people campaigning for you to lose your job .
More often , we have to worry about groups of drunks guessing our past on the tube .
It starts with name - calling , but it does n't always end there .
Some terms were always insulting .
' She - male ' has the interesting distinction of being simultaneously used by the pornography industry and radical feminists such as Janice Raymond .
' He - she ' is unpronounceable when sober .
Raymond 's terms , like ' male - to - constructed - female ' , were always so unwieldy that they disappeared even from the language of abuse .
The tabloid - beloved ' sex change ' lacks a sense of nuance - not everyone wants , or can get or afford , surgery that is seen as putting us where we should always have been , not somewhere new .
Yet we use words that involve the notion of crossing over - language is all about paradox .
There are words used in the community that almost no one else wants or needs .
People ' pass ' , and some of those who pass decide to ' go into stealth ' and sever all ties with the trans community .
Some stealthers snipe on the internet at everyone else for making their lives more difficult , for being inferior failures ; others are just getting on with their lives in privacy .
Yet all stealthers , just like those of us who want social acceptance on our own terms , are at risk of being ' read ' and outed .
Most trans people can agree on ' transition ' at least - for the moment .
On the other hand , MTF and FTM were for a while standard , then got into the personal ads and disappeared from respectable usage .
' Transexual ' is too medicalised for a lot of people 's taste , and ' gender dysphoric ' plays the pity card .
' Transgender ' is a useful portmanteau term for a coalition of almost everybody unhappy with rigid unalterable binary gender roles , but rapidly became too vague to be entirely useful .
Right now , trans is just about universally acceptable - though in recent years there was a fight over whether it should be an adjective or a prefix .
A trans woman , the argument goes , is a woman who happens to be trans as she might be , say , blonde , but a transman is some special and distinct order of being .
For a while , it seemed as if some younger trans men were going to successfully reclaim ' tranny ' , at least as a ' smile when you say that ' epithet , or a 'we can say that about ourselves ; you can 't ' in - group word like ' queer ' .
It did n't take , though , partly because it had never stopped being used by would - be hip lad journalists to abuse not only actual trans people , but a list of ' weird ' people seen as non-gender - conforming .
Unwieldiness is always going to be the thing that stops some of the currently modish terminology catching on .
Once you start using self - descriptions like ' male - identified , female - assigned - at - birth , female - bodied ( currently ) , non-operative ' , you are getting into a place where the map is as big as the territory and you hand out a CV every time you have a conversation .
The thing about just saying you 're trans is that it tells people we 're here , get used to it .
That 's why , particularly for younger trans people , writing and activism are one .
Old - school language such as ' trapped in the wrong body ' was always sentimental twaddle , but spoke to how life felt .
Now young trans poets are trying to make new language for their situations .
As a recent play about trans male life and genitals put it , " There is no word for it . "
There is , however , now a word for people who are not trans .
Amazingly , there has recently been a controversy in feminist blogs about the term ' cis ' , popularised by Julia Serano , which is about as value - free and non-derogatory as you can get - it's a standard Latin prefix , as in ' Cisalpine Gaul ' .
This exemplifies the fact that language is a battlefield for trans people : we can find ourselves in a row just for having our own word for everyone else .

This plugin differs from others in the way it just put a transparent ‘ layer ’ over the involved boxes ( this using a jQuery selector ) instead of putting it over the entire body , in this way the user will specifically know which sections of the page are being updated .
Demo
Before / After
I was reading the New York Times online and they had an article which showed a road in Brooklyn that had been reconstructed to make it safer and more pleasing to the eye .
To show the difference in the reconstruction project , they showed a before and after picture using Flash that let the visitor drag a slider over the images , which were sandwiched with one on top of the other , so that you could easily see how dramatic the changes were .
I immediately thought that this could be done in JavaScript using jQuery , so I set out to do it .

The government ’s decision not to renew an agreement with Microsoft for up to 800,000 NHS desktops could be an opportunity for open source suppliers to prove their worth .
According to an article on IT channel website Microscope.co.uk , the government did not feel the deal , known as an enterprise agreement , which aims to give lower prices in return for group buying was not value for money .
It prefers individual NHS Trusts to buy what they want , rather than being forced to be part of an enterprise wide deal .
This must appear an opening of a door for two groups of suppliers .
These are the open source software community and those selling and integrating thin client computing systems .
Open source software would help service providers make immediate costs in government IT spending because there are no license fees .
Thin clients , where the software sits on a central server and users connect via a terminal , is also a lower cost way of using Microsoft .
The Department of Work & Pensions recently signed a deal with Fujitsu to replace 140,000 desktops with thin clients .
The deal between Fujitsu and the DWP also saves millions on energy consumption because every workers does n’t have an energy hungry desktop PC .
This is probably another good example of how suppliers should help the government meet its targets to cut IT costs .

GENEVA  Roman Polanski ’s repeated claims that there was misconduct at his trial for having sex with a 13 - year - old girl in 1977 ran into a brick wall in American courts .
But they were enough apparently to convince Swiss authorities that he should walk free .
Switzerland announced Monday that it would not extradite Mr. Polanski , a famous film director , to the United States in part because of fresh doubts over the conduct of the judge in his original trial .
“ He ’s a free man , ” the Swiss justice minister , Eveline Widmer - Schlumpf , said at a news conference on Monday .
The ruling means that , after nearly a year of courtroom wrangling in the United States and Switzerland , the case is roughly where it has been for decades : Mr. Polanski is free to return to his home in France but remains wanted in the United States .
He was arrested at the Zurich airport last September on an international warrant issued by the United States on charges including rape and sodomy dating from 1977 .
In December , the Swiss authorities allowed him to move to his chalet in the ski resort of Gstaad under house arrest on bail of $ 4.5 million pending a decision on his extradition .
HMV forced to take down ' Anyone But England ' World Cup display after racism complaints
HMV have withdrawn ' Anyone But England ' banners from its Scottish stores after complaints to police that they were inciting racial hatred .
The high street chain put up large window displays and stocked T - shirts featuring the slogan ' ABE ' in the run-up to the World Cup .
However , they were besieged by calls from angry members of the public and the Campaign for an English Parliament ( CEP ) made a complaint to police in Fife that the company were inciting racial hatred .
An officer from Fife Constabulary visited an HMV store in former Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's constituency of Kirkcaldy earlier this week and bosses quickly agreed to remove the banners from all their stores north of the border .
Offending article : The Anyone But England T - shirt currently on sale in Scottish HMV stores .
The high street chain has received complaints
Yesterday , HMV said they were no longer ' actively promoting ' the ' ABE ' stock through banners and displays but said it would continue to sell a limited number of T - shirts .
Stuart Parr , a National Council member for the CEP , said : ' The Campaign for an English Parliament will challenge any company that incites racial hatred towards the English .
' Racism is unacceptable no matter who it is directed against , including English people .
Mr Parr said HMV 's decision to stock the ABE shirts and make window displays during the World Cup was ' criminally irresponsible '
Police visit : Officers went to an HMV store in Kircaldy and asked the staff to remove an ABE window display after it was accused of inciting racial hatred
He added : ' There has been a lot of attacks on English people in Scotland during previous football tournaments and anti-English racism remains a problem .
' There is enough tension around the World Cup without a big national company like HMV stirring it up . '
But police have been accused of an overreacting to the complaints .
Tam Ferry , a spokesman for the Association of Tartan Army Clubs , said : ' This is just political correctness gone mad again .
He started it :
When asked at a press conference who he would be supporting in the 2006 World Cup , tennis star Andy Murray replied ' Anyone but England '
' I have got one of the T - shirts and I think it 's great that HMV were putting up banners .
' Football is all about rivalry and having a bit of banter .
Have the police got nothing better to do than take away a bit of fun from people ?
' There 's bigger problems in this country that they should be dealing with rather than this . '
Trevor Phillips , the head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission , has described the slogan as ' good - natured banter that was unlikely to cause offence ' .
The T - shirts had already been the subject of police action after officers from Grampian visited Slanj , an Aberdeen - based kilt - maker , in February pointing out they were potentially racist .
The company was asked to remove the garments from its windows because of their ' potential to cause disturbance ' .
The term ' Anyone but England ' was coined by Andy Murray , the Scottish tennis player , when he was asked at a press conference who he would be supporting in the 2006 World Cup .
His quip provoked a backlash among English fans and he later apologised , claiming he had been joking .
An HMV spokesman said : ' If we thought the shirts were in any way racist then we certainly would n't have stocked them .
' In our view the shirts are not against England or the English , but are simply about some Scottish fans expressing a view that they want any team other than England to win this year 's World Cup .
' It 's not a sentiment we agree with , but surely a football fan has a right to express such a view if they choose to - this is about the World Cup and should not be turned into a race issue . '
A spokeswoman for Fife Constabulary said : ' We received a complaint on Monday June 14 regarding the Anyone But England banners .
' An officer attended the HMV store in Kirkcaldy and spoke to the manager there to make him aware of the complaint and to give advice .
' Ultimately it was HMV 's decision to remove the banners . '
There would surely be no more popular World Cup winners than the Netherlands .
The country that has produced so many great footballers and such a distinct , wonderful way of playing the game is still without a World Cup win .
Discussing the tactics of the Dutch side is not possible without a brief look at the history and culture surrounding the way they play their football .
Attempting to sum up why the Dutch have underachieved is not possible within one article ; David Winner has essentially written an entire book on that very subject .
He begins a chapter by asking ,
“ Why have the Dutch never won the World Cup , despite having so many wonderful , intelligent players and such a deliciously original and beautiful concept of the game ?
To an outsider , the manner in which Dutch national teams regularly fail in major tournaments is hard to comprehend .
What weird , remorseless , fatal inner logical causes Dutch players , coaches and the federation to exhaust themselves in pointless pretty feuds about tactics , power and money ?
Why , when it so obviously defeats the purpose of achieving success , do the Dutch so often pick the wrong coach or spend all their time and energy complaining about the coach they do pick ?
Why do their gifted teams so often fall asleep against inferior opponents ?
Why do their stars walk out on the eve of major tournaments ?
Why do n’t they ever seem to ask themselves why ? ”
He concludes ,
“ The most obvious diagnosis for the Dutch tendency to fail at the vital moment surely lies in the nature of Dutch individualism and antipathy to autocracy .
Holland ’s democracy , individualism and profound distrust of authority all have deep historical roots . ”
Later on , Winner asks Dennis Bergkamp why Holland have so often disappointed in major tournaments .
Bergkamp replies ,
“ It ’s difficult .
Because we ’re not really a killer team … it we were a killer team , we might forget to play the football we ’re good at .
You never know there that will end … ”
The 2010 episode
So , is anything different this time around ?
Probably not .
The Netherlands have a wonderful array of attacking talent but a slightly suspect defence ; so we have all the required features of a classic Dutch show – wonderful football in the group stage followed by an alarming collapse when things get serious .
They had amongst the most impressive results of any of the 31 sides who qualified for this tournament .
In an admittedly weak group , they had a record of eight wins from eight games , 17 goals scored and two conceded .
They maintained a shape throughout qualification that was described as both 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 and 4 - 2 - 1 - 3 – in this case , the notation is probably not important ; the basic shape is clear .
Fluidity in the final third
The formation may be settled , but the starting XI is not .
Wesley Sneijder , seen by most as the key player in this side , only started two of those eight games because of injury .
Both Arjen Robben and Rafael van der Vaart were in and out of the side , whilst Robin van Persie managed to pick up a long - term injury almost as soon as qualifying was over , but is thankfully now fit .
The attacking player who started the most games , Dirk Kuyt , may find himself with a place on the bench .
The reason for that is the delicious prospect of a Sneijder - Robben - van Persie - van der Vaart quartet , which would unquestionably be the popular choice .
And for once , public desire to squeeze four out - and - out attacking players into the same side might just work – all are versatile , offering a plethora of attacking options , and in theory , it should work brilliantly .
“ In theory ” is the key , however .
Those players have never started a Holland game together as a front four , although they were on the pitch as the same time for a blistering 33 - minute spell against France in Euro 2008 , one of the most remarkable international performances in recent history .
Incredibly , Ruud van Nistelrooy was also on the pitch – and if they can work together that well with another striker on the pitch and just one holding midfielder , surely they can work as a front four in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 for Bert van Marwijk .
Will Sneijder - Robben-RVP-RVDV work ?
It certainly seems to be popular with the players themselves , as Robin van Persie recently revealed , saying “ Nothing negative about Kuyt , who is a good player and deserved his credit but this is my opinion … with these four players in one team we really will be unique and will have an excellent chance of success . ”
There is a suspicion , though , that Kuyt will get a starting spot – he offers a more disciplined , defensively aware option in the front four .
Most likely for the chop would be Rafael van der Vaart , and then Bert van Marwijk would have to decide how to play his quartet – van Persie or Kuyt could play upfront , with the other three behind , but they offer two quite different options ; van Persie drops deep in a false nine role , whereas Kuyt is more focussed on holding the ball up .
The former seems the most natural option .
The system is a ‘ deliberate ’ 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , rather than a system that started out as a 4 - 4 - 2 but evolved with the wingers pushing on and one striker dropping off .
The four front players are happy to rotate , as seen on the right .
This is also key defensively – when Holland lose the ball the front four are not obliged to return to their starting position , they simply move to the zone closest to them if the nature of the attack has taken them off - course .
Defence
The two central midfielders will be two destructive players , Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong .
De Jong comes short to receive the ball from the central defenders slightly more often , but also charges forward and attempts to link up with the forwards more – although do n’t expect much of a goal threat from the central midfielders .
The back four now looks fairly certain to be , from right to left , Gregory van der Wiel , Johnny Heitinga , Joris Mathijsen and captain Giovanni van Bronkhorst .
Slightly unusually for a Dutch side that has often featured a central midfielder dropping back into the defence , or even a back three , there is relatively little of note about the defence – the centre - backs stay central , the full - backs look to get forward and provide an outlet for the midfielders .
Generally only one of them push forward at a time , although with two holding midfielders in front of the defence , it is not suicidal if they both get forward .
Conclusion
There has been speculation that this is a slightly more pragmatic , less spectacular Netherlands side than usual – but that may be , as with Brazil , a case of viewing their previous World Cup displays with orange - tinted glasses .
The key to the success of this Dutch side ( in purely tactical terms ) will be the organisation of the defenders .
The attacking players will surely score goals , and you know what you ’ll get from the two central midfielders – battling qualities and reliable , simple distribution .
The back four are relatively weak players individually , maybe the weakest of the true contenders for this competition .
As always with defending , though , it is not so much about individual quality as it is about cohesiveness and mutual understanding .
If the Dutch back four can work well together , they have a real chance of wining this competition – but then that would n’t be the Dutch way , would it ?

It will take a while to parse Muir Russell .
They ’ve been working on it for 7 months and I ’ve had it for a day .
I ’m going to place up notes on things as I notice them .
At some point , I ’ll try to pull together a longer response , but there are lots of interesting things as I read .
Here ’s an interesting point that touches on some larger issues .
In Fred Pearce ’s recent book , he says that Jones told him that Yamal was used in only 3 of 12 AR4 reconstructions – a point which led him ( incorrectly ) to presume that statements made in McKitrick ’s National Post article were “ poppycock ” :
According to Jones , of the 12 reconstructions used in the last IPCC reconstruction , authored by Briffa and published in 2007 , only three contained Yamal data .
( Pearce , 101 )
The minutes of the April 9 , 2009 meeting between the Team and Briffa - Jones say that 4 reconstructions used Yamal ( a point re-confirmed in the CRU Response to the Apr 9 minutes )
Prof Briffa responded that the Briffa - Yamal series is only used in 4 of 10 reconstructions in the 4th IPCC reports and none in the 3rd .
Salient , s6
In the Muir Russell Report , they say ( section 7 ) that Yamal is used in only 4 [ 2 ] out of 12 reconstructions in AR4 , with footnote 2 saying that a “ fifth reconstruction is disputed “ .
No provenance is given as to how this dispute arises , nor are there any documents at the CCE Review website showing evidence to the panel that Yamal was used in fifth “ disputed ” reconstruction .
The point at issue here is obviously medieval - modern comparisons .
Only 8 of the 12 AR4 reconstructions provide such a comparison ( Oerlemanns ’ glacier recession ; Pollack and Smerdon ’s borehole ; Rutherford et al 2005 and Briffa et al 2001 go back only to 1500 or 1400 . )
Using a denominator of 12 rather than 8 for the comparison is what climate scientists call a “ trick ” .
I visited this topic in October 2009 in two posts during the pre-Climategate Yamal controversy ( Sept 29 here and Oct 28 here , responding to Briffa ’s post on the topic here .
The fifth “ disputed ” use pertains to Hegerl et al 2007 .
In Briffa ’s table here , he says that Yamal was not used in this reconstruction .
In my table here responding to Briffa , I observed that Hegerl et al 2007 stated that their “ west Siberia long composite involved Yamal and the west Urals composite , ” which I took as evidence that they used Yamal , which Briffa interprets otherwise – hence the “ dispute ” .
Now Jones ’ number of three uses presumably arises from the fact that D’Arrigo et al said that they used Polar Urals , but actually used Yamal – a point observed at CA .
I suggested to D’Arrigo co-author Rob Wilson that they submit an erratum on this point , but Wilson thought that it was a good idea not to do so .
Briffa ’s post noted that D ; Arrigo ’s “ Yamal was used , though possibly labelled as Polar Urals ” – a statement that I criticized at the time , since there was no actual doubt as to the label in the article – all you had to do was look .
Now what of the mysterious Hegerl reconstruction ?
Where the use or non-use is a mystery that remained unresolved even after the GBP200,000 inquiry .
A question that IPCC Lead Author Briffa is unable to answer .
In Sep 2005 as an IPCC reviewer , I asked IPCC to determine which proxies were used in Hegerl et al 2007 .
When they refused , I asked Hegerl directly ( and also D’Arrigo et al ) .
IPCC WG1 Chairman Susan Solomon threatened me with expulsion as an IPCC reviewer if I asked any more authors of unpublished papers for such information .
So I was n’t able to find out at the time .
Climategate correspondence at the time of the NAS panel hearings ( March 2006 ) contains correspondence about a worried Hegerl , afraid of data requests from McKitrick and I and wondering whether it might n’t be better to remove her reconstruction from the spaghetti graph .
I engaged in lengthy correspondence with Hegerl co-author and husband , Tom Crowley , trying to get information on their proxies and , in particular , their west Siberia composite .
That drifted into a huge number of emails without any success .
Crowley made fun of this in an interview with Andy Revkin last September .
Hegerl and Crowley were hired by Muir Russell panelist Geoffrey Boulton to the University of Edinburgh .
In the Royal Society of Edinburgh ’s Copenhagen brief in December 2009 , Boulton used the mysterious Hegerl reconstruction .
Only in Team climate science would there be a “ dispute ” over whether Yamal was used in the Hegerl reconstruction .
Be that as it may , you ’d have thought that Boulton would have been perfectly placed to get to the bottom of the mystery of whether Yamal was used in the Hegerl reconstruction .
Unfortunately , the moment seems to have passed .
And thus the dispute lingers on .
And oh yes , it seems like we have a little He Who Must Not Be Named here .
Muir Russell is silent on who claimed 5 Yamal uses and there ’s no submitted evidence on the point .
Can we therefore presume that they read the relevant CA post https://climateaudit.org/2009/10/28/response-to-briffa-on-yamal-impact/ but Gavinesquely did n’t cite it ?
The actual issue is the impact of Yamal on the AR4 spaghetti graph .
Muir Russell purports to rebut a straw man that Yamal did n’t affect all the reconstructions – a point that I ’ll return to .
This is a strawman .
The original point was that bristlecones and / or Yamal had a material impact on virtually all of the 1000 - year reconstructions ( seven of eight ) – not that Yamal simpliciter affected all the reconstructions .
The purported rebuttals completely miss the point .
Yamal was Scotty Pippen to the bristlecones ’ Michael Jordan .
If I said that Jordan and Pippen scored most of the points for the Chicago Bulls .
The strawman is to restate that I ’d claimed that Pippen scored most of the points , and then purporting to rebut it by showing Michael Jordan highlights .
Jordan and Pippen , not Pippen by himself .
Or as I ’ve expressed elsewhere .
Yamal was like crack cocaine to paleoclimatogists ( but bristlecones were heroin . )
relevant comparison for Yamal is thus not 3 out of 12 , but 5 out of 8 – something that is a material difference unless you ’re a climate scientist .
The indented , italicized sections below appear as annotations to the Open Source Definition ( OSD ) and are not a part of the OSD .
A plain version of the OSD without annotations can be found here .
Introduction
Open source does n't just mean access to the source code .
The distribution terms of open - source software must comply with the following criteria :
1. Free Redistribution
The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources .
The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale .
Rationale :
By constraining the license to require free redistribution , we eliminate the temptation for licensors to throw away many long - term gains to make short - term gains .
If we did n't do this , there would be lots of pressure for cooperators to defect .
2. Source Code
The program must include source code , and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form .
Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code , there must be a well - publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost , preferably downloading via the Internet without charge .
The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program .
Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed .
Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed .
Rationale :
We require access to un-obfuscated source code because you can't evolve programs without modifying them .
Since our purpose is to make evolution easy , we require that modification be made easy .
3. Derived Works
The license must allow modifications and derived works , and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software .
Rationale :
The mere ability to read source is n't enough to support independent peer review and rapid evolutionary selection .
For rapid evolution to happen , people need to be able to experiment with and redistribute modifications .
4. Integrity of The Author 's Source Code
The license may restrict source - code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of " patch files " with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time .
The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code .
The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software .
Rationale : Encouraging lots of improvement is a good thing , but users have a right to know who is responsible for the software they are using .
Authors and maintainers have reciprocal right to know what they 're being asked to support and protect their reputations .
Accordingly , an open - source license must guarantee that source be readily available , but may require that it be distributed as pristine base sources plus patches .
In this way , " unofficial " changes can be made available but readily distinguished from the base source .
5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons .
Rationale :
In order to get the maximum benefit from the process , the maximum diversity of persons and groups should be equally eligible to contribute to open sources .
Therefore we forbid any open - source license from locking anybody out of the process .
Some countries , including the United States , have export restrictions for certain types of software .
An OSD - conformant license may warn licensees of applicable restrictions and remind them that they are obliged to obey the law ; however , it may not incorporate such restrictions itself .
6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor .
For example , it may not restrict the program from being used in a business , or from being used for genetic research .
Rationale :
The major intention of this clause is to prohibit license traps that prevent open source from being used commercially .
We want commercial users to join our community , not feel excluded from it .
7. Distribution of License
The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties .
Rationale :
This clause is intended to forbid closing up software by indirect means such as requiring a non-disclosure agreement .
8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product
The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program 's being part of a particular software distribution .
If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program 's license , all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution .
Rationale :
This clause forecloses yet another class of license traps .
9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software
The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software .
For example , the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open - source software .
Rationale : Distributors of open - source software have the right to make their own choices about their own software .
Yes , the GPL v2 and v3 are conformant with this requirement .
Software linked with GPLed libraries only inherits the GPL if it forms a single work , not any software with which they are merely distributed .
10 . License Must Be Technology - Neutral
No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface .
Rationale :
This provision is aimed specifically at licenses which require an explicit gesture of assent in order to establish a contract between licensor and licensee .
Provisions mandating so - called " click - wrap " may conflict with important methods of software distribution such as FTP download , CD - ROM anthologies , and web mirroring ; such provisions may also hinder code re-use .
Conformant licenses must allow for the possibility that ( a ) redistribution of the software will take place over non-Web channels that do not support click - wrapping of the download , and that ( b ) the covered code ( or re-used portions of covered code ) may run in a non-GUI environment that cannot support popup dialogues .
The Open Source Definition was originally derived from the Debian Free Software Guidelines ( DFSG ) .

Remember that 100 - ton , four - story “ containment box ” which developed a nasty case of hydrates , or that snaggable “ riser insertion tube , ” which was supposed to siphon off so much of the escaping oil from the busted well , but did n’t ?
No ?
Little wonder , because we moved on so quickly to “ top kill , ” “ junk shot , ” and now “ top hat ” -- with both a snaggable diamond saw and shears that do n't cut that cleanly .
Strangely , while all of this represents a repetitive tale of failure 5,000 feet down , the headline narrative remains oddly hopeful .
The next techno - fix , or the one after , will finally do the trick .
( I suspect that oil industry insiders must be joking sardonically about rubes who will believe anything . )
The final hope lies , of course , in those “ relief wells ” now being drilled diagonally thousands of feet under the waters to intersect with the original well and cement it shut .
As White House energy adviser Carol Browner said last Sunday , “ I think what the American people need to know [ is ] that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August when the relief wells will be finished . "
Mid-August may be a long time to wait , even if those wells are now declared “ ahead of schedule , ” but at least -- we are regularly assured -- they will do the trick .
Think about it a moment , though : if a relief well is such a slam dunk , why is BP drilling two of them ( one ordered by federal officials ) , and muttering about a third .
Here , then , is a tip of the old top hat to grim reality .
On those relief wells , listen to David Rensink , president - elect of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and a veteran of oil industry offshore exploration : " If they get it on the first three or four shots , they 'd be very lucky . "
That ’s not exactly surprising given that the process has been “ compared to hitting a target the size of a dinner plate with a drill more than two miles into the earth . ”
Rensink also suggests that the odds of a first - time success are about the same as winning the lottery .
What , then , can be learned from the historical record ?
The last time such a well was drilled in the Timor Sea off Western Australia , it took five tries over 10 weeks to succeed ( and in the process , the well ’s rig went up in flames ) -- and that was in only 250 feet of water .
As with the 1979 hostage crisis in Iran , Americans are already counting the days to “ relief ” in a drama implicitly titled , as then , “ America held hostage . ”
“ Disaster in the Gulf : Day XX , ” as NBC News ’ logo typically has it .
Well , keep counting if you want , but do n’t count on it .
( There are even reports that a relief well could make the spill worse . )
Whatever the solution , if any , to the gushing well , only one of 4,000 in the northern Gulf of Mexico , the problem is , of course , oil itself .
We humans , like BP , are increasingly out of our depth when it comes to fossil fuels .
AsTomDispatch regular Bill McKibben , author of the remarkable new book Eaarth : Making a Life on a Tough New Planet ( reviewed by Rebecca Solnit at this site ) makes clear , this could be themoment to turn this country around on the subject of its energy future and begin real planning for life after both BP and deepwater drilling .
If only .

If There Was Ever a Moment to Seize
Will Obama Stand Up to Big Energy in Deeds as Well as Words ?
By Bill McKibben
Here 's the president on March 31st , announcing his plan to lift a longstanding moratorium on offshore drilling : " Given our energy needs , in order to sustain economic growth and produce jobs , and keep our businesses competitive , we are going to need to harness traditional sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of renewable , homegrown energy . "
Siestas are popular in continental Europe
Met Office research has predicted by the second half of this century summers like the one in 2003 which killed thousands will become the norm .
Professor Bill Keatinge , a University College London expert on how heat affects the body , said midday rests would be needed to help people cope .
He said without a lifestyle change , the UK could see more people die of heat .
The 2003 heatwave - the hottest summer for 500 years - was linked to 27,000 deaths across Europe , including 2,000 in Britain .
2003 was a foretaste of thing to come if we carry on emitting greenhouse gases
Peter Stott , of the Met Office
During the average summer , 800 people in Britain normally die because of the heat - most commonly through heart attacks or organ damage as the body heats up .
But officials from the Met Office 's climate research unit have predicted the UK could have summers as hot as 2003 - when temperatures hit 35 ºC ( 95 º F ) - every other year .
The study which is yet to be published analysed how climate change would affect temperatures and concluded the hottest days could rise by 7C to top 40C ( 104 ºF ) .
Researcher Peter Stott said : " 2003 was a foretaste of thing to come if we carry on emitting greenhouse gases .
It is likely to become the norm . "
Already this summer temperatures in Spain and Italy have been nudging 40C , prompting reports of heat - related deaths .
Change
Professor Keatinge said a change in habits was needed if temperatures do rise .
" When it is really hot people need to take precautions , especially the elderly .
This means avoiding physical exercise , staying out of the heat .
" Siestas are a good way of doing this , even in central Europe such as Germany they are becoming more common with people working later .
" It is a simple way of staying cool without installing air conditioning . "
Professor Keatinge also said people should eat and drink more during heatwaves .
Mark Gibbs , a Met Office official who advises the NHS on how to prepare for heatwaves , agreed lifestyle changes were needed .
" We need to look at these countries that have already adapted to the heat ... building design , changing lifestyle . "
