I work from the following assumptions :
If the war is still going on when a Democratic President is elected , that President will withdraw all , most , or very many of the troops in Iraq .
The withdrawal , whenever it comes , is going to be accompanied by enormous bloodshed , loss of American life , an at least short - term deterioration of the situation in Iraq , and triumphant videos from Iraqi insurgents and Al Queda linked groups .
The question is " Who gets blamed " ?
Right now , the fault for the war is mostly on the Republicans .
Yes , it 's true that the Democrats have not taken partisan action to stop it , and there are some things they could do which would pretty effectively tie George Bush 's hands -- but still , the Democrats are able to speak out against the war and , as long as they do , the blame stays with the intransigent Republicans .
The problem is , if the Republicans succeed in running out the clock on the Bush Administration and a new Democratic Administration comes into office and implements a withdrawal they ( we ! ) will " own " the disaster that ensues .
It will take an extremely skillful politician and PR team to make sure the blame is placed where it belongs -- on the lunatics who started the war and bungled the aftermath .
But if the Congressional Democrats were to take the non-bi-partisan action that so many here want to see -- by filibustering the funding bill with no Republican support -- the situation is even worse .
First off , again , blame for the unavoidably disastrous outcome will likely fall on the Democrats .
And although the situation in Iraq will be bad even if a Democratic Commander - In - Chief pulls out the troops , imagine how truly terrible it will be if Bush is in charge !
Even if you do n't think that the Bush Administration will deliberately sabotage the pull - out , there 's a certain basic level of incompetency above which they do not seem to be able to rise .
And compounding the problem will be the fact that the Bush Administration will still control the bully pulpit and will still be exerting control over the news coverage .
Does it matter who gets blamed for the eventual disaster in Iraq ?
Yes , because it 's going to affect politics for at least two decades , just as the Vietnam war did .
If the Republicans win , the coming period of Democratic governance could be short - lived indeed .
If the Democrats can somehow dodge blame for doing what needs to be done and keep the focus where it belongs , on Republican bungling , they may neutralize the Republican Party for a generation .
Now comes the part of the diary where I tell you my brilliant solution for how the Democrats accomplish that .
Except I have n't got one .
I have inklings that if they wait until we have the White House and both Houses of Congress it might be done by simultaneously holding scandalous hearings in Congress while carefully controlling the media images out of Iraq ( not that Democrats are particularly good at either coordinating their efforts or affecting media coverage ) .
If it 's to be done by Congress before we take the Presidency I really do n't see any way to stop the war and not get clobbered politically .
That , I believe , is why the Democrats are so focussed on developing bi-partisan support for whatever legislation comes out of Congress and avoiding unilateral action .
If there 's anyone who does know how to get out of this mess , put your plan in the comments .

Facebook The United States ' largest and costliest embassy , a heavily fortified compound in Baghdad with its own power plant and lighted softball field , is on track to be completed next month , on time and within budget .
" We 're going to complete it on schedule , " said Charles Williams , director of the State Department 's overseas building operations .
It took two years to build , he said .
The 65 - acre compound will be largely a world unto itself , insulated as much as possible from problems that plague the rest of Baghdad .
The facility sits on the banks of the Tigris River in the Green Zone , a walled - off area that houses Iraqi and U.S. offices .
The embassy will have a separate set of 9 - foot - high concrete walls to protect it against car or truck bombs .
Many of the buildings also will have specially made bulletproof doors and windows , Williams said .
Baghdad experiences frequent utility outages , but the compound will have its own power , water and sewage plants .
Diplomats are limited in their ability to move outside the Green Zone because of violence , so the compound has soccer fields and a commissary for shopping , Williams said .
The facility has 619 apartments and can accommodate 1,157 workers .
Building the facility in the middle of an insurgency was costly , but Williams said it will not exceed the $ 592 million budgeted .
By having workers live inside the Green Zone , the U.S. government avoided a lot of the security costs that have hampered other construction projects throughout Iraq .
The builders , First Kuwaiti General Trading & Contracting , headquartered in Kuwait , brought in about 2,500 mostly non-Iraqi workers who lived in trailers in the Green Zone .
It was easier than trying to bring locals into the work site , he said .
" The Iraqis were difficult to vet , " Williams said .
First Kuwaiti has been accused by some former workers of abusive labor practices and housing workers in deplorable conditions at the Baghdad site .
" Foreign workers were packed into trailers very tight , " John Owens , a former construction manager at the embassy , told a congressional panel last month .
" There was insufficient equipment and basic needs , like shoes and gloves . "
Williams said he has seen no evidence of abuses .
A review last year by the State Department Inspector General did not substantiate the allegations .
Williams said he expects the State Department to perform final inspections by Sept. 24 or 25 .
Diplomats could move in after that , he said .

Security research company Intego on Monday issued a security alert about a new Trojan Horse called OSX.RSPlug .
A that specifically targets Mac users .
The Trojan is a form of DNSChanger that changes the Mac ’s Domain Name Server ( DNS ) address .
According to Intego , the Trojan has been found on several pornographic Web sites .
When trying to view a movie , the user is told that “ Quicktime Player is unable to play movie file .
Please click here to download new version of codec . ”
When the user clicks the link a disk image ( .dmg ) is downloaded to the desktop .
When the user installs the software , they are actually installing the Trojan , not a free video codec .
The Trojan is installed with full root privileges , which means it has access to all files and commands on the system .
When the malicious DNS server is active , it hijacks some web requests , leading users to phishing web sites ( for sites such as Ebay , PayPal and some banks ) or to web pages displaying ads for other pornographic web sites , according to Intego .
The Trojan also installs a root crontab which checks every minute to ensure that its DNS server is still active , the company said .
Since changing a network location could change the DNS server , this cron job ensures that , in such a case , the malicious DNS server remains the active server .
Intego says that using Mac OS X 10.4 , there is no way to see the changed DNS server in the operating system ’s interface .
Under Mac OS X 10.5 , this can be seen in the Advanced Network preferences ; the added DNS servers are dimmed , and can not be removed manually .
Intego has updated its virus definitions to remove the malicious code and prevent it from being installed .
This story , " New Trojan Horse targets Mac users " was originally published by PCWorld .
F# is a functional language being developed by Microsoft Research .
Based on OCaml , the language has been the test bed for many features that eventually made their way into the CLR and the production languages VB and C# .
That is not to say people have not been using F# for production work in its own right .
In order to provide a richer environment for writing F# based applications , Robert Pickering has been working on integrating F# into # Develop .
# Develop is an open source IDE inspired by Visual Studio and designed with managed code in mind .
The first step was to create a MSBuild provider .
Robert based his on MonoCompilerTask .
Provided by # Develop , this class provides an interface between command line compilers and MSBuild .
Next was the # Develop plug - in itself .
Features that alpha version supports include
Code Colouring

Could this be the prettiest ballgirl in tennis history ?
Hugo Boss would certainly like us to think so .
Showing off her ever - ready ball skills , this catwalk beauty was just one of a team of trained adult models appearing at the Madrid Masters in Spain .
Scroll down for more ...
The ATP tournament hosted some of the greats of the tennis circuit - Rafael Nadal , Carlos Moya , and Manolo Santana .
But unlike other tennis championships around the world , in Madrid the tennis stars come second .
Scroll down for more ...
Here it is the model ballgirls - all clad in pink and blue outfits emblazoned with Hugo Boss - who draw the crowds .
Despite drawing the ire of Spanish government officials , equality groups and even American hero Andre Agassi , the marketing stunt looks set to stay .
Not that this year 's testosterone - fuelled male tennis stars seemed to mind .
Of my 12 brothers and sisters , four are full siblings .
They were my best friends , my companions and my world .
We fought like regular children , but we bonded together as outcasts in our town , enduring the taunts and stares of other kids who made fun of our strange Little House on the Prairie clothing and funny braided hairstyles .
I still recall the pain of hearing them yell " Polyg ! Polyg ! " ( slang for anyone who came from a polygamous family ) as I walked down the street , but having my siblings with me made it easier to bear .
I have fond memories of cuddling together with my sisters and whispering late into the night .
My father repeatedly reminded all his daughters to " keep sweet , " but that sugary fundamentalist slogan carried bitter implications .
In order to keep sweet , you could never admit to emotions such as jealousy , anger or uncertainty .
The key to living the Principle was unquestioning obedience .
Never question Father .
Do as he says .
Never question the Prophet .
When I was a child , the Prophet for the FLDS was Leroy Johnson .
We called him Uncle Roy .
He was a frail but animated old man who prophesied that he'd live until Christ 's second coming — and then he'd be literally lifted up to heaven .
If I kept sweet , he explained , I 'd be taken with him .
So I tried — I kept my questions to myself , prayed every day and did my best not to disappoint my elders .
Then , in 1986 , Uncle Roy died and my world fell apart .
He was 98 ; I was 15 .
" Why did Uncle Roy die ? " I asked my father .
My father responded that the Prophet was weary of our sinful ways .
" But did n't he promise us that he would live until the second coming ? " I wanted to know .
" How can you trust the Prophet if he does n't keep his promise ? "
Enough questions , I was told .
We must trust Uncle Rulon , our new Prophet .
He is God 's mouthpiece .
But I refused to place my faith in Rulon Jeffs , an imposing gray - haired old man .
Where Uncle Roy had been loving and gentle , Rulon seemed gruff and stern .
He banned the dances and sporting events that had brought the community together .
Disheartened by these changes , I no longer accepted the aspects of the Principle that did n't make sense to me .
Why did the Heavenly Father require men to have three wives in order to get into heaven ?
Why were women required to share their husbands , but not the other way around ?
Why did the Prophet need more than 50 wives ?
Increasingly , as I stitched my dress , I felt as if the needle were piercing my heart and soul .
Who would stand beside me when I wore it ?
Would I be his first wife , his second or his third ?
Nobody could answer me .
My fate had yet to be decided .
Angering my elders
My siblings and I attended the private Alta Academy in Sandy , Utah .
The school was led by the Prophet 's son , a tall lanky man named Warren Jeffs .
Warren taught math , history and church history and led devotionals every morning .
Some of our lessons were slightly modified versions of the truth .
We were taught that man had never landed on the moon ; it was all a staged show similar to the movie Capricorn One .
Why teach us this strange fiction ?
Maybe because FLDS members believe that after death , worthy men may become the gods of their own planets ; it threatened the order of things if non-Mormon astronauts could visit the moon .
Warren constantly warned us about the wickedness of this world : " I want to say to you young people : Leave television alone .
Do away with videos .
Do away with headphones and listening to radio .
Hard metallic music is the devil , " he said .
Righteousness , he preached , meant wearing long underwear even in the blazing hot summer months .
We girls were made to dress like women on a wagon train heading west and were constantly being groomed for marriage .
" Learn how to keep a house , behead a chicken and cook it up for your husband ! "
Warren demanded .
THE last eco-warrior to win the Nobel peace prize , Wangari Maathai ( a tree - planting conservationist who won in 2004 ) , was barely known outside her native Kenya .
Al Gore is a flashier shade of green .
His trophy cabinet is already bulging — the Nobel medal will have to jostle for space with an Oscar and an Emmy , all won this year .
His political career has probably attracted more attention than that of any other living non-president .
Billions watched the drama of Bush v Gore unfold in 2000 .
So last week 's announcement in Norway has naturally ignited speculation that Mr Gore will mount another bid for the White House .
Do n't hold your breath .
As Mr Gore well knows , running for president is not much fun .
You have to make small talk with thousands of people you do n't know .
You are attacked often , viciously and sometimes unfairly .
And you have to forgo that comforting extra scoop of ice - cream .
Why would Mr Gore re-subject himself to such an ordeal ?
Currently , as the prophet of the planet 's most fashionable cause — preventing climate change — he is showered with adulation wherever he goes .
The more the world recoils from George Bush , the more it embraces the man he beat ( or did n't , if you believe some diehard Gorephiles ) .
Mr Gore advocated tackling global warming and staying out of Iraq before either cause was popular in America .
Foreigners love him .
So do Democrats .
But were he to heed the 200,000 petitioners who have signed up at www.draftgore.com, he would lose his saintly aura .
He would have to raise money and trash his opponents again ( it was he who first attacked Michael Dukakis for freeing violent jailbirds for the weekend ) .
His tendency to over - dramatise the likely consequences of climate change — will the oceans rise by two feet or 20 ? — would be ruthlessly pilloried .
Worst of all , he would probably lose again .
A Gallup poll taken after the Nobel announcement found that if he ran for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton would thrash him by 30 points and Barack Obama would pip him by five .
Only 48 % of Democrats said they wanted him to run —six points less than seven months ago .
Mr Gore has repeatedly , though not absolutely definitively , said he is not planning to run , and did so quite firmly again this week .
The chances must now be remote that he will change his mind .
Far more likely is that Mr Gore will carry on as before , agitating from outside the political system for America to emit less carbon .
He may succeed .
The Senate will soon consider a bill , co-sponsored by Mr Gore 's former running mate , Joe Lieberman , to set up a cap - and - trade system for greenhouse - gas emissions .
Similar proposals are working their way through the House of Representatives .
If both arms of Congress present Mr Bush with a cap - and - trade bill , he may well sign it .
If none of this happens before next year 's election , it will probably do so afterwards .
Turning up the heat
Public opinion is shifting .
The proportion of Americans who say they worry “ a great deal ” about global warming has risen from 28 % to 41 % in the past four years .
Over the same period , the proportion favouring “ immediate , drastic action ” to protect the environment has risen from 23 % to 38 % .
How much of this is due to Mr Gore is impossible to say .
Others crunched the numbers ( including the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , with which he shared the Nobel ) .
Hurricane Katrina , some reckon , did more than Mr Gore to make Americans fear global warming .
( Illogically , since one storm proves nothing . )
And Mr Gore 's political past sometimes hinders his message .
Granted , many Americans take him more seriously because he used to be vice - president .
But others dismiss him because he was part of an administration that often twisted the truth .
Nearly half of Republicans think the environment is in good shape ; only 9 % of Democrats agree .
Despite all these caveats , Mr Gore has surely helped to pave the way for American action against climate change .
American voters are hardly demanding such action — only 2 % say that climate change is one of the most important issues they will take into account when voting next year .
But all the main Democratic candidates favour a cap - and - trade system .
They also favour auctioning the emissions permits rather than giving them away .
Mr Obama uses religious language to make the case , arguing that “ we are not acting as good stewards of God 's earth . ”
On the Republican side , John McCain has long pushed for cap - and - trade .
His main rivals have not so far felt pressed by their Republican electorate to say much about it .
But whoever clinches the nomination will be forced to take a stance .
Besides Mr Gore , however , no plausible candidate of either party favours a carbon tax , the most efficient way to tackle emissions .
( Chris Dodd , a Democrat , does , but he surely wo n't win . )
Voters prefer solutions that are either cheap or that they think will be paid for by someone else .
A poll for the New Scientist magazine in June tried to quantify this , with sobering results .
Only half of Americans would favour rules to force power companies to emit less if that raised their monthly electricity bill from $ 85 ( the average in 2005 ) to $ 155 ( an estimate of the hike needed to lower American emissions by 5 % by 2020 ) .
And only 37 % could stomach a tax that raised petrol ( gasoline ) prices to $ 4 a gallon .
That would be an unprecedented hardship for Americans but barely half what the stuff now costs in Britain .
This is why Mr Gore talks more bluntly now than he ever did on the campaign trail , and why no serious presidential contender echoes him .
You cannot win the White House by telling Americans that they must pay more to drive , or by telling Midwestern coalminers that their industry must clean up or die .
But if candidates do not prepare America for the cost of tackling climate change , the next president will have no mandate to impose it .
Now that 's an inconvenient truth .
On Friday 's " Hardball " CNBC 's Erin Burnett spoke with Chris Matthews about the current instability in the U.S. economy and Burnett had these choice words to say about China :
Download Download ( h/t Jane )
" A lot of people like to say , uh , scaremonger about China , right ?
A lot of politicians , and I know you talk about that issue all the time .
I think people should be careful what they wish for on China .
Ya know , if China were to revalue it 's currency or China is to start making say , toys that do n't have lead in them or food that is n't poisonous , their costs of production are going to go up and that means prices at Wal - Mart here in the United States are going to go up too .
So , I would say China is our greatest friend right now , they 're keeping prices low and they 're keeping the prices for mortgages low , too . "
Burnett makes a valid point , if China were to revalue it 's currency we'd be screwed -- so we should just keep our traps shut , let our children gnaw on lead coated toys and eat potentially lethal food so the Walton family does n't lose money ?
I realize it's a much deeper issue than that , but she probably should have used different analogies to get her point across .
Speaking of Wal - Mart , if you have n't yet seen Robert Greenwald 's documentary , Wal - Mart : The High Cost of Low Price , you can pick up a copy here .
It 'll make you think twice about setting foot in a Wal - Mart again ...
In this account , to Friedman and his acolytes , all the world ’s an experimental lab in which , to quote Klein , " Bush ’s exploits merely represent the monstrously violent and creative culmination of a fifty - year campaign for total corporate liberation . "
As she describes early in the book CIA - funded Canadian experiments in dismantling an individual ’s personality to create a clean slate , a sick feeling grows : one knows where this story is going , it ’s going to applied to whole societies and the results are n’t going to be pretty .
What Friedman and his technocratic / corporatist allies realized was that like an individual , a society that suffers a trauma — a natural disaster , an economic meltdown , a political upheaval — is initially so stressed in its wake that if ideologues move quickly enough , they can ram through " reforms " at what amounts to the political speed of light .
Ergo , " the Shock Doctrine , " with its ruthless privatization of formerly public property , elimination of social programs , busting up of worker groups , and the suspension of minimum wage laws .
" Crises are , in a way , " Klein writes , " democracy - free zones — gaps in politics as usual when the need for consent and consensus do not seem to apply . "
Of course , people eventually begin to recover from the seminal event and even the layers of free - market strangulation can’t seem to keep them down .
And as they recover , they rebel .
And when they rebel ... carnage ensues .
Just as there is no kind , gentle way to occupy people against their determined will , there is no peaceful way to take away from millions of citizens what they need to live with dignity — which is what the Chicago Boys were determined to do .
Robbery , whether of land or a way of life , requires force or at least its credible threat ; it ’s why thieves carry guns , and often use them .
Torture is sickening , but it is often a highly rational way to achieve a specific goal ; indeed , it may be the only way to achieve those goals .
Which raises the deeper question , one that so many were incapable of asking at the time in Latin America .
Is neoliberalism an inherently violent ideology , and is there something about its goals that demands this cycle of brutal political cleansing , followed by human rights cleanup operations ?
There is more than a whiff of sociopathology in the technocrats described in Klein ’s sweeping account , as they advise , tinker , pillage and plunder their way first through Latin America , then expand to Indonesia and Poland and Russia and South Africa , and ultimately turn their eyes upon the American adventure in Iraq ... and then bring it home to New Orleans .
The decade upon decade of fine - tuning how much death and how much misery a society can take and still be profitable is described in excruciating detail .
The human lives are discarded , the indignities and suppressions that ca n’t be entered into a spreadsheet are discounted — unless they can be used as individual lessons to the populace that everyone better get in line , pronto :
All Argentines were in some way enlisted as witnesses to the erasure of their fellow citizens , yet most people claimed not to know what was going on .
There is a phrase Argentines use to describe the paradox of wide - eyed knowing and eyes - closed terror that was the dominant state of mind in those years ; " We did not know what nobody could deny . " **
Of course , all interrogation is purportedly about gaining valuable information and therefore forcing betrayal , but many prisoners report that their torturers were far less interested in the information , which they usually already possessed , than in achieving the act of betrayal itself .
The point of the exercise was getting prisoners to do irreparable damage to that part of themselves that believed in helping others above all else , that part of themselves that made them activists , replacing it with shame and humiliation .
Every place the shock doctrine has been imposed , it has failed , even on its own economic terms .
It has yet to yield the free - market paradise promised ; interest rates soar ever higher , currency crashes , even greedy provincial elites who think they ’re going to strike it rich usually end up at the bottom of the multi-national corporation heap .
Undaunted , the free - market fundies insist that every failure is due to the " interference " of maintaining even the smallest strand of a traditional safety net imaginable .
No state has proven — yet — to be willing to erase in the necessary radical fashion every vestige of commonly held public resources or government payout or protection in some form .
Iraq comes closest to the ideal , Klein maintains , and we all know what a cheerful economic experiment that has turned out to be :
The weak public present and the robust corporate one reflected the fact that the Bush cabinet was using Iraq ’s reconstruction ( over which it had complete control , in contrast to the federal bureaucracy back home ) to implement its vision of a fully outsourced , hollow government .
In Iraq , there was not a single governmental function that was considered so " core " that it could not be handed to a contractor , preferably one who provided the Republican Party with financial contributions or Christian foot soldiers during election campaigns .
The usual Bush motto governed all aspects of the foreign forces ’ involvement in Iraq : if a task could be performed by a private entity , it must be .
This entire book is ripe with full - throated , rich metaphors , followed fearlessly to their logical ends .
The image of the frontier .
The psyche .
The Rapture .
The hollow men at the hollow core , selling off pieces of shared civilization , piece by piece .
As Klein brings the disaster capitalism model home to the streets of New Orleans , turf wars with public agencies and charities begin , with no -bid contracts at stake behind the scenes :
" The companies at the heart of the disaster capitalism complex increasingly regard both the state and nonprofits as competitors — from the corporate perspective , whenever governments or charities fulfill their traditional roles , they are denying contractors work that could be performed at a profit . "
There ’s a danger when reading a work of this sort to become overwhelmed by the magnitude of the battle ; helplessness can set in when few suggestions are given on specifically how to roll back the changes of 30 years .
Klein ’s book is clearly meant to be more descriptive than prescriptive , an opening challenge to consider alternative ways to organize more economically and socially just societies — and not necessarily to serve as a cure - all for how to do so .
Still , the final chapter explores some tentative resistance measures in Latin America and Indonesia that hold promise , most founded on the principle of going " off the grid " of IMF - based loans and other corporate - backed restructuring schemes .
Some cases are cited of the underdog Latin American governments helping each other with law enforcement , trade agreements and loans ; the previous targeted victims are beginning to explore the limits of using their smaller resources to pool together for regional strength and to beat back the predators that view their geographical assets and populations as exploitable free game .
The Shock Doctrine is a magnificent achievement on every level : beautifully written , intellectually engaging , paradigm challenging , thorough and haunting .
It deserves a place as a defining book of this decade — when we all began to slowly wake up and see clearly what ’s been done to the world ... largely in America ’s name .
And you come to realize just what conditions these powerful forces need to perpetuate in order to continue their global pillage :
Dirt Is n’t So Cheap After All
By Stephen Leahy
Aug 30 ( IPS ) – Soil erosion is the “ silent global crisis ” that is undermining food production and water availability , as well as being responsible for 30 percent of the greenhouse gases driving climate change .
“ We are overlooking soil as the foundation of all life on Earth , ” said Andres Arnalds , assistant director of the Icelandic Soil Conservation Service .
“ Soil and vegetation is being lost at an alarming rate around the globe , which in turn has devastating effects on food production and accelerates climate change , ” Arnalds told IPS from Selfoss , Iceland , host city of the International Forum on Soils , Society and Climate Change which starts Friday .
Along with many other international partner institutions , Iceland is marking the centenary of its Soil Conservation Service by convening this forum of experts .
Every year , some 100,000 square kilometres of land loses its vegetation and becomes degraded or turns into desert .
“ Land degradation and desertification may be regarded as the silent crisis of the world , a genuine threat to the future of humankind , ” Arnalds said .
Food production has kept pace with population growth by increasing 50 percent between 1980 and 2000 .
But it is an open question whether there will be enough food in 2050 with an estimated three billion more mouths to feed .
That means more food has to be produced within the next 50 years than during the last 10,000 years combined he noted .
“ Global food production per hectare is already declining , ” said Zafar Adeel , director of the United Nations University ’s Canadian - based International Network on Water , Environment and Health .
There are a number of reasons for this decline , including the fact that soil degradation is producing growing shortages of water .
Soil and vegetation act as a sponge that holds and gradually releases water , Adeel explained .
The newest challenge to food production and conserving land and water resources is the boom in vegetable - based biofuels , says Andrew Campbell , Australia ’s first National Landcare Facilitator .
“ Soils are under greater pressure than ever before , ” Campbell said in an interview .
“ Governments around the world are subsidising crops to produce biofuels . ”

Popular Girls
Susie , second from right , was probably the most popular girl in school .
( She did have two legs ; she 's just standing strangely . )
Lisa , far left , went to Gateway for a year between prep schools .
She seemed out of place , in a good way .
She did n't believe in big hair , and was known to have read books .
Tough Guys
The tough guys in my high school were pretty scary .
Fortunately , by this time I hardly ever ran into them .
A friend of mine who went to a good east coast high school looked at this picture and said " this looks like a picture from prison . "
And yet I believe my school was above average , statistically .
Mr. Gateway
If kids in my school had spent as much time studying math as they did lifting weights , we could have run our own Manhattan Project in house .
I lifted weights too .
I started at about fifteen , mostly to protect myself .
By the time I graduated I could bench press around 200 .
It was kind of fun , actually .
Valedictorian ( Almost )
Here 's my friend Rich in gym class .
He would have been valedictorian , but came second on a technicality .
Rich wrote large parts of Mach and is now a fairly big cheese at Microsoft .
Believe it or not , he later took up rowing , and is now an avid mountain climber .
Pep Rally
Football is taken very seriously in Western Pennsylvania .
When I entered high school , the quarterback of our rival Central Catholic was Dan Marino .
Looking at this picture now , what I notice is the uniformity .
The same clothes , the same hair , the same facial expressions , the same gestures .
Chess Club
That 's me , top left .
How unhappy we all look .
Well , we probably were unhappy .
The kind of things we were interested in did n't count for much in our high school .
Jonathan Yedidia , lower left , later became a professional chess player .
It was not so much a question of whether he would win as how many pieces he would spot you .
A Great Teacher
Doc Schultz was a great teacher .
His class felt like a college class .
What was he doing in our school ?
( I was alarmed to hear from several friends that they thought I 'd made this page as a joke .
So let me state explicitly , all these pictures are scanned from my junior - year high school yearbook .
Yes , my high school had bodybuilding contests ; yes , that muscular guy was a high school student , and not the only one who looked like that ; yes , Dan Marino was the quarterback of our high school rival ; and yes , that is me in the upper left in the chess club . )

Council for a Livable World released today a statement responding to this weekâ€™s congressional testimony by General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker .
President Bush is expected to endorse Petraeus and Crockerâ€™s policy recommendations in a prime time speech later this evening .
The statement was authored by former Senator Gary Hart , Lieutenant General Robert Gard ( USA , ret. ) , and Brigadier General John Johns ( USA , ret . ) .
Hart serves as Chairman of Council for a Livable World , Gard is a Senior Military Fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation , and Johns is a Council board member .
In response to General Petraeusâ€™s report of military progress in Iraq , the authors write :
â€ œThe series of recent reports on the situation in Iraq add up to only one clear conclusion : while there has been some limited success in recent months , there is little if any prospect of resolving the insurgency anytime in the next decade , if not longer.â€ 
To those who point to potential disasters if the United States withdraws from Iraq , the authors respond :
â€ œThe situation in Iraq already is a disaster , both for the American military and for Iraqi civilians .
Continued engagement in Iraq 's civil war distracts the United States from our more urgent missions in Afghanistan and enhanced homeland security , stretches the U.S. military to the breaking point , inflicts psychological scars on returning veterans and breaks up their families , causes mounting American casualties , increases the drain on the U.S. treasury , and erodes our stature in the world .â€ 
The presence of American forces is worsening the situation in Iraq , according to Hart , Gard , and Johns .
â€œThe uncertain future of Iraq cannot be accurately addressed while the primary problem remains uncorrected .
As long as the United States remains , nothing can be resolved .â€ 
â€ œIt is time to put a conclusion to this sad adventure and to withdraw American forces in an orderly but expeditious manner , â€ the authors conclude .

Linux users want two things for their hardware : drivers ; and easy access to those drivers .
The first is finally happening ; and now , thanks to a Dell Linux project called DKMS ( Dynamic Kernel Module Support ) , the other is on its way .
Dell and Linux distributors have been working on DKMS for about five years now .
Its purpose is to create a framework where kernel - dependent module source can reside , so that it is very easy to rebuild modules .
In turn , this enables Linux distributors and driver developers to create driver drops without having to wait for new kernel releases .
For users , all this makes it easier to get up - to - the - minute drivers without hand compiling device drivers .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Pay comparisons almost always leave someone feeling dwarfed , and none more so than the CEO - to - worker pay gap .
But even CEOs have reason to feel seriously dwarfed these days , thanks to the outsized paychecks of private equity and hedge fund managers .
The average CEO of a large U.S. company made roughly $ 10.8 million last year , or 364 times that of U.S. full - time and part - time workers , who made an average of $ 29,544 , according to a joint analysis released Wednesday by the liberal Institute for Policy Studies and United for a Fair Economy .
Quiz
Take the quiz
Do you deserve a raise ?
Before asking , know your strengths and weaknesses .
1 . If you left the company , how easy or hard would it be for the company to replace you ?
Easy Hard
This quiz is adapted from Are You Paid What You 're Worth ? , by Michael O'Malley ( Broadway Books , $ 15 ) .
That gap is down from 411 times in 2005 and well - below the record high of 525 times recorded in 2000 .
But the comparison is n't exactly apples - to - apples , in part because IPS and UFE changed how they measured CEO options pay this year .
The IPS and UFE pay - gap numbers are also wider than some other measures of CEO - to - worker pay because they count both full - time and part - time workers in their calculations , which effectively lowers workers ' average pay due to fewer hours worked .
If you just consider the average compensation ( wages plus benefits ) of full - time year - round workers in non-managerial jobs - roughly $ 40,000 - CEO pay is more like 270 times bigger than the average Joe's .
That 's still a far cry from days gone by .
In 1989 , for instance , U.S. CEOs of large companies earned 71 times more than the average worker , according to the Economic Policy Institute .
The IPS / UFE report also compared U.S. CEO pay to that of leaders in other fields and other countries .
The top 20 CEOs of U.S. companies made an average of $ 36.4 million in 2006 .
That 's 204 times that of the 20 highest paid U.S. military generals , and 38 times that of the 20 highest - paid non -profit leaders .
They also made three times more than the top 20 CEOs of European companies who had booked higher sales numbers than their U.S. counterparts .
The pay gap numbers do n't include the value of the many perks CEOs receive , which averaged $ 438,342 , according to the report .
Nor do they include the pension benefits CEOs receive .
But even including all that , CEO pay can look like chump change next to private equity and hedge fund managers ' pay .
Those managers made an average of $ 657.5 million in 2006 - more than 16,000 times what the average full - time worker makes , and roughly 61 times that of the average CEO .
The enormous rise in executive pay in recent years has gotten a lot of attention in the press , the boardroom and around the Beltway .
The Securities and Exchange Commission has instituted greater pay disclosure rules .
There is legislation proposed that would give shareholders greater say on pay decisions .
And lawmakers have been holding hearings to assess whether to raise the taxes on a portion of private equity and hedge fund managers ' compensation .
Blogging in Haskell
Yesterday , I finally decided to figure out syntax highlighting for Haskell in my blog .
I ended up finding two different ways to do it , so I ’ll describe both of them , along with links to the ( small bits of ) code that I ended up writing in the process to help out .
Attempt 1 : The Star - Light Approach
The first approach is to use Dean Edwards ’ star - light JavaScript / CSS library .
This is a nice piece of client - side JavaScript and CSS that syntax highlights your source code for you , in a variety of languages .
All you have to do is enclose it in a tag like < pre class= " javascript " > or < pre class = " php " > .
The CSS file ( which you also need to reference from your page ) takes care of invoking some JavaScript code that scours your page and does the syntax highlighting on the client .
Unfortunately , Dean Edward ’s code does n’t do Haskell by default .
So I wrote the code to do it , and you can download a modified version of star - light here .
It was n’t terribly difficult , but neither is my code very elegant .
It mostly works , though .
Limitations that I know about are listed in the comments at the beginning of star - hs.js , and include poor handling of nested comments , “ gaps ” in string literals , and non-ASCII characters , and some overly excessive highlighting of Prelude symbols and the pseudo - keywords as , qualified , and hiding when they should be left alone .
Star - Light : Advantages
Very little effort on your part .
Support for several different languages .
Client - side programming is all the rage !
Star - Light Disadvantages
Uses non-standard CSS extensions , so limited portability .
You have to trust my code . :)
The parser is based on regular expressions , so it ’s ultimately hopeless for Haskell .
In the end , though , neither of these is the reason that I did n’t end up using star - light for syntax highlighting .
I did n’t use it because the blogging host I ’m using , WordPress , strips any “ dangerous ” stuff out of CSS and bans JavaScript from their blogs .
They claim it ’s a security risk for them .
I ’m a little worried , and you should be too , that a very popular blog platform believes that their security validly depends on client - side behavior .
I ’d be even more worried if I thought they might be right .
Ah well ; given the chance to choose again , I ’d have avoided WordPress for a blog , but it ’s a little late for that now .
Off to my second attempt …
Attempt 2 : HsColour +
Plugin
Having given up on client - side syntax highlighting , I turned to the obvious choice for server - side implementation : HsColour .
This nifty little project specializes in syntax highlighting Haskell , and can output HTML .
If only it were a little easier to use when writing a blog entry …
I write my blog entries using Windows Live Writer .
While I ’m not at all addicted to it , it ’s a nice alternative to the web - based editors in conventional blogs , and it does n’t have the tendency to freeze up randomly that characterizes WordPress ’s built - in editor .
( Did I mention that I ’d never start a blog with WordPress again ?
I thought so . )
It also has a plug - in interface , so I built a simple plug - in that asks for a block of code , runs it through HsColour , and sticks the result into a < pre > block in the blog .
Wanting to do the same for inline code fragments , I added a second plugin to ask for a line of code and put it into HTML < code > tags .
The plugin can be found here as a DLL file , which you can just drop into the plugins directory underneath Windows Live Writer ’s installation directory to install it .
You ’ll need HsColour installed and in your path .
If you want the source code , look here .
This plugin calls HsColour with the CSS option , so you ’ll need to add a CSS stylesheet to define your syntax highlighting styles .
Alternatively , you could edit the plugin to use - html instead .
( WordPress , for example , charges extra for writing a CSS file even with their “ security ” limitations ; did I mention I ’d never start another blog with them ? )
If you choose CSS , you ’ll need styles for the selectors .
keyword , . keyglyph , .layout , .comment , .conid , .varid , .conop , .varop , .str , .chr , and .num .
The only confusing one is . layout , which I initially assumed had something to do with omitting squiggly braces .
It turns out it ’s just more reserved symbols and should probably be set to the same thing as . keyglyph .
HsColour + Plugin : Advantages
Result works on all browsers with basic CSS support .
The planet .haskell.org server has ( boring ) HsColour CSS entries , so it works there !
HsColour is probably better at correctly parsing the language .
HsColour + Plugin : Disadvantages
Only Haskell works ; other techniques needed for other languages .
My plugin only works on this one piece of blog writing software .
Attempt 2.5 : Another Loose End
Another annoying thing about WordPress is that their blog software converts normal old everyday quote characters to “ smart quotes ” .
This is merely annoying for regular text , but it ’s absolutely fatal for source code .
( Did I mention I ’d never start another blog with WordPress ? )
One more quick change produces a half - fix for this .
You should only need this if you are using WordPress as well .
The idea is to hide quotes from the WordPress code - mangler by writing unnecessary HTML entities .
Adding the appropriate HTML escape codes ( which WordPress wo n’t let me write , but are an ampersand , followed by # , followed by either 39 or 34 , followed by a semicolon ) at line 79 of HsColour ’s HTML .hs does the trick .
This sort of fixes the problem .
Unfortunately , Windows Live Writer helpfully notices that these entity tags are not needed , and converts them back to spaces for me every once in a while .
For the time being , my strategy for solving this is to be vigilant .
If you notice a problem with smart quotes in source code in my blog , just say so and I ’ll try to fix it .
That ’s all I ’ve got .
Hope it was helpful .

In Illinois , Obama dealt with lobbyists
But as candidate , he faults Clinton for ties Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama spoke at a rally Thursday in Atlanta .
Obama has tried to distinguish himself from rival Hillary Clinton by criticizing her ties to lobbyists .
( JOHN BAZEMORE / ASSOCIATED PRESS )
When Barack Obama and fellow state lawmakers in Illinois tried to expand healthcare coverage in 2003 with the " Health Care Justice Act , " they drew fierce opposition from the insurance industry , which saw it as a back - handed attempt to impose a government - run system .
Over the next 15 months , insurers and their lobbyists found a sympathetic ear in Obama , who amended the bill more to their liking partly because of concerns they raised with him and his aides , according to lobbyists , Senate staff , and Obama 's remarks on the Senate floor .
The wrangling over the healthcare measure , which narrowly passed and became law in 2004 , illustrates how Obama , during his eight years in the Illinois Senate , was able to shepherd major legislation by negotiating competing interests in Springfield , the state capital .
But it also shows how Obama 's own experience in lawmaking involved dealings with the kinds of lobbyists and special interests he now demonizes on the campaign trail .
Obama has tried to distinguish himself from rival Hillary Clinton by criticizing her ties to lobbyists and special interests , and , unlike her , refusing to take contributions from federal lobbyists and political action committees .
But Clinton supporters say she has been more honest than Obama - including on the healthcare plan she released last week - in acknowledging that industry deserves a role .
" Senator Clinton has learned along the way the importance of both listening to those who are in the field as well as listening to the concerns of the consumer , " said Sylvia Larsen , the New Hampshire Senate president and a Clinton backer .
Obama " seems to have forgotten the importance of hearing from all sides . "
Obama spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Obama 's overall experience in Springfield was that lobbyists and special interests wielded too much power , not that they should have no voice in lawmaking .
Psaki said Obama had worked with disparate interests to pass many important bills , including not just the Health Care Justice
Act but a sweeping ethics overhaul that became the first major change in Illinois campaign finance law in 25 years .
" Barack Obama 's experience with this bill and also with his leadership on the ethics reform bill , which he also helped pass in the state Senate , showed him that real change comes not by dividing but by bringing people together to get things done , " Psaki said .
The Health Care Justice Act , which Obama sponsored in the state Senate , grew out of work done by the Campaign for Better Health Care , an Illinois coalition of healthcare advocates , labor unions , and nonprofit organizations .
The ostensible goal was simple : make affordable healthcare available to all Illinoisans .
But the politics were anything but simple .
On one side were healthcare advocates , eager to capitalize on the Democrats having won control of the General Assembly and the governor 's office .
On the other were most insurers , who worked vigorously to sink the bill .
Obama was in the middle , trying to reconcile a range of agendas to get a viable plan signed into law .
The bill originally called for a " Bipartisan Health Care Reform Commission " to implement a program reaching all 12.4 million Illinois residents .
The legislation would have made it official state policy to ensure that all residents could access " quality healthcare at costs that are reasonable . "
Insurers feared that language would result in a government takeover of healthcare , even though the bill did not explicitly say that .
By the time the legislation passed the Senate , in May 2004 , Obama had written three successful amendments , at least one of which made key changes favorable to insurers .
Most significant , universal healthcare became merely a policy goal instead of state policy - the proposed commission , renamed the Adequate Health Care Task Force , was charged only with studying how to expand healthcare access .
In the same amendment , Obama also sought to give insurers a voice in how the task force developed its plan .
Lobbyists praised Obama for taking the insurance industry 's concerns into consideration .
" Barack is a very reasonable person who clearly recognized the various roles involved in the healthcare system , " said Phil Lackman , a lobbyist for insurance agents and brokers .
Obama " understood our concern that we did n't want a predetermined outcome . "
In one attempt at a deal , Obama approached the Campaign for Better Health Care with insurers ' concerns , asking if the group would consider a less stringent mandate than requiring the state to come up with a universal healthcare plan .
The coalition decided not to bend , said Jim Duffett , the group 's executive director .
" The concept of the Health Care Justice Act was to bring the sides - the different perspectives and stakeholders - to the table , " Duffett said .
" In this situation , Obama was being a conduit from the insurance industry to us . "
Obama later watered down the bill after hearing from insurers and after a legal precedent surfaced during the debate indicating that it would be unconstitutional for one legislative assembly to pass a law requiring a future legislative assembly to craft a healthcare plan .
During debate on the bill on May 19 , 2004 , Obama portrayed himself as a conciliatory figure .
He acknowledged that he had " worked diligently with the insurance industry , " as well as Republicans , to limit the legislation 's reach and noted that the bill had undergone a " complete restructuring " after industry representatives " legitimately " raised fears that it would result in a single - payer system .
" The original presentation of the bill was the House version that we radically changed - we radically changed - and we changed in response to concerns that were raised by the insurance industry , " Obama said , according to the session transcript .
During debate over the Health Care Justice Act , Obama also attacked the insurers , accusing the industry of " fear - mongering " by claiming , even after he made changes they wanted , that the bill would lead to a government takeover .
Still , Obama 's willingness to hear out insurers and their lobbyists is revealing given the posture he strikes today on the presidential campaign trail - that lobbyists , insurance companies , and other big - industry special interests have an outsized and polluting influence on policy - making in Washington .
In a new television ad his campaign unveiled last week , Obama says that cynics " do n't believe we can limit the power of lobbyists who block our progress , or that we can trust the American people with the truth .
. . .
In 20 years of public service , I 've brought Democrats and Republicans together to solve problems that touch the lives of everyday people .
I 've taken on the drug and insurance companies and won . "
And yet while serving in Illinois , Obama was willing to accept campaign contributions from lobbyists .
Obama 's state Senate campaign committee accepted contributions from insurance companies and their lobbyists - including $ 1,000 from the Professional Independent Insurance Agents PAC in June 2003 , and $ 1,000 from the Illinois Insurance PAC in December 2003 - while the Health Care Justice Act was wending its way through the Illinois General Assembly .
Obama also collected money from the insurance industry and its lobbyists for his successful US Senate campaign in 2004 .
Obama 's campaign has said that his position on accepting such contributions has evolved and that he decided not to accept them for his presidential campaign after seeing how much influence lobbyists had in Washington during his first two years in the Senate .
The Illinois task force eventually released its healthcare recommendations , including the Illinois mandate that all residents be covered .
But Governor Rod Blagojevich has since come out with his own proposal to expand coverage , and the governor and lawmakers are now wrangling over how to proceed .
Some who worked on the bill say Obama recognized then that lobbyists and industry play an integral role in shaping legislation .
" At the end of the day , " said Kim Maisch , Illinois state director for the National Federation of Independent Business , " he realized that if he wanted to pass something , you have to work " with lobbyists .

This IS NOT speculation on what we ’ll see on Sept. 5th .
This weekend I was thinking about the NBC vs .
Apple thing , after explaining it to relatives , and a thought occurred to me …
There has been long standing rumor and speculation that Apple would turn the AppleTV into a DVR .
At the time , that never made sense to me…it would do nothing but infuriate the networks that Apple is hoping to keep appeased .
However , with Universal ’s continued antagonism towards Apple and vice versa , it ’s not going to be long before SOMEONE has to give .
Steve Jobs has never been very good at that .
If NBC does jump ship , I think it ’s safe to say that sales of other shows will be affected as well , because once people get used to going to Bittorrent ( and I do firmly believe that people will be driven to Bittorrent before they are driven to hulu.com or any other asinine service NBC can dream up ) , they ’re going to keep using it .
I do n’t think everyone will abandon iTunes by any means , but I think Apple can expect a huge sales loss in the video department of the iTunes store without NBC .
If that happens , the other networks are likely to get upset .
If they do … what solution does Apple have to keep content on their iPods ?
Well … they could always go the DVR route … last time I checked DVRs were n’t illegal , and Dish Network and ( I believe ) others have set ups where you can download that content to other devices … so why could n’t Apple do this ?
Now , I do n’t know the ins and outs of the DMCA , so this may very well be a moot point – and if it is , somebody please point me to the parts of the DMCA that says they ca n’t do this … but if you can record onto a tape with a VCR , I do n’t see why Apple could n’t just record the programming off your local cable ( including a cable card in a new AppleTV model for those digital channels ) , and encode it in an iPod friendly format that could shoot itself right back to iTunes an onto your iPod ?
It seems like that would be a perfect way to keep the content coming for the iPods , and it ’s not like the networks did n’t get a chance to play nice … if they ultimately choose not too ( and of course , I ‘m not saying all of them will act like NBC , but you never know ) … would n’t this be a perfect solution ?
I mean , $ 300 for an Apple TV is cheaper than buying 3 seasons worth of any NBC show at the $ 4.99 they wanted to charge per episode this fall … right ?

New paradigms
It 's not often that one gets a chance to attend a demonstration of a new method of human - computer interaction .
Having been too young to witness the development of the command line in the 1950s or the modern graphical user interface at Xerox PARC in the 1970s , it was a genuine thrill to visit Microsoft 's campus for a personal demo of " surface computing . "
While future computer historians are unlikely to view this technology as being anywhere near as groundbreaking as the CLI or GUI , the multi - touch interface nonetheless serves as an innovative way of interacting with the personal computer .
Microsoft Surface has taken many years to come to fruition .
The original idea was developed in 2001 by employees at Microsoft Research and Microsoft Hardware , and it was nurtured towards reality by a team that included architect Nigel Keam .
Not content with merely coming up with a new idea , the Surface team is committed to actually releasing it to the commercial market as early as the end of 2007 .
From there , the team hopes that the product will make its way from retail and commercial establishments to the home , in much the same manner as large - screen plasma displays have migrated out of the stadium and into the living room over the past few years .
Microsoft began the Surface project back in 2001 , after the idea had already been proposed by employees in the Microsoft Research division .
For many years the work was hidden under a non-disclosure agreement .
Keam mentioned that , although necessary , the NDA made it frustrating when Microsoft scheduled the official Surface announcement just days after Apple announced the iPhone .
While both projects employ touch - sensitive screens with multi- touch capability , they are very different from each other , and the development timelines clearly show that neither was " copied " from the other .
As Keam put it : " I only wish I could work that fast ! "
Beyond creating the hardware , however , the Microsoft Surface team has identified several different scenarios where the device could be used in retail and commercial environments , and it has developed demonstration software that shows off the potential of the system .
Microsoft has partnered with several retail and entertainment companies and will be co-developing applications customized for these environments .
Let 's take a look .
The hardware
Senior marketing director Mark Bolger models Surface
Essentially , Microsoft Surface is a computer embedded in a medium - sized table , with a large , flat display on top that is touch - sensitive .
The software reacts to the touch of any object , including human fingers , and can track the presence and movement of many different objects at the same time .
In addition to sensing touch , the Microsoft Surface unit can detect objects that are labeled with small " domino " stickers , and in the future , it will identify devices via radio - frequency identification ( RFID ) tags .
The demonstration unit I used was housed in an attractive glass table about three feet high , with a solid base that hides a fairly standard computer equipped with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor , an AMI BIOS , 2 GB of RAM , and Windows Vista .
The team lead would not divulge which graphics card was inside , but they said that it was a moderately - powerful graphics card from either AMD / ATI or NVIDIA .
The display screen is a 4:3 rear - projected DLP display measuring 30 inches diagonally .
The screen resolution is a relatively modest 1024x768 , but the touch detection system had an effective resolution of 1280x960 .
Unlike the screen resolution , which for the time being is constant , the touch resolution varies according to the size of the screen used — it is designed to work at a resolution of 48 dots per inch .
The top layer also works as a diffuser , making the display clearly visible at any angle .
Unlike most touch screens , Surface does not use heat or pressure sensors to indicate when someone has touched the screen .
Instead , five tiny cameras take snapshots of the surface many times a second , similar to how an optical mouse works , but on a larger scale .
This allows Surface to capture many simultaneous touches and makes it easier to track movement , although the disadvantage is that the system cannot ( at the moment ) sense pressure .
Five cameras mounted beneath the table read objects and touches on the acrylic surface above , which is flooded with near - infrared light to make such touches easier to pick out .
The cameras can read a nearly infinite number of simultaneous touches and are limited only by processing power .
Right now , Surface is optimized for 52 touches , or enough for four people to use all 10 fingers at once and still have 12 objects sitting on the table .
( For more on the camera system and hardware , check out our launch coverage of the system ) .
The unit is rugged and designed to take all kinds of abuse .
Senior director of marketing Mark Bolger demonstrated this quite dramatically by slamming his hand onto the top of the screen as hard as he could — it made a loud thump , but the unit itself did n't move .
The screen is also water resistant .
At an earlier demonstration , a skeptical reporter tested this by pouring his drink all over the device .
Microsoft has designed the unit to put up with this kind of punishment because it envisions Surface being used in environments such as restaurants where hard impacts and spills are always on the menu .
The choice of a 4:3 screen was , according to Nigel Keam , mostly a function of the availability of light engines ( projectors ) when the project began .
Testing and user feedback have shown that the 4:3 ratio works well , and the addition of a slight amount of extra acrylic on each side leaves the table looking like it has normal dimensions .
Built - in wireless and Bluetooth round out the hardware capabilities of Surface .
A Bluetooth keyboard with a built - in trackpad is available to diagnose problems with the unit , although for regular use it is not required .
Maniacally grinning weirdos barging into your hotel room to shriek insanely at you , crank phone calls until all hours and incessant banging on the wall .
Normally if you experience these sorts of interruptions to a night 's sleep , you 've had the misfortune to book into an establishment also playing host to a stag party or touring rugby club .
But if subjecting yourself to this sort of nocturnal terror sounds more treat than trick , a stay in one of Alton Towers Hotel 's new Scare Rooms could be just the ticket .
It 's all in aid of Halloween , of course , a festival the theme park is enthusiastically embracing with a host of spooky activities on offer during its Scarefest .
Prices for a stay in a Scare Room start from £ 46 per person and the one thing guaranteed not to await those retiring for the night is a good kip .
The five rooms have been given a suitably ghoulish makeover with red lighting , ripped curtains and blood - stained walls .
Guests can also expect to find themselves tripping over gruesome props , including hideously mutilated soft toys and wooden stakes .
The latter could come in handy when warding off visitations from the assorted spectres and fiends that are the hellish highlights of this particular fright night .
These are , of course , actors and not genuine denizens of the underworld but , with a revolving cast including the grim reaper , knife - wielding maniacs , an evil clown and a very promising - sounding demonic butcher ( complete with slabs of rotten meat ) , these do sound a cut above the moth - eaten giant bears and rabbits usually found wandering unsteadily around theme parks .
If it sounds like your worst nightmare then you 're probably the sort of person who thinks the modern , commercial Halloween is a desperately crass American import on a par with McDonalds and Starbucks .
If , on the other ( severed ) hand , you thrill at the sight of a jack - o - lantern flickering in the frosty twilight and like nothing better than spending October 31 scaring yourself witless with Japanese horror films , then you might just have found your ideal weekend break .
£ 46 , after all , is a very reasonable rate for a hotel room and , if you pay that little anywhere else , you 're pretty much guaranteed wild grunting in the corridors and unexplained tapping on the window .
The reign of terror apparently stops at 2 am but either way , you 're likely to wake the next day with shredded nerves and a cadaverous appearance , which , I suppose , is the point .
Granted this is how most parents will look anyway after a day spent supervising their little darlings around a theme park but I suspect those with very small children wo n't be checking in .
Perhaps you think paying the best part of £ 50 to be harassed long into the night by jobbing actors sounds like hell - on - earth but I think a spot of light haunting followed by some intensive rollercoaster riding to blow away the cobwebs the next day sounds like a great alternative to your bog - standard hotel stay .

Is n't there a major debate going on about the war ?
Why was n't this comment by Gloria Borger from last night not the top of the top ?
Maybe on a political show --- telling your audience that Republicans are fuming at Bush for destroying the last shield ( or so they perceived ) they had on the Iraq war is a tad more important than this psycho .

transcript via CNN :
GLORIA BORGER , CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST :
Well , I think Republicans , many of whom are now critics of this war , were very willing to stand with General Petraeus .
There was a sense that the general did quite well in his testimony on Capitol Hill .
If you look at public opinion polls , the public trusts the generals to figure out what to do next in the war more than they do the president or even the Congress .
And so , Republicans were saying , it was fine with us to stand with Petraeus .
By the president going on television tonight , he is reminding the American public that this is , of course , the policy of George W. Bush that they are supporting .
And -- and this comes from Republican presidential candidates as well .
They would just as soon that the president had kept quiet and just leave Petraeus ' statements stand for themselves .
The Massachusetts Impeachment Coalition
Impeachment activists urge Olver ( D - MA ) to respect the voters
by Susie Patlove , Darcy Sweeny , Tom Plaut .
Over the past year , 24 town meetings in John Olver ’s ( D - MA ) Congressional District voted on issue of impeachment by margins as high as 339 to 1 .
Some towns called for Congress to investigate the possible grounds for impeachment .
Others asked that their resolutions and vote be included in the Congressional Record .
On July 5 representatives from 15 of these towns met with Congressman Olver in Amherst to urge him to act now on impeachment .
We gave five specific reasons to impeach :
To protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic ,
To prevent dangerous precedents and rein in the unitary executive , warning future presidents not to start where George Bush left off ,
To re-establish openness in government ,
To avoid the extreme danger of a nuclear or other disaster if the current administration stays in power , and
To heal this nation , our veterans and the world .
We rebutted the reasons frequently given by Congressman Olver and his Democratic colleagues to take no action :
Impeachment wo n’t work – we do n’t have the votes .
Everything can change rapidly as it did during the Nixon impeachment investigations .
Hearings will take energy from needed legislative work .
During the Nixon impeachment investigation Congress raised the minimum wage , passed the endangered species act , and began to draw down troop numbers in Vietnam .
The impeachment process will prevent us from stopping the war .
We believe impeachment proceedings will stop the war .
They will make clear that the cause of the war was lust for oil .
The threat from WMD ’s and our interest in liberating Iraq were lies .
Impeachment will unite the Republicans behind Bush and divide the nation .
On the contrary , impeachment will unite the country against Bush and his Congressional supporters .
If we let Bush hang himself , the Democrats will win in 2008 .
There may be no elections in 2008 .
After hearing that Congressman Olver was definitely against beginning impeachment proceedings at this time , Cory Bazinet a veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq said , “ In view of your comments I will not read my prepared statement .
I have only one question for you , what will it take for you to change your mind and to cosponsor H.R. 333 ? ”
Olver was taken aback .
He finally answered that he would be for impeachment if he were convinced that it would be useful .
A lively but respectful discussion ensued .
At the close of the meeting the group urged Congressman Olver to use his voice and his vote to save the Constitution and our country .

Bush is visiting the site of a bridge that collapsed in Minneapolis tomorrow .
He and Cheney and Congress have spent $ 488 billion on the illegal occupation of Iraq , which works out to $ 10.7 billion from Minnesota , or $ 1.2 billion from Minneapolis and St. Paul .

Porn Star 's Blog Has Tennessee Trooper in Hot Water
Porn star says she got out of a drug charge , but still got a speeding ticket .
May 21 , 2007  --
The Tennessee Highway Patrol has suspended a trooper who allegedly received a sexual favor from a porn star and recorded the act with a camera from his cruiser in return for ignoring her possession of illegal painkillers .
The woman , who goes by the stage name Barbie Cummings , said that at a traffic stop on May 7 , trooper James Randy Moss found illegal painkillers in her car , but decided not to bust the Knoxville woman in return for a sexual favor .
Now Moss is on paid administrative leave pending an investigation by the Tennessee Department of Safety .
The incident came to the attention of officials when someone filed an internal complaint against the veteran trooper , according to Tennessee Highway Patrol spokesman Mike Browning .
Browning told ABC
News that he could add few details beyond a press release issued Friday that announced Moss ' indefinite suspension .
But a blog maintained by the woman , which recounts sordid details of the alleged escapade , has drawn additional attention to the case , and the department is investigating whether Moss may have violated the law while on duty .
Crying Over ' Happy Pills '
The woman , who in an interview with ABC News would only reveal her actual first name , Justis , posted the entry on May 7 , the date of the alleged offense .
She said she was pulled over around 1 a.m. on a Tennessee highway for driving 92 mph in a 70 mph zone .
In the blog , Justis writes that after pulling her over , the trooper found her " happy pills " -- painkillers -- while searching her car .
Justis does not specifically name Moss .
The trooper explained that the punishment for the narcotics possession would likely prevent her from leaving the state , at which point Justis said she became upset and started to cry .
" He wanted to know why , " Justis told ABC News .
She said she told him that as a porn star under contract , she must travel from Knoxville to Los Angeles once a month to shoot scenes .
She said the two then moved inside Moss ' cruiser where she said he asked about Web sites on which she might be featured .
She gave him the domain name for her blog , and the two of them watched clips from two of her movies on the laptop in his cruiser , she wrote on the blog .
Then the trooper took " the hand full ( sic ) of pills and scatters them in the brush next to the interstate , " she wrote in the blog .
After that , she claims he asked her to follow him to a secluded place , where she performed oral sex while he allegedly took photographs and short video clips using a hand - held camera from his cruiser .
Justis said she did n't want to get Moss into trouble and suspects he incriminated himself by talking about the incident .
She said he called her the day after the traffic stop to ask if he could share the tale with his co-workers .
She said the trooper also e-mailed her the photos and video , which she promptly posted on her blog .
Justis said she has few regrets about what she did .
And as for Moss , who could not be reached for comment , she said she feels some sympathy , but insisted that he brought the situation upon himself .
" He 's not necessarily being punished for the act itself , but he did go to the adult Web site on a computer that was assigned to him , and he did do this on duty , " Justis said .
" He made all these decisions as a grown - up , there was no coercing or nothing . "
There 's a chance the two may meet again when Justis attends her court date next month .
Despite the alleged tryst , she still received a $ 180 speeding ticket from Moss .
This year 's grand prize winners drive off in their new SUV
Sergei Morozov wants couples to take the day off work to have sex .
If a baby is born on national day , they will receive cars , TVs or other prizes .
Mr Morozov has declared Wednesday " family contact day " as part of efforts to fight Russia 's demographic crisis .
The population has sharply declined since the Soviet Union collapsed .
This is the third year that Ulyanovsk , in central Russia , is offering prizes for babies born on 12 June .
This year , a couple won the grand prize of a sports utility vehicle ( SUV ) .
The initiative seems to be paying off , as the region 's birth rate has risen by 4.5 % over the last year .
" If there 's a good , healthy atmosphere at home within the family , if the husband and wife both love each other and their child , they will be in good spirits ... so there 'll be a healthy atmosphere throughout the country , " Mr Morozov told the Associated Press news agency .
Demographers estimate that Russia could lose 40 million people - almost a third of its current population - by the middle of the century .
A combination of falling birth rates , emigration and an ailing healthcare system has led to the decline .
President Vladimir Putin has introduced a scheme to encourage more children .
Women who have a second or third child are eligible to receive $ 9,000 , which can be used to pay for education or home purchases .
It was the most notorious scientific experiment in recent memory - in 1989 , the two men who claimed to have discovered the energy of the future were condemned as imposters and exiled by their peers .
Can it possibly make sense to reopen the cold fusion investigation ?
A surprising number of researchers already have .
Almost four stories high , framed in steel beams and tangled in pipes , conduits , cables , and coils , the Joint European Torus ( JET ) claims to be the largest fusion power experiment in the world .
Located near Oxford , England , JET is a monument to big science , its donut - shaped containment vessel dwarfing maintenance workers who enter it in protective suits .
Here in this gleaming nuclear cauldron , deuterium gas is energized with 7 million amperes and heated to 300 million degrees Celsius - more than 10 times hotter than the center of the sun .
Under these extreme conditions atomic nuclei collide and fuse , liberating energy that could provide virtually limitless power .
Maybe .
High - tension lines run directly to the installation , but they do n't take electricity out - they bring it in .
For a few magic seconds in 1997 , JET managed to return 60 percent of the energy it consumed , but that 's the best it 's ever done , and is typical of fusion experiments worldwide .
The US Department of Energy has predicted that we 'll have to wait another five decades , minimum , before fusion power becomes practical .
Meanwhile , the United States continues to depend on fossil fuels for 85 percent of its energy .
Many miles away , in the basement of a fine new home in the hills overlooking Santa Fe , New Mexico , a retired scientist named Edmund Storms has built a different kind of fusion reactor .
It consists of laboratory glassware , off - the - shelf chemical supplies , two aging Macintosh computers for data acquisition , and an insulated wooden box the size of a kitchen cabinet .
While JET 's 15 European sponsor-nations have paid about US $ 1 billion for their hardware , and the US government has spent $ 14.7 billion on fusion research since 1951 ( all figures in 1997 dollars ) , Storms 's apparatus and ancillary gear have cost less than $ 50,000 .
Moreover , he claims that his equipment works , generating surplus heat for days at a time .
Storms is not an antiestablishment pseudoscientist pursuing a crackpot theory .
For 34 years he was part of the establishment himself , employed at Los Alamos on projects such as a nuclear motor for space vehicles .
Subsequently he testified before a congressional subcommittee considering the future of fusion .
He believes you do n't need millions of degrees or billions of dollars to fuse atomic nuclei and yield energy .
" You can stimulate nuclear reactions at room temperature , " he says , in his genial , matter - of - fact style .
" I am absolutely certain that the phenomenon is real .
It is quite extraordinary , and if it can be developed , it will have profound effects on society . "
That 's an understatement .
If low - temperature fusion does exist and can be perfected , power generation could be decentralized .
Each home could heat itself and produce its own electricity , probably using a form of water as fuel .
Even automobiles might be cold fusion powered .
Massive generators and ugly power lines could be eliminated , along with imported oil and our contribution to the greenhouse effect .
Moreover , according to some experimental data , low - temperature fusion does n't create significant hazardous radiation or radioactive waste .
Most scientists laugh at these claims .
" It 's pathological science , " says physicist Douglas Morrison , formerly employed by CERN in Geneva .
" The results are impossible . "
Yet some highly qualified researchers disagree .
George Miley , who received the Edward Teller medal for innovative research in hot fusion and has edited Fusion Technology magazine for the American Nuclear Society for more than 15 years : " There 's very strong evidence that low - energy nuclear reactions do occur .
Numerous experiments have shown definitive results - as do my own . "
John Bockris , formerly a distinguished professor in physical chemistry at Texas A&M University and a cofounder of the International Society for Electrochemistry : " Nuclear reactions can occur without high temperatures .
Low - energy nuclear transformations can - and do - exist . "
Michael McKubre , director of the Energy Research Center at SRI International : " I am absolutely certain there is unexplained heat , and the most likely explanation is that its origin is nuclear . "
Arthur C. Clarke , science fiction writer , futurist , and funder of Infinite Energy magazine : " It seems very promising to me that nuclear reactions may occur at room temperatures .
I 'm quite convinced there 's something in this . "
Statements like these prompt an obvious question :
If nuclear fusion can be demonstrated in anyone 's basement workshop for a few thousand dollars , and could revolutionize society - why have n't we heard about it ?
We have .
On March 23 , 1989 , Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann announced their discovery of " cold fusion . "
It was the most heavily hyped science story of the decade , but the awed excitement quickly evaporated amid accusations of fraud and incompetence .
When it was over , Pons and Fleischmann were humiliated by the scientific establishment ; their reputations ruined , they fled from their laboratory and dropped out of sight .
" Cold fusion " and " hoax " became synonymous in most people 's minds , and today , everyone knows that the idea has been discredited .
Or has it ?
In fact , despite the scandal , laboratories in at least eight countries are still spending millions on cold fusion research .
During the past nine years this work has yielded a huge body of evidence , while remaining virtually unknown - because most academic journals adamantly refuse to publish papers on it .
At most , the story of cold fusion represents a colossal conspiracy of denial .
At least , it is one of the strangest untold stories in 20th - century science .
Utah
Martin Fleischmann was 11 years old when his family fled from their native Czechoslovakia in 1939 .
Shortly before his father died from abuse inflicted by the Nazis , Fleischmann was taken in for a while by foster parents in Britain , where he became a brilliant , creative scientist .
At age 40 he was appointed to the professorial chair in electrochemistry at the University of Southampton .
About the same time he became president of the International Society of Electrochemistry , and was made a fellow of The Royal Society .
Stanley Pons was born in 1943 in North Carolina , but chose to do his PhD at Southampton , where Fleischmann had acquired an international reputation .
By the time Pons received his doctorate in 1979 , he was well acquainted with Fleischmann .
Later , when Pons became chair of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah , Fleischmann was a regular visitor .
At one point he brought with him a heretical theory which he confided to Pons , during a hike in Utah 's Millcreek Canyon .
Under certain circumstances , Fleischmann believed , nuclear fusion might occur near room temperature .
For more than five years the two men worked in secret , spending about $ 100,000 of their own money .
They ended up with something very simple : an insulated glass jar containing deuterium oxide ( commonly known as heavy water ) in which two electrodes were immersed , one of them a coil of platinum wire , the other a rod of palladium - a precious metal comparable in value to gold .
A small voltage between the electrodes decomposed the deuterium oxide into oxygen and deuterium ( a form of hydrogen ) , some of which was absorbed into the palladium .
This was high school chemistry .
But Fleischmann believed that if the process continued long enough , deuterium atoms could become so tightly packed in the palladium , fusion would occur .
Orthodox science said that this was absurd .
Atomic nuclei repel each other ; a nuclear explosion or insanely high temperatures ( as in a device such as JET ) are required to force them together .
Moreover , laboratory fusion reactions have never lasted more than a few seconds .
Consequently , Pons and Fleischmann created a seismic shock in the scientific community when they claimed their simple apparatus had generated low - level fusion reactions yielding heat for hours at a time .
In March 1989 , the University of Utah promoted the work using hyperbole it would live to regret : " Breakthrough process has potential to provide inexhaustible source of energy " was the headline on the press release .
This seemed so implausible that The New York Times at first refused to print the story .
But a reporter named Jerry Bishop , of The Wall Street Journal , was less inhibited .
Partly catalyzed by Bishop 's revelations , cold fusion became a major media event .
The euphoria was brief .
Many physicists were highly skeptical that a couple of chemists could have pulled off such a feat .
More damning , they were claiming to validate their far - fetched theory via an experiment that was n't properly documented .
In their defense , Pons and Fleischmann explained that they could n't reveal all the details because the University of Utah 's patent had not yet been approved .
They admitted that the press conference had been premature , but claimed the University had urged them to go public when another scientist - a physicist named Steve Jones - turned out to be pursuing similar work .
These excuses were n't well received .
" Conventional science requires you to play by certain rules , " comments cold fusionist Edmund Storms .
" First , thou shalt not announce thy results via a press conference .
Second , thou shalt not exaggerate the results .
Third , thou shalt tell other scientists precisely what thou did .
They broke all of those rules . "
The Journal 's Bishop was accused of compounding the hype .
" But the job of reporters is to report news , " he said recently .
" If some authority , like a scientist in the case of cold fusion , says it 's not true , you do n't kill the story - you report the controversy . "
By the end of April , academic criticism was causing Pons to lose patience .
" They do n't have to believe me , " he was quoted in a local newspaper .
" I will just go back to the lab , do my experiments , and build my power plant . "
But his vilification had barely begun .
On May 1 , East Coast physicists launched a major debunking offensive .
A Boston Herald headline read , " MIT Bombshell Knocks Fusion ' Breakthrough ' Cold . "
Hot fusionists at MIT found apparent inconsistencies in nuclear effects claimed by Pons and Fleischmann .
The director of their department , Ronald Parker , dismissed the whole thing as " scientific schlock " and " maybe fraud . "
A few months later , with the full details still not released from Utah , MIT described its own version of the Pons - Fleischmann experiment and reported no excess heat .
Soon , other hot fusion institutions , such as Harwell in Great Britain , were complaining that they could n't make the experiment perform as advertised , either .
It seemed evident that Pons and Fleischmann had precipitated a media circus before verifying their wild ideas , and now they would be forced to face reality .
But maybe it was n't so simple .
Eugene Mallove , an MIT - trained engineer working as chief science writer in the MIT news office , was a cold fusion skeptic .
Then he studied data from the MIT experiment , and the graph looked wrong to him .
In a recent interview , he told me , " I realized they had moved the baseline to conceal a small amount of anomalous heat . "
At the same time , an MIT spokesperson denied it .
Meanwhile , electrochemist John Bockris announced that one of his graduate students at Texas A&M , Nigel Packham , had collaborated on a successful cold fusion experiment .
Packham had even detected small amounts of tritium , a radioactive by - product virtually guaranteeing that fusion had taken place .
A science writer named Gary Taubes , who has written two books and several articles investigating allegations of fraudulent activity in science , went to Texas A&M on a fact - finding mission .
" We thought Taubes was genuine at first , " Bockris told me recently , speaking in a clipped , precise British accent that he acquired before he moved to the United States in 1953 .
" We exposed our lab books to him , and told him our results .
But then he said to Packham , my grad student , ' I 've turned off the tape , now you can tell me - it 's a fraud , is n't it ?
If you confess to me now , I wo n't be hard on you , you 'll be able to pursue your career . ' "
( Taubes has been shown Bockris 's statement .
He prefers not to comment . )
According to Bockris , " A postdoctoral student named Kainthla , and a technician named Velev , both detected tritium and heat after we took Packham off the work because of the controversy .
Since then , numerous people have obtained comparable results .
In 1994 , I counted 140 papers reporting tritium in low - temperature fusion experiments .
One of them was by Fritz Will , the president of The Electrochemical Society , who has an impeccable reputation . "
Still , Taubes 's report in the June 1990 Science magazine clearly suggested that Packham might have added tritium to fake his results .
This reassured many people that cold fusion had been bogus all along .
Packham received his PhD , but only on condition that all references to cold fusion be removed from the body of his thesis .
Today he works for NASA , developing astronaut life - support systems .
" I do n't know why Gary Taubes wrote what he did , " he says .
" Certainly I did not add any tritium in my experiment . "
John Bockris sighs as he remembers the impact on his own career .
He was investigated by his university , which found no evidence of incompetence or fraud .
He was investigated again in 1992 , and exonerated again ; but his ordeal still was n't over .
As he recalls : " The people in the chemistry department created their own ad hoc committee for the investigation of professor Bockris .
For 11 months I was under investigation by them , without ever knowing what the investigation was . "
He had to appeal to the American Association of University Professors before the harassment stopped .
Other cold fusion researchers were likewise reviled - especially Pons and Fleischmann , who eventually retreated to the south of France , where Pons adopted French citizenship .
Financial factors may have played a part in the fierce animosity exhibited toward cold fusion experiments .
When a congressional subcommittee suggested that $ 25 million could be diverted from hot fusion research to cold fusion , naturally the hot fusion scientists were outraged .
The bottom line , though , was that since most labs could n't replicate the effect , most physicists sincerely believed that cold fusion did n't exist .
They dismissed the few positive results as experimental error .
As it happens , there was another possible explanation : Palladium is a quixotic metal .
" If you chop a rod into three or four sections , " says Bockris , " you get the confusing and ridiculous effect that the first section works splendidly , and the second does n't work at all , probably because of inconsistently distributed impurities . "
Cold fusion researchers have observed that it is inhibited , also , if the heavy water is excessively contaminated with water vapor from the atmosphere .
Pons and Fleischmann were not fully aware of these potential factors at the time of their press conference .
A year later , the subtleties of cold fusion experimentation were better understood - but by this time , it was too late .
The concept had been ridiculed and denounced .
Vancouver
Still , some researchers refused to quit .
An international " cold fusion underground " evolved , trading data and theories which conventional journals refused to publish .
In Italy , Giuliano Preparata claimed he had replicated the original experiment successfully .
So did a Frenchman named Lonchampt , with support from the French Atomic Energy Commission .
Pons and Fleischmann set up a new laboratory in the south of France , funded by Technova , a research group supported by Toyota .
The Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) financed cold fusion research at SRI International , and several other institutions quietly sponsored similar work .
Some reports claimed unequivocal success :
In August 1994 , in document TR - 104195 , regarding project 3170 - 01 , EPRI concluded : " Small but definite evidence of nuclear reactions have been detected at levels some 40 orders of magnitude greater than predicted by conventional nuclear theory . "
NASA Technical Memorandum 107167 , dated February 1996 , concluded that " Replication of experiments claiming to demonstrate excess heat production in light water - Ni-K2CO3 electrolytic cells was found to produce an apparent excess heat of 11 W maximum , for 60 W electrical power into the cell . "
In 1993 , Pons and Fleischmann described a cell that had reached boiling point , and subsequently they claimed to generate more than 1 kilowatt per cubic centimeter of palladium - about 100 percent excess heat , lasting for more than 50 days .
Fleischmann calculated that if this ratio could be upped to 100 kilowatts , " You could satisfy all the world 's existing energy requirements with the existing supply of palladium . "
Alas , to skeptics this sounded like an embarrassing attempt by a discredited scientist to salvage his reputation .
Few people took Fleischmann seriously , and his research terminated when funding from Toyota was cut off .
He moved back to England and retired , while Pons reportedly became embittered and ceased working in the field .
Today , a handful of laboratories still pursue cold fusion , but their work remains largely ignored .
I knew nothing about it myself until Eugene Mallove , the former science writer from MIT , sent me a copy of a book he had written titled Fire from Ice , which provided an excellent factual summary .
But Mallove also edits Infinite Energy , a magazine which Arthur C. Clarke had helped to fund ; and this turned out to be a wild grab bag of eye - popping assertions and evangelistic rants against the establishment .
In the March - June 1997 issue , for instance , an article was headlined :
Low - Energy Bulk - Process Alchemy
One - Tenth Gram of Thorium Becomes Titanium and Copper
Most Sacrosanct Principles of Physics Overturned
At the same time , buried among the far - fetched claims were rigorous reports from credentialed scientists .
The result was schizophrenic , like a collision between American Journal of Physics and Weekly World News .
When I saw that the Seventh International Conference on Cold Fusion would be held in Vancouver within a few weeks , I decided to go there to find out for myself just how wacky these cold fusionists would turn out to be .
In a huge , grandiose convention center I found about 200 extremely conventional - looking scientists , almost all of them male and over 50 .
In fact some seemed over 70 , and I realized why :
The younger ones had bailed years ago , fearing career damage from the cold fusion stigma .
" I have tenure , so I do n't have to worry about my reputation , " commented physicist George Miley , 65 .
" But if I were an assistant professor , I would think twice about getting involved . "
I sat through four days of highly technical presentations and was amazed by the quantity of the work , its quality , and the credentials of the people pursuing it .
A few obvious pseudoscientists , promoting their ideas in an adjoining room used for poster sessions , were politely ignored .
Stanley Pons , now in his mid-50s , did not attend , but Martin Fleischmann was there , pacing impatiently , as bad - tempered as a snapping turtle - though he could be charming when he felt like it .
He looked younger than his 71 years , with a stocky build , a pink complexion , and long hair hanging behind a balding pate .
Eyeing me with amusement through gold wire - framed glasses , he entertained himself by avoiding most of my questions .
I asked why his lab in the south of France had lost its funding .
" Minoru Toyoda was a great man , " said Fleischmann .
" Not the kind of man you find very often , who is willing to say , ' This is what I am going to do , and I do n't care if you think I am mad . '
After he died -" Fleischmann grimaced .
" What you have to ask yourself is , who wants this discovery ?
Do you imagine the seven sisters [ the world 's top oil companies ] want it ?
Does it fit into any idea of macroeconomics or microeconomics ?
I do n't think so .
And do you really think that the Department of Defense wants electrochemists producing nuclear reactions in test tubes ?
Eh ? "
I liked his defiant , gadfly style , but his habit of answering questions with questions was n't very helpful , so I chatted briefly with John Bockris .
Sharp - profiled , slightly bent with age , he moved from one exhibit of research results to the next with the fastidious , perfectionist eye of a watchmaker , tut - tutting over tiny discrepancies or unsupported hypotheses .
Supposedly , this was the man who had either committed fraud , or allowed his grad student to do so .
Finally I talked to Dan Cavicchio , a multimillionaire whose New Energy Partners VC fund has raised venture capital for commercial applications of cold fusion .
Soft - spoken and low - key , with a neat haircut and a conservative suit , Cavicchio told me that in the late 1980s he made a fortune by buying companies that had good technology but were poorly managed .
" We bought a capacitor company from Sprague Electric , doubled the size of it , and made it profitable , " he said .
When his partner left , Cavicchio looked around , found cold fusion , and became convinced that it was real .
" I 've been gathering money from other investors - high - net - worth individuals - under regulation D of the SEC , with a formal offering document .
We 're hoping to invest between $ 15 and $ 20 million .
This was a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to get involved with something that 's going to change the earth , it 's going to be so big . "
Of course , scientists outside the conference would have laughed at these ambitions - if they 'd had any way of knowing about them .
As far as I could tell , I was the only mainstream journalist who bothered to attend .
To the outside world , it did n't exist .
I found myself faced with an impossible choice : Either 200 chemists and physicists had spent the past nine years doing incompetent experiments and engaging in full - blown self - delusion , or a genuine discovery of great importance had been discredited so thoroughly , some ornery retirees and tenured professors were the only ones who still had the courage even to mention it .
I had to learn more .
Silicon Valley
On a quiet backstreet near El Camino Real , a profusion of trees screens a sprawling complex of ' 60s - style buildings .
SRI International is quintessentially Northern California : tasteful , verdant , low - key .
Founded in 1946 to tap talent from nearby Stanford University , its innovations include liquid - crystal displays , optical data storage , acoustic modems , pen-input computing , HDTV , artificial heart valves , and speech - recognition software .
All its research is sponsored by outside companies or government agencies , mostly seeking practical applications .
Michael McKubre , the Energy Research Center director , is blue - eyed and brawny in jeans and a black T - shirt as he strides vigorously across the lobby to meet me .
His longish hair and beard are gray at the edges , but he seems energized and confident , like a woodsman setting out on a hike .
He leads me across a courtyard rimmed with eucalyptus trees , into a building of chemistry labs .
Although born in New Zealand , McKubre has an almost English accent , and his voice is well modulated , as if he once took acting lessons .
He 's relaxed , witty , and charming .
When I ask to see one of the laboratories , he opens a door for me , then pauses .
" This was where the accident occurred , " he says , sounding suddenly subdued .
He 's referring to a cold fusion cell that exploded after building up excess gas pressure .
" I was hit with fragments in my side , in the vicinity of the liver .
I still have pieces of glass in me that work their way up to the surface . "
Still , he was fortunate ; the scientist standing next to him was killed .
" I have nervousness that continues to this day , " McKubre says , closing the lab door .
" But the funding all came through me , so I had to carry on .
Otherwise , the work would have ended . "
He did n't consider a different line of research ?
" No .
If we 're right , and there 's a nuclear - based heat production mechanism , I believe the implications for humanity and science are too great for any individual to say , ' I do n't want to do this anymore . '
I have an ethical obligation to proceed . "
He gives me safety goggles before opening another heavy steel door , then introduces me to Francis Tanzella , who is energetic , enthusiastic , but has difficulty talking nontechnically .
He 's going to be my guide .
This lab is big - perhaps 50 feet long , divided into small cubicles with panels of steel - framed half - inch Lexan providing protection in case another explosion occurs .
Inside the cubicles are glass containers , pressure gauges , valves , and tubes where liquids surge and bubble .
Watching cold fusion is like watching water boil in slow motion .
First , sufficient deuterium has to penetrate the palladium electrode .
This can take a few weeks .
Then , if excess heat is generated during the next month or two , accurate temperature readings require extreme precautions to exclude environmental effects .
" For years , " says Tanzella , " we simply ran Pons - Fleischmann cells , six or eight at once , testing different types of palladium , electrolytes , additives , in order to find the best procedures and materials . "
He starts rattling off names and functions of the equipment in the manner of someone describing his hometown neighborhood .
After nine years of this work , he does n't just live for it , he seems to live in it .
I ask him if he regrets the career choice .
He pauses thoughtfully .
" It was definitely a sacrifice .
But - look , if you commit yourself in any direction , you always sacrifice the other things you 've learned . "
McKubre was summoned by Edward Teller .
" He did n't think cold fusion was a reality , but said if it were he could account for it with a very small change in the laws of physics . "
McKubre rejoins us and recounts his own background .
He did postdoctoral research at Britain 's Southampton University because , like Stanley Pons , he was impressed by Fleischmann 's reputation .
Unlike Pons , however , McKubre lost touch with Fleischmann after relocating in the United States .
When cold fusion was announced , he was program manager in electrochemistry at SRI , funded by EPRI to develop sensors for nuclear reactors .
By pure coincidence he was working routinely with deuterium and palladium , so - why not give it a try ?
He convinced EPRI to contribute $ 30,000 , even though he did n't expect to find anything .
" If the claim had come from anyone in the world except Fleischmann , I would have dismissed it as being outrageous , " he says .
McKubre underestimated the complexities of heat measurement .
Still , after six months and $ 100,000 , he achieved results .
" We had two identical cells , one with a large palladium electrode , the other with a small one .
Lo and behold , they both generated heat , and the bigger one generated more heat than the smaller one .
This was enough to convince us that the effect probably was real . "
Subsequently one cell at SRI generated 100 times the heat that could be explained by any conceivable chemical reaction .
Overall , according to McKubre , " the ratio of power out to power in ranged from 1.05 to 1.3 .
Our new calorimeter was accurate to better than half a percent , so , without a doubt , the results were statistically significant . "
Significant , and ignored - though some mainstream scientists maintained a discreet interest in the field .
Around 1992 , McKubre says , he was summoned for an audience with legendary physicist Edward Teller .
" He asked probing questions , in better depth , I think , than anyone else on the planet .
You could see what a giant intellect he must have been in his time .
I was subjected to this interrogation for four hours .
At the end of it Teller said that he did not think that cold fusion was a reality , but if it were , he could account for it with a very small change in the laws of physics as he understood them , and it would prove to be an example of nuclear catalysis at an interface .
I still do n't understand what he meant by that , but I 'm quite willing to believe that it's correct . "
Currently , McKubre is overseeing a radically different experiment .
We walk down an echoing hallway , into a smaller room crammed with equipment .
Amid the steady hum and whine of cooling fans , a large , bearded guy wearing khaki shorts and a short - sleeved shirt is sitting in front of a video screen .
He introduces himself as Russ George , 48 , a former ecologist for the Canadian government who switched to cold fusion more than five years ago .
He says he acquired his initial interest in science from his father , a nuclear physicist .
" When we played hide - and - seek as kids , " he tells me , " the children who hid carried radioactive ore , and the seeker carried a Geiger counter . "
George has done some contract work on cold fusion for EPRI and the Navy , but much of his research is unpaid .
It 's been a proud and lonely struggle .
" I 've been a voice in the wilderness , " he says .
" But I 've been a visiting scientist at Los Alamos three times , also at a lab in Japan , I 've given seminars at Lockheed , Lawrence Livermore , Rockwell -"
Beside him is a softball - sized steel sphere , submitted to the lab by a lone - wolf experimenter in New Hampshire named Les Case .
Inside the sphere are carbon granules coated with palladium , plus some deuterium gas under pressure .
Case believes that if a moderate amount of heat is applied to these everyday , off - the - shelf items for a couple of weeks , nuclear fusion occurs - just as in a Pons - Fleischmann cell .
Intrigued , SRI put the same ingredients into a sealed 50 - cc stainless - steel flask and wrapped it in a heating element .
A tube from this flask is connected , now , to a mass - spectrometer - an enigmatic steel cabinet standing behind the video screen .
" This mass - spec is sensitive enough to detect the difference between helium and deuterium , " says Russ George .
" And the video display , here , will tell us how much helium is generated . "
Any production of helium would be stunning proof that fusion is occurring , because helium only results from nuclear reactions .
No known chemical interaction can create it .
" The problem is , " McKubre puts in , " helium is also the leakiest gas known to man .
So , any time it 's been detected in other cold fusion experiments , people have said it must be getting in from ambient air , which contains about 5 parts per million . "
" Which is precisely what we have now , " says George , pointing to data graphed on the screen .
" Although it 's been building to this level for the past few weeks , starting at 0.1 parts per million .
We do sets of five analyses :
First we check for helium in the instrument , then the helium background in ambient air , then the helium being generated by the apparatus .
Then we check the air again , and then we check the instrument again . "
I take a closer look at the ultrasimple experiment .
" You really think there 's fusion going on in there ? "
" Electrochemistry does n't require much hardware , " says McKubre .
" So , you may find isolated individuals doing valuable work .
The problem is that even if they 're very able people , they are not surrounded by a peer group that can challenge them and question them . "
He pauses .
" Consequently , they may make mistakes . "
So , this is why SRI is running its own version of Case 's experiment .
They wo n't believe it till they see it themselves .
" Within another few days , " says Russ George , " if the helium level continues to rise , then we 'll have the proof . "
Personally , I can't wait here for a few days ; but I can visit Les Case .
New Hampshire
The road is narrow , twisting under a canopy of green .
Quaint old houses hide among the trees , along with some quaint newer businesses such as Lumber Liquidators and Used Auto Parts .
A yellow diamond sign warns , " Horse Crossing . "
Past a barn of unpainted rough - sawn planks , over a little stone bridge , I come to a dirt driveway furrowed like a streambed .
The car tires spin in the sandy soil as I emerge in a clearing where a large , modern home has been built recently .
Les Case is a tall , well - rounded figure in a plain white T - shirt , linen pants , and suspenders .
At 68 he still has much of his hair , plus some truly amazing black eyebrows , like wild herbs scorched by some industrial accident .
He leads me down to his basement , lit by fluorescent lights and crammed to the ceiling with cardboard boxes .
An old Remington typewriter stands on a ' 60s - style metal - legged formica table .
A workbench fashioned from massive chunks of lumber is cluttered with tools and hardware .
An antique laboratory beam - balance stands in a glass cabinet .
" Have n't finished building the house , " Case explains , lowering his bulk into an old wooden office chair .
" Have n't finished unpacking , either .
I live in a slightly disorganized fashion .
See , my wife died in 1987 .
She was a PhD chemist , her hobby was investing .
I inherited her money , and have used a portion to fund my research . "
I ask him how he ended up doing this .
He explains that he grew up in Tulsa , obtained a substantial scholarship , and spent five and a half years at MIT , obtaining a doctorate in chemical engineering .
His childhood fantasy had been to get rich as a corporate executive , but he found he was better suited to lab work .
He spent some years at DuPont , but was n't a company man .
" I was too outspoken .
I got irritated , and left . "
He taught classes at colleges such as Purdue and Tufts .
Along the way , he acquired 30 patents .
Finally , he read about Pons and Fleischmann .
" It was interesting , but I did n't like the idea of putting in 100 watts to get a net excess of one - tenth of a watt .
I 'm a chemical engineer , a practical person , so I wanted to scale it up . "
In 1993 he embarked on a courageous international odyssey that began in Japan , where a scientist named Yamaguchi had done interesting work with palladium .
Case found him , inspected a palladium disc from the experiment , and saw gold fused into it .
Since this must have happened at around 800 degrees Celsius , a huge amount of heat had been produced , perhaps by a burst of neutrons .
Back in the United States , Case looked for a lab where he could rent time with a neutron detector .
There were no takers , so he obtained a list of colleges in Eastern Europe , and went there .
In Prague , he walked into an office unannounced and found himself facing the university 's director , who fortunately happened to speak English .
When Case explained what he wanted to do , the man agreed .
" So I went there six or seven times , " Case recalls .
" I tried many different metals , all kinds of things .
Then I thought , maybe a catalyst is needed .
So I started making my own , and all of a sudden I got 1.2 degrees of excess heat from a sample that was palladium on carbon .
I do n't believe in magic , so it had to be catalytic . "
He was still looking for neutrons , which would confirm a certain type of fusion reaction .
" But the neutron counter was very sensitive .
Any time anyone in Prague turned on a big machine , the counter counted it .
But , aha ! "
He holds up his finger .
" Prague closes down on the weekend !
It 's socialism , see ?
So one Sunday I finally got a quiet half hour , and - there were no neutrons . "
He was n't discouraged , though ; he figured he must be looking at a different kind of deuterium fusion .
Back in America he paid a lab called Geochron , in Cambridge , Massachusetts , to check for tritium .
This , too , was negative .
" So , " he says , " only one other fusion reaction could be occurring .
Deuterium plus deuterium , yielding helium 4 , plus a gamma ray .
This cannot happen in the gas phase , so the hot fusion people never consider it .
But when the gas atoms are in a crystal or a solid , it can happen , converting almost 1 percent of mass to energy , which I believe is the most energetic reaction that will ever be done on a macroscopic scale on Earth . "
He grins happily .
Case found no gamma radiation , for reasons he did n't understand ; but when he sent one of his devices to Lockheed Martin , at Oak Ridge , Tennessee , they reported that it appeared to generate an astonishing and inexplicable 90 parts per million of helium .
Now he had the confirmation he was looking for .
" Plus I was generating heat , " he continues .
" First 5 degrees , then 11 degrees , depending on the catalyst , which has to be unactivated carbon .
Once I understood this , I made a prototype out of two stainless - steel gravy ladles . "
I ask if he still has it .
" Sure !
You 're sitting on it ! "
I 've been perching on the edge of another old office chair .
I stand up , and Case retrieves his apparatus .
" Later , " he says , " I found war - surplus oxygen bottles , which are cheap .
I cut them up and paid a welder to join them . "
This was his equipment that I saw at SRI .
I tell him that so far SRI has generated only 5 parts per million of helium .
" I know that .
Russ George faxed me the graph .
But it 'll go up . "
He 's totally confident .
In fact , at this point , he 's looking far ahead , contemplating that childhood dream of entrepreneurial wealth .
" Scaling up will be critically important .
First I 'll do a 100 - watt demonstration unit .
If that works , the next step is a water heater .
Ultimately I could build a boiler that makes steam and drives a small turbine , creating electricity .
That 'll require 200 kilograms of catalyst , of which 0.5 percent will be palladium .
A few ounces .
We can afford that . "
Limited supplies of palladium would still tend to inhibit his grand plan .
A mine in Russia is unreliable , and there 's only one other reliable source : " Stillwater mine in Montana , " says Case .
" SWC on Amex .
You should consider buying stock !
A medium - sized commercial power plant using my process will require 100,000 ounces of palladium , and the total supply is only 6 million ounces per year .
I may have to find a substitute .
Titanium and nickel are possibilities . "
If his dreams come true , the implications are endless .
" With really cheap energy , we can make fuel from water and mountains . "
He grins .
" Heat a limestone mountain to make carbon dioxide , mix it with hydrogen from the electrolysis of water , and you have methanol .
How many limestone mountains do you think we have ?
An indefinite supply .
Another application is desalinization of seawater .
Los Angeles could get all its water straight out of the Pacific Ocean , with cheap energy for reverse osmosis .
Then there 's Australia - vast areas of very fertile soil , a good climate , but no rain .
I envisage aqueducts bringing water in from the ocean .
It could become the breadbasket of Asia ! "
" When I built this house , " says Case , " I installed geothermal power .
I get 3.4 times the heat of electric , but it cost a fortune .
That 's all going to change . "
Case is serious about this ; he 's actually negotiating to buy thousands of acres in Australia .
" I have very low cholesterol , and normal blood pressure even at my weight .
There 's no physical reason why I can't keep going for 10 or 20 more years .
I want to supply the world with energy - and not just for my personal benefit .
There are areas in the world where deserving people could start making an honest living , if energy was cheap . "
In the meantime , though , he has to deal with the local welder , the patent office , and his unfinished home .
We walk upstairs , through the kitchen , which is a bachelor - pad nightmare with dishes heaped in the sink , countertops piled with jars and cans , the floor strewn with boxes and papers , and a bed in the dining area .
It looks as if a hurricane struck , and then nothing happened for a year or so .
He ignores it .
It 's trivial .
" When I built this house , " he says , " I installed geothermal power .
It uses a 700 - foot - deep well , and the water goes through a heat pump .
I get 3.4 times as much heat as if I used an electric baseboard .
But , the installation cost a fortune . "
He gives me a hard , serious look .
" This is all going to change . "
Sarasota
Les Case is n't the first to hatch plans for commercial exploitation of low - temperature fusion .
Clean Energy Technologies Inc. ( CETI ) is way ahead of him .
I 'm driving down a back street where unpretentious houses have been bleached and crisped by the sun .
So far , in this neighborhood , I 've passed three goodwill stores , one of them a drive - thru .
On the nearby main drag is an AAMCO Transmissions service center , a funky Cuban restaurant , and Le Club Exotic , all done up in purple paint .
CETI 's headquarters is a ribbed - metal building that looks clean , neat , and new by comparison .
Inside , it 's a typical start - up , minimally equipped with utilitarian office furniture .
A receptionist is fielding phone calls .
In the adjoining lab , youngish people are debating test results .
CETI 's technology is based on five patents initially filed by James Patterson , now 75 years old , formerly an employee at Dow Chemical and a consultant for Fairchild Semiconductor , Lockheed , and the Atomic Energy Commission .
Patterson codeveloped liquid chromatography , a fundamental laboratory measuring technique .
He also developed core technology for identifying proteins in DNA .
He long since retired , but as a lifelong tinkerer , he was fascinated by the Pons - Fleischmann process and devised a variant using regular water instead of heavy water , with an electrode composed of plastic beads triple - coated with nickel , palladium , and nickel .
Gabe Collins , a young chemical engineer who dropped out of a master 's program at The University of Alabama to work here , shows me a 6 - inch glass container with gray beads at the bottom .
" This is a classic Patterson cell .
We 've seen it take .06 watts and give out 10,000 times that .
But the trick is in making the beads .
They do n't work reliably . "
According to Collins , it 's the same old story : quixotic palladium .
" Here 's a different cell that I made myself . "
He 's bright and eager , speaking rapidly .
" I used bismuth beads and glass beads to create a series of voltage gradients .
These cells have been up to the kilowatt range , generating 20 to 30 percent excess .
This is the closest we 've come to a home hot - water heater . "
Is it reliable ?
" It 's ... fairly reliable . "
He laughs uneasily .
" When they do n't work , it 's mostly due to contamination .
If you get any sodium in the system it kills the reaction - and since sodium is one of the more abundant elements , it 's hard to keep it out . "
James Patterson 's grandson , Jim Reding , serves as CETI 's CEO .
Formerly an investment banker at Merrill Lynch , Reding is 28 , shrewd , and ambitious .
He readily admits that efforts to develop a commercial water heater have been frustrated by irreproducibility .
" For the first two years , " he says , " we had a large batch of beads that produced robust effects consistently .
But that batch is pretty much gone , and we 've had trouble replacing them .
We do n't know why , and it 's going to cost money to find out . "
CETI has spent about $ 2 million on cold fusion research since its foundation in 1995 , much of it family money , a large fraction paying for additional patents .
To raise more cash , Reding has developed an alternate strategy .
" We just finished a $ 2.5 offering about nine months ago .
That enabled us to hire a president , Jack St. Genis , who was a very senior manager at Matsushita , NEC , and IBM .
And Lou Furlong joined us six months ago as director of research , formerly at Exxon .
Altogether we have 10 people here .
Now we 're going to raise another $ 5 million for three projects .
The first is filtering tritium from waste water out of fission reactors , using a different invention of Dr. Patterson's .
The second project is neutralizing other forms of radioactivity .
The third is power cells .
When the first venture creates revenue , we 'll spin that out and use it as liquidity to raise capital for the other two . "
At this point Patterson himself wanders into the office , a big man with wild white hair , wearing a stained T - shirt and rumpled pants .
He moved to Florida in 1981 .
His brother , his sister , and his 100 - year - old mother live not far away .
" I just play around , " he says in a laconic , folksy style .
" I got involved in 1995 , " says Reding , " to make a business out of inventions that he had left sitting on the shelf . "
Patterson chuckles .
" Jim , here , was too interested in girls to go into science .
Before that , he was my fishin ' buddy .
Used to cut up the bait and put it on the end of my hook . "
Power - Gen '95 conferencegoers were astonished by a cell that seemed to produce more than 1,000 watts of heat - from only 1 watt of input power .
Patterson shows me his private lab , a tiny backroom in an auto - parts supply warehouse - an entirely separate business next door .
" I like to have some peace and quiet , " he says , relaxing in a La - Z - Boy recliner alongside an old wooden desk .
Patterson 's dog is sleeping under a gray steel lab bench .
A wooden sign announces , " Hours Subject to Change During Fishing Season . "
I ask if he 's working on the problem of the beads .
" No , I 've gone over that path already , " he says .
Instead , he 's refining techniques to measure the impurities in drinking water .
" I 've got a meeting coming up at the American Society for Testing Methods .
The turbidity [ pollution ] detector I 'm working on now is at such a level , it will detect viruses in water .
This 'll be extremely valuable for third - world countries .
But it 's purely an academic venture . "
Back in the CETI offices , Reding agrees that it 's " very difficult to keep Dr. Patterson focused . "
Still , he 's determined to fix the problem of the beads , because past demonstrations have been so dramatic .
Delegates to the energy industry 's Power - Gen '95 conference in Anaheim , California , were astonished by a cell that seemed to produce more than 1,000 watts of heat , drawing only about 1 watt of input power .
" By mid-1996 , " Reding recalls , " we had research relationships with the University of Illinois , the University of Missouri , and Kansas City Power & Light .
They were supporting our research .
Motorola even made a written offer to buy our company . "
When I challenge him on that , he goes to a file cabinet and pulls out a letter from Gregory E. Korb at Motorola New Enterprises .
Conditional on a series of tests , it proposes a buyout totaling $ 15 million .
( Subsequently , I track down Korb and ask him if the letter is genuine .
" The Patterson cell was demonstrated in a Motorola facility , which was not the best environment to do calorimetry , " Korb says , very carefully .
" But Motorola did tell CETI that if they could prove the phenomenon , we would be willing to invest in it . " )
So , the letter seems real .
" You turned down a conditional offer that could have been worth $ 15 million , " I say to Reding .
He hesitates - but only for a moment .
" We 're better off in the long run , " he tells me .
Illinois
CETI has employed several academics as consultants , most notably George Miley , the respected nuclear engineer at the University of Illinois who edits Fusion Technology .
While investigating a Patterson cell , Miley claims he found something even more astonishing than excess heat : residues of copper and silver that seemed to have been generated spontaneously inside the cell .
Naturally , Miley suspected contamination , so he decided to develop his own beads coated with ultrathin metallic films , taking advantage of reactions that he believed would occur between metals with different Fermi levels .
He used the beads as an electrode in a cell full of lithium sulfate and water .
Result : many more metal residues .
" After a run , " he says , " I found three dozen or more elements , including iron , silver , copper , magnesium , and chromium . "
For detection , he used neutron activation analysis , energy dispersive X ray , Auger electron spectrometry , and secondary ion mass spectrometry .
Miley believes the metals are created by transmutation - fundamental nuclear shifts that turn one element into another , just as ancient alchemists dreamed of turning lead into gold .
According to orthodox science , this can occur only under extreme conditions , as in stars or nuclear reactors .
To John Bockris , though , Miley 's work is plausible .
" Transmutation research has been reported in scientific journals since at least 1943 , " he notes dryly .
" The first paper I could quote you is by D. C. Borghi , who concluded that he had produced a nuclear reaction at everyday temperatures . "
To most cold fusionists , though , transmutation remains hard to believe , especially since electrolysis is guaranteed to concentrate any preexisting impurities .
" The case for it is not proven at a high level , " says Michael McKubre .
" Also - heat has practical applications , but what am I supposed to do with the ability to turn expensive elements into cheap ones ? "
" Some of the metals I 've found are at such high concentrations , they 're very unlikely to be impurities , " Miley responds .
He adds that his system generates heat , too .
Moreover he requires only an hour , rather than days , to load thin metal films with deuterium or hydrogen , and the films do n't vary much in structure from one batch to the next .
This enables quick experiments that are n't plagued with inconsistent results .
" We always get similar results , " Miley claims .
Los Alamos
Can anything be stranger than this ?
Perhaps the fact that cold fusion research was supported continuously , for about five years , by Los Alamos National Laboratory , not only the birthplace of the atomic bomb but a bastion of the hot fusion fraternity .
I follow Oppenheimer Road out of the modern town center , which is quintessentially Suburban USA , till I come to Trinity Drive , leading to a steel bridge spanning a canyon between two long , narrow mesas .
An ominous notice warns that I 'm entering government property , where " All Signs , Security Personnel , and Law Enforcement Officers Must Be Obeyed . "
Ten - foot chain - link fences topped with barbed wire are ornamented with dozens of yellow No Trespassing signs .
Behind the fences , box - shaped concrete buildings dating back to the 1950s have had their windows blocked with sheets of stainless steel .
The place looks like a low - budget military prison .
At the badge office , I 'm told that no paperwork has been issued for me , although an official decides that it can be generated if the man I 've come to see , Tom Claytor , gives authorization .
Then Claytor arrives , and he does n't want to do it .
" I ca n't show you the lab , " he tells me , escorting me to the parking lot .
" It could create - some problems . "
Previously , on the phone , he promised I could see everything .
Now he seems uneasy , as if a new policy has been implemented .
He takes me to a lounge area in a hallway above a library .
This is where we will talk .
Claytor is soft - spoken , amiable in a low - key way , but if he has a sense of humor , he hides it .
He 's the most conventional cold fusionist I 've met : clean shaven , conservative , and neatly dressed .
Initially , he was a skeptic .
" We ran some experiments , " he says , " and did n't get any results .
Then we got some results three months later , but we did n't believe the results .
Then we replicated them , and I realized there was something here .
I think we spent about $ 300,000 , mostly on labor - not a lot by Los Alamos standards . "
In a bland , easygoing style , Claytor dismisses the idea that he encountered hostility or skepticism .
" I had a number of theorists backing me , because they were familiar with the limitations of hot fusion theory .
They knew that not everything was known . "
He shrugs .
Like Nigel Packham at Texas A&M , Claytor tested for tritium , partly because Los Alamos owns some of the most sensitive tritium detectors in the world .
He found tritium sometimes at 100 times background levels .
He also found neutrons .
" We would see a burst , " he recalls , " once in a while . "
Since I 'm still wondering if there 's a hidden reason why I can't see his lab , I ask if his work is continuing .
" To some extent , " he says vaguely .
" But it 's not being funded anymore , because even though our results can't be explained by error , we can't produce them consistently .
Therefore , we can't go to the program managers and ask them to give us money . "
Like other researchers , he was plagued by inconsistent palladium samples ; so he used facilities at Los Alamos to refine his own , adding various small impurities .
" This was our last large experimental thrust .
We learned that certain palladium alloys would work part of the time , and the one that worked best was most complicated , with four different constituents .
Also , we found that only very small fractions of the palladium seem active .
Whenever we see a little dot where palladium evaporates off the sample , we get positive results .
These dots are probably about 50 to 70 microns , they evaporate leaving a hole of 120 microns , and that 's where it stops . "
He looks away thoughtfully .
" If you could make the whole plate active , it would be very interesting . "
" Very interesting , " indeed .
The effect might be multiplied by a factor of 10,000 or more .
" The trouble is , " he goes on , " I 'm not a theoretician , I 'm an experimentalist .
Normally I vary the parameters in an experiment , to explore a phenomenon .
But with cold fusion , when I change something , usually it stops the phenomenon . "
He spreads his hands and smiles helplessly .
Since we 're in Los Alamos , I ask if he sees any military applications .
" No , the energy density is n't high enough .
In the first few months , people here tried to implode these things .
They had neutron counters and gamma counters , they blew up all their equipment , and then they lost interest . "
He says it deadpan .
So , he does n't agree with Fleischmann 's theory that the Department of Defense may have pursued a policy to discredit cold fusion .
He chooses his words carefully .
" From what I 've seen , " he says , sounding very diplomatic , " there are a number of people who approve of the research in Washington , DC - and a number who disapprove . "
That 's the closest Tom Claytor will come to admitting that he's had any opposition at all , pursuing his research into cold fusion .
Santa Fe
Thirty - five miles southeast of Los Alamos , adobe - style houses hide discreetly among juniper trees in the hills overlooking Santa Fe .
I turn up a muddy dirt road that winds around a mountain , through virgin forest .
Near the summit I find the home of Edmund Storms , formerly at Los Alamos , now maintaining his own little cold fusion lab in his basement .
He 's tall and fit , gray - bearded , with a friendly , animated manner .
He and his wife Carol designed and built this house themselves , and even some of the furniture in it , such as the fine rolltop desk in Storms 's office .
In manila folders stacked on oak shelves , he has archived more than 2,000 papers and reference works relating to cold fusion .
I 'm hoping he will provide me with an overview ; a definitive summation .
In 1989 he remembers literally hundreds of people at Los Alamos taking an interest in cold fusion .
" Chemists were actually speaking to physicists !
Everyone got involved .
We met once a week , more than 100 people .
There must have been 50 attempts to reproduce the effect . "
Only three succeeded .
One was Claytor 's , another was by Howard Menlove , a world expert in neutron detection , and the third was by Storms .
" That 's how I met my wife , Carol .
We started working together , trying to detect tritium .
We did n't succeed often , and there was n't very much of it , but we did find some , and it was abnormal . "
They succeeded partly because they were inhumanly persistent .
" We tried every conceivable permutation of every variable we could think of .
We ran 250 experiments , taking one whole year , and I think 13 made excess tritium .
Skeptics , of course , said the palladium must have been contaminated with tritium at the start .
So , we did another experiment , contaminating palladium with tritium on purpose , to find out how it would behave ; and sure enough , it behaved differently . "
Still , other scientists found Storms 's results hard to believe .
" After an exhaustive inquiry , no one could say that my work was wrong .
But the theoreticians mobilized their negative arguments in an overwhelming onslaught , and the lab administration grew weary of the whole controversy .
After a year , they were n't interested in going any further .
They would n't call you an idiot at Los Alamos .
They 'd even allow your work to be published .
They just pretended it did n't exist . "
So he quit .
" About six years ago , we decided to build our house and set up our own lab to do things the way we wanted to . "
He takes me downstairs , through a big woodworking shop , into a back room where the walls are plain gray cinder block .
Here he has glass - blowing equipment to create his own labware , a lathe , power supplies , monitoring and analysis gear , and calorimeters in insulated cabinets .
" It 's fairly crude and homemade , " says Storms , although to me it seems more sophisticated than anything I 've seen outside of SRI .
He shows me a box containing 90 little tags of palladium .
" I 've learned , " he says , " how to determine in advance whether a sample will work .
I can predict it with about 50 - 50 accuracy , where it was a 1 - in - 20 chance before . "
He analyzes various properties of the metal , such as its tendency to crack , which limits its absorption of deuterium .
" That 's what makes cold fusion so nonreproducible , " says Storms .
" You have to load the palladium with very high concentrations , and many samples simply wo n't tolerate it . "
" Heat has practical applications , " concedes McKubre , " but what am I supposed to do with the ability to turn expensive elements into cheap ones ? "
This , finally , is his explanation for many negative results .
There 's still a snag , though .
Just because he knows how to select good palladium , does n't mean he knows how to make it .
" Pons and Fleischmann used to test samples from a supplier , Johnson Matthey , and over the years they figured out how to create palladium that worked most of the time .
But Johnson Matthey signed a nondisclosure agreement with Technova , the Toyota - supported group that financed the research in France .
The Japanese thought cold fusion would be hugely successful , and therefore everyone would want this certain type of palladium , and they 'd clean up . "
Of course , it never happened .
Technova abandoned cold fusion .
But according to Storms the nondisclosure agreement still exists , and Johnson Matthey is still bound by it .
( A spokesperson at Johnson Matthey would not confirm that an agreement exists . )
" Someone should buy it from Technova , " I suggest .
Storms laughs .
" Why should they ?
It 's worthless !
You can't make any money from cold fusion - at least , not using the Pons - Fleischmann method . "
And so , at this point , Storms is stymied .
He shows me a paper he has written , with a grim cover letter : " Ironically , it is now possible to know why we failed but it is too late to follow a more successful path ...
Without access to widely circulated journals , this negative attitude within the scientific community obviously cannot be changed .
Even overwhelming proof , as demanded by many scientists in the past , can have no effect because no mechanism exists for it to be communicated to the scientific professions . "
I ask Storms if most scientists can be as conservative as he implies .
" The majority may be bright and competent , " he says , " but they believe what they 've been taught to believe .
I was like that myself , for a long time , till I began to find things which I could n't explain .
Now I see that we should accept everything , so we do n't throw out the baby with the bathwater .
Of course , when we accept everything , we accept a whole lot of crap .
But let 's talk about it , get people thinking about it and debating it .
Then we can decide what to keep and what to throw away . "
Epilogue
It 's 10 days since I visited SRI International .
I call Russ George and find him bubbling with enthusiasm , because Les Case 's mix of carbon , palladium , and deuterium is now generating 10 parts per million of helium - twice the level in ambient air .
The only conceivable source of this helium is a nuclear reaction , and George feels that it 's the best - ever proof of cold fusion .
" It makes all the sacrifices worthwhile , " he says .
But when I speak to Michael McKubre , he 's as fatalistic as Ed Storms .
" I doubt that any single result is going to change everyone 's minds , " he says .
After all , skeptics have been unimpressed by other evidence of cold fusion .
Why should they be convinced now ?
Instead of looking for the ultimate demo to browbeat unbelievers , McKubre wants to pursue a carefully thought - out investigation of the mechanism of cold fusion .
" We have the space and facility to mount a large effort , " he says .
But he does n't have the personnel .
At one time there were 10 people in his lab ; now , Francis Tanzella is the only full - time paid employee .
EPRI is sustained exclusively by power utility companies , which have turned away from " nuclear " research , forcing McKubre to find funds elsewhere after 1996 .
He received some help from MITI , the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry ; but , " From October of this year , " he says , " I 'm not sure of our future .
So , how do we plan long - term experiments ?
Where do we get the fortitude to tackle big questions , if there is no guarantee that we 'll complete them ? "
At Los Alamos , Tom Claytor likewise is thwarted by lack of money .
He would like to see a massive trial - and - error program to test every possible palladium alloy , since tiny impurities seem to catalyze dramatic performance gains .
" This is how ceramic superconductors were developed , " he points out , " by testing 5,000 different compounds . "
But no laboratory wants to mount such an effort for cold fusion .
Consequently the field is languishing , while its key scientists grow older , and few newcomers venture in .
Jed Rothwell , a former software engineer turned journalist who has taken an active interest in cold fusion since 1991 , sums up the sad situation : " Very little happens .
People putter along doing pretty much the same thing year after year .
They are old and work slowly , and they have no funding and no equipment - so jobs that ought to take weeks take years instead . "
And as Ed Storms has pointed out , even when significant discoveries are made - such as detection of helium from Les Case 's apparatus - there 's no easy way to publish them .
According to an estimate by David Nagel at the Naval Research Laboratory , only four of approximately 5,000 academic journals worldwide will consider papers that mention low - temperature fusion .
There 's one obvious way to do an end run around this barrier : Manufacture a marketable product .
If a maverick such as Les Case or a start - up such as CETI could put a cold fusion water heater in every home in America , then the phenomenon would be undeniable .
But these are longshots .
If they do n't pan out , and the current situation persists , we may be left with the grim scenario described half a century ago by the famous physicist Max Planck : " A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light , but rather because its opponents eventually die , and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it . "
Alas , by the time a new generation displaces the old , the graying community of cold fusion researchers will be long gone .
Thus , in a worst - case scenario , the new generation may have to rediscover cold fusion for themselves .
Meanwhile , the US Department of Energy spends more than $ 15 billion each year , of which hot fusionists receive almost $ 500 million , secure in their knowledge that they are following the only valid path .
And , to be fair , they may be correct - if every one of the hundreds of successful cold fusion experiments turns out to be based on incompetence , experimental errors , self - delusion , or fraud .
Even if major funding is obtained for cold fusion , conceivably the phenomenon could suffer from problems as intractable as those of hot fusion .
It may never work reliably , or generate enough energy to be commercially viable .
One thing , though , is certain :
If it remains the poor stepchild of science , starved into obscurity , we 'll never have a chance to learn what we may be missing .

PLR Part 1 : Up and Running with PL/R ( PLR ) in PostgreSQL : An almost Idiot 's Guide
Printer Friendly
R is both a language as well as an environment for doing statistical analysis .
R is available as Free Software under the GPL .
For those familiar with environments such as S , MatLab , and SAS - R serves the same purpose .
It has powerful constructs for manipulating arrays , packages for importing data from various datasources such as relational databases , csv , dbf files and spreadsheets .
In addition it has an environment for doing graphical plotting and outputting the results to both screen , printer and file .
For more information on R check out R Project for Statistical Computing .
What is PL / R? PL /R is a PostgreSQL language extension that allows you to write PostgreSQL functions and aggregate functions in the R statistical computing language .
With the R - language you can write such things as aggregate function for median which does n't exist natively in PostgreSQL and exists only in a few relational databases natively ( e.g. Oracle ) I can think of .
Even in Oracle the function did n't appear until version 10 .
Another popular use of R is for doing Voronoi diagrams using the R Delaunay Triangulation and Dirichlet ( Voronoi ) Tesselation ( deldir ) Comprehensive R Archive Network ( CRAN ) package .
When you combine this with PostGIS you have an extremely powerful environment for doing such things as nearest neighbor searches and facility planning .
In the past , PL/ R was only supported on PostgreSQL Unix / Linux / Mac OSX environments .
Recently that has changed and now PLR can be run on PostgreSQL windows installs .
For most of this exercise we will focus on the Windows installs , but will provide links for instructions on Linux / Unix / Mac OSX installs .
Installing R and PL / R
In order to use PLR , you must first have the R - Language environment installed on the server you have PostgreSQL on .
In the next couple of sections , we 'll provide step by step instructions .
Installing PostgreSQL and PostGIS
It goes without saying .
If you do n't have PostgreSQL already - please install it and preferably with PostGIS support .
Checkout Installing R Next install R- Language : Pick a CRAN Mirror from http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
In Download and Install R section - pick your OS from the Precompiled binary section .
In my case I am picking Windows ( 95 and later ) .
Note there are binary installs for Linux , MacOS X and Windows .
If you are given a choice between base and contrib .
Choose base .
This will give you an install containing the base R packages .
Once you are up and running with R , you can get additional packages by using the builit in package installer in R or downloading from the web which we will do later .
Run the install package .
As of this writing the latest version of R is 2.10.1 .
The windows install file is named R - 2.10.1-win32.exe
Once you have installed the package - open up the RGUI .
NOTE : For windows users - this is located on Start menu - Start ->
Programs - >R -> R. 2.10.1 .
If for some reason you do n't find it on the start menu - it should be located at " C: \Program Files\R\R-2.10.1\bin\Rgui.exe " .
If you are on a 64 - bit system this will be in C : \Program Files ( x86 ) \R\R-2.10.1
Run the following command at the R GUI Console .
update.packages ( )
Running the above command should popup a dialog requesting for a CRAN MIRROR - pick one closest to you and then click OK .
A sequence of prompts will then follow requesting if you would like to replace existing packages .
Go ahead and type y to each one .
After that you will be running the latest version of the currently installed packages .
Installing PL / R
It goes without saying .
If you do n't have PostgreSQL already - please install it and preferably with PostGIS support .
Checkout Getting started with PostGIS
Now that you have both PostgreSQL and R installed , you are now ready to install PLR procedural language for PostgreSQL .
Go to http://www.joeconway.com/plr/
For non-Windows users , follow the instructions here http://www.joeconway.com/plr/doc/plr-install.html.
For Windows users : download the installation file from step 6 of http://www.joeconway.com/web/guest/pl/r
As of this writing , there is no install setup for PostgreSQL 8.3/8.4/9 * for windows .
So what you need to do is copy the plr.dll into your PostgreSQL / ( 8.3/8.4/9.1/9.2/9.3 ) /lib folder .
If you are installing on PostgreSQL 9.1+ , make share to copy the .control , .sql files to share / extension folder .
Set the enviroment variable ( you get here by going to Control Panel -> System -> Advanced ->
Environment Variables
Add an R_HOME system variable and the R_HOME location of your R install .
If you are on a 64 - bit system and running 32 - bit - it will be installed in Program Files ( x86 ) .
On 32 - bit ( or a 64 - bit running 64 - bit install it will be installed in Program Files .
Edit Path system variable and add the R bin folder to the end of it .
Do not remove existing ones , just add this to the end Restart your PostgreSQL service from control panel -> Services .
On rare circumstances , you may need to restart the computer for changes to take effect .
Loading PL / R functionality into a database
If you are running R version 2.12 or above on Windows , the R bin folder has changed .
Instead of bin it 's bin\i386 or bin\x64 .
Also if you install the newer version , you 'll need to use the binaries and manually register the paths and R_HOME yourself since the installer will not install .
You can still use the plr.dll etc .
See our other Quick Intro to PL / R for more details and examples .
In order to start using PL / R in a database , you need to load the help functions in the database .
To do so do the following .
Using PgAdmin III - select the database you want to enable with PL / R and then click the SQL icon to get to the query window .
For users running PostgreSQL 9.1+ , install by typing in SQL window :
CREATE EXTENSION plr ;
If you are running on PostgreSLQ 9.0 or lower you have to install using the plr.sql file .
Choose -> File -> Open -> path/to/PostgreSQL/8.4/contrib/plr.sql
( NOTE : on Windows the default location is C : \Program Files\PostgreSQL\8.4\contrib\plr.sql
Click the Green arrow to execute Testing out PL / R
Next run the following commands from PgAdminIII or psql to test out R SELECT * FROM plr_environ ( ) ; SELECT load_r_typenames ( ) ; SELECT * FROM r_typenames ( ) ; SELECT plr_array_accum ('{ 23,35} ' , 42 ) ; Next try to create a helper function ( this was copied from ( http://www.joeconway.com/plr/doc/plr-pgsql-support-funcs.html) - and test with the following CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION plr_array ( text , text ) RETURNS text [ ]
AS ' $ libdir / plr ' , ' plr_array ' LANGUAGE 'C ' WITH ( isstrict ) ; select plr_array ( ' hello ' , 'world ' ) ; Using R In PostgreSQL Creating Median Function in PostgreSQL using R Below is a link creating a median aggregate function .
This basically creates a stub aggregate function that calls the median function in R .
http://www.joeconway.com/plr/doc/plr-aggregate-funcs.html
NOTE : I ran into a problem here installing median from the plr-aggregate - funcs via PgAdmin .
Gave R - Parse error when trying to use the function .
I had to install median function by removing all the carriage returns ( \r
) so put the whole median function body in single line like below to be safe .
Evidentally when copying from IE - IE puts in carriage returns instead of unix line breaks .
When creating PL / R functions make sure to use Unix line breaks instead of windows carriage returns by using an editor such as Notepad + + that will allow you to specify unix line breaks .
create or replace function r_median ( _float8 ) returns float as ' median ( arg1 ) ' language ' plr ' ; CREATE AGGREGATE median ( sfunc = plr_array_accum , basetype = float8 , stype = _float8 , finalfunc = r_median ) ; create table foo ( f0 int , f1 text , f2 float8 ) ; insert into foo values ( 1 , ' cat1 ' , 1.21 ) ; insert into foo values ( 2 , ' cat1 ' , 1.24 ) ; insert into foo values ( 3 , ' cat1 ' , 1.18 ) ; insert into foo values ( 4 , ' cat1 ' , 1.26 ) ; insert into foo values ( 5 , ' cat1 ' , 1.15 ) ; insert into foo values ( 6 , 'cat2 ' , 1.15 ) ; insert into foo values ( 7 , ' cat2 ' , 1.26 ) ; insert into foo values ( 8 , ' cat2 ' , 1.32 ) ; insert into foo values ( 9 , 'cat2 ' , 1.30 ) ; select f1 , median ( f2 ) from foo group by f1 order by f1 ;
In the next part of this series , we will cover using PL/ R in conjunction with PostGIS .
Post Comments About PLR Part 1 : Up and Running with PL/R ( PLR ) in PostgreSQL : An almost Idiot 's Guide
BAGHDAD , July 2 — Iranian operatives helped plan a January raid in Karbala in which five American soldiers were killed , an American military spokesman in Iraq said today .
Brig .
Gen. Kevin J. Bergner , the military spokesman , also said that Iran ’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has used operatives from the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah as a “ proxy ” to train and arm Shiite militants in Iraq .
American military officials have long asserted that the Quds Force , an elite unit of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard , has trained and equipped Shiite militants in Iraq .
The Americans have also cited extensive intelligence indicating that Iran has supplied Shiite militants with the most lethal type of roadside bomb in Iraq , a bomb called the explosively formed penetrator , which is capable of piercing an armored vehicle .
Previously , Iranian officials have said that the United States is fabricating evidence to back up its accusation that Iran is sending bombs and weapons into Iraq .
Some critics have cast doubt on the American military statements about the penetrator bombs , saying the evidence linking them to Iran was circumstantial and inferential .
Arguing with your spouse ?
Feuding with your boss ?
Fighting with your parents or teachers ?
Adopt a new frame of mind and try solving that dispute one more time .
As a team leader for a large software organization , I sometimes had to help feuding teammates settle an argument .
Over the years , I taught my teammates 7 tried and true conflict resolution techniques ( some invented , others learned ) — and the good news is that you can use these techniques to settle your own arguments , at work or at home .
Each of the 7 techniques below provides a separate and unique frame of mind with which to approach the steps of conflict resolution .
Technique # 1 : The Observer
Imagine yourself as an observer of the argument instead of a participant .
Analyze your own position in the argument as if from the outside looking in .
Find a room where you can be alone and write a short paragraph expressing each personâ€™s point of view , including your ownÂ — theseÂ paragraphs areÂ for your eyes only .
Acting as a dispassionate observer will help you understand the goals of every party involved in the dispute .
Technique # 2 : The Doppelganger
Temporarily become your opponent .
Put yourself in his shoes , internalizing the logic of his argument until you can feel it .
If you are unable to create an emotional connection to your opponentâ€™s point of view , at least attempt to supplant your own logic with his .
Your goal is not to become subservient to your opponentâ€™s cause ( not at all ) , but rather to understand and empathize with him so you will be more capable of understanding his needs as you work to address your own .
Tip :
If you find yourself unable to truly understand your opponentsâ€™ point of view while using the Observer or Doppelganger techniques , try asking your friends or family to help you .
Their natural reaction may be to take your side in the argument , so make sure you tell them youâ€ ™re not looking for sympathy â€ “ youâ€ ™re looking for help understanding a perspective other than your own .
Technique # 3 : The Common Thread
You and your opponent may seem to disagree on everything under the sun , but look hard to find an element of the debate you agree upon .
See if a solution can be reached that uses common ground as a foundation .
Technique # 4 : Low Hanging Fruit
If you and your opponent have multiple disputes , resolve theÂ easiest onesÂ first .
This will build an atmosphere of trust and accomplishment that will help you resolve tougher disputes .
Technique # 5 : The Psychologist
Often in personal relationships ( and sometimes in professional ones too ) , people argue about one thing , when the real cause of the argument is some otherÂ unspoken thing .
For example , a married couple might argue about who will wash the dishes when the underlying problem is that someone in the relationship feels under - appreciated or taken for granted .
If you suspect there is an underlying cause for the argument , you can short - circuit the entire debate by attacking the underlying cause directly .
Be calm and understanding , as the underlying cause is clearly a hot - button subject .
Technique # 6 : The Robot
If youâ€™re too emotional to work out a solution , try turning your heated emotions completely off ( which may take time and distance ) .
The key here is using logic in place of emotion , and itâ€™s a helpful technique when emotion is a significant barrier .
Technique # 7 : The Overflowing Cup
If you have a lot of positive history with a person , you may be able to focus on the positive feelings you have for that person instead of the negative feelings associated with this specific dispute .
Use those positive feelings as an impetus for a solution .
This technique can be helpfulwhen both parties recognize that the underlying relationship is more important than the argument at hand .
These 7 simple conflict resolution techniques cannot make the core components of an argument any simpler , but they do provide helpful frames of mind that can make it easier to find a solution .
TheÂ best technique to use willÂ varyÂ depending upon your own comfort level with the technique , the general environment , and the nature of the argument you ’re trying to resolve . Â
For example , I have found the Observer and Doppelganger techniques incredibly helpful in team - oriented work environments where multiple points ofÂ view must be reconciled before the team can move forward ( ieÂ software development ) .
And if you find yourself arguing a lot with aÂ spouse or friend over petty things , try using the Psychologist technique because there may beÂ a deeper problem brooding beneath the surface .
Each of these techniques has helped me , Â and I ’mÂ hopeful you will find something in this list that will help you the next time you need to resolve a tough conflict . Â
Women who use make - up on a daily basis are absorbing almost 5lb of chemicals a year into their bodies , it is claimed .
Many use more than 20 different beauty products a day striving to look their best while nine out of 10 apply make - up which is past its use by date .
Dependence on cosmetics and toiletries means that a cocktail of 4lb 6 oz of chemicals a year is absorbed into the body through the skin .
Some synthetic compounds involved have been linked to side effects ranging from skin irritation to premature ageing and cancer .
Richard Bence , a biochemist who has spent three years researching conventional products , said : " We really need to start questioning the products we are putting on our skin and not just assume that the chemicals in them are safe .
" We have no idea what these chemicals do when they are mixed together , the effect could be much greater than the sum of the individual parts . "
Mr Bence , an advocate of organic beauty products , believes that absorbing chemicals through the skin in more dangerous than swallowing them .
He said : " If lipstick gets into your mouth it is broken down by the enzymes in saliva and in the stomach .
But chemicals get straight into your bloodstream , there is no protection . "
Warnings over using out - of - date lipstick and mascara have also been issued by the Royal College of Optometrists which believes such items are a " hothouse " for harmful bacteria .
Clio Turton , of the Soil Association , said : " Many women are using over 20 different products a day , bombarding themselves with hundreds of different chemicals .
They should be asking themselves ' is that eyelash conditioner really essential ? ' "
Among chemicals under scrutiny are parabens ( para - hydroxybenzoic acids ) which are preservatives used in products including soap , shampoo , deodorant and baby lotion .
Traces of parabens have been found in breast tumour samples , although its link to the development of the cancer is disputed .
Sodium lauryl sulphate , used to help create lather in soaps , shampoo , shaving foam , toothpaste and bubble bath , can cause skin irritation .
The Cosmetic , Toiletry and Perfumery Association said there was no reason for worry because the products were covered by European Union rules requiring them to be safe .
A spokesman said : " The cocktail effect is an urban myth .
We do know how different chemicals react individually and can predict how they interact with each other and this is taken into account when the safety of products is assessed . "
On Behalf of BusyBox Developers , SFLC Files First Ever U.S. GPL Violation Lawsuit
The Software Freedom Law Center ( SFLC ) today announced that it has filed the first ever U.S. copyright infringement lawsuit based on a violation of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) on behalf of its clients , two principal developers of BusyBox , against Monsoon Multimedia , Inc. BusyBox is a lightweight set of standard Unix utilities commonly used in embedded systems and is open source software licensed under GPL version 2 .
One of the conditions of the GPL is that re-distributors of BusyBox are required to ensure that each downstream recipient is provided access to the source code of the program .
On the company ’s own Web site , Monsoon Multimedia has publicly acknowledged that its products and firmware contain BusyBox .
However , it has not provided any recipients with access to the underlying source code , as is required by the GPL .
“ We licensed BusyBox under the GPL to give users the freedom to access and modify its source code , ” said Erik Andersen , a developer of BusyBox and a named plaintiff in the lawsuit filed yesterday in Manhattan Federal District Court .
“ If companies will not abide by the fair terms of our license , then we have no choice but to ask our attorneys to go to court to force them to do so . ”
The complaint filed by SFLC on behalf of the BusyBox developers requests that an injunction be issued against Monsoon Multimedia .
It also requests that damages and litigation costs be awarded to the plaintiffs .
A copy of the complaint is available at http://www.softwarefreedom.org/news/2007/sep/20/busybox/complaint.pdf
“ Free software licenses such as the GPL exist to protect the freedom of computer users .
If we do n’t ensure that these licenses are respected , then they will not be able to achieve their goal , ” said Eben Moglen , Founding Director of SFLC .
“ Our goal is simply to ensure that Monsoon Multimedia complies with the terms of the GPL . ”
The lawsuit , “ Erik Andersen and Rob Landley v. Monsoon Multimedia Inc. , ” case number 07 - CV - 8205 , will be heard by Senior District Judge John E. Sprizzo of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York .

His hands were bleeding and his eyes filled with tears as , four years ago , he slammed a sledgehammer into the tiled plinth that held a 20ft bronze statue of Saddam Hussein .
Then Kadhim al - Jubouri spoke of his joy at being the leader of the crowd that toppled the statue in Baghdad 's Firdous Square .
Now , he is filled with nothing but regret .
The moment became symbolic across the world as it signalled the fall of the dictator .
Wearing a black vest , Mr al - Jubouri , an Iraqi weightlifting champion , pounded through the concrete in an attempt to smash the statue and all it meant to him .
Now , on the fourth anniversary of the US - led invasion of Iraq , he says : " I really regret bringing down the statue .
The Americans are worse than the dictatorship .
Every day is worse than the previous day . "
The weightlifter had also been a mechanic and had felt the full weight of Saddam 's regime when he was sent to Abu Ghraib prison by the Iraqi leader 's son , Uday , after complaining that he had not been paid for fixing his motorcycle .
He explained : " There were lots of people from my tribe who were also put in prison or hanged .
It became my dream ever since I saw them building that statue to one day topple it . "
Yet he now says he would prefer to be living under Saddam than under US occupation .
He said : " The devil you know [ is ] better than the devil you do n't .
We no longer know friend from foe .
The situation is becoming more dangerous .
It 's not getting better at all .
People are poor and the prices are going higher and higher . "
Saddam , he says , " was like Stalin .
But the occupation is proving to be worse " .
According to an opinion poll of 5,000 Iraqis carried out over the past month , 49 % say they are better off now than under Saddam , and 26 % say life was better under Saddam .
More than one in four said they had had a close relative murdered in the past three years .

ST .
GEORGE , Utah — Woodrow Johnson was 15 , and by the rules of the polygamous sect in which his family lived , he had a vice that could condemn them to hell :
He liked to watch movies .
When his parents discovered his secret stash of DVDs , including the “ Die Hard ” series and comedies , they burned them and gave him an ultimatum .
Stop watching movies , they said , or leave the family and church for good .
With television and the Internet also banned as wicked , along with short - sleeve shirts — a sign of immodesty — and staring at girls , let alone dating them , Woodrow made the wrenching decision to go .
And so 10 months ago , with only a seventh - grade education and a suitcase of clothes , he was thrown into an unfamiliar world he had been taught to fear .
Over the last six years , hundreds of teenage boys have been expelled or felt compelled to leave the polygamous settlement that straddles Colorado City , Ariz . , and Hildale , Utah .
On Sunday , the European Union celebrated its 50th anniversary .
The EU was established on March 25 , 1957 , when its six founding states ( Germany , France , Italy , the Netherlands , Belgium and Luxemburg ) signed the Treaty of Rome .
They solemnly declared that they would aim for “ an ever closer union . ”
As a first step towards the goal of political unification the six states decided to integrate their economies .
They have meanwhile been joined by 21 other European countries ,
Economic activities , however , cannot result in achieving a predetermined political goal without strict economic controls and centralist planning .
The controlling and planning body of the EU is the European Commission , based in Brussels .
The commissioners are not elected and are accountable to no one .
This deliberate democratic deficit was built in as a structural feature of the EU .
An unelected and unaccountable structure makes it easier to impose centrally driven change on a society .
Some of the EU ’s founding fathers claimed that political unification was needed to prevent European nations from going to war again .
Others , such as Paul - Henri Spaak , the Belgian foreign minister who authored the Rome treaty , dreamed of a European superstate .
He hoped that such a state might one day become as powerful as the United States .
Robert Rothschild , Mr. Spaak ’s chef de cabinet , recalled later how Mr. Spaak told him in 1957 : “ I think we have re-established the Roman Empire without a single shot being fired . ”
Washington foolishly supported the European unification project .
It failed to see that democratization and decentralization are far more likely to preserve peace than unification and centralization .
Washington also thought that without the gradual obliteration of the former European nation - states the Europeans were bound to wage war on each other again .
America became the EU ’s midwife .
“ Without the Americans we would not have gotten anywhere , ” Mr. Rothschild acknowledged .
Empires , however , are carnivorous monsters .
They have to keep growing in order to avoid unraveling .
Hence , they inevitably grow ever more totalitarian and expansionist .
The EU is interfering more and more in the daily lives of its subjects .
At the same time , its territory continues to expand , from the original six members to the present 27 .
By definition , there is no end to this process .
The Leviathan has to be fed .
With the accession of Romania and Bulgaria on Jan. 1 , the EU ’s territory has reached the outer boundaries of the European continent .
Since the European Empire by definition has to expand , it has to move into Asia and Africa .
The preparation for this crossing of the Rubicon — in this case the crossing of the Strait of Gibraltar and the Bosporus — has been going on for years .
Five years ago , Louis Michel , then the Belgian minister of foreign affairs and at present a member of the European Commission , told the Belgian parliament that eventually the EU will encompass the entire Mediterranean basin , including North Africa and the Middle East .
Mr. Michel also posited that only by incorporating both Israel and Palestine into the EU will there be peace between them .
The European - Mediterranean ( “ Euro - Med ” ) partnership between the EU and the countries of the Maghreb ( an Arab word meaning “ the West ” and denoting Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia and Libya — the North African Muslim countries to the west of Egypt ) was established specifically to promote the economic , cultural and political integration of the EU and the Maghreb countries .
The Brussels bureaucrats embrace Islam because they want the EU to expand into the Muslim east and south .
They think that eventually the Maghreb will become part of Europe , but many ordinary Europeans fear that Europe is on its way to becoming the Maghreb , the Muslim “ West . ”
The problem for the Brussels establishment is that the present institutional framework of the EU is not adapted to the rapid expansion which the EU has experienced since the fall of the Iron Curtain in the late 1980s .
To cope with expansion , the EU establishment produced the so - called “ European Constitution , ” a bloated 70,000 - word document full of politically correct phrases and carefully omitting any reference to Europe ’s Christian heritage and its cultural tradition .
It expands the powers of the Brussels Eurocracy and limits the national sovereignty of the member states .
In early 2005 the constitution was rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands .
One of the reasons why people voted against it was their fear of Islam and their subsequent opposition to the admission of Turkey into the EU .
Theoretically the constitution should have been discarded after its rejection at the polls .
The Europeanist politicians , however , refuse to accept the electorate ’s “ no . ” “ It has to be yes , ” they say , as they know that the empire will collapse if it cannot expand .
They are now writing down a new and binding institutional framework , which , as German Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear , shall not be put before the electorate in a referendum .
Empires can not be democracies .

Michael Mukasey , President Bush ’s nominee to be attorney general , is being promoted as a “ consensus choice , ” which is meant to signal the Senate that it should be grateful and confirm him without delay .
Mr. Mukasey is clearly better than some of the “ loyal Bushies ” whose names had been floated , but that should not decide the matter .
The Senate needs to question him closely about troubling aspects of his record , and make sure he is willing to take the tough steps necessary to repair a very damaged Justice Department .
Mr. Mukasey has attributes that could make him a good attorney general .
He has been a lawyer and federal district court judge in New York , where he enjoys a good reputation .
Although he is not divorced from politics ( he is on an advisory committee to Rudolph Giuliani ’s campaign ) , it is unlikely that he would run the Justice Department as an adjunct of the White House , or a booster of the Republican Party , as Alberto Gonzales did .
Aspects of his record , however , are troubling .
As a judge , he was too deferential to the government .
In the case of Jose Padilla , who was accused of participating in a dirty bomb plot , he ruled that the president may detain American citizens indefinitely as “ enemy combatants . ”
His dangerously narrow reading of the Constitution was rightly reversed by a federal appeals court .
In a 2004 Wall Street Journal op - ed article , Mr. Mukasey denounced the “ hysteria ” of Patriot Act critics , and lashed out at the American Library Association for trying to protect patrons ’ privacy .
He also made the dubious claim that based on the structure of the Constitution , the government should “ receive from its citizens the benefit of the doubt . ”
And writing in The Journal this year , he promoted the truly awful idea of a separate national security court that would try suspected terrorists .

After four drafts , broad discussion , and extensive public review , the FSF has finally published the official , much - anticipated GPL revision 3 ( GPL 3 ) .
The new version aims to clarify aspects of the previous version , strengthen unencumbered redistribution by imposing new patent licensing requirements , and protect the user 's right to modify GPL software on embedded systems .
The GPL is the most popular open - source software license , and it is used by many high - profile open - source software projects , including the Linux kernel .
Unlike proprietary software licenses , the GPL explicitly guarantees users the right to modify , repurpose , and redistribute software .
" Since we founded the free software movement , over 23 years ago , the free software community has developed thousands of useful programs that respect the user 's freedom , " says FSF president Richard Stallman in a statement .
" Most of these programs use the GNU GPL to guarantee every user the freedom to run , study , adapt , improve , and redistribute the program . "
Many contentious issues addressed in the GPL 3 caused controversy and debate throughout the draft process .
An unexpected patent agreement between Microsoft and Novell compelled the FSF to revise the patent licensing language in a late GPL 3 draft in an effort to block similar deals in the future .
Despite the controversy and debate , the highly transparent draft process has ensured that the GPL 3 is the product of broad consensus .
" By hearing from so many different groups in a public drafting process , we have been able to write a license that successfully addresses a broad spectrum of concerns , " says FSF executive director Peter Brown in a statement .
" But even more importantly , these different groups have had an opportunity to find common ground on important issues facing the free software community today , such as patents , tivoization , and Treacherous Computing . "
Now that the GPL 3 has been released , it is likely that it will be broadly adopted within the open - source software community .
Although Linux kernel creator Linus Torvalds initially rejected the possibility of migrating the kernel from the GPL 2 to the GPL 3 , the developer has recently stated that the possibility is once again under consideration .
When starting out a new website , most people do n’t realize that nearly every hosting provider offers a free domain registration when you purchase a new hosting package ( Hostpapa offers this as part of their hostpapa.com hosting discount code ) .
So , if you ’re among those who purchased a domain name with GoDaddy , not realizing that BlueHost was going to give you a free domain registration anyway , then you have a free domain name to play with !
Instead of merely registering the ‘.NET ’ or ‘.ORG ’ versions of your domain name , why not get a little creative with it ?
These are some possibilities for you to play around with when you get a free domain registration .
Get Creative with Alternative Domain Names
Whether you are founding a new business or updating an existing one for the digital age , a memorable domain name is one of the best ways to brand your online presence .
Since the dot - com bubble of the late ’90s , companies have typically turned to the tried - and - true .com domain extension as their preferred choice .
But with more top - level domains ( TLDs ) available than ever before , now is the perfect time to look beyond .com and take advantage of new and creative listings for your company or brand .
Here are five creative ways to get in on this new trend .
Get the scoop with . today .
For businesses and news organizations that trade in up - to - date information , a . today website is a surefire way to attract users looking for the latest scoop .
An ideal name convention for local newspapers or news aggregators , . today domains indicate an urgency and immediacy that is hard to find elsewhere .
Creative . today ideas include : radioname.today , tvstation .
today , cityname.today , and more .
Be yourself with .me
Are you looking to build a portfolio site or personal blog ?
Look no further than a .me domain , a memorable and recognizable listing that quickly communicates the non-commercial nature of your page .
On the flip side , businesses can take advantage of a .me page to create platforms for intimate customer engagement away from the hustle and bustle of larger social media watering holes .
Creative .me ideas include : a photographer ’s portfolio website ( JohnDoe.me ) , a fitness trainer for hire ( fitnesscoachfor.me ) , and a financial advisory page ( investingfor.me ) .
Dive into video with .
tv
Give your next vlog and other web - based video content project a high - definition makeover with a .tv landing page .
If your preferred .tv domain happens to be taken , never fear !
Look at lesser - known alternatives like .media and .video for bargain availability .
Creative .tv ideas include : a streaming video portal for a local TV channel ( stationID.tv ) , and a landing page for a specific TV show ( showname.tv ) .
Go mobile with .mobi
More users are browsing the web from phones and tablets than ever before .
Keep your website mobile - friendly with a .mobi domain name .
E - commerce sites can see big gains by updating their web presence to be optimized for mobile .
There is no better way to let your customers know their mobile devices are welcome than with a .mobi domain .
Creative .mobi domain ideas include : a mobile app information page ( yourapp.mobi ) , a game website ( mobilegame.mobi ) , and a mobile version of an existing business page ( business.mobi ) .
Say “ I do ! ” to . wedding
Before you pick the perfect dress , make sure you cover all your bases with a bespoke website for your wedding .
Whether you need a place to host your gift wish list or a public one - stop - shop for all your post - wedding pictures and video , a . wedding domain is a great way to bring some modern flair to that special day .
With so many top - level domains available , the only thing standing between you and a unique web address is your decision to pick one .
Brendan Barber called for new rights to be given to temporary and agency workers after highlighting a series of cases reported to the trade union movement .
In a speech on the opening day of the TUC Congress in Brighton , he said Polish workers were being paid as little as £ 2 an hour - well below the hourly minimum wage of £ 5.35 - for a 70 - hour week , and not allowed any breaks .
He claimed one worker was sacked on the spot after asking if he could have a holiday , and a home worker , who was paid 60 p for sewing a pair of trousers , had no rights to sick leave , holiday pay or redundancy protection .
" There are so many issues to tackle in this dark underbelly of British life , " he told delegates .
Mr Barber said disreputable employment agencies were at the heart of many of the abuses and he called on the government to sign up to a planned European directive aimed at giving equal employment rights to agency staff .
" Now is the time to think again about employment agencies .
It is time for another minimum wage moment - time to stop standing up for the bad agencies who undercut the good and threaten the reputation of all . "
In a veiled warning to Gordon Brown , Mr Barber said it was " a critical time " for British workers , but also a crucial point in the political cycle .
Speaking ahead of the prime minister 's address to the congress , Mr Barber condemned the treatment of public sector workers , saying they felt " battered and bruised " , especially over pay .
With Mr Brown relying on affiliated party funding and union support in the event of a snap general election , Mr Barber made clear unions expected the government to " listen , consult and involve " workers more in future public sector reforms .
He claimed there was " too much top - down change , too many targets and too much faith that the private sector has all the answers " .
" This year 's centralised attempt to railroad through below - inflation public sector pay has been plain wrong and must never be repeated , " Mr Barber said .
He called for " the unique public service ethos to once again take centre stage " and for unions to work with the government to shape a world - class service .
" To deliver the real improvements across our pubic services , we need to work together on the way forward , " he said .
" Not a retreat to the policies of the past , but a new way of doing things that delivers for service users , taxpayers and workers alike . "
Later in the article , this assertion is made :
America 's increased productivity " has to do with the ICT ( information and communication technologies ) revolution , with the way the U.S. organizes companies , with the high level of competition in the country , with the extension of trade and investment abroad , " said Jose Manuel Salazar , the ILO 's head of employment .
The majority of that statement is patent bullshit as far as I 'm concerned .
Let me back up and then explain .
Productivity is a simple calculation designed to describe how much of x is produced as output per unit of input y .
The CNN Money article specifically references output per worker , or labor productivity .
This , again , is a fairly simple calculation arrived at by evaluating output per worker per labor hour or per year .
The CNN Money article articulates both - $ 63,885 of wealth is generated by each worker annually , according to the article .
When expressed on an hourly basis , the figure is $ 35.63 per hour .
The article proclaims the US as being " in the lead " on the annual productivity figure and second on the hourly productivity figure , owing primarily to the fact that US workers work more hours than other countries included in the analysis .
This constitutes nothing more than trying to baffle us with bullshit , folks .
Because what most are hesitant to explain is that the productivity measure , while intersting ( I guess ) , is NOT an adequate measure of the health of the economy .
There are a variety of reasons for this , not the least of which is the fact that US businesses outsource many jobs to foreign markets with cheap labor sources .
The output figures evaluated are TOTAL output to the US business .
The labor figures include ONLY US workers .
Wikipedia has an interesting ( if somewhat convoluted ) discussion about productivity as it relates to outsourcing :
Productivity Offshore outsourcing for the purpose of saving cost can often have a negative influence on the real productivity of a company .
Rather , [ sic ] than investing in technology to improve productivity , companies gain non-real productivity by hiring less people locally and outsourcing work to less productive facilities offshore that appear to be more productive simply because the workers are paid less .
Sometimes , this can lead to strange contradictions where workers in a third world country using hand tools can appear to be more productive than a U.S. worker using advanced computer controlled machine tools , simply because their salary appears to be less in terms of U.S. dollars .
In contrast , increases in real productivity are the result of more productive tools or methods of operating that make it possible for a worker to do more work .
Non-real productivity gains are the result of shifting work to lower paid workers , often without regards to real productivity .
The net result of choosing non-real over real productivity gain is that the company falls behind and obsoletes itself overtime rather than making real investments in productivity .
My emphasis added .
The thing to focus on here is the idea of non-real gains in productivity .
When the Administration touts the fabulous US productivity numbers as a basis for their sound and wizened leadership in economic policy , they are talking about a measure that is non-real .
In other words , its bullshit .
And even worse - its unexplained bullshit ( unexplained certainly by the Administration , but picked up and further unexplained in the mainstream , soundbyte financial media ) .
Here 's a sampling of the Administration shoveling productivity bullshit , bullshit that is almost exclusively parrotted by the mainstream media :
Press briefings since July 1 , 2007 July 6 , 2007 - White House Fact Sheet : " Since The First Quarter Of 2001 , Productivity Growth Has Averaged 2.8 Percent .
This is well above average productivity growth in the 1990s , 1980s , and 1970s . "
July 19 , 2007 - Speech in Nashville , TN : " But it also means that the English muffin manufacturing company -- English muffin machine manufacturing company is more likely to have work .
In other words , there 's an effect , the tax code can affect commerce .
And that 's exactly what we did , and we cut the taxes and it 's worked .
This economy is strong .
Unemployment has dropped .
Since August of 2003 we 've added over 8.2 million new jobs .
Productivity is up .
People are working . " ( Applause . )
August 3 , 2007 - Job Creation Fact Sheet : " Since The First Quarter Of 2001 , Productivity Growth Has Averaged 2.8 Percent Per Year .
This is well above the average productivity growth in the 1990s , 1980s , and 1970s . "
( Ed. note - it appears the White House is no stranger to cut and paste ) Radio Addresses Since January 1 , 2006 January 7 , 2006 : " Productivity is high , consumers are confident , and more Americans now own their homes than at any time in our Nation 's history . "
January 21 , 2006 : " Productivity is high , inflation is contained , consumers are confident , and more Americans now own their homes than at any time in our Nation 's history . "
April 1 , 2006 : " Productivity has grown strongly over the past five years , and our small business sector is thriving . "
June 24 , 2006 : " Productivity is growing , and wages are beginning to rise .
And because taxes are low , workers are keeping more of the money they earn . "
I 'm sure we 're bound to see upteen mentions of the fabulous , world - leading productivity figures in press releases , statements , speeches and radio addresses to come , imploring us to simply run out to our local Wal - Mart and buy shit we do n't need with credit we can't afford , buoyed by our fabulous productivity .
If only it meant something , then maybe there would be a reason to discuss it .
And I have to say - I do n't think the concept of the labor productivity numbers being essentially meaningless is a difficult one on which to comment or report .
Productivity is a straight - forward measure , and the concept that cheaper overseas labor boosts a productivity measure is one that most people could grasp .
The Administration is at fault because it continually touts it - so much so that I wonder if they really understand it 's meaninglessness or are simply choosing to believe their own lies at this point .
But worse yet is the general mainstream media 's failure to report , at minimum , a caution associated with those figures .
It would take more than 30 seconds to explain it in a way that was easily understandable for most Americans .
And the open question - will the Democrats find a way to talk about the irrelevant nature of " productivity " in light of its flawed calculation ?
I hope so - because I believe most Americans can relate to the utter disconnect between our so - called productivity standing on the world stage and their personal lack of ability to get out of debt and provide for necessities like health care and college for their children and [ insert your favorite issue here ] .

Litvinenko murder suspect confirms plans to stand for election
RIA Novosti
16/09/2007 16:11 MOSCOW , September 16 ( RIA Novosti ) - Andrei Lugovoi , a Russian businessman who the U.K. suspects of murdering Alexander Litvinenko , confirmed on Sunday that he would run for parliament as a candidate for an ultranationalist party .
The head of the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDPR ) , Vladimir Zhirinovsky , announced on Saturday that the former KGB officer , who Britain wants to try for the poisoning of ex-security officer Litvinenko last November , would stand as number two party candidate at the December elections to the lower house of parliament , the State Duma .
Lugovoi told RIA Novosti : " I will take part in the State Duma elections on the LDPR 's candidate lists . "
If the millionaire businessman , who owns a private security company , becomes a member of parliament , he will receive immunity from prosecution according to Russian law .
Lugovoi also said he would take part in the LDPR 's party congress on Monday .
He said he would make further comments on his candidacy after the congress .
Russia 's refusal to extradite Lugovoi to the U.K. has proved a major source of contention in relations between the countries , and in July sparked a tit - for - tat row involving expulsions of diplomats and visa restrictions .
Alexander Litvinenko , an outspoken Kremlin critic , is believed to have died of poisoning from a dose of a highly toxic polonium isotope allegedly dropped into his drink in the bar of a luxury London hotel last November .
Lugovoi reportedly met with him at the hotel on the day of his poisoning .
Lugovoi has repeatedly denied the accusations against him , and in a news conference hosted by RIA Novosti and radio station Ekho Moskvy in late August , he insisted that there is not even any proof that Litvinenko died of radioactive poisoning , and said the cause of death remains unknown .
He also suggested that fugitive Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky and British intelligence were involved in Litvinenko 's murder .
This article describes how to implement SSL - enabled name - based vhosts – that is secure virtual hosts which share the same IP address and port – with the SNI - capable mod_gnutls module for Apache ’s httpd web server .
Server Name Indication ( SNI ) , as described in section 3.1 of the RFC3546 , is a TLS extension which makes the configuration of SSL - enabled name - based virtual hosts possible .
This extention eliminates the need for the assignment of one IP address per secure virtual host , therefore the cost for secure web hosting is greatly reduced , as all secure virtual hosts can share the same IP address and port combination .
SNI is a huge step forward as it promotes security by making secure web services easier and cheaper to implement .
The current version of OpenSSL – 0.98 at the time of writing – does not support SNI yet , but this is planned for the upcoming 0.99 release .
On the other hand , mod_gnutls , an experimental module for Apache ’s httpd which has been around for 2 + years , includes support for SNI .
Introduction
Searching the web for mod_gnutls binary distribution packages or information on how to set it up returned very few relevant results .
This was a surprise , as , at this moment , the only implementation that supports SNI is mod_gnutls .
So , I decided to write a tutorial on how to set things up for a test .
I hope you find it useful .
The test that is described in this guide includes :
The compilation of the mod_gnutls module .
The generation of SSL certificates .
The configuration of the SSL - enabled name - based virtual hosts .
This test was performed on a server that runs Fedora 7 .
Installation
In order to compile mod_gnutls , you will need the development tools for Fedora :
# yum groupinstall " Development Tools "
Install the mod_gnutls dependencies :
# yum install httpd - devel gnutls - devel
As an unprivileged user , download the mod_gnutls distribution and compile it .
$ wget http://www.outoforder.cc/downloads/mod_gnutls/mod_gnutls-0.2.0.tar.bz2 $ tar - xjvf mod_gnutls - 0.2.0.tar.bz2 $ cd mod_gnutls - 0.2.0 $ ./ configure -- prefix= / usr $ make
Do not use the ‘ make install ‘ script , but perform the installation manually – it is only one library .
As root , copy libmod_gnutls .
so to the directory that holds the Apache modules ( usually / usr / lib / httpd / modules ) and rename it to mod_gnutls .
so for consistency :
# cp mod_gnutls-0.2.0/src/.libs/libmod_gnutls.so
/usr/lib/httpd/modules/mod_gnutls.so
During the compilation , two keys , dhfile and rsafile , have been generated in the mod_gnutls - 0.2.0 / data / directory .
It is absolutely important to copy these files in httpd ’s configuration directory ( usually / etc / httpd / conf / ) , otherwise mod_gnutls will never work .
This is undocumented , and I found out about it after some trial&error .
As root :
# cp mod_gnutls -0.2.0/data/{dh, rsa}file
/etc/httpd/conf/
Installation is complete .
SSL certificates
In this test installation , two virtual hosts will be used .
Thus , two SSL certificates will be required .
Please read my article on how to generate SSL certificates for your servers , as this information is beyond the scope of this document .
Alternatively , you may use a ready - made script which will create those certificates for you quickly .
Such scripts are shipped will almost all Linux distributions .
Please consult your distribution ’s documentation for more information .
HTTPd Configuration
The configuration of the Apache web server includes two phases :
The configuration of the main server .
The configuration of the virtual hosts .
In the following instructions , some brief notes about what each directive does is included .
For more detailed information , please consult the mod_gnutls documentation .
Main Server Configuration
This includes setting some general mod_gnutls options , which will be inherited by all virtual hosts .
But , first of all , httpd needs to be set to listen on port 443 ( in addition to port 80 ) .
Instead of specifying the SSL port only ( Listen 443 ) which will lead httpd to listen to all the available network interfaces , you may specify the exact network interface on which the server will listen .
For example :
Listen 192.168.0.1:443
Next , load mod_gnutls :
LoadModule gnutls_module modules/mod_gnutls.so
Add some MIME - types for downloading Certificates and CRLs from your web sites ( taken from the mod_ssl configuration ) :
AddType application / x-x509 - ca- cert .crt AddType application /x- pkcs7 - crl .crl
It is suggested that you use a session cache for mod_gnutls .
This will increase its performance .
In this example , the dbm cache type is used .
This cache type requires a directory where mod_gnutls will actually save SSL session data .
So , creating a directory for this purpose and giving ownership to the user that runs Apache ( usually apache or www - data ) is needed .
Assuming that the Apache user is apache , as root issue the commands :
# mkdir -m 0700 /var/cache/mod_gnutls_cache # chown apache : apache /var / cache/mod_gnutls_cache
Now , back to the Apache configuration .
The following directive sets the dbm SSL Session Cache for mod_gnutls :
GnuTLSCache dbm " /var/cache/mod_gnutls_cache "
Set a timeout for the SSL Session Cache entries .
Usually , this is set to 300 seconds :
GnuTLSCacheTimeout 300
Finally , specify that on the 192.168.0.1:443 interface and port there will be name - based virtual hosts ; that is vhosts that share the specified interface and port :
NameVirtualHost 192.168.0.1:443
Virtual Host Configuration
The example virtual hosts are : v1.example.org and v2.example.org .
It is assumed that two SSL certificates with the canonical name ( CN ) correctly set to each of the aforementioned vhost domains have been generated .
In the following vhost configs , only the absolutely required directives have been used .
The rest of the options are inherited from the main server .
< VirtualHost 192.168.0.1:443 > ServerName v1.example.org:443 GnuTLSEnable on GnuTLSCertificateFile
/etc/pki_custom/certs/v1.example.org.crt
GnuTLSKeyFile
/etc/pki_custom/private/v1.example.org.key
DocumentRoot " /var/www/v1/public_html " </VirtualHost > < VirtualHost 192.168.0.1:443 > ServerName v2.example.org:443 GnuTLSEnable on GnuTLSCertificateFile
/etc/pki_custom/certs/v2.example.org.crt
GnuTLSKeyFile
/etc/pki_custom/private/v2.example.org.key
DocumentRoot " /var/www/v2/public_html " </ VirtualHost >
Testing the setup
Having finished with the configuration , review the changes , restart the server and check the error logs for any errors .
Use a web browser to visit each of the virtual hosts by using the HTTPS protocol :
https://v1.example.org/
https://v2.example.org/
Until now , the web server did not support the SNI TLS extension .
Therefore , when visiting the v2.example.org virtual host , you would see two warnings in your browser .
The first one would be because the vhost ’s certificate has not been issued by a trusted Certificate Authority – this is normal as it was you who issued that certificate – and the other one because on a server without SNI support it is actually the V1 vhost ’s certificate that is used when visiting V2 vhost over https .
Remember the limitation with SSL and name - based virtual hosts ?
With mod_gnutls , the server supports the SNI TLS extension .
Although the virtual hosts are name - based , no matter which one you visit , the relevant certificate for each vhost is used and the only warning you see is the one about the certificates being self - signed .
You can get rid of these by purchasing a certificate that is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority .
Conclusion
mod_gnutls works .
Actually , it was a real pleasure to see SNI work !
It is important to note though that mod_gnutls is still in experimental phase .
Therefore , performance issues should be considered as normal when using it .
At the moment of writing , my server uses Fedora 7 as an operating system .
As I have n’t upgraded my desktop to F7 yet and my server does not have any development tools installed , I compiled mod_gnutls on a Fedora 6 system and used it on Fedora 7 .
I do not know if that was the reason – and I did not have the necessary free time to investigate – or anything else , but , during the use of mod_gnutls , my server ’s load average increased significantly .
I will test mod_gnutls again soon and post the new results , if they are different than the ones I present in this article .
I highly recommend that you try it , as it is currently the only way to easily achieve SSL - enabled name - based virtual hosts using the SNI TLS extension .
Note , that this extension will be supported by openssl 0.99 , so the moment that SNI goes mainstream and such a setup becomes easy and cheap to implement with any Linux distribution is close .
One last thing that has not been mentioned at all is about SNI support in web browsers .
Currently , with the exception of Safari ( this is unconfirmed , please correct me if I am wrong ) , the latest versions of all major web browsers , Firefox and other Mozilla - based browsers , Internet Explorer , Opera , support SNI .

Many cheap aftershaves contain high levels of ethanol
UK researchers estimated that half of all deaths in working age men in the country are due to hazardous drinking .
The products , which also include herbal tinctures sold in pharmacies , are widely available , cheap and contain up to 97 % alcohol , the Lancet study says .
It was found that they contain very few toxins but are deadly simply because of the extreme alcohol levels .
Russian men have an " exceptionally low " life expectancy of 59 years , compared with 72 years for women .
People are dying because of the concentration of alcohol in a cheap , readily available form
Professor David Leon
Russia 's drink headache Russians dying for a drink
Men of working age are three - and - a - half times more likely to die than men in Britain .
Past studies have shown levels of alcohol consumption among the Russian population , where spirits such as vodka are popular , are high .
But the team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine wanted to take into account non-beverage alcohol .
They looked at 1,750 deaths in men aged 25 to 54 years in 2003 and 2005 in Izhevsk , a typical Russian city in the Western Ural region .
Family members were interviewed about the drinking habits of the deceased .
High mortality
Hazardous drinking - classed as excessive consumption of regular drinks such as beer , wine and spirits or drinking of non-beverage alcohol - was found to cause 43 % of deaths .
Men who drank heavily or who drank non-beverage alcohol , were six times more likely to die than similar men who did not drink at all or did not have a drinking problem .
Those who specifically drank non-beverage alcohol were nine times more likely to die than those who did not .
Lead researcher Professor David Leon said : " We 're talking about things like eau de cologne and aftershave which are widely available at kiosks and cheaper because they are not subject to excise duty .
" The important work we have done is the toxicology and with many of these products all that 's in them is water and ethanol and something to make them smell a bit - people are dying because of the concentration of alcohol in a cheap , readily available form .
" They should be more strictly regulated . "
He said the toll might be even higher as his work only concentrated on men who lived with their families .
Andrew McNeill , director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies said there was a problem with heavy drinking in Eastern Europe in general .
" It has fluctuated in Russia - under Communism , alcohol was the only thing people could afford .
" Gorbachev tried to sober everyone up but he could n't sustain it . "
He added that rapid economic development in recent years may have added to the social problems which often underlie heavy drinking .
" In Western countries , there 's a link between alcohol and health inequalities .
" We do n't find much more heavy drinking in poorer populations but morbidity and mortality tends to be higher because it compounds other problems . "
Dr Jurgen Rehm from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health , Toronto , Canada , said that many factors might have affected death rates in Russia during the time covered by the study , with non-beverage alcohol " highly unlikely to be the main contributor " .

Iraqi volunteers bury more anonymous victims of violence now than during Saddam 's rule : CNN David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday September 14 , 2007
Print This Email This Every month in Iraq hundreds of victims are struck down by sectarian violence or massive bombing campaigns , and a small band of volunteers has taken it upon themselves to give the unclaimed dead a proper burial .
" We 've been doing this for 20 years , under Saddam , but the numbers have increased , as have the difficulties , " Sheik Jamal al - Sudani , who leads the volunteers , tells CNN correspondent Michael Ware .
" Because now it is as if the streets are flowing with blood . "
Before the US invasion of Iraq deposed dictator Saddam Hussein , the volunteers buried up to 40 people every month .
In the war 's worst months , that figure increased 50 - fold as volunteers buried an average of more than 2,000 anonymous war victims , Ware reports .
As the war stretches through its fifth year , several hundred bodies remain unclaimed every month .
The unidentified bodies of men , women and children are found on Iraqi streets and sewers as well as in bombing ruins ; some are " so mangled and charred , they 're unidentifiable , " CNN says , while others are Sunni victims whose families are too fearful from their own lives to visit Iraq 's Health Ministry morgue , which is controlled by Muqtada al - Sadr 's hard - line Shiite followers .
The Shiite volunteers led by al - Sudani bury victims of all religions , and the bodies are photographed and catalogued in a database before they are buried in the Muslim tradition .
Volunteers take the bodies from Baghdad 150 miles away to Najaf where they are buried in hand - dug graves .
Because of the high numbers , two victims often have to share a grave .
Al - Sudani laments the necessity of his work in the war zone .
" " Now you see Iraqis ' houses , meant to be a family 's safest place , have become like graves for their families , because any minute , any second , they 're ready to die by explosion , airstrikes or car bombs , " he says .
" And no man , and no government , American or Iraqi , can fix it because now that will take a miracle . "
The following video is from CNN's Newsroom , broadcast on September 14 .
At any other time , the film would not have been made .
Imagine the pitch : " Let 's steal time and funding from our other projects so we can go way over budget making a cartoon with no jokes , and no real gags .
The score will be a German opera .
Kids wo n't get it .
Most adults wo n't get it , but I do n't care because I think it 's funny . "
Fortunately , the time was 1956 , the director was Chuck Jones , and the place was the Warners Bros. backlot animation studio dubbed " Termite Terrace . "
The result – released 50 years ago this week – was " What 's Opera , Doc? , " voted by animators in the 1994 book The 50 Greatest Cartoons : As Selected by 1,000 Animation Professionals to be the greatest cartoon of all time .
It is the antithesis of the routine cartoon .
In place of snappy one - liners we see Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny singing their parts with complete sincerity and commitment .
The backgrounds are beautifully textured paintings .
The score is powerful and moving .
Bugs cuts a striking figure in a metallic brassiere before Madonna was even born .
It 's audacious and decadent and beautiful and bold and everything the vast majority of cartoons would never dare to be .
Years later , it was my immense pleasure to meet Chuck and spend several hours with him .
Never before , and never since , have I encountered someone as smart , funny , passionate and wry , all rolled into one delightful and charming package .
I can only imagine the magic at work as he and fellow geniuses Friz Freleng , Bob Clampett , Mike Maltese , Maurice Noble , Mel Blanc , Carl Stalling and a host of others created thousands ( yes , thousands ) of cartoons featuring history 's greatest ensemble cast .
Chuck told me he and his team of writers and animators never saw themselves as making cartoons for anyone but themselves .
Months , and sometimes years , passed before their work ended up in theatres , and by then they had made so many new cartoons public reaction just was n't on their radar .
It was because they made cartoons to humour themselves , and because studio executives did n't much care what they did so long as they stayed on time and on budget , that " What 's Opera , Doc ? " was possible .
The key was placing it between two Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner cartoons in the production schedule .
Formulaic by design , those ones could be done fast and cheap .
Knock off the Coyote films ahead of schedule and under budget , reallocate the time and money to " What 's Opera , Doc ? " so the overall budgets remained intact , and voila !
A masterpiece created right under the noses of studio executives who would have vetoed the idea long before Elmer Fudd could have raised his spear and donned his magic helmet .
A few years ago , when I staged a tribute to Chuck and his incredible body of work , showing 15 of his greatest cartoons on the big screen as they were originally meant to be seen , it was n't " What 's Opera , Doc ? " that got the biggest reaction , initially .
The nearly 500 people in attendance gave their most enthusiastic reaction to the opening credits of " One Froggy Evening " featuring Michigan J. Frog , and " Rabbit of Seville , " the famous Bugs Bunny - Elmer Fudd barbershop ditty .
Both great cartoons , to be sure , and both on any animation historian 's top 10 .
The interesting thing was that for weeks afterward , people told me how moved they were by " What 's Opera , Doc ? "
Some had never seen it before .
Others had seen it on TV , but absent the big screen and big sound , they had failed to fall under its spell .
Seeing it that day , the way audiences first saw it in 1957 , they were enthralled .
That 's what makes " What 's Opera , Doc ? " the greatest cartoon ever , and that is why a piece of such grandeur will never be repeated .
That 's not to say good work has n't been done in recent years .
The laughs are plentiful with The Simpsons in its heyday , Family Guy most of the time , and South Park when they find that sweet spot between satire and absurdity .
On the big screen , Pixar tells stories as captivating as the greatest Disney epics of the past , and pulls the viewer into spectacular and compelling worlds .
They are all great in their own way , but they are to be expected .
Animated sitcoms are supposed to be funny and irreverent and mildly scandalous .
Feature films are supposed to have rich character development , radio - worthy songs , and captivating storylines .
Bugs Bunny cartoons are not supposed to feature a lisping Viking rabbit hunter enthusiastically professing his operatic love for a bunny in drag .
These days , cartoons are made for the small screen , for syndication , for licensing , for Happy Meal toys and theme park rides .
Gone are the days when someone like Chuck could trick the system and go on a flight of fancy to animation immortality with such a hugely impractical and absolutely beautiful film .
No one who knows and loves " What 's Opera , Doc ? " will ever hear Wagner 's " Der Ring des Nibelungen " without hearing , in their own minds , " Kill da wabbit . . . kill da wabbit . "
While classical music aficionados may be offended by that fact , I 'm okay with it .
More than okay with it .
Steve Watt owns AnimationConnection.com , Canada 's only studio- authorized animation art gallery .
He is also the proud owner of a rare original production drawing of Elmer Fudd from " What 's Opera , Doc? , " a piece of art he will never sell .

Do n’t ask yourself what the world needs ; ask yourself what makes you come alive .
And then go and do that .
Because what the world needs is people who have come alive .
— Howard Thurman
Life is meant to be an adventure .
If your life is anything less than interesting and inspiring to other people , you ’re doing something wrong .
The range of possible thrills and spills at your disposal is limited only by your imagination and the choices you make .
You are not too old .
You are not too young .
You do n’t need more savings .
You do n’t need to wait until you ’re finished university .
You do n’t need to wait for a better time .
Right now is the only moment you ever have .
There are so many choices that you can make to live an amazing adventure .
Travel the world .
Meet the girl of your dreams .
Start a company .
Learn to fly an airplane .
Move to Japan to become a Go master .
Live in a city whose language you do n’t speak , then learn to talk like a local .
While many people will say that some of these things are out of their reach , the truth is that you ’re only ever either taking action to achieve a specific goal , or making excuses for why you are n’t .
Still , for a lot of people these goals will seem a bit “ over the top ” for their current life situation .
What if you ’ve got one more year left before you get your degree ?
What if you just broke up with your girlfriend / boyfriend and meeting the mate of your dreams is the furthest thing from your mind ?
What if you know you want to travel but you ’re still thousands of dollars away from the bankroll required to jump on a plane to Australia ?
What can you do right now , this afternoon or tonight , to increase your adventure quotient ?
In thinking about this , I wanted to offer something practical .
It had to be something that requires no money , very little time , no planning , and something I ’ve done myself , so that I can legitimately vouch for its effectiveness .
In fact , it ’s something I ’m going to do tonight .
Throw Yourself Into the World
If you feel like your life has become a bit mundane and routine , perhaps even a bit lonely , then let now be the moment that you do something about it .
If you want to shake things up a bit , then do this :
Go out to a social event this evening , by yourself .
That ’s right .
Do n’t invite anyone along .
In fact , some of you wo n’t have any friends to invite .
I ’ll admit it , I ’ve been there many times .
No one needs to know where you ’re going .
You do n’t need permission from your girlfriend or boyfriend .
You just need to choose to make right now a lot more exciting than yesterday .
Your goal for this evening should be just one simple thing : Amuse yourself .
You do n’t need to get any phone numbers .
In fact , you need even make no guarantee that you ’ll actually talk to anyone .
Do n’t scare yourself into submission before you ’ve even left the house .
I ’d strongly recommend this event be something that interests you .
If you claim you “ ca n’t find anything good ” you are n’t looking hard enough .
Here are some ideas :
Art Shows
Book Readings
Rock Concerts
Museum Exhibitions
“ Beginners Night ” Dance Classes
Speed Dating
Outdoor Festivals
Geek Gatherings
Parades / Rallies / Protests
A friend of mine did this a few weeks ago , while in London on a business trip , and ended up finding his way into a fetish party .
The beauty of boldness is that you get to choose your own adventure .
The Benefits of Soloing
There are numerous reasons why I suggest going out on your own from time to time .
If you do this enough , you ’ll eventually get comfortable being yourself around people .
While you should expect your first time to be really scary , even lame perhaps , see the bigger picture .
Do you really think you ’ll still be just as horrified once you ’ve done this 10 times ?
100 times ?
1000 times ?
Planting yourself in social situations actually makes talking to strangers become the path of least resistance .
In fact , you ’ll look a lot more strange if you are n’t talking to people .
Learning to create your own fun gives you more control over your social life .
It means you can make a decision about what you want to do on a given night , even if nobody else wants to or is available to join you .
Suddenly , those awkward moments of waiting around like a loser for your friend to show up at some social gathering become opportunities to meet new people .
This is n’t even about “ picking up ” girls or guys ; it ’s simply a tax - free way to add more fun to your life , that absolutely anyone can do any day of the week .
And even if your ambitions are sexual , going out alone can also be a great advantage .
It makes it easier to control your state of mind .
You do n’t have to worry about “ embarrassing yourself ” in front of your friends or “ looking good ” .
You can just talk to whomever you want and , even if things do go bad , you probably wo n’t see that person again anyway .
But I ’m Too Scared !
Let me start by removing all your worries .
You will encounter all of the following problems :
You wo n’t know what to say when you approach people .
You might end up standing around like a loser .
You ’ll be almost visibly shaking for the first few people you approach .
Some people will think you ’re creepy .
Some people will think you ’re weird because you ’re not out with your friends .
You ’ll tell yourself , “ Oh my God !
This is too hard !
I think I ’ll just rent a movie instead . :/”
Furthermore , you cannot read your way through this .
The only path forward is action .
You can spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on “ self - help books ” that promise to awaken your inner confidence , waste hundreds of hours absorbing that information , and guess what ?
It wo n’t make this even the slightest bit easier .
The quickest , easiest , and cheapest way to get over this hump is to actually do it .
Get out there , screw up badly ( if you ’re new to this , I promise you will ) , and rejoice in your truly impressive ability to feel the fear and do it anyway .
The first time I ever went out solo was when I lived in Quebec City .
I had just moved there , I knew no one , and I did n’t speak the language .
I was one half of a two - person company , so even the office provided almost no potential for social expansion .
I was making $ 30,000 / year , and I lived in a room in a house in suburbia , rented at $ 280 / month .
My roommates , while cool , were n’t exactly the life of the party .
I was living a life way too small for my own spirit .
So after several months of wallowing in my own self - pity , having a truly pathetic social life , I decided I was going to do something about it .
On weekends , I started going out on my own to a local student bar at the university not too far from where I lived .
Being fairly good at pool , I started to make friends around the table , and I actually really started to enjoy these outings .
Eventually I met a girl , and we ended up going out for six months .
I literally created my social and sex life out of thin air .
Not only that , but being with this girl gave me all the more motivation to learn French fluently , which is an adventure in its own right .
Fast forward to today , and the last girl I dated I also met while out at a social gathering on my own .
And , yes , she threw one jab after another at me wondering why I was n’t out with my friends .
While there are some clever lines you can use to respond to these “ shit tests ” , forget about perfecting your scripts .
You do n’t need to be told how to talk to people .
Practice will develop your intuition , and your intuition will help carry your interactions .
This is not about going out to find a sex partner or impress people by being an entertainment monkey .
It ’s about creating your own excitement .
Going out alone is actually a lot more common than you might think .
A couple months ago , I was in Vancouver hanging out with my buddy , and we met a girl who was out by herself .
Then , a few weeks ago I took my brother out to a funky nightclub while he was in town visiting me , and as soon as we walked in , I immediately introduced myself to this gorgeous blonde , who turned out to be a choreographer …and was out by herself !
It ’s fascinating what you become aware of when you ’re not locked into brainless beerversation with your buddies .
If your life is anything less than exciting , you ’re holding yourself back .
While not everyone ’s current life situation makes it practical to travel the world or climb Mount Everest today , there is something everyone can do with no money down , no planning required , and you do n’t even have to sell the idea to anyone else .
Solo socializing is a supreme thrill ride .
Your goal need n’t be to “ pick up women ” or “ meet guys ” .
You ’re under no obligation to even talk to people .
Find social gatherings that interest you and pursue them to your own amusement .
While failure and awkwardness are virtually guaranteed early on , even if you ’re good looking and well - dressed , it will get better .
Social skills require practice , just like anything else , but even a bad night of “ social skydiving ” independently beats any movie watching marathon .
Let 's give the Iraqi puppet government some credit :
At least they have the sense to delicense and order out of the country the Blackwater mercenary outfit .
The real question is why we allow them here in the US .
Recall that FEMA and Homeland Security used heavily armed Blackwater troops in the aftermath of the Katrina disaster in New Orleans .
They were seen wandering around in flak jackets and helmets , with no identifying tags , carrying heavy weapons and M - 16s .
It is not clear how many people they may have killed or injured in those terrible days .
Worse yet , there 's word that Homeland Security has standing contracts with Blackwater and other private mercenary firms for other " national emergency " situations in the US .
This whole concept is an affront to democracy and a grave threat to the survival of our democratic freedoms .
While the rules are often honored in the breach by officers who tape over their badges during operations , the law requires police in the US to identify themselves with badges that show their number clearly , so that if they abuse their power , people know how to file a complaint or a lawsuit , which is the only recourse they have for illegal behavior by police forces .
Police are also supposed to be trained in things like Miranda rights , civil liberties and so on .
Again , while many officers go on and act like laws unto themselves , particularly in poor and minority communities , there is a presumption that they will behave in a law - abiding manner , and when they do n't it is possible to challenge them .
Not so private mercenary " police . "
Such forces have no place in any democratic society , and they have no place in ours .
Nor do they have any place in American military actions overseas .
Bear in mind that the British use of Hessian mercenaries during colonial times was one of the main grievances that fired up American revolutionaries ( although in fairness to the German soldiers - of - fortune , many of them eventually went AWOL and become Americans ) .
Why is n't it being decried as a scandal that today America is increasingly turning over its military and its police to mercenary forces , many of whom are n't even Americans ?
Blackwater , DynCorp and other such firms are hiring Israeli veterans , former South African police , and Latin American graduates of the notorious School of the Americas ( Torture U ) to fill out their ranks , along with veterans of such US outfits as Delta Force , Navy Seals and the Green Berets .
The Iraqis have seen close up the inhumanity and ruthlessness of these mercenary outfits , and are starting to take steps to rein them in or toss them out .
Americans should demand the same here at home .

NOUADHIBOU , Mauritania —
One might ask why any sane person would ride 419 miles through the Sahara in a railroad hopper , scorched by a blazing sun , surrounded by goats , fated to pass 17 hours watching desperate companions relieve themselves over the side of the car .
For one , it is free .
And two , it is virtually the only way to get to Zouerate .
“ Take a car and try to drive , you will be scared to death , ” said Mohamed Vall Ould Cheikh , who has been hopping the train for 12 years .
“ You will be driving in the middle of nowhere , no road , no water and no restaurant .
If your car breaks down , you are dead . ”
One might also ask why any sane person would go to Zouerate ( pronounced zoo - WARE - ate ) , a spot in remote northwest Mauritania whose only feature is a gargantuan open - pit hematite mine .
Yet on any given day in Nouadhibou ( pronounced noh - AH - dee - boo ) , a rough - hewn town of 90,000 on the shores of the luminescent green Atlantic , maybe 100 people are bound and determined to make it to Zouerate — or at least to Choum , a dusty outpost of 5,000 about two - thirds of the way .
The mad rush for the train to Zouerate each afternoon is the best entertainment in Nouadhibou , excepting , perhaps , the sailor - friendly brothel posing as an Asian restaurant on the main strip , the Boulevard Médian .
Turning yourself into a freelancer is easy – you probably want a Ltd. company ( see Part 1 ) and you need to know what you are offering , where you are offering it ( probably local places that you can travel to ) and who you are offering it to .
Articles : Introduction , Successful Freelancing , Talking to People , Making a Sales Call , Books and Resources .
Becoming a successful freelance programmer is harder – you need a constant supply of interesting work which pays well .
You also want clients who will recommend you to others as this simplifies the job of finding new work .
You need interesting work else you will get bored .
You need well - paying work as you have to cover yourself for holidays , sickness , down - time when you search for new work , accountancy fees and tax .
A simple rule of thumb is that you ’ll pay 1/3 of your overall salary to income tax , corporation tax and National Insurance .
Finding new Work
You ’ll spend a lot of time finding new work .
Sometimes you can start straight away , sometimes you have to arrange a start date up to a month in advance .
You do n’t want to be free - wheeling without work so you ’re probably going to be working for 1 client and searching for new work at the same time .
Searching for new work normally means sending emails , knocking on nearby doors ( ideally in places like an Innovation Centre with lots of close and related companies ) and talking to friends in the industry .
Remember – if you run out of work then you have to work hard , without getting paid , to find new work .
This is an easy way to run out of your savings and get in a panic .
This is not nice , it will happen to you , you will work darn hard at solving the problem and you ’ll get out of the mess and learn from it ( I did , several times ) .
Try to avoid it though , it really saps your energy and makes life crappy for a while .
Being a good freelancer
I ’m going to assume that you ’re an honest and reliable person .
Your friends can recommend you in a heart - beat , you can honestly say what you are good ( and bad ) at and you can advise a potential client if you can help them or not .
Be honest and helpful , always recommend other people who might be useful .
Help the potential client to understand what needs solving ( often they need an outsider to help clarify things ) , offer to do some free work with them for an hour or two to help get to the root of any problems .
Give them confidence that they can trust you to solve their problem .
Do n’t be an idiot , never avoid communication , make everything clear ( including costs and hours that you ’ll work ) and clarify what needs delivering and required timescales in writing ( e.g. an email or printed document ) .
Life is easier if both parties agree on what need ’s doing , why it needs doing and how long it should take and cost .
Showing up
Woody Allen ( probably ) said “ Eighty percent of success is showing up . ” .
It surprises me how many people avoid contacting a possible client due to their own fears – they literally talk themselves out of a possible contract .
Remember that if you have skills and you potential client might need those skills , they need to get those skills from somewhere !
Do n’t ignore that client , instead go talk to them .
Analyse their problem , you can always advise them that the problem is outside of your skill set ( bonus points if you can point them at a more skilled associate ) .
I ’ve found a lot of consulting work comes because I :
Talk to someone briefly about what they ’re doing Talk some more , helping them understand the problems they ’ve expressed and if / how you could help Offer to solve their problem
Lesson – talk to many people frequently , ask them what problems they have , try to help solve the problems .
If you know people you can recommend then spread the love and help your associates – what goes around does tend to come around in your favour .
Here ’s another article on successful consulting .
It ’s late .
We had open house for parents at my high school tonight .
It was a very long day .
I ’m exhausted .
But this got me riled up enough to write something …
Russell ( an atheist ) and Ginny ( an agnostic atheist ) have lived in their neighborhood for six years .
They have n’t spoken to their religious neighbors in about five … until now .
What ’s up with that ?
Russell says this :
When we first moved in , they were friendly and invited us to church , which we politely declined .
We used to host a regular gaming night with our mostly atheist friends .
They started asking “ Why are there so many cars here on Mondays , and what are all those bumper stickers about ? ”
So my wife told them .
And that ’s about the time they stopped talking to us .
I never felt like it was outright hostility , but she did .
In any case , we have n’t had much contact .
The atheist couple also has agave plants on the sidewalk near their driveway , close to the street .
Russell adds : “ They ’re sharp spiky plants , but that ’s not so unusual ; there are a number of neighbors around the block who have a cactus or two . ”
One of those plants was mutilated over the weekend :
The couple suspected their Christian neighbors were responsible .
So Russell went over to their house to ask them about it :
… I had a seat on their couch , they took positions opposite me , and the husband had his arms folded the whole time and a very sullen scowl on his face .
Yes , he cut down the agave .
I received a lecture on how dangerous it is to the neighborhood kids , and all sorts of gruesome scenarios about eyes being poked out .
But what struck Ginny and me as weird later was when we realized that they had n’t cut any of the spines facing the sidewalk — only the side on the street .
( Again , see the picture . ) …
I took all this politely and said I understood their concerns , and is there anything else ?
Then we got into the bumper stickers .
The wife said several times that they “ make her sick ” and she is very angry that we disrespect her religion .
That she could never be friends with someone who does n’t “ share her values . ”
That she is firmly set in her beliefs and would never change them .
Not that anyone asked them to change their beliefs .
Even if the bumper stickers are offensive , they ’re not personal attacks on the neighbors .
And no one is knocking on their door trying to convince them to become atheists .
For the record , though , what did the bumper stickers say ?
Ginny tells us :
One sticker says “ Freedom From Religion ” but you ’d think it said “ kill kittens ” or something equally terrible the way they reacted over it .
If it were n’t for people like them , there would be no need for bumper stickers that display a free thinker ’s sentiments .
To add insult to injury , the Christians also criticized the “ general awful nature of [ Russell and Ginny ’s ] yard . ”
A yard that is mowed weekly , by the way , and seems to be perfectly fine .
Ginny shares her thoughts on the incident :
It was n’t an act of kindness or neighborly caring that drove this man to mutilate my poor agave , it was an act of a bigot who holds nothing but disdain for us because we believe differently from him .
He is a Christian ( the kind that gives Christianity a bad name ) and we are atheists .
In his mind he has all the justification he needs to break the law by not only trespassing , but to vandalize as well , because we do n’t matter as far as he is concerned .
He views us as the lowest of the low and we do n’t deserve to be treated with respect .
The police were called about the trespassing and vandalism .
Here ’s Russell again :
… Before I left for work we were visited by a very cheerful and friendly cop , who got to hear all about the history and laughed at the notion that our yard would be an eyesore to anyone .
We did n’t want to file charges .
He offered to go over there and talk with them , even give a warning that they could be arrested if they were on our property again .
We declined that too .
I said I ’m still hoping that the husband will come over and work things out amicably .
But I did happen to glance over at the neighbor ’s house while the cop car was in our driveway , and I saw the window blinds being pulled up .
It was bright outside and I did n’t get to see the expression on her face as she watched us talk to the policeman , clearly discussing our plant .
But I have a pretty good imagination and I have to admit , it was kind of satisfying .
Ginny ( jokingly ) says she is now more tempted to get anti-religious bumper stickers in response .
In all seriousness , she says this :
I think as angry as I am over this , I should turn the other cheek so to speak and show them how nice people behave .
It ’s a good move , to show these Christians the type of humanism that they can’t seem to grasp with their religion .

Chest compressions help pump blood round the body
Not only are bystanders less likely to help someone who has collapsed if they have to do mouth - to - mouth ventilation , many are unable to perform it properly .
Chest compressions alone are just as good if not better in most cases , a Japanese study in The Lancet shows .
They recommend resuscitation trainers revise their advice .
But the British Heart Foundation disagrees .
The current advice is to give mouth - to - mouth ventilation unless you are unable , or are unwilling .
' Yuk ' factor
Studies show less than a third of people who collapse in public are helped by a bystander .
HOW TO GIVE CPR
Is the patient unresponsive ?
If so , shout for help Open airway
If they 're not breathing normally , call 999
Then give 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 times a minute Next , give two rescue breaths , then 30 chest compressions ... repeat Source : Resuscitation Council ( UK )
Surveys reveal many would - be first - aiders are put off by the idea of giving the kiss of life - for fear of catching an infectious disease , for example .
And when bystanders do assist , giving mouth - to - mouth can steal time from giving essential chest compressions .
Furthermore , if the patient has collapsed because of a heart rather than a lung problem they should already have enough oxygen in their body to keep them going without needing rescue breaths from a bystander .
Dr Ken Nagao and colleagues at the Surugadai Nihon University Hospital in Tokyo say in these circumstances it would be better for all parties to stick to giving chest compressions alone , which they called cardiac - only resuscitation .
Chest compressions 'key
They checked their theory by looking at the outcomes of more than 4,000 adult patients who had been helped by bystanders .
They found chest - compression - only resuscitation was the clear winner compared with conventional CPR ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation , or mouth - to - mouth breathing together with chest compressions ) .
Colin Elding of the British Heart Foundation said a number of studies had shown it could be as effective as combined mouth - to - mouth ventilation and compression in many cases .
But he said it was right for CPR guidelines to still include mouth - to - mouth .
He added : " The current guidelines state , however , that for ' lay person ' CPR , if the rescuer is unwilling or unable to give rescue breaths they should give chest compressions only and that these should be continuous at a rate of 100 per minute .
The BHF believes this is sound advice .
" Cardiac arrests are a serious problem in the UK , which is why the BHF recently launched its Doubt Kills campaign , to encourage people experiencing potential heart attack symptoms to call 999 . "
The Consumer Overdraft Protection Fair Practices
Act , scheduled for a vote in the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday , could go a long way to reduce the hidden overdraft fees paid by every day Americans to their banks , which total $ 17.5 billion per year according to the Center for Responsible Lending .
Overdraft protection , a feature of a checking account that is regularly offered to bank customers as a convenience , has transformed into an excessive fee machine — often costing customers up to $ 35 per transaction .
The original intent of such programs was to save customers from the embarrassment of a bounced check .
But instead , overdraft protection has transformed into a kind of inadvertent short - term loan product .
When a customer overdraws his or her account , the bank extends funds to the merchant rather than denying the transaction .
If the fees charged were converted into an annual percentage rate , the effective APR could be 1,000 percent or above .
Many Americans have their own nightmarish stories about how their supposedly friendly bank charged them a fee upwards of $ 35 for what really amounted to a simple math error or an honest mistake .
Two - thirds of bank customers believe that permitting overdrafts and then charging fees without their consent is unfair , according to a 2004 survey by the Consumer Federation of America .
The Consumer Overdraft Protection Fair Practices Act , introduced by Rep. Carolyn Maloney ( D - NY ) , has a simple premise : it would require both new and existing accountholders to opt-in to overdraft protection systems rather than being enrolled in them automatically .
That is , customers should be able to choose if they want overdraft protection as it operates today or if they would rather not pay the fee and thus not give the bank permission to honor transactions that overdraw .
Rep .
Maloney ’s bill would also require banks to give their customers clearer information about the cost of overdraft protection .
Customers could therefore better compare this service to its less - costly alternatives , such as linking their checking account to their savings account or to a line of credit .
While customers are certainly responsible for understanding the terms and conditions of their checking accounts , banks currently seem to go out of their way to shroud important information about their accounts .
A survey by the Woodstock Institute showed that many banks process a customer ’s largest transactions first , increasing the likelihood that smaller subsequent transactions will incur additional overdraft fees .
In other cases , banks fail to warn customers before they make debit card or ATM transactions that the transaction will overdraw their account .
And in most cases , an overdraft fee is levied for each transaction made , not just for the first transaction that pushes the account below zero .
That ’s what makes Rep .
Maloney ’s bill so important : by choosing to opt - out of these expensive overdraft protection systems , all of these tricks and traps would be eliminated .
In reality , overdraft protection disproportionately affects those Americans who have very little in their checking accounts , and who are least able to afford these costly and excessive bank fees .
Americans are ready for financial services that help them build credit and build assets to get ahead , not financial services riddled with tricks and traps that leave them a step behind .
The passage of the Consumer Overdraft Protection Fair Practices
Act is a key step toward fixing the deficiencies in our nation ’s financial services industry to make it easier for those who work hard to pay the bills on time to access the tools necessary to climb the ladder in America .
Only a few days after Corel issued a WinDVD update to close the hole opened by AACS hackers , the folks at the Doom9 forums sent word that they have found yet another way around the copy protection for high definition discs .
This time , the method involved the Xbox 360's HD DVD add - on drive to capture the " Volume Unique Keys " as they were being read by the drive itself .
Rather than just point out the crack , we 're going to take a closer look at how this crack was accomplished , because one of the hackers involved in the crack says that it 's more or less unstoppable .
The latest attack vector bypasses the encryption performed by the Device Keys — the same keys that were revoked by the WinDVD update — and the so - called " Host Private Key , " which as yet has not been found .
This was accomplished by de-soldering the HD DVD drive 's firmware chip , reading its contents , and then patching it .
Once that was done , the firmware was soldered back onto the drive .
Despite the technical difficulty of performing this hack , it does offer some advantages in the race to beat AACS copy protection .
" They can not revoke this hack , " said forum member arnezami , who has been at the center of much of the AACS cracking recently .
" No matter how many Private Host Keys they revoke we will still be able to get Volume IDs using patched xbox 360 HD DVD drives . "
Simplified high - def decryption diagram , courtesy of arnezami .
" Kvu " is the volume license key .
In addition to being irrevocable , the hack has the potential to make future decryption even easier .
" This hack / technique enables us to figure out how the Volume ID is stored on the disc , " arnezami explained .
" It 's very possible we would figure out [...] how the KCD is stored on the disc .
Knowing that and being able to teach a PC drive how to read a KCD will open the door for what I called third - generation decryption . "
While this type of decryption ( reading keys directly off a PC drive by sidestepping part of the encryption process ) is still not a reality , it may not be too far off .
The main issue is the cost of purchasing standalone high - def players by the hackers , but as prices for these come down , this problem will slowly go away .
Although AACS has proven much more difficult to fully crack than the copy protection on regular DVDs , it is unlikely to remain only partially cracked for very long .
The real problem with trying to create an " uncrackable " copy protection is that the media must come with the keys used to decrypt it somewhere on the device and the media itself .
Hiding these keys in different places — security by obscurity — merely delays the inevitable .
Of course , for the content providers , any delay is still better than no delay at all , so expect the battles between copy protection and hackers to continue .
Total stream processors and quantification over infinite number of infinite streams
The present message recasts the recent Martín Escardó ’s article on satisfaction of total computable predicates over all Cantor numbers in terms of explicit streams and depth - limited depth - first search .
This alternative point of view may make it easier to see why the satisfaction problem is decidable .
We show how to add transparent memoization to stream predicates : without changing their code , we can cause our predicates to apply themselves to partially available data and yield the residual .
For dense predicates our code is about 9 times more efficient than the most sophisticated Martín Escardó ’s code .
Our approach is particularly fast at reporting dissatisfaction .
The complete code for this article is available at http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/StreamPEval.hs
In a recent article Martín Escardó wrote about decidable checking of satisfaction of a total computable predicate on Cantor numerals .
The latter represent infinite bit strings , or real numbers within [ 0,1 ] .
http://math.andrej.com/2007/09/28/seemingly-impossible-functional-programs/
Martín Escardó ’s technique can tell , in finite time , if a given total computable predicate is satisfied over all possible infinite bit strings .
( The cardinality of the set of Cantor numerals is greater than that of natural numbers ) .
Furthermore , for sparse predicate ( defined below ) , Martín Escardó ’s technique is very fast .
The mystery of Martín Escardó article is revealed by noticing that the predicate in question must be total and computable .
We can represent any predicate p on Cantor numbers ( i.e. , on infinite bit strings ) as a function [ Bit ] -> Maybe Bool .
Given a finite prefix of the infinite bit string , the predicate returns True or False – or requests to be given a longer prefix .
We shall assume all predicates to be monotone in that once the predicate returned Just True or Just False on some prefix , it will return the same result on any longer prefix .
Undecidability of p comes in two forms :
First , a predicate may fail to return any result , by looping or raising a run-time error like stack overflow .
Second , the predicate may keep returning Nothing asking for longer and longer prefix .
A total computable predicate has none of the above problems .
Given a prefix , it always ( in finite time ) returns the answer .
Furthermore , for each predicate there exists a number N so that the predicate will return either Just True or Just False for any prefix of the length N .
In other words , given progressively longer prefixes , the total computable predicate will give the answer Nothing only finitely many times .
It is clear then we can check the satisfaction of the total computable predicate over all Cantor numerals , using , for example , iterative deepening strategy .
Since we are guaranteed there exists a depth ( prefix length ) so that the predicate returns either True or False and no further increase in depth changes the result , the strategy is complete .
Some “ obvious ” predicates are alas not in the class of total computable .
For example , equality of two Cantor numerals .
Mathematically speaking , we can tell if any two Cantor numbers are the same or different .
One can hardly build any mathematical theory if one cannot identify its objects .
Computationally speaking , equality is only semi-decidable .
If two Cantor numbers are different , they differ in at least one bit at a finite index .
That difference can be detected in finite time .
Deciding if two numbers ( infinite bit streams ) are the same is not generally computable .
More precisely , the paper
G. Rosu , Equality of streams is a Pi^0_2 - Complete Problem , ICFP06
proved that deciding equality of two infinite ( bit ) streams is equivalent to the Halting problem .
In the context of Martín Escardó ’s article , we can define a binary equality predicate ceq and an ( unary ) predicate badp1 :
ceq c1 c2 = foldr ( \i r -> r && c1 i == c2 i ) True [ 0 ..] badp1 a = ceq ( Zero # a ) a
If we add this code to the one in Martín Escardó ’s article and use his forsome quantifier to check the satisfaction of badp1 – ( forsome badp1 ) – we get the stack overflow error .
However , mathematically speaking badp1 is satisfiable , by the Cantor number represented by the infinite string of zero bits .
We have encountered incompleteness – the satisfaction of badp1 is true but we ca n’t compute it .
The original Martín Escardó ’s article represented Cantor numbers as functions from a bit index to the bit value .
We chose a different approach , a pair of a finite prefix and a function to extend this prefix .
Rather than using a list of bits , we chose a finite map ( from bit indices to their values ) to represent the finite prefix .
data Bit = Zero |
One deriving ( Eq , Show ) type Prefix = M.IntMap Bit data Cantor = Cantor Prefix ( Prefix -> Cantor )
Here is one Cantor number , an alternating stream of one and zero bits .
twothirds = twothirds1 0 M.empty where twothirds0 i pr = Cantor ( M.insert i Zero pr ) ( twothirds1 ( succ i ) ) twothirds 1 i pr = Cantor ( M.insert i One pr ) ( twothirds0 ( succ i ) )
As was mentioned already , a function on Cantor numbers takes a finite prefix and either produces a value or reports “ failure ” ( hence the monadic type ) :
type CantorFN m a = Prefix -> m a
The failure means the given data are not sufficient to compute the result and so the function ought to be called with a longer prefix .
If the monad in question is the Maybe monad ( with Nothing indicating failure ) , we define the application of a function to a Cantor number as follows :
capply1 :: CantorFN Maybe a -> Cantor -> a capply1 f ( Cantor pr next ) = maybe ( capply1 f ( next pr ) ) id ( f pr )
Quite literally , we feed the function a progressively longer prefix until the function succeeds and yields the value .
For a total computable function , that moment shall happen sooner or later .
We can define a few sample functions on Cantor numbers .
To make them easier to write , we assume ( m a ) is in Num provided that a is .
We further define a method to extract a bit from the prefix , of fail trying .
class Monad m =>
GetBit m where getbit :: Prefix -> Int -> m Natural
For the Maybe monad , we have
instance Num a =>
Num ( Maybe a ) where (+ ) = lift M2 (+ ) ( -) = liftM2 ( -) ( *) = lift M2 (*) fromInteger = return .
fromInteger instance GetBit Maybe where getbit pr i = liftM coerce ( M.lookup i pr )
The first sample function on Cantor numbers is
proj i = \pr -> getbit pr i
which returns the i-th bit of a number .
More sophisticated are the following functions , originally introduced in Martín Escardó ’s article .
We keep their original notation in comments , to contrast his and our notations .
-- f , g , h :: Cantor ->
Integer f , g , h : : ( GetBit m , Num ( m Natural ) ) => CantorFN m Natural -- f a = coerce ( a ( 7 * coerce(a 4 ) + 4 * ( coerce (a 7 ) ) + 4 ) ) f a = getbit a =<< ( 7 * ( getbit a 4 ) + 4 * ( getbit a 7 ) + 4 ) -- g a = coerce ( a( coerce (a 4 ) + 11 * ( coerce (a 7 ) ) ) ) g a = getbit a =<< ( getbit a 4 + 11 * ( getbit a 7 ) ) -- h a = if a 7 == Zero -- then if a 4 == Zero then coerce ( a 4 ) else coerce ( a 11 ) -- else if a 4 ==
One then coerce ( a 15 ) else coerce (a 8 ) h a = ifm ( ( == 0 ) `liftM` getbit a 7 ) ( ifm ( ( == 0 ) `liftM` getbit a 4 ) ( getbit a 4 ) ( getbit a 11 ) ) ( ifm ( ( == 1 ) `liftM` getbit a 4 ) ( getbit a 15 ) ( getbit a 8 ) ) ifm test tb eb = do b <- test ; if b then tb else eb
The following function is not present in Martín Escardó ’s article .
It converts the prefix of the width w of a Cantor number to an Integer .
The function is , too , total , and dense : it uses all of the bits from its argument , up to a certain limit .
In contrast , ( proj i ) is an ultimate “ sparse ” function : of all the bits in the given prefix it uses only one for its result .
-- ton w a = foldl ( \ac i -> 2 * ac + coerce ( a i ) ) 0 [ 0 ..w - 1 ] ton w a = foldl ( \ac i -> 2 * ac + getbit a i ) 0 [ 0..w- 1 ]
For example , capply1 ( ton 5 ) twothirds gives the answer 21 ( which is 10101 in binary ) .
We now come to quantification : given a total computable predicate , CantorFN Maybe Bool , we check to see if it is satisfiable .
If so , we return the witness , a Cantor number that makes the predicate succeed with a True value .
The following predicate uses the standard recursive depth - first search , with no memoization .
search1 :: CantorFN Maybe Bool ->
Maybe Cantor search1 p = s0 M.empty 0 where s0 pr i = let pr ' = M.insert i Zero pr i' = succ i in case p pr ' of Just True ->
Just $ Cantor pr' ( zeros i ' )
Nothing | c@( Just _) <- s0 pr ' i' -> c _ -> s1 pr i s1 pr i = let pr ' = M.insert i One pr i' = succ i in case p pr ' of Just True ->
Just $ Cantor pr' ( zeros i' ) Nothing -> s0 pr ' i' Just False ->
Nothing
Definitions of more conventional quantifiers from Martín Escardó ’s paper is straightforward :
forsome1 , forevery1 :: CantorFN Maybe Bool ->
Bool forsome1 p = maybe False ( const True ) ( search1 p ) forevery 1 p = not ( forsome1 ( liftM not . p ) ) -- equal :: Eq y => ( Cantor -> y ) -> ( Cantor -> y ) ->
Bool equal1 f g = forevery1 ( \a -> liftM2 ( == ) ( f a ) ( g a ) )
Time for some tests :
tests11 = equal1 ( proj 14 ) ( proj 14 ) -- Martín Escardó 's find_i result : ( 1.82 secs , 39783148 bytes ) -- ours : ( 0.42 secs , 22456632 bytes ) tests12 = equal1 ( proj 14 ) ( proj 15 ) -- Martín Escardó 's find_i result : ( 3.64 secs , 79934000 bytes ) -- ours : ( 0.00 secs , 0 bytes ) tests13 = equal1 ( ton 14 ) ( ton 14 ) -- Martín Escardó 's find_i result : ( 5.98 secs , 153746524 bytes ) -- ours : ( 2.96 secs , 245394268 bytes ) tests14 = equal1 ( ton 14 ) ( ton 15 ) -- Martín Escardó 's find_i result : ( 12.85 secs , 325268744 bytes ) -- ours : ( 0.00 secs , 0 bytes ) tests15 = equal1 ( ton 15 ) ( ton 15 ) -- Martín Escardó 's find_i result : ( 13.61 secs , 342230580 bytes ) -- ours : ( 6.03 secs , 524111536 bytes )
The tests are satisfying in one respect .
Still , the inefficiency is obvious .
If we enable tracing of each bit retrieval and evaluate capply1 ( ton 3 ) twothirds , we see
bit 0 : 1 no bit 1 bit 0 : 1 bit 1 : 0 no bit 2 bit 0 : 1 bit 1 : 0 bit 2 : 1 5
The predicate ton 3 requested bit 0 and got it .
It then requested bit 1 and did n’t get , and so failed .
The Cantor number computed bit 1 as requested , and the predicate is re-invoked .
It again requests the bit 0 , and bit 1 .
Now it needs bit 2 , and so it fails .
The Cantor numeral computes bit 2 , re-invokes the predicate , which proceeds to retrieve the bits it retrieved already .
Memoization would help .
As it turns out , we can impose memoization transparently , without changing the code of the functions .
We can cause the function to compute the result of their partial application to available bits .
We refine the Maybe monad to return not just the indicator of failure ( meaning , the request for a longer prefix ) .
Rather , we return a function that takes the longer prefix ; that new function – the continuation – is in general specialized to the already seen prefix :
data Inc a = Done a | More ( Prefix -> Inc a )
The following instances show that once some data is available , they can be used right away :
instance Monad Inc where return = Done ( Done x ) >>= k = k x ( More f ) >>= k = More ( \pr -> f pr >>= k ) instance GetBit
Inc where getbit pr i = maybe ( More ( \pr -> getbit pr i ) ) ( return . coerce ) ( M.lookup i pr )
We should modify our previous capply to use the residualized , partially applied predicate .
The changes compared to capply1 are trivial :
capply2 :: CantorFN Inc a -> Cantor -> a capply2 f ( Cantor pr next ) = case f pr of Done x -> x More f -> capply2 f ( next pr )
More importantly though , none of the previously defined functions on Cantor numbers , e.g. , f , h , ton , proj , need to be re-defined .
They can be used as they are .
We may evaluate capply2 ( ton 3 ) twothirds and see the difference :
bit 0 : 1 no bit 1 bit 1 : 0 no bit 2 bit 2 : 1 5
Once bit i has been requested and received , it is no longer retrieved again .
After we modify search1 along the lines of capply2 ( please see the complete code ) , we repeat the stress tests :
tests23 = equal2 ( ton 14 ) ( ton 14 ) -- Martín Escardó 's find_i result : ( 5.98 secs , 153746524 bytes ) -- Ours : ( 0.70 secs , 27485480 bytes ) tests24 = equal2 ( ton 14 ) ( ton 15 ) -- Martín Escardó 's find_i result : ( 12.85 secs , 325268744 bytes ) -- ours : ( 0.00 secs , 0 bytes ) tests25 = equal2 ( ton 15 ) ( ton 15 ) -- Martín Escardó 's find_i result : ( 13.61 secs , 342230580 bytes ) -- ours : ( 1.41 secs , 55052820 bytes )
And one more before the day ’s round of media stuff begins .
Another weirdly persistent myth is that rich people vote Democratic , while working stiffs vote Republican .
Here ’s Tucker Carlson :
OK , but here ’s the fact that nobody ever , ever mentions — Democrats win rich people .
Over 100,000 in income , you are likely more than not to vote for Democrats .
People never point that out .
Rich people vote liberal .
I do n’t know what that ’s all about
Actually , people mention this alleged fact all the time — but the truth is just the opposite .
From the 2006 exit polls :
VOTE BY INCOME TOTAL Democrat Republican
Less Than $ 100,000 ( 78 % ) 55 % 43 %
$ 100,000 or More ( 22 % ) 47 % 52 %
And the fact that people with higher incomes are more likely to vote Republican has been consistently true since 1972 .
The interesting question is why so many pundits know for a fact something that simply ai n’t so .
Burma 's generals have come down hard on the monks
Ye Min Tun , a foreign ministry official for 10 years , said Burma 's generals had ignored the people 's desire for them to negotiate with opposition activists .
At least 10 people died and thousands were arrested when troops used force to end peaceful anti-government marches .
Burma 's leaders have now appointed a go - between for opposition talks .
An official had been charged with liaising with detained pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi , state media reported on Monday .
I have never seen such a scenario in the whole of my life
Ye Min Tun
Burmese official
Ms Suu Kyi's party , the National League for Democracy , welcomed the appointment , saying : " Finding a solution through dialogue is the natural way to help the people and the country . "
The party won a landslide election victory in 1990 , but the ruling generals have never allowed them to govern .
Correspondents say the move , recommended by UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari when he visited the country last week , seems to be a concession to international pressure .
Countries including the US , UK and France are campaigning for sanctions against the regime , but Burma 's neighbours oppose such action .
On Tuesday , China 's foreign ministry reiterated its position , saying " sanctions or pressure will not help to solve the issue " .
' Decisive factor '
The government 's crackdown has seen curfews imposed in Burma 's main cities , and frequent night - time raids on monasteries and private homes .
Ye Min Tun , who describes himself as a " good Buddhist " , sent a letter of resignation to the Burmese embassy in London .
In an interview with the BBC , he described the crackdown on the September protesters as " horrible " .
" I have never seen such a scenario in the whole of my life .
The government is arresting and beating the peaceful Buddhist monks . "
He said he had hoped that the protests would force the generals to come to an agreement with the opposition .
" This revolution , this incident seemed to be the decisive factor that could persuade the government to go to the negotiation table .
" But actually the government ignored the reality , " he said .
I was clandestine in my actions , but I did n’t feel too much shame about any of this — nose picking was too much something I had to do .
But as I got older , the lamp was looking more and more terrible , and there was talk of throwing it out .
I secretly tried to clean it , but the blue - green streaks would not go away .
But I did n’t want this lamp to be forsaken by my family ; things back then , objects , were nearly animate to me , dear even , and to lose a thing from the living room , my special room of TV and darkness , would be terrible .
I wanted everything to stay the same forever ; and , too , I felt horribly guilty that I was killing this lamp .
So I pleaded with my parents on its behalf , told them I loved the lamp , and it was n’t thrown away .
With this reprieve , I tried not to wipe my snots on it anymore , to only coat the bottom of the coffee table and feed my beautiful dog , but sometimes I would weaken , and I ’d find a new unstreaked spot — I could feel them with my fingers — and so I ’d make my mark , my hydrocarbonated snot — there must be hydrogen and carbon in my mucous , all the elements of the world must be in me , in everyone — would mingle with the copper and make a union , a new thing , alchemically , chemically , pigmentally .
And that thing was the color bice , a good color , I think , because it has brought back to me that TV and darkened living room and childhood and lamp and coffee table and beloved dog — all things gone a long time ago .
All things that did n’t last forever .

UFO observed on the moon by Italian Astronomers
by Dhiram Shah
During routine observations of the cosmos , Italian astronomers have recently spotted and tracked on video an Unidentified Flying Object or UFO .
It may look like a bug on the lens it is not because when zoomed the object would look much bigger .
If it is a UFO , boy it surely is big and moving very fast .
I do believe Aliens exist , what about you ?
Take our poll .
Thanks Michael

A day after the Vermont Senate voted to impeach the President , supporters are now calling on the house to follow suit .
At City Hall in Burlington , dozens of people gathered to say thank you to the 16 Senators who passed Friday ’s landmark resolution .
A similar resolution may be considered in the House on Wednesday .
( More )
Upon the VT House passing this resolution , the U.S. House would then be prompted to act on impeachment according their own rules ( Jefferson ’s Manual ) .
What can WE do ?

HANOI , Vietnam —
It was midnight here in Hanoi , or already 2 a.m. back in Seoul , South Korea .
But after a five - hour flight on a recent Sunday , Kim Wan-su was driven straight from the airport to the Lucky Star karaoke bar here , where 23 young Vietnamese women seeking Korean husbands sat waiting in two dimly lighted rooms .
“ Do I have to look at them and decide now ? ” Mr. Kim asked , as the marriage brokers gave a brief description of each of the women sitting around a U - shaped sofa .
Thus , Mr. Kim , a 39 - year - old auto parts worker from a suburb of Seoul , began the mildly chaotic , two - hour process of choosing a spouse .
In a day or two , if his five - day marriage tour went according to plan , he would be wed and enjoying his honeymoon at the famed Perfume Pagoda on the Huong Tich Mountain southwest of here .
More and more South Korean men are finding wives outside of South Korea , where a surplus of bachelors , a lack of marriageable Korean partners and the rising social status of women have combined to shrink the domestic market for the marriage - minded male .
Bachelors in China , India and other Asian nations , where the traditional preference for sons has created a disproportionate number of men now fighting over a smaller pool of women , are facing the same problem .
Drug companies care about what your doctor prescribes just as much as you do - and they 're paying big money to find out .
They are paying so much , in fact , that even though the vast majority of physicians disapprove of the sale of their personal prescribing data for marketing purposes , the American Medical Association persists in selling detailed physician information to the pharmaceutical industry .
This data must be used for legitimate public health research - not brand promotion .
Drug ads cover doctors ' offices , coating everything from wall calendars and paperweights to stethoscopes and prescription pads .
The numbers show that these advertisements work : doctors are prescribing more brand - name , higher - cost drugs than ever before .
One of the less obvious but more intrusive marketing tools is the drug rep 's hand - held computer , which contains a detailed profile of your doctor 's prescribing history .
Armed with the knowledge of each doctor 's individual prescribing habits , pharmaceutical sales representatives tailor their pitches to each physician .
This strategy has resulted in new , costlier drugs replacing established medications that have proven histories of safety and effectiveness .
Industry profits swell , as do the nation 's health care costs .
Few people recognize the role the AMA plays in making physician information available to companies that use it for pharmaceutical marketing purposes .
The AMA sells information from its physician " Masterfile " to health information organizations that pair the identifying information with prescribing records from pharmacies and sell the whole package to pharmaceutical companies , a practice commonly called " prescription data - mining . "
The AMA profits handsomely from this agreement .
In 2005 , the AMA made more than $ 44 million from the sale of database products , approximately 16 percent of its budget .
It comes as no surprise , then , that the sale of prescriber information failed to make the formal agenda when AMA delegates met in Chicago last month .
Yet among physicians there is a growing and vigorous debate about the appropriateness of this practice and its enhancement of pharmaceutical marketing .
Despite representing less than 30 percent of all U.S. doctors , the AMA keeps identifying information on all licensed physicians - and sells it all .
Even so , only 60 percent of physicians surveyed by the Kaiser Family Foundation were aware of the sale of their information .
Once told , 74 percent disapproved .
Even a survey by the AMA itself found a 66 percent disapproval rate .
A number of policymakers , physician groups and medical societies have come out against this practice in recent years .
Leaders include the National Physicians Alliance , the American Medical Student Association , the Vermont Medical Society and the New Hampshire Medical Society .
Unfortunately , the AMA has a financial incentive to keep selling this information without regard to how it is being used or the impact it has on patient care and health - care costs .
A growing number of states have taken measures to end data mining because the AMA will not .
Maine and Vermont recently passed legislation banning the sale of information detailing what drugs doctors are prescribing their patients while New Hampshire , the first state to pass such legislation , saw the data mining companies challenge the law .
A federal court overturned the law banning the sale of prescription information " on free speech " grounds and the case in now being appealed by New Hampshire .
Last year , in response to this growing pressure , the AMA created an " opt- out " measure , called the Prescribing Data Restriction Program .
Difficult to navigate , poorly publicized , with only a quarter of physicians are aware of it , and used by less than 1 percent of doctors , the opt - out program is a step toward reform , but a small and inadequate one .
The program does not bar the sale of prescriber information to pharmaceutical companies ; it merely requests and then relies on the industry to prevent the transmission of this data to its sales teams .
By continuing to profit from the sale of physician data , the AMA has shown itself to be at best , slow - to - act , and at worst , opportunistic at the expense of professional boundaries .
The AMA should put medical ethics before profits and stop licensing its Physician Masterfile for pharmaceutical marketing purposes .

EUGENE --
A seat belt saved a driver , police say , but not in the usual way .
Steven Earp , 48 , was eating a fast - food sandwich Wednesday morning , said police Sgt. Doug Mozan .
Earp choked and blacked out .
His 1997 Honda sedan hit a parked car .
After the wreck , Earp came to .
Mozan attributed his revival to a " seat - belt - induced Heimlich maneuver . "
Witnesses told police Earp got out of his car , and they asked if he was OK .
" No , I 'm not , " he said , and collapsed again .
Paramedics revived him and took him to the hospital , where doctors determined he had n't been injured .
" We urge people to take the extra time to pull over to the side of the road to enjoy your breakfast sandwiches , " said Mozan .
" The fact that it was a nonfatal accident was extremely lucky .
He did n't choke to death or take anyone else with him . "
I came in off the street into an Access / VB / SQL shop after a summer spent reading books about Excel macros .
I was disappointed in myself for not being able to grok the O’Reilly book by itself and having to resort to a 21 days book , but functions were a new concept at the time and there was lots to play with .
It was distinctly comforting to me then than Basic had not only survived , but was bolted onto the market dominating office suite of the day .
( Yeah , I was nostalgic about buying magazines that had type - in programs in them . )
For months I frantically coded during the day and read programming books when I went home .
Early on I realized that one of my first assignments was so impossibly designed that the 60 + year old lady that would end up using it would never be able to master it .
Very close to the go - live date , I proposed changing the design to use a tree - view control and a streamlined approach … my boss grudgingly agreed and I ended up finishing it on site with the client ’s big cheese smoking a stinky cigar while looking over my shoulder .
Later on a comp - sci student came to work with us .
He was a very slick middle - eastern guy ; always wore nice suits .
He did okay around the shop , I guess … but one night I get a call from him to please come over to the university lab .
He needed help with a class assignment .
It was pretty lame , but I managed to fix it for him in ten minutes or so .
It felt weird bailing guys like this out .
I was a faker … a charlatan .
No training and no education … just a few months job experience .
Fast forward to now .
I get to work with guys that have Master ’s Degrees .
Woo - hoo .
But I ca n’t relate to them , somehow .
I ’m always flirting with some new idea … and I ’m never content unless I have some crazy mad - scientist scheme being developed in some obscure folder on my hard drive .
And these other guys … they just never have anything technical they want to talk about .
There ’s never a technique or idea or tool that they get excited about and have to discuss over lunch .
They ’re are actually content with the status - quo… which is strange given how annoying and unreliable things can be .
And if I go off on some technical tangent … there ’s actually someone around that ’s going to call me a nerd .
Dude : we ’re computer programmers .
We code for a living .
Are n’t we nerds by definition ?!
I guess not .
We… as a group … are something else entirely .
We ’re all CodeMungers .
A CodeMunger has no need to master Data Structures , Classic Algorithms , or Regular Expressions .
A series of nested for - next loops and a slew of global and local variables are all he needs to calculate anything .
A CodeMunger has no need to really ever design applications or tools .
The framework / library of his tool set has solved most of the problems he ’s going to come up against … and he generally works in large existing programs anyway .
He can learn everything he needs to get the job done by imitating the existing code base .
Everything else that could possibly matter has been covered by an article on a site like the CodeProject .
A CodeMunger has no problem with maintaining 50 near - identical forms … each with redundant GUI and data - access code .
A CodeMunger is irritated if the forms rely on subroutines that exist in other modules .
A CodeMunger is lost if he has to track down a subroutine that ’s inside a separate class .
A CodeMunger has no problem maintaining identical or near - identical versions of the same form or report in different applications .
A CodeMunger does not have the influence to convince the team to fix an architectural flaw even if he manages to notice one .
The team is lucky to be using any form of source control as it is … and there are no regression tests to speak of .
In this environment , he cannot make a case for the business value of eliminating design debt .
The CodeMunger knows that if he trys anything “ fancy ” that the rest of the team will protest the complexity of such abstraction .
A CodeMunger is content .
Even if there are things about his existing tools that annoy him , he accepts them as just being part of the background reality .
They ’re just the way things are .
Yeah , it was all exiting at first– just to be able to say , “ I write database applications ” when strangers asked , “ so , what do you do ? ” I remember all of the whining when .
Net was released .
It was very stressful trying to keep a job post 9/11 while getting up to speed on the new thing .
C# 2.0 was a big deal to me because a simple change to the language resulted the elimination of a couple hundred lines of code in a pet project .
( Now I study Lisp because I want to experience that again and again .
Expressiveness is the crack cocaine of programming . )
The .
Net Framework 3.0 was a complete bust , though .
I ’ve just got no interest in screwing around with a byzantine object model that does n’t address something I ’m trying to do right now — and that may or may not be here three years from now .
But now that I have to maintain applications that exist on both COM and on varying flavors of .
Net … well … it ’s really just not fun anymore .
Every time I have to wait for any one of five IDE ’s that I use to load up I get bitter .
Every time I have to wait for a file dialog I get angry .
Every time the application freezes because of some stupid process or useless GUI , my blood pressure goes up that much higher .
But those things are all superficial compared to the pain of being a CodeMunger .
Well … not so much being one … but being aware that that ’s what I am… and that that ’s what I ’m surrounded by .
I do n’t know what the next step is .
I suspect that too many comp-sci departments have a hand in creating this herd of CodeMungers … but Eugene Wallingford ’s blog is comforting .
They do n’t all have to be that way .
( Man , I wish I could get into that Compilers course somehow … . )
Until my options become clearer , there ’s always On Lisp , Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence , and the Stucture and Interpretation of Computer Programs to keep me company … .
Maybe the world has no use for yet another BiPoler Lisp Programmer , but I feel I must at least try to go beyond the bag of tricks I picked up “ on the street . ”

Men do n't have time for scissors and tape and bows or string and all of that hoo - ha .
We barely have time to get gifts .
If it were n't for well - stocked convenience stores and bootleg dvds littering our favorite street corners , our loved ones would never get a crummy gift .
Big surprise , but nowhere we ever go has free gift wrapping like at those perfumey Nordstroms and crud , so once a year we have to dig through our closets and dust off long forgotten gift wrap .
I am here to show you how to wrap your gifts while keeping your dignity .
The first picture we see here shows the only tape thats acceptable in a bachelor 's quarters — duct tape .
When someone gets a gift from a man wrapped in duct tape they know they 're getting something that is n't going to be easily unwrapped by some nosy kid .
Everyone else in the world chooses invisible tape , and if we were wimpy invisible tape we'd be too ashamed to want to be noticed too .
Duct tape is proud .
It 's visible .
It has no shame .
Nor should it have shame .
I picked up a free copy of 19 Deadly Sins of Software Security at a conference last year .
I did n't expect the book to be good because it was a free giveaway item from one of the the vendor booths .
But I paged through it on the flight home , and I was pleasantly surprised .
It 's actually quite good .
Software security is n't exactly my favorite topic , so holding my interest is no mean feat .
It helps that the book is mercifully brief and to the point , and filled with practical examples and citations .
It 's an excellent cross-platform , language - agnostic checksheet of common software security risks .
Here 's a brief summary of each of the 19 sins , along with a count of the number of vulnerabilities I found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database for each one .
Affected Languages Exploit count Buffer Overflows C , C++
A buffer overrun occurs when a program allows input to write beyond the end of the allocated buffer .
Results in anything from a crash to the attacker gaining complete control of the operating system .
Many famous exploits are based on buffer overflows , such as the Morris worm .
3,326 Format String Problems C , C++
The standard format string libraries in C/C++ include some potentially dangerous commands ( particularly %n ) .
If you allow untrusted user input to pass through a format string , this can result in anything from arbitrary code execution to spoofing user output .
411 Integer Overflows C , C++ , others Failure to range check on integer types .
This can cause integer overflow crashes and logic errors .
In C/C++ , integer overflows can be turned into a buffer overrun and arbitrary code execution , but all languages are prone to denial of service and logic errors .
288 SQL Injection All Forming SQL statements with untrusted user input means users can " inject " their own commands into your SQL statements .
This puts your data at risk , and can even lead to complete server and network compromise .
2,225 Command Injection All Occurs when untrusted user input is passed to a compiler or interpreter , or worse , a command line shell .
Potential risk depends on the context .
193 Failing to Handle Errors Most A broad category of problems related to a program 's error handling strategy ; anything that leads to the program crashing , aborting , or restarting is potentially a denial of service issue and therefore can be a security problem , particularly on servers .
80 Cross -Site Scripting ( XSS )
Any web - facing A web application takes some input from the user , fails to validate it , and echoes that input directly back to the web page .
Because this code is running in the context of your web site , it can do anything your website could do , including retrieving cookies , modifying the HTML DOM , and so forth .
2,996 Failing to Protect Network Traffic
All Most programmers understimate the risk of transmitting data over the network , even if that data is not private .
Attackers can eavesdrop , replay , spoof , tamper with , or otherwise hijack any unprotected data sent over the wire .
26 Use of Magic URLs and Hidden Form Fields
Any web - facing Passing sensitive or secure information via the URL querystring or hidden HTML form fields , sometimes with lousy or ineffectual " encryption " schemes .
Attackers can use these fields to hijack or manipulate a browser session .
33 Improper use of SSL and TLS All Using most SSL and TLS APIs requires writing a lot of error - prone code .
If programmers are n't careful , they will have an illusion of security in place of the actual security promised by SSL .
Attackers can use certificates from lax authorities , subtly invalid certificates , or stolen / revoked certificates , and it's up to the developer to write the code to check for that .
123 Use of Weak Password - Based Systems All
Anywhere you are using passwords , you need to seriously consider the risks inherent to all password - based systems .
Risks like phishing , social engineering , eavesdropping , keyloggers , brute force attacks , and so on .
And then you have to worry about how users choose passwords , and where to store them securely on the server .
Passwords are a necessary evil , but tread carefully .
1,235 Failing to Store and Protect Data Securely All Information spends more time stored on disk than in transit .
Consider filesystem permissions and encryption for any data you 're storing .
And try to avoid hardcoding " secrets " into your code or configuration files .
56 Information Leakage All
The classic trade - off between giving the user helpful information , and preventing attackers from learning about the internal details of your system .
Was the password invalid , or the username ?
26 Improper File Access All 1 ) There is often a window of vulnerability between time of check and time of use ( TOCTOU ) in the filesystem , so an attacker can slip changes in , particularly if the files are accessed over the network .
2 ) The " it is n't really a file problem " ; you may think you have a file , but attackers may substitute a link to another file , or a device name , or a pipe .
3 ) Allowing users control over the complete filename and path of files used by the program ; this can lead to directory traversal attacks .
5 , 58 Trusting Network Name Resolution All
It 's simple to override and subvert DNS on a server or workstation with a local HOSTS file .
How do you really know you 're talking to the real " secureserver.com " when you make a HTTP request ?
20 Race Conditions
All A race condition is when two different execution contexts are able to change a resource and interfere with each other .
If attackers can force a race condition , they can execute a denial of service attack .
Unfortunately , writing properly concurrent code is incredibly difficult .
139 Unauthenticated Key Exchange
All Exchanging a private key without properly authenticating the entity / machine / service that you 're exchanging the key with .
To have a secure session , both parties need to agree on the identity of the opposing party .
You'd be shocked how often this does n't happen .
1 Cryptographically Strong Random Numbers All Imagine you 're playing poker online .
The computer shuffles and deals the cards .
You get your cards , and then another program tells you what 's in everybody else 's hands .
Random numbers are similarly fundamental to cryptography ; they 're used to generate things like keys and session identifiers .
An attacker who can predict numbers -- even with only a slight probability of success -- can often leverage this information to breach the security of a system .
5 Poor Usability All Security is always extra complexity and pain for the user .
It 's up to us software developers to go out of our way to make it as painless as it can reasonably be .
Security only works if the secure way also happens to be the easy way .
All
It 's true that C and C++ have a heavy cross to bear .
But only 3 of the 19 sins can be completely lumped on the plate of K&R .
The other 16 apply almost everywhere , to any developer writing code on any platform .
It 's a sobering thought .
The usability sin is the one that 's most interesting to me .
Usability is tough under the best of conditions -- and security is the worst of conditions , at least from the user 's perspective .
It 's quite a challenge .
There are a few great links in the book on the topic of security usability :
You can certainly find other books that go much deeper on particular aspects of software security .
But if you 're looking for an excellent primer on the entire gamut of security problems that could potentially afflict your project , 19 Deadly Sins of Software Security is an excellent starting point .

The Eye of Argon
The Eye of Argon is reputed to be the worst science fiction story ever written , with some justification , I think .
Some SF cons run competitive readings .
There have been attempts to write a prequel and a sequel in the same vein .
Although they are awful , they do n't have quite that same kind of awfulness , leading me to believe the original was n't a deliberate spoof , as some have suggested , but was indeed genuine .
BAGHDAD , Oct. 7 — A completed Iraqi government inquiry found that employees of the American security company Blackwater USA shot unprovoked at Iraqi civilians at a downtown traffic circle three weeks ago , an episode that killed 17 people and wounded more than 20 others , a government spokesman said Sunday .
The four - vehicle Blackwater convoy , which had stopped at Nisoor Square on Sept. 16 to seal off traffic for another convoy carrying State Department officials , “ was n’t even hit by a stone , ” much less hostile gunfire when Blackwater guards began shooting at unarmed civilians , government spokesman , Ali al - Dabbagh , said .
Also Sunday , a joint commission of American and Iraqi senior officials convened here for the first time to look into ways to improve interactions between armed contractors and Iraqis they encounter in the course of transporting American diplomats .
One of the main goals of the meeting , between Patricia A. Butenis , the embassy ’s deputy chief of mission , and the Iraqi defense minister , Abdulqadir Mohammed Jassim , was to improve procedures to avoid the use of deadly force , and to ensure contractors “ do not endanger public safety , ” a statement from the American Embassy said .
The meeting occurred on a day in which a series of car bomb attacks in the capital killed at least nine people , apparently all civilians , officials said .
One of the bombings occurred near the Iranian embassy and killed three people , Iraqi officials said .
Where do most tigers live ?
In the United States it turns out .
There are 4,000 tigers residing in captivity in Texas alone , where private ownership of tigers is legal .
The number of tigers left in the wild is perhaps no more than 5,100 - 7,500 .
A tiger cub costs about $ 1,000 while the more exotic blue - eyed white tiger costs $ 15,000 .
That is from The Book of General Ignorance , an interesting compilation of not so well known facts .
I learned also that chamelons do not change color to fit their background ( the changes are determined by their emotional states ) , moths are disoriented by flames rather than attracted to them , and ( possibly ) America was named after Richard Amerike rather than Amerigo Vespucci ; I still have n’t gotten to the bottom of that one .
Amerike , a wealthy merchant , helped finance Cabot ’s voyage , and asked that any discovered lands be named after him .
NEW DELHI : India on Thursday gave Microsoft a thumbs - down in the war of standards for office documents .
In a tense meeting at Delhi ’s Manak Bhawan , the 21 - member technical committee decided that India will vote a ‘ no ’ against Microsoft ’s Open Office Extensible Mark Up Language ( OOXML ) standard at the International Standards Organisation ( ISO ) in Geneva on September 2 .
“ We unanimously agree on the disapproval of OOXML with comments .
The same will be submitted to ISO , ” National Informatics Centre head and BIS technical committee chairperson Nita Verma said after a marathon meeting that lasted over six hours .
There was no need for a voting as only Infosys Technologies and CSI supported Microsoft .
The Open Document Format ( ODF ) alliance , enjoying widespread support from academia and corporates like Oracle , IBM , Red Hat , Sun Microsystems , Google , were in a jubilant mood having succeeded in stalling OOXML from being accepted as a standard in India .
Microsoft said it respect ’s the government ’s decision .
“ There were only three options ` Yes ’ , ` No ’ and ` Abstain ’ to be taken and we respect the government ’s decision , ” Microsoft ’s legal affairs head Rakesh Bakshi said .
He , however , added that India ’s ‘ No ’ vote will become a ‘ Yes ’ if Microsoft is able to resolve all technical issues with OOXML before the ballot resolution committee of ISO .
Prof DB Phatak of IIT Mumbai , who was instrumental in conducting the meetings , looked relieved after being flooded with calls from both camps over the week .
The Microsoft camp complained that when ODF was being standardised by ISO , they did not oppose it and now the ODF camp refused to return the favour .
ODF supporters said they would have no problems with OOXML if all the 200 technical issues were taken care of .
Amongst hectic lobbying from both camps , the US government on Thursday said that it will abstain from voting .
China has already voted a ‘ No ’ against Microsoft , while Malaysia , Denmark and Switzerland are supporting the software major .
A global alliance of Sun-IBM , Oracle , Google , Red Hat have ganged up against Microsoft which is being supported by Apple , Quark , Accenture and Novell .
On Indian soil , Infosys , HCL , Skelta , Sonata Software and Sify have come out in support of Microsoft .
September 2 is the last date to submit the vote with comments to ISO .
About 123 counties are participating in the vote .
Votes from most are still to come .
Canada , Czech Republic , Iran , Japan , Libya , Cuba , New Zealand , UK are likely to back the IBM - Sun ’s ODF Alliance .
On the other hand , Belgium , Finland , Italy , Spain , Brazil , Singapore , Korea , France and Australia are likely to abstain from voting .
Congressional officials voiced new concern Tuesday over CIA Director Michael V. Hayden ’s decision to make the agency ’s inspector general the target of an internal probe .
Seeking to defuse the issue , Robert L. Deitz , a senior CIA attorney in charge of the probe , briefed both the House and Senate intelligence committees Tuesday .
But congressional aides said the sessions did little to assuage concerns that the inquiry could undermine the independence of the inspector general , the main in - house watchdog for the nation ’s leading spy service .
“ I do n’t think that we were satisfied with the discussion , ” said a Senate aide who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the issue ’s sensitivity .
“ They gave us their view , but I think there is a great deal of skepticism on our part over whether this is a smart thing for them to be doing . ”

The congressional panels could hold formal hearings on the issue or otherwise put pressure on Hayden to alter the scope or nature of the inquiry , which former CIA officials have described as unprecedented .
The probe is focused on the conduct of Inspector General John G. Helgerson .
He has been accused of bias and unfair treatment by senior agency officials and veteran spies singled out for criticism in a series of internal reports .
Some of the complaints are said to come from case officers involved in the CIA ’s terrorist detention and interrogation operations , which have been a focus of Helgerson ’s scrutiny for several years .
Helgerson , who has held the inspector general position since 2002 , also has been harshly critical of former CIA Director George J. Tenet and other senior officials for their roles in intelligence failures leading up to the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .

CIA spokesman George Little confirmed that Deitz , who has long - standing ties to Hayden , had met with the House and Senate intelligence committees on Tuesday , but declined to discuss the information Deitz shared .
“ We do n’t think it ’s appropriate to comment one way or the other on discussions between agency officials and congressional staffers that occur in closed session , ” Little said .
“ And it ’s unfortunate that others have chosen not to hold to that standard . ”
Deitz described the inquiry as a broad probe of the inspector general ’s conduct , according to sources familiar with the discussion .
Deitz also said that the CIA was reluctant to invite an outside panel to review Helgerson ’s work , in part because that would require the agency to share information with outsiders on some of its most closely guarded activities , including its secret overseas prison system .

A special President ’s Council on Integrity and Effectiveness was established to review allegations against government inspectors general .
But CIA officials have characterized the probe as a management review that did n’t rise to the level of enlisting outside help .
Key lawmakers and former CIA officials have questioned that decision , saying it sets a confusing and potentially damaging precedent to have the CIA director investigate its inspector general .
“ Whatever conclusions one may draw about the motive for undertaking this , ” the Senate aide said , “ it has the potential for sending a message to people that it is an attempt to undermine the work of the IG . ”

Just two days after it was yelled out in a University of Florida lecture hall , " Do n’t Tase Me , Bro ! " has become the newest cultural touchstone of our pop-cultural lexicon .
Consider :
The term hovered between 9th and 11th place as the most searched for term on Google for Wednesday , according to Google Trends .
The above video has been the number 1 Viral Video for the past 24 hours , according to Unruly Media , an online marketing firm in London that tracks viral video activity on the Web .
The Meyer arrest video has received 2.6 million views and almost 40,000 new comments since Monday .
In contrast , the much - talked about MoveOn.org ’s " Betrayal of Trust , " anti-Rudy Giuliani ad received just over 171 thousand views and 59 new blog posts .
And John Edwards ’ rebuttal to President Bush ’s progress report on the Iraq war received 114 thousand views and 43 new posts .
Many of the leading opinion shapers on both the left and the right , as well as newspaper blogs , offered their thoughts and insights on the incident .
Television pundits across the dial offered their opinions , and those opinions were archived for posterity on YouTube .
Several enterprising individuals have even snapped up variations of the spelling of the phrase as Web addresses .
One of them points to a Wikipedia entry for the University of Florida .
Mashups are proliferating on the Web .
A couple of t- shirt designs , and bumper stickers have emerged .
Dozens of people have felt compelled to record their own video responses in a YouTube forum discussion on the matter .
For those of you who ’ve been on vacation on a Greek Island , or are just logging onto your computer from a remote location in China , the incident sparking the worldwide uproar is the Monday arrest and tasering of Andrew Meyer , a University of Florida student .
Meyer barged in line to harangue Massachusetts senator John Kerry during a campus talk that day .
The student refused to pipe down after being asked to by the forum ’s organizers , and after he carried on pressing Kerry for answers , police hauled him off .
They forced him to the ground , and tasered him .
Several versions of the incident are up on YouTube , and there ’s a debate about whether Meyer , known as a prankster , staged the incident in Sacha Baron Cohen - style or not .
Whatever its true nature , the altercation whipped up a tornado of rhetoric that is whirling across forums on the Web , including here at Threat Level .
Policemen , Intensive Care Unit trauma unit nurses … even concerned individuals on the other side of the planet in Australia — everyone is weighing in on whether Meyer was acting like an ass , and whether he had it coming to him .
The incident has opened up the floodgates of an eye - opening debate over First Amendment rights here in the United States , police brutality and the limits and boundaries of how we as a society should deal with the unruly among us .
" This was really sickening to watch .
In the video the kid offers to leave and walk out on his own , but instead more and more of those officers try to force him on the ground and into handcuffs .
What a horrible way to handle such a simple situation , " writes " Aaron , " one of Threat Level ‘s readers .
" The University and its police department should be ashamed of themselves and embarrassed of the way they looked in front of a US Senator .
Totally unacceptable , " he adds .
Meanwhile , " Nightwatch , " who says that he ’s with a university police department , weighed in and says that he and his colleagues agree that the Florida police handled the situation badly .
And " Jon in Austin " writes that as an intensive care unit trauma nurse , he ’s concerned about the safety of the devices .
" I am an ICU
Trauma Nurse , and I know there have been numerous deaths resulting from the use of the Taser device — and no one knows who that next victim is going to be !
It could be any one of us .
" If we do n’t stand up against the use of the Taser , who will be next ? "
( Taser International says its technology is a " safer use - of - force option " on its web site . )
" I do n’t believe that asking a question at a town hall meeting , EVEN IF
it is long - winded and perhaps even a little combative , should lead to this , " writes Jon .
" I think it ’s foolish to run and flail from the police like that , but I can tell you that this could have been avoided had the police taken him out of the auditorium and explained when and where ( or IF ? ) he broke the law , THEN talk about arrest ( but that seems stupid when they could have just kicked him out ) .
Seems to me , that the real people who caused the disturbance , were the POLICE themselves , who carried it to an entirely absurd and potentially deadly level of risk to this student . "
Those wanting to somehow cash in on the notoriety of the phrase , or who perhaps were like cultural tourists wanting to hold onto a keepsake of the moment , went ahead and registered domain names .
Someone by the name of Johannes Feldberg registered donttasemebro.com yesterday , and Alexander Shkirenko , who apparently was chairman of the college Republicans at Georgia Tech a decade ago , registered donttazemebro.com .
The list goes on .
Michael Sarfatti in San Francisco grabbed Dontasemebro.com at 1 am this morning as he was listening to a radio show discussing the now infamous incident .
When asked why he bothered , and what he intended to do with it , Sarfatti , the founder of a baby boomer technology - related consulting firm in San Francisco , laughed heartily .
" I ’m not sure why I did it — other than it ’s going to be an expression in our society for a long time , " he says .
" I went to [ domain name registrar ] GoDaddy , and there was a whole bunch of people who had already registered various versions of it — I was actually surprised to get it . "
" I think it ’s a hilarious expression — it ’s a classic phrase , " he adds .
" It ’s such a brilliant line — to be honest , I think it was a set - up , but it was a brilliant ploy .
I ’d hire that guy in a heartbeat if indeed it was . "
Asked how anybody could want , or plan to be tasered , Sarfatti implied that it ’s not an uncommon occurrence .
He says that he ’s heard that there are games that people play that involve tasering each other .
" As an engineer I ’m curious [ about how that works ] but as a human , I think I ’ll take a pass , " he laughed .
Addendum :
My question for readers :
There ’s been a lot of debate [ see comments section below ] about whether Meyer " deserved " to be tasered , or not .
But the question in my mind is not whether he would have otherwise received a bullet in his chest ( as some of you have suggested he would have . )
The question is whether the use of this new technology is justified .
In a world without tasers , he would have just been subdued by the police officers until he surrendered his wrists to be cuffed .
The worrying aspect of this incident is the trigger - happiness of the law - enforcement authorities .
Several police officers already had him on the ground — why did they need to taser him ?
It ’s an important question : I think we need to define the limits of what we find acceptable , and what we do n’t with the uses of relatively new technology , since that is how we formulate policy :
On consensus .
To our police officer readers : I ’ve never been tasered ( I pray that I never will , ) so I ca n’t appreciate how extreme of an act it is .
It certainly looks extreme .
But what if an individual has a heart condition , or any other condition that the taser would have interfered with ?
The trigger - happy aspect of this disturbs me since there ’s been a lot of disquieting news on the subject , recently .

If you are Chinese , or visiting China , try very hard NOT to get sick .
Here 's why :
1. China has no system of general practitioners , so most people go to a hospital for health care .
2 . Most hospitals demand cash up front .
Chinese people cannot get treatment , even for life - threatening illnesses , until they hand over money .
3. Chinese hospitals have been turned into pharmacies on steroids , more than half their funding is from the sale of drugs .
The system has in - built incentives for everyone to sell as many drugs as possible , including doctors , whose salaries are tied to prescription targets .
It is no coincidence that one of the biggest corruption cases this year centred on the former head of the state food and drug administration , who was executed last month for taking bribes of $ 1 m to approve new drugs .
4 . The most common prescription is for antibiotics , with devastating effect .
The health ministry says that 70 - 90 % of child pneumonia patients are resistant to drugs used to treat the disease , because of overuse of antibiotics .
5 . A Chinese journalist visited 10 hospitals this year and , pretending to be a patient , provided tea in the place of a requested urine sample .
Six of the hospitals said they had discovered " blood cells " in the " urine " and immediately prescribed drugs .

MP : China 's health care system also has implications for China 's trade surplus with the U.S .
The fear of being financially crippled by falling ill is an important driver of the country 's high savings rates , which in turn feeds the economy 's bias towards investment and , more recently , with a large current account surplus , in favor of exports .
Countries like Japan and China with high savings rates ( and low consumption ) typically have trade surpluses and countries like the U.S. with low savings rates ( and low consumption ) have trade deficits .
Trade policies in the U.S. targeted at reducing the trade deficit with China will never work unless the underlying savings / consumption patterns are altered in both the U.S. and China .
That is , unless the U.S. somehow becomes a high savings country , we 'll continue to have a trade deficit , and unless China somehow beceomes a low savings country , it 'll continue to have trade surpluses .
Not likely during our lifetimes .
Hackers are taking credit for at least three breaches at anti-piracy firm MediaDefender .
The newly revealed attacks threaten to turn what started as an embarrassing e-mail leak into a full - blown security meltdown for the company .
The revelations began Saturday , when more than 6,000 internal company e-mails were exposed in a 700 - megabyte BitTorrent download .
A note from the hackers that accompanied the download points to a MediaDefender employee 's personal Gmail account as the source of the purloined mail , which covered six months of internal correspondence .
At least two more MediaDefender hacks have emerged since Saturday .
In one , hackers obtained a copy of an internal company database identifying some of the decoy files the company has slipped onto peer - to - peer networks .
In the other , intruders released a digital recording of a private phone call that appears to be a discussion between MediaDefender personnel and staff at the New York attorney general 's office .
In that phone call , ironically , a man who seems to be a MediaDefender official is heard reassuring law enforcement agents that the company 's systems are secure .
The stolen database may have been obtained after hackers noticed that the MediaDefender employee 's e-mail contained the IP addresses of company servers , as well as server - login information and passwords .
MediaDefender is an anti-piracy company that works with the entertainment industry to thwart the trading of copyright content on file - sharing networks .
The company scans the networks and notifies content owners when their material appears on download sites .
MediaDefender also posts decoy movie and music files to make it difficult for users to distinguish real from fake content .
The first internal MediaDefender e-mail surfaced two months ago at a site called ZeroPaid .
The message discussed a list of P2P download sites that MediaDefender was proposing ( if the message is authentic ) to monitor for Fox Studios .
MediaDefender , which did not respond to calls for comment , appears to have been aware of the leak at the time , because the company seems to have discussed it in the phone call with the New York attorney general 's office that was posted online by the hackers this week .
According to the audio file of the phone conversation , the company was working under contract with the attorney general on a highly important and secretive global project to track child porn on file - sharing networks .
The file appears to be a conversation between Ben Brodsky of MediaDefender and three investigators and analysts from the New York attorney general 's office – among them Mike McCartney , a special investigator with the state 's Criminal Prosecutions Bureau .
The call includes a discussion about the security of MediaDefender 's server in light of the initial e-mail leak .
An investigator says the attorney general 's operation with MediaDefender is " extremely sensitive , " and if the state is to rely on the company for criminal evidence related to child porn , it needs assurance that data on MediaDefender 's servers is n't vulnerable to manipulation .
In the recording , the voice that appears to be Brodsky acknowledges that his company is " a major target of hackers , " but assures the investigators that the company 's server was n't compromised and that the e-mail must have been intercepted in transit .
He also offers that if they want to be extra cautious , they could change the login and password for the data link they 've set up between the two offices and communicate these login details only over the phone .
" The e-mail is n't really an issue as long as we do n't really say anything particularly sensitive in the e-mails , " he says in the call .
It 's unclear how the conversation was recorded by the hackers , but a note from the person who posted the audio file on BitTorrent claims that intruders have been monitoring MediaDefender 's phone system for nine months .
When asked to confirm whether the audio file of the phone call was authentic , a spokesman for the New York attorney general 's office refused to comment .
Discussions on blogs have speculated how hackers obtained the e-mails from MediaDefender .
A note from the hacker who posted them on BitTorrent thanked a MediaDefender employee named Jay Mairs for forwarding all of his company e-mail to his Gmail account .
One popular theory holds that Mairs probably used his Gmail login to sign up with one of the file - sharing services he was monitoring , and used the same password as on his Gmail account .
Then , so goes the theory , someone with administrative access to the account traced his IP address to MediaDefender , and then either decided to log in and take a look at Mairs ' e-mail or provided the login information to a hacker .
The blogger who first posted information about the e-mails being available for download at BitTorrent told Wired News that he learned about them when someone from a Swedish domain sent him an e-mail tipping him off .

The Internet connection in Myanmar was cut Friday , limiting the free flow of information the nation 's citizens were sharing with the world depicting the violent crackdown on monks and other peaceful demonstrators .
Ko Htike runs his Myanmar blog out of his London apartment and says he 's trying to stop the violence .

Myanmar - based blogs went dark suddenly .
But London - based blogger Ko Htike -- who has been one of the most prominent bloggers posting information about the violence -- has vowed to keep up the fight , saying where " there is a will , there is a way . "
" I sadly announce that the Burmese military junta has cut off the Internet connection throughout the country , " he said on his blog Friday .
" I , therefore , would not be able to feed in pictures of the brutality by the brutal Burmese military junta . "
Ko Htike is a 28 - year - old who left Myanmar , once known as Burma , seven years ago to study in England .
Watch a blogger 's fight for Myanmar »
He told CNN.com a day earlier that he has as many as 40 people in Myanmar sending him photos or calling him with information .
They often take the photos from windows from their homes , he said .
Myanmar 's military junta has forbidden such images , and anyone who sends them is risking their lives .
" If they get caught , you will never know their future .
Maybe just disappear or maybe life in prison or maybe dead , " he told CNN .
Why would they take such risks ?
" They thought that this is their duty for the country , " he said .
" That 's why they are doing it .
It 's like a mission . "
Even with Friday 's action by the government , he said he will continue to do all he can to get images of what 's happening out for the world to see .
" I will also try my best to feed in their demonic appetite of fear and paranoia by posting any pictures that I receive through other means , " he said on his blog .
" I will continue to live with the motto that 'if there is a will there is a way . ' "
With few Western journalists allowed in Myanmar , his blog has become one of the main information outlets .
More than 170,000 people from 175 countries have gone to the blog , according to a counter on the page .
On Friday , shots rang out in the streets of Myanmar 's biggest city of Yangon , marking the third straight day of violence at the hands of the ruling military junta to suppress citizen protests .

One diplomat told CNN that a Western witness had reported seeing about 35 bodies lying in rows on a street near Sule Pagoda , with civilians praying over them .
CNN could not independently confirm the report , and it was not known if the bodies were from Friday or the result of earlier violence .
According to The Associated Press , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Friday he believes the loss of life in Myanmar has been " far greater " than is being reported .
In a country where Buddhist monks are revered , the violence against them could stir even more outrage among the people of Myanmar .
" Now , there is blood shed on the monastery , " Htike said .
The Internet has also spawned other Myanmar pages .
On the popular online community of Facebook , several Myanmar support pages were set up with links keeping a close eye on the latest developments .
One letter floating around the Internet from a group calling itself the " Global Alliance of Burmese Students " called on people abroad to stage protests .
" We call on you to take action , to take the lead , and to show solidarity with our fellow countrymen back home , " it said .
" The streets of Yangon bleed red , and it will all be in vain if we do not act and mobilize for change . "
Other people used technology as simple as the cell phone as a means to get the word out on what was happening .
" We did n't do any terrorism , but they sharp - shoot us , " one woman said by phone inside Myanmar Thursday .
" I just want to say we have no weapons and no rights . "
She added , " Who can help us ? "
The last time the nation saw such widespread protests was in 1988 , when today 's instantaneous means of communication did not exist .
The government used brutal force to quash that democratic uprising , with few people seeing what happened .

Today 's technology allows anyone with the means to capture what is happening .
Despite the cutting of the Internet inside the country , people can still take pictures and videos with cell phones and send them to the outside world .
" They are ready to die for that , " Vincent Brossels with Reporters Without Borders said on Thursday .
" I spoke with a Burmese journalist this morning in Rangoon and he told me that now I do n't care about anything .
I 'm ready to be in jail .
I 'm ready to die for that . "
Benjamin Valk , a 25 - year - old student from a university in Tokyo , Japan , sent CNN.com video of saffron - robed monks carrying out a peaceful protest earlier this week in Yangon , once known as Rangoon .
The video shows thousands of monks and civilians walking together and chanting .
He said he felt compelled to share the video because people " should know what is happening in a country like Myanmar . "
" In a world where democracy is considered the better or perhaps the best political system , there is huge global support for a people who dare to openly challenge a military dictatorship and call for democracy , " Valk said .
" I think it 's good for the world to see . "
Htike agrees , saying he 's just trying to stop the killing in his homeland .
" If I can publish these kind of [ photos ] and this kind of news to the world , so maybe they may stop a little bit . "

Sentiment is growing in both political parties for extending the U.S. military presence in Iraq in order " to ensure the safe flow of petroleum , " according to the Nov. 12th issue of The Nation magazine .
Not only is President Bush protracting U.S. engagement in Iraq but the two leading Democratic contenders for his job , Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , seek to keep a U.S. military presence in the region .
Clinton told The New York Times Iraq is " right in the heart of the oil region " and thus " it is directly in opposition to our interests " for it to become a pawn of Iran or failed state .
Obama has also spoken of the need to maintain a robust US military presence in Iraq and the surrounding area , writes Michael Klare , the magazine 's defense correspondent and professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire College .
Senior officials in both parties , he notes , " are calling for a reinvigorated U.S. military role in the protection of foreign energy deliveries . "
Klare writes no dramatic change in U.S. policy in the Gulf region should be expected from the next administration , whether Republican or Democratic .
" If anything , " he says , " we should expect an increase in the use of military force to protect the overseas flow of oil , as the threat level rises along with the need for new investment to avert even further reductions in global supplies . "
The likelihood of a continuing U.S. presence in the Middle East is framed against a backdrop of growing demand for oil .
The global output of " liquids , " the U.S. Energy Department says , using its new term for oil , is expected to rise from 84 million barrels of oil equivalent ( mboe ) per day in 2005 to about 117.6 mboe in 2030 .
And that 's virtually the same as anticipated demand , Klare reports .
The International Energy Agency has predicted world economic activity will grow on average by 4.5 percent per year by 2012 and world oil demand will grow by 2.2 percent annually , pushing consumption up from 86 - to 96 - million barrels per day .
Almost all of the increase , Klare writes , will have to come from Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , Algeria , Angola , Libya , Nigeria , Sudan , Kazakhstan and Venezuela , " countries that do not inspire the sort of investor confidence that will be needed to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into new drilling rigs , pipelines and other essential infrastructure . "
Not surprisingly , oil 's price has jumped spectacularly , crossing the $ 80 per barrel " psychological barrier " on the New York Mercantile Exchange in September and then upwards to as high as $ 90 .
Many reasons have been cited for this but " the underlying reality is that most oil - producing countries are pumping at maximum capacity and finding it increasingly difficult to boost production in the face of rising international demand , " Klare writes .
He quotes Peter Hitchens of the New York brokerage Teather & Greenwood as saying , " It 's becoming more and more difficult to bring ( oil ) projects in on time and on budget . "
The result is liable to be the peaking of oil production , triggering an intensified scramble for conventional petroleum resources " with troops being rushed from one oil - producing hot spot to another , " Klare predicts .
This gloomy forecast is causing the world 's oil majors , notably Chevron , to turn their attention to Canada 's Alberta province , with its bountiful tar sands , a gooey substance that can be converted into synthetic petroleum .
The rub here , though , Klare says , is this can be done " only with enormous effort and expense . "
What 's more , extracting Alberta 's tar sands is environmentally destructive , as it takes vast quantities of energy to recover the bitumen and convert it into a usable liquid .
This process releases three times as much greenhouse gas as in conventional oil production , leaving in its wake toxic water supplies and empty moonscapes .
Klare concludes , " The safest and most morally defensible course is to repudiate any ' consensus ' calling for the use of force to protect overseas petroleum supplies and to strive to conserve what remains of the world 's oil by using less of it . "

It has been painful for me to see some of Attorney General nominee Michael Mukasey 's responses to questions from the Senate .
As it happens , I know and respect Michael Mukasey .
He was a partner in the law firm where I worked right after law school .
I am sure that Judge Mukasey knows that waterboarding is torture .
I am sure that it pains him to dodge questions about the issue .
But apparently , George Bush has told him that refusing to admit that torture is the price of serving as George Bush 's Attorney General .
Apparently , the Judge also believed that in order to serve as Bush 's Attorney General , he had to give this unfortunate answer when asked whether the president is required to obey federal statutes : " That would have to depend on whether what goes outside the statute nonetheless lies within the authority of the president to defend the country . "
I do n't quite know what that means , but it sounds like Bushspeak to me .
It suggests that the President is above the law .
Accordingly , I have called on the Senate to refuse to confirm Judge Mukasey unless and until he gives some different answers .
If the Senate again confirms an Attorney General who refuses to denounce torture , it will be giving a green light to the Bush Administration to continue to use torture as a tactic .
It will disgrace the United States in the eyes of the world .
And it will not make us safer .
As Senator John McCain has said : ‘ We should not torture or treat inhumanely terrorists we have captured .
The abuse of prisoners harms , not helps , our war effort .
Take action Call your representatives and tell them to refuse Mukasey 's confirmation as Attorney General unless he rejects Bush 's unconstitutional and inhumane use of torture ..
Priorities
Sometimes I argue with friends who believe the people who run America are utterly indifferent to human life .
I tell them : " You could n't be more wrong .
If you made up a list of the top 1000 priorities of the people who run America , human life might come in as high as 997th . "
I was pleased to see my perspective validated in George Packer 's recent New Yorker article about Iraq :
David Kilcullen , an Australian counter - insurgency adviser who served on Petraeus ’s staff ... drew up a list of core American interests in Iraq , which he later gave to senior officials at the White House and the State Department .
In order of priority , the list contained the following items : maintain the flow of oil and gas in the region ; prevent the establishment of an Al Qaeda safe haven in Iraq ; contain Iranian influence ; prevent a regional war ; prevent a humanitarian catastrophe on the scale of Rwanda ; and restore American credibility in the region and in the world ( which Kilcullen called “ the master interest , ” and which doing all the others would go a long way toward achieving ) .
You see ?
They do care !
Human life is on the list !
Right there after their four higher priorities !
Of which the top one is oil !
The best part is that mere paragraphs later , Packer expresses this concern :
Even in narrow strategic terms American interests would be harmed by large - scale slaughter in Iraq .
The spectacle , televised around the world , would deepen the feeling that America is indifferent to human , especially Muslim , life .
Yes , it would be terrible if the world were to get such a distorted picture of America .
We must make them understand how we really feel : that human life is wonderful , as long as it does n't conflict with all our higher priorities .
Police name OJ Simpson suspect in casino break - in RAW STORY
Published : Friday September 14 , 2007
Print This Email This Former football legend O.J. Simpson , acquitted of killing his ex-wife thirteen years ago , has been named as a suspect in a Las Vegas casino break - in , according to various news reports .
" Investigators questioned O.J. Simpson and named him a suspect Friday in a break - in at a casino hotel room involving sports memorabilia , " Kathleen Hennessey reports for the Associated Press .
The gossip web site TMZ.com asks , " Did OJ rob a guy ? "
Although no charges had been filed and no one was in custody , " Sources say OJ Simpson and five other men barged into a hotel room last night , and at gunpoint , took various memorabilia once owned by Simpson , " TMZ staff write .
According to an AP report , many of Simpson 's sports collectibles , including his Heisman Trophy , were seized by the courts and auctioned to pay some of the $ 33.5 million judgment awarded to the Goldman family and the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson .
Auction house owner Tom Riccio called Simpson weeks ago to alert him that collectors were trying to peddle his former belongings quietly .
Simpson , who was town for a friend 's wedding , " arranged to meet Riccio , who set up a meeting with collectors under the guise that he had a private collector interested in buying Simpson 's items . "
The former All - Pro later told the AP there was no armed robbery and no guns were involved .
Simpson , one of the most famous American footballers of his generation during the 1970s , was charged in the brutal 1994 murders of estranged wife Nicole Brown - Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman .
Simpson , who always has vehemently denied the killings , was acquitted of the slayings after a racially charged Los Angeles trial in 1995 , a verdict that was greeted with widespread outrage across America .
The former sports star was subsequently found liable for the deaths in a 1997 civil suit and was ordered to pay damages to the victims ' families totaling 33.5 million dollars .
Excerpts from AP article : # The break - in was reported at the Palace Station casino late Thursday night , police spokesman Jose Montoya said .
He said investigators determined the break - in involved sports collectibles .
" When they talked to him , Simpson made the comment that he believed the memorabilia was his , " Montoya said .
" We 're getting conflicting stories from the two sides . "
Simpson was released after he and several associates were questioned , but he is considered a suspect in the case , Montoya said .
He is believed to be in Las Vegas .
" We do n't believe he 's going anywhere , " he said .
# Excerpts from TMZ article : # It happened at the Palace Station Hotel last night at around 7:15 .
Alfred Beardsley , a memorabilia dealer , had secured various items once owned by Simpson .
Beardsley has said he had the suit OJ wore the day he was acquitted of murder .
Beardsley tells TMZ he had arranged to meet with someone last night who was interested in buying the suit and other Simpson memorabilia .
Beardsley says the man was actually a member of Simpson 's crew .
He says the men stormed the room , two of them had guns drawn .
Beardsley says the men claimed to be police officers .
OJ and others demanded that Beardsley and two other men surrender their cell phones .
Beardsley refused to do so .
Beardsley says the group stole every piece of memorabilia in the room , including items signed by Joe Montana .
They also took a case of never - released leather editions of Simpson 's book , " I Want to Tell You . " # ( with wire reports )

9th Cir. on Perfect 10 : Advantage Google
Score 8.5 for public access .
In Perfect 10 v. Amazon.com and Google , the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed and strengthened Kelly v. Arriba Soft , holding that neither showing image thumbnails nor inline linking / framing in an image search engine constitutes copyright infringement .
In the ongoing battle between adult - content purveyor Perfect 10 and Google , the court reversed the lower court 's ruling to hold that Google could not be held directly liable for infringement even if its image search spidered in some unauthorized images .
As in Kelly , the court found that search was a transformative fair use .
The court further rejected the argument that Google 's Adsense program made it a vicarious infringer .
The rub is that the court sent the case back for further factfinding on questions of contributory infringement and Google 's safe harbor defense .
Accordingly , we hold that a computer system operator can be held contributorily liable if it has actual knowledge that specific infringing material is available using its system , and can take simple measures to prevent further damage to copyrighted works , yet continues to provide access to infringing works .
( citations omitted )
While that standard sounds nice in theory , it gums up the works of search engines in practice .
In the dozen takedown notices Perfect 10 sent to Google are hundreds of URLs Google must investigate or remove , if the allegation is enough to impute knowledge .
In return for ease of copyright - holder policing , the public gets less access to comprehensive search .
Now the court did say considerable factfinding remained before Google could be held contributorily liable , including " factual disputes over whether there are reasonable and feasible means for Google to refrain from providing access to infringing images . "
Moreover , the safe harbor should protect Google , which routinely does " expeditiously " remove alleged infringements , but I 've often argued the safe harbor goes beyond legal liabilities .
BEVERLY HILLS , Calif. — Kelly Brannigan was suffering from a case of tattoo remorse .
Just a year ago , Ms. Brannigan , 24 , who holds up Case No. 24 as one of the models on the NBC game show “ Deal or No Deal , ” had been full of hope when she and her fiancé had each other ’s names tattooed across their inner wrists .
But now , when she looks at the letters — P - A - T - R - I - C - K — she is reminded of the failed relationship .
For help , she turned to Dr. Tattoff , a chain of tattoo removal stores where nurses use lasers in a series of treatments to break down tattoo pigments .
Dr. Tattoff is part of a growing industry catering to people who may not have thought about the implications of “ forever ” the first time around .
Removing tattoos is costly , uncomfortable and time - consuming , but the affinity for body art is so strong that some people say they do it to clear space to tattoo all over again .
" That fondness for science , ... that affability and condescension which God shows to the learned , that promptitude with which he protects and supports them in the elucidation of obscurities and in the removal of difficulties , has encouraged me to compose a short work on calculating by al - jabr and al - muqabala , confining it to what is easiest and most useful in arithmetic . "

Three staff and a film crew from ABC TV's program The Chaser 's War on Everything have been questioned by police after being involved in second stunt in central Sydney this afternoon .
The three were released by police after being briefly questioned for carrying around black cardboard boxes dressed up as limousines in Sydney .
The Chaser 's Craig Reucassel , speaking moments after being released by police , says the event happened well away from the APEC lockdown zone .
" The police basically just detained us and just checked whether we 'd breached any laws - which we had n't - and we 're on our way , " he said .
" We had boxes , but it 'll all be on the Chaser , there was basically no problem . "
Chaser member Chris Taylor says all involved knew no laws had been broken .
" We did n't do anything wrong at all , we were very careful to stay within the letter of the law , I think the police realised that so it was fine , " he said .
On Thursday , eight other members of the Chaser program and three hire car drivers were charged using new APEC powers for allegedly entering a restricted zone in real cars with Canadian flags .
Many executions have been carried out in public in an apparent bid to create a climate of intimidation while sending out uncompromising signals to the West .
Opposition sources say at least three of the dead were political activists , contradicting government insistence that it is targeting ' thugs ' and dangerous criminals .
The executions have coincided with a crackdown on student activists and academics accused of trying to foment a ' soft revolution ' with US support .
The most high - profile recent executions involved Majid Kavousifar , 28 , and his nephew , Hossein Kavousifar , 24 , hanged for the murder of a hardline judge , Hassan Moghaddas , a man notorious for jailing political dissidents .
They were hanged from cranes and hoisted high above one of Tehran 's busiest thoroughfares .
The spectacle , the first public executions in Tehran for five years , took place outside the judiciary department headquarters where Moghaddas was murdered .
But the location , near many office blocks and the Australian and Japanese embassies , meant they were seen by many middle - class Iranians who would not normally witness such events .
The previous day seven men were publicly executed in the north - eastern city of Masshad , including five said to be guilty of ' rape , kidnapping , theft and committing indecent acts ' .
Another two were hanged separately for raping and robbing a young woman .
The executions were also shown live on state television .
Public hangings are normally carried out sparingly in Iran and reserved for cases that have provoked public outrage , such as serial murders or child killings .
Human rights organisations say the rising death toll has brought the number of prisoners executed this year to about 150 , compared to 177 in 2006 , a dramatic increase in capital punishment since the country 's radical President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , took office two years ago .
The executions come after the government launched a campaign targeting murderers , sex offenders , drug traffickers and others cast as a threat to ' social security ' .
It resulted in a wave of arrests after police raided working - class neighbourhoods in Tehran and other cities .
Those arrested were paraded in public , often in humiliating poses .
The government has also sought to publicise executions conducted behind closed doors .
Last month state television broadcast footage of 12 condemned men as they were about to be hanged in Tehran 's Evin prison .
The authorities said they had been guilty of ' rape , sodomy and assault and battery ' .
Opposition sources say at least three were political activists , though they have not disclosed their identities .
Asiran , a government website , dismissed the claims as ' lies ' .
International gay rights campaigners have also said that homosexual men were among the executed .
Homosexuality is a capital offence in Iran , along with adultery , espionage , armed robbery , drug trafficking and apostasy .
Iran has long been one of the world 's most prolific exponents of the death penalty and ranks second only to China in the number of executions .
Human rights groups say it has the world 's worst record for executions for crimes committed when the defendant was under 18 .
However , there have been signs of official disquiet over the recent trend .
Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi , the relatively moderate judiciary chief , has made an apparent protest by openly criticising Ahmadinejad 's government on a range of issues .
He also signalled displeasure with the repressive climate by ordering officials to investigate claims that student activists were tortured during a recent detention in Evin prison .
Shahroudi is believed to have been unhappy over the stoning to death last month of a man convicted of adultery after he had ordered a stay of execution .
However , the spate of executions seems likely to continue .
Tehran 's hardline chief prosecutor , Saeed Mortazavi , has announced that he is seeking the death penalty against 17 ' hooligans ' .
The USA 's military spending is now close to $ 2 billion a day .
This fall , the country will begin its seventh year of continuous war , with no end in sight .
On the horizon is the very real threat of a massive air assault on Iran .
And few in Congress seem willing or able to articulate a rejection of the warfare state .
While the Bush - Cheney administration is the most dangerous of our lifetimes -- and ousting Republicans from the White House is imperative -- such truths are apt to smooth the way for progressive evasions .
We hear that " the people must take back the government , " but how can " the people " take back what they never really had ?
And when rhetoric calls for " returning to a foreign policy based on human rights and democracy , " we 're encouraged to be nostalgic for good old days that never existed .
The warfare state did n't suddenly arrive in 2001 , and it wo n't disappear when the current lunatic in the Oval Office moves on .
Born 50 years before George W. Bush became president , I have always lived in a warfare state .
Each man in the Oval Office has presided over an arsenal of weapons designed to destroy human life en masse .
In recent decades , our self - proclaimed protectors have been able -- and willing -- to destroy all of humanity .
We 've accommodated ourselves to this insanity .
And I do mean " we " -- including those of us who fret aloud that the impact of our peace - loving wisdom is circumscribed because our voices do n't carry much farther than the choir .
We may carry around an inflated sense of our own resistance to a system that is poised to incinerate and irradiate the planet .
Maybe it 's too unpleasant to acknowledge that we 've been living in a warfare state for so long .
And maybe it 's even more unpleasant to acknowledge that the warfare state is not just " out there . "
It 's also internalized ; at least to the extent that we pass up countless opportunities to resist it .
Like millions of other young Americans , I grew into awakening as the Vietnam War escalated .
Slogans like " make love , not war " -- and , a bit later , " the personal is political " -- really spoke to us .
But over the decades we generally learned , or relearned , to compartmentalize : as if personal and national histories were n't interwoven in our pasts , presents and futures .
One day in 1969 , a biologist named George Wald , who had won a Nobel Prize , visited the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- the biggest military contractor in academia -- and gave a speech .
" Our government has become preoccupied with death , " he said , " with the business of killing and being killed . "
That preoccupation has fluctuated , but in essence it has persisted .
While speaking of a far - off war and a nuclear arsenal certain to remain in place after the war 's end , Wald pointed out : " We are under repeated pressure to accept things that are presented to us as settled -- decisions that have been made . "
Today , in similar ways , our government is preoccupied and we are pressurized .
The grisly commerce of killing -- whether through carnage in Iraq and Afghanistan or through the deadly shredding of social safety - nets at home -- thrives on aggressive war and on the perverse realpolitik of " national security " that brandishes the Pentagon 's weaponry against the world .
At least tacitly , we accept so much that threatens to destroy anything and everything .
As it happened , for reasons both " personal " and " political " -- more accurately , for reasons indistinguishable between the two -- my own life fell apart and began to reassemble itself during the same season of 1969 when George Wald gave his speech , which he called " A Generation in Search of a Future . "
Political and personal histories are usually kept separate -- in how we 're taught , how we speak and even how we think .
But I 've become very skeptical of the categories .
They may not be much more than illusions we 've been conned into going through the motions of believing .
We actually live in concentric spheres , and " politics " suffuses households as well as what Martin Luther King Jr. called " The World House . "
Under that heading , he wrote in 1967 : " When scientific power outruns moral power , we end up with guided missiles and misguided men .
When we foolishly minimize the internal of our lives and maximize the external , we sign the warrant for our own day of doom .
Our hope for creative living in this world house that we have inherited lies in our ability to re-establish the moral ends of our lives in personal character and social justice .
Without this spiritual and moral reawakening we shall destroy ourselves in the misuse of our own instruments . "
While trying to understand the essence of what so many Americans have witnessed over the last half century , I worked on a book ( titled " Made Love , Got War " ) that sifts through the last 50 years of the warfare state ... and , in the process , through my own life .
I have n't learned as much as I would have liked , but some patterns emerged -- persistent and pervasive since the middle of the 20th century .
The warfare state does n't come and go .
It ca n't be defeated on Election Day .
Like it or not , it 's at the core of the United States -- and it has infiltrated our very being .
What we 've tolerated has become part of us .
What we accept , however reluctantly , seeps inward .
In the long run , passivity can easily ratify even what we may condemn .
And meanwhile , in the words of Thomas Merton , " It is the sane ones , the well - adapted ones , who can without qualms and without nausea aim the missiles and press the buttons that will initiate the great festival of destruction that they , the sane ones , have prepared . "
The triumph of the warfare state degrades and suppresses us all .
Even before the weapons perform as guaranteed .

Snow tells CBS anchor , ' I hate to tell you ... you can't have your own facts '
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday June 12 , 2007 Print This Email This On Tuesday , the major networks each interviewed White House Press Secretary Tony Snow about the failure of President Bush 's immigration bill , asking Snow directly whether Bush was now officially a lame duck .
Snow insisted to all of them that Bush had been the " dominant figure " at the recent G8 conference and will be pushing strenuously for his immigration , energy , and education legislation .
He claimed to CBS that many Republicans voted against the immigration bill only because the Democratic leadership had not allowed them to debate amendments .
However , when Snow said of Bush to CBS 's Harry Smith , " He goes to the G8 , leads the way on climate change , " Smith broke in to object : " I think that 's following on climate change .
...
These other countries have set the table for this for years .
The president is late to this table . "
" I hate to tell you , " replied Snow .
" No Harry , you can't have your own facts .
We 've got a better record than the rest of the world ...
What you 're arguing is that you regulate your way in .
It never works , has n't .
What the president says is , use technology as the way of doing it and , guess what , everybody agreed . "
According to a Reuters report on the G8 conference , " President George W. Bush 's plan to combat climate change got a cool reception on Friday in Europe , where the European Union 's environment chief dismissed it as unambitious and the ' classic ' U.S. line . "
The following video is from NBC's Today Show , ABC's Good Morning America and CBS 's Early Show .
All were broadcast on June 12 .
Excerpts from transcripts : ABC # MS.
ROBERTS : Tony , we just heard what Senator Barack Obama had to say about the president .
So let me ask you , is George Bush a lame duck president ?
MR .
SNOW : No , not at all .
As a matter of fact , I mean , just take a look at what 's been going on in the last couple of weeks .
The president just came off a very successful meeting at the G8 where the United States led the way on climate change , led the way on development , drew Russia into conversations about missile defense in Europe , had the highly successful meetings throughout the region .
Meanwhile , back here at home , what are we doing ?
We 're still in the middle of an immigration debate that we feel confident is going to yield an historic and important vote and an important piece of legislation .
Congress today is going to take up energy legislation .
And you 've got a president actually who laid out a fairly ambitious agenda at the State of the Union address featuring immigration , energy , No Child Left Behind .
We 're likely to get all three this year .
That 's hardly a lame duck presidency .
Now , if Senator Obama does n't want to act on that , then he 's going to have to explain to the American people why he thinks important problems are the kinds of things we can shove off for a couple of years .
Meanwhile , while I actually think a lot of people are very busy doing some very important and constructive work .
# CBS : # MR .
SMITH : For more on the president 's Capitol Hill visit , we turn now to White House Press Secretary Tony Snow .
Tony , good morning .
MR .
SNOW : Good morning , Harry .
MR .
SMITH : We just heard in this report from Joie Chen 38 Republicans voted against this immigration bill .
Any real chance of getting any of them to change their minds ?
MR .
SNOW : Yeah , there is , because if you take a look at the vote last week , it was n't necessarily on the immigration bill .
There are some people who are opposed to it , but also a fair number of Republicans were n't happy because Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid did not want to continue the process of debating a lot of amendments .
So you have people like John Warner and others saying , " Well , wait a minute .
This is the Senate .
We need to have a full debate . "
I think what you 're going to find , Harry , is that the Senate Republicans are going to put together a package of amendments .
They 're going to present them to Democrats , saying , " This is what we want to debate . "
And we seem to be getting some signals out of the majority leader that he 'll go ahead and make that debate possible .
Therefore , we feel pretty confident we 're going to get passage .
.... MR .
SMITH : Does n't the president have to convince those people who are so adamant about this that he may be right ?
MR .
SNOW : Yeah .
Look , there are some people who are not going to be persuaded because they disagree with him .
But there are also a lot of people right now who are saying , " Well , who 's right here ? "
And I think that 's one of the reasons why you have political debate in this country .
You 're absolutely right .
We 're going to continue to present our arguments to the American people and explain exactly what this bill says , what it does , and why it answers people 's qualms about security ; provide security first ; why it restores rule of law and why it makes citizenship special .
MR .
SMITH : But the other question that comes up , then , is if the president can't get this done , in which he has placed so much of his own prestige and will and everything else , does this not show that he 's a lame duck ?
MR .
SNOW : Well , think of it -- let 's flip it around .
The president just came back from a G - 8 session where , you know , when everybody went they said , " Well , here 's George W. Bush .
The whole world 's against him on climate change . "
Guess what :
He goes to the G - 8 , leads the way on climate change , leads the way on development , leads the way on AIDS -- MR .
SMITH : No , I think that 's following on climate change .
He 's following on climate change .
MR .
SNOW : No , no , I do n't think so , Harry .
MR .
SMITH : These other countries have set the table for this for years .
The president is late to this table .
You can't flip that around .
MR .
SNOW : I hate to tell you -- no , Harry , you can't have your own facts .
We 've got a better record than the rest of the world .
We have more rapid rate of improvement -- MR .
SMITH : And it should have an even better record than we already have , and you know that .
MR .
SNOW : No .
What you 're arguing is that you regulate your way in .
It never works ; has n't .
What the president says is , " Use technology as the way of doing it . "
And guess what : Everybody agreed .
Now , when it comes to domestic policy , the president laid out a number of key items in the State of the Union address .
Immigration is one of them .
We feel pretty good about that .
They 're debating energy right now , and he 's been able to implement a fair amount of that by executive order .
No Child Left Behind ; that 's got bipartisan support .
What I think you 're going to see is big , major legislation being passed in the seventh year of a presidency .
That 's not a lame duck .
MR .
SMITH : Okay .
MR .
SNOW : What you have is a situation of a lot of political contentiousness .
MR .
SMITH : All right , we 'll see . #
Sunday is an important date for Microsoft 's future .
It 's the deadline for votes on whether Microsoft 's office document format , Office OpenXML , will be approved as an international standard by the International Standards Organization , or ISO .
Office OpenXML , or OOXML as it 's commonly known , is the native file format for Microsoft 's Office 2007 suite .
It can hold data from word processors , spreadsheets and other office applications .
The final decision wo n't be made until February 2008 , but in the meantime , Microsoft 's lobbying of the ISO has prompted one of the most contentious arguments about open standards in recent memory .
Both those for and against OOXML 's approval have resorted to name - calling , finger pointing and muckraking of the highest order , setting off a debate about current standards approval procedures and the ease with which they can be bent by corporate influence .
Try running a Google search on OOXML .
The first hit is the Wikipedia entry , the neutrality and accuracy of which is under dispute .
The second hit is for a website urging members of national voting boards to reject OOXML 's standardization .
On that site , text branding the format as " immature " appears next to a graphic showing OOXML supporters sitting on fat bags of cash .
After those top two hits , Google points us to 50 or so recent news articles outlining how Microsoft has employed ballot stuffing and other shady tactics to win approval for its format .
Further down the page , a blog post by IBM's Rob Weir is called " The Formula for Failure . "
Keep scrolling , it gets worse .
The whole debacle started two years ago when Microsoft began campaigning to get OOXML approved as an international standard .
This was seen as a move to speed worldwide adoption of the document format by governments .
Some governments have mandates requiring them to use only ISO - approved file formats for communications and data archiving .
Winning ISO approval would give Microsoft Office 2007 the stamp of approval it needs to be adopted by governments and large institutions .
Advocates of open standards sent up two red flags about OOXML .
First : an open - document standard already exists .
It 's called the OpenDocument Format , or ODF , and is the format used by IBM's Lotus Notes , Google Docs and Spreadsheets and the free and cross-platform OpenOffice suite .
Second , critics say OOXML is rife with technical problems , which inhibits its ability to work with non-Microsoft office products and to be used by non-English - speakers .
Blogger Stephane Rodriguez has posted an in - depth look at OOXML 's supposed technical shortcomings .
These arguments have n't slowed Microsoft , which has been aggressively working to gain approval from standards bodies .
Last December , OOXML won standards approval from ECMA , and shortly thereafter , it was submitted to the ISO 's fast - track process .
Many say that 's when the skulduggery began .
In order to get ISO Fast Track approval , OOXML needs to win at least a two - thirds majority vote from the countries involved in the vote .
Inexplicably , a number of countries recently upgraded their status to the " P " level , at which point their votes on the OOXML issue becomes the most influential .
In August , the number of " P " status countries swelled from 30 to 40 , with Cyprus , Turkey , Lebanon , Ecuador , Pakistan , Uruguay , Venezuela and Trinidad - Tobago among those joining the party at the last minute .
Law blogger Andrew Updegrove suspects Microsoft 's influence in the sudden upgrades : " As someone who has spent a great part of my life working to support open standards over the past 20 years , I have to say that this is the most egregious , and far - reaching , example of playing the system to the advantage of a single company that I have ever seen .
Breathtaking , in fact . "
Indeed , he is n't alone in his suspicions .
And there is little question that most of these newcomers will vote " yes , " even though many of them have had only a few days to debate their decision .
( It 's worth noting that Microsoft 's standards proposal is a whopping 6,000 pages long .
One could argue that more information is a good thing when you 're trying to write software to meet a specification .
One could also argue that asking a voting body to digest 6,000 pages in less than a week is equivalent to asking a human to drink six gallons of orange juice in an hour .
Possible , but Herculean – and you will probably feel like vomiting long before you 're through . )
The drama continues .
Last week , " yes " votes placed by Hungary and Sweden were called into question by authorities in those countries over concerns about voting irregularities .
In Sweden 's case , a leaked e-mail from a Microsoft employee promised " market benefits " and increased access to Microsoft resources to members if they voted in favor of approval .
Hungary is redoing its vote after allegations that Microsoft seeded its panel with yes -men .
For the record , the United States voted , " Yes , with comments , " but it was tight .
The voting record shows eight in favor , seven against and one abstention .
So what happens now ?
If Microsoft wins enough votes , comments amended to " No " votes will be considered at a week - long ballot resolution meeting scheduled for February 25 - 29 , 2008 in Geneva , where the ISO will try to reach a consensus .
If Microsoft does n't win the two - thirds majority it needs , the vote is halted and the ballot resolution meeting wo n't take place .
Either way , the ISO 's current state is likely to be seen as a quagmire when viewed through history 's lens .
As IBM vice president of open source and standards Bob Sutor , an outspoken opponent of OOXML writes on his blog , " ISO 's rules are n't supposed to allow one group to stymie or block another and up to now they 've been able to assume , and have relied on , a level of good - faith interaction that may not be sustainable in the future . "
Microsoft did not respond to several calls requesting comment .
MIAMI ( Reuters ) -
An 11 - year - old girl was charged with drunken driving after leading police on a chase at speeds of up to 100 mph that ended when she flipped the car in an Alabama beach town .
A video camera in the police car captured the look of surprise on the officer ’s face when he approached the wrecked car and got a look at the motorist .
The Mobile Press - Register newspaper said the patrolman saw the Chevrolet Monte Carlo speeding and flashed his lights to signal the driver to stop .
Instead , the car sped faster , traveling at up to 100 mph ( 160 kph ) before sideswiping another vehicle and flipping over in the Gulf Coast town of Orange Beach , Alabama , on Tuesday night .
The young driver , who lived nearby in Perdido Key , Florida , was treated at a hospital for scrapes and bruises and released to relatives .
Police also charged her with speeding , leaving the scene of an accident and reckless endangerment .
The car belonged to a relative and police were still trying to find out where she got the alcohol .
There was none in the vehicle but her blood alcohol level was over the limit for adult motorists , police told the newspaper .
An old yarn about a classic marketing con game on the secret of wealth instructs you to write a book about how to make a lot of money and sell it through the mail .
When your marks receive the book , they discover the secret -- write a book about how to make a lot of money and sell it through the mail .
A confidence scheme similar to this can be found in The Secret ( Simon & Schuster , 2006 ) , a book and DVD by Rhonda Byrne and a cadre of self - help gurus that , thanks to Oprah Winfrey 's endorsement , have now sold more than three million copies combined .
The secret is the so - called law of attraction .
Like attracts like .
Positive thoughts sally forth from your body as magnetic energy , then return in the form of whatever it was you were thinking about .
Such as money .
" The only reason any person does not have enough money is because they are blocking money from coming to them with their thoughts , " we are told .
Damn those poor Kenyans .
If only they were n't such pessimistic sourpusses .
The film 's promotional trailer is filled with such vainglorious money mantras as " Everything I touch turns to gold , " " I am a money magnet , " and , my favorite , " There is more money being printed for me right now . "
Where ?
Kinko's ?
A pantheon of shiny , happy people assures viewers that The Secret is grounded in science : " It has been proven scientifically that a positive thought is hundreds of times more powerful than a negative thought . "
No , it has n't .
" Our physiology creates disease to give us feedback , to let us know we have an imbalanced perspective , and we 're not loving and we 're not grateful . "
Those ungrateful cancer patients .
" You 've got enough power in your body to illuminate a whole city for nearly a week . "
Sure , if you convert your body 's hydrogen into energy through nuclear fusion .
" Thoughts are sending out that magnetic signal that is drawing the parallel back to you . "
But in magnets , opposites attract -- positive is attracted to negative .
" Every thought has a frequency ....
If you are thinking that thought over and over again you are emitting that frequency . "
The brain does produce electrical activity from the ion currents flowing among neurons during synaptic transmission , and in accordance with Maxwell 's equations any electric current produces a magnetic field .
But as neuroscientist Russell A. Poldrack of the University of California , Los Angeles , explained to me , these fields are minuscule and can be measured only by using an extremely sensitive superconducting quantum interference device ( SQUID ) in a room heavily shielded against outside magnetic sources .
Plus , remember the inverse square law : the intensity of an energy wave radiating from a source is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from that source .
An object twice as far away from the source of energy as another object of the same size receives only one - fourth the energy that the closer object receives .
The brain 's magnetic field of 10 - 15 tesla quickly dissipates from the skull and is promptly swamped by other magnetic sources , not to mention the earth 's magnetic field of 10 - 5 tesla , which overpowers it by 10 orders of magnitude !
Ceteris paribus , it is undoubtedly better to think positive thoughts than negative ones .
But in the real world , all other things are never equal , no matter how sanguine your outlook .
Just ask the survivors of Auschwitz .
If the law of attraction is true , then the Jews -- along with the butchered Turkish - Armenians , the raped Nanking Chinese , the massacred Native Americans and the enslaved African - Americans - - had it coming .
The latter exemplar is especially poignant given Oprah 's backing of The Secret on her Web site : " The energy you put into the world - - both good and bad -- is exactly what comes back to you .
This means you create the circumstances of your life with the choices you make every day . "
Africans created the circumstances for Europeans to enslave them ?
Oprah , please , withdraw your support of this risible twaddle -- as you did when you discovered that James Frey 's memoir was a million little lies -- and tell your vast following that prosperity comes from a good dollop of hard work and creative thinking , the way you did it .
Correction :
The original version of this article used the phrase " nuclear fission " where " nuclear fusion " was intended .
Hospitals , doctors ’ offices , restaurants and retailers all added jobs in August .
But the bright spots were few and far between .
Employment in the finance sector — which includes real estate agencies and accounts for about 8.5 million of the country ’s 138 million jobs — was flat in August , which could be a sign that the government numbers have not yet captured some of the mortgage - related job cuts now occurring .
The surveys that made up the Labor Department report measured employment from Aug. 12 to Aug. 18 , when the credit squeeze and subsequent stock market turmoil were under way but not fully felt .
Since then , some large lenders like Countrywide and Lehman Brothers have continued to lay off workers .
And just today , IndyMac Bancorp , a large mortgage lender , said it would be cutting about 1,000 jobs over the next several months .
“ There probably was not that much influence in the data from the credit shock , ” said Richard Berner , chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley .
“ So I think more weakness in the economy is likely .
The economy is clearly losing momentum . ”
The extent to which the economy continues to lose momentum will determine the Fed ’s course of action .
The price of a futures contract tied to Fed policy shows that the central bank will probably cut the benchmark rate , now at 5.25 percent , to 4.5 percent by the end of the year .
But a growing number of economists are saying that might not be soon enough .
Mr. Gault of Global Insight , who is forecasting a half - point cut on Sept. 18 , said it would send “ an important message that the Fed sees there are real problems here , there ’s a real threat , and it needs to have a response that ’s commensurate to that threat . ”
Although the unemployment rate held steady at 4.6 percent , the percentage of adults with jobs fell to 62.8 percent , from 63 percent in July and a peak of 63.4 percent in December .
The number of people who were neither working nor looking for work — and thus considered neither employed nor unemployed by the government — rose by almost 600,000 in August .
“ That ’s a sign of economic weakness , ” Mr. Anderson , of Wells Fargo , said .
“ Perhaps people just gave up trying to find jobs . ”

We may live in a divided nation , but there is one man with the charisma to bring us together .
“ Smiling Bob , ” pitchman for the herbal supplement Enzyte , is destined to annoy us all .
His face , frozen in a wide smile , gets more airtime than Paris Hilton .
According to the ubiquitous television ads , he owes his perma-grin to Enzyte , a pill that delivers “ natural male enhancement . ”
The TV spots never explicitly say what “ natural male enhancement ” means , but the golf clubs and hoses he ’s always clutching give us a clue .
( Presumably , someone decided that a giant cigar would n’t strike the right tone of subtlety . )
The ads have evidently worked , says Dr. Mark Moyad , a urologist and the director of complementary and alternative medicine at the University of Michigan Medical Center .
“ Patients ask about Enzyte all the time , ” he says .
Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals , the Cincinnati - based company that makes and distributes Enzyte , says more than 3 million people have already tried the product .
According to the label , Enzyte is an herbal grab - bag featuring , among other things , Korean red ginseng , Ginkgo biloba , Tribulus terrestris ( a.k.a. puncture vine ) and -- this is true -- horny goat weed ( Epimedium ) .
It also contains less - exotic ingredients such as niacin , copper and zinc .
Enzyte is sold at drugstores everywhere , as well as over the Internet .
A one - month supply costs about $ 50 .

The claims : Smiling Bob ’s facial expression has n’t changed over the years , but the definition of “ natural male enhancement ” certainly has .
Magazine ads from a few years ago promised that Enzyte could add “ one to three inches to your size in just 8 months . ”
Claims have softened dramatically since then , thanks in part to a series of lawsuits from dissatisfied customers .
Now the Enzyte website promises “ firmer and fuller feeling erections , along with improvements in sexual energy , stamina and confidence . ”
Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals declined to comment on its top - selling product .
The bottom line :
Any man who still hopes that “ natural male enhancement ” is code for “ larger penis ” is bound to be disappointed by Enzyte , Moyad says .
In fact , no supplement , vitamin or anything else in a pill could ever make a penis larger , he says .
“ That would be like trying to lengthen your leg . ”
Enzyte is n’t likely to do anything else for a man ’s sex life , says Dr. Ira Sharlip , a urologist at UC San Francisco and president of the International Society for Sexual Medicine .
He ca n’t dismiss the product outright , though , because nobody has ever formally tested it .
“ They do n’t have any evidence that it ’s safe or effective , ” he says .
“ It ’s infuriating that companies can make these claims . ”

Although Enzyte ’s prowess is unproven , Moyad says , some of its ingredients could possibly give men a sexual lift .
A few studies suggest that large doses of Korean red ginseng -- about six times larger than the total herbal blend found in Enzyte -- can treat erectile dysfunction .
In a small Brazilian study published earlier this year , two - thirds of men taking 3 grams of ginseng daily reported stronger erections .
Men taking a placebo did n’t report improvements .
Moyad also thinks Tribulus terrestris might help boost testosterone , which could spark sex drives of men with low levels of the hormone .
( For the record , there ’s no good evidence that horny goat weed lives up to its name either . )
The problem , Moyad says , is that Enzyte takes a scattershot approach -- throwing small amounts of different herbs at sexual problems instead of focusing on any particular herb or condition .
If a man wanted to try an herbal remedy for erection problems , Moyad says , it would make more sense to buy a big batch of ginseng .
“ I ’m a supporter of alternative medicines , ” he says .
“ But I ’m no fan of Enzyte . ”
Evidently , lots of those 3 million Enzyte customers are n’t huge fans either .
Last September , federal prosecutors , spurred by customer complaints , indicted Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals and president Steve Warshak on 112 counts of conspiracy , mail fraud , bank fraud and money laundering .
The company was charged with bilking customers of more than $ 100 million in fraudulent charges .
( The case is still pending . )

Perhaps Bob deserves some credit after all .
A lesser man might have quit smiling long ago .

ask yourself
People who have low self - esteem , or who are suffering from depression , are often convinced that others do n't like them , even when there is no evidence for their negative belief .
People who have a poor self image can be surrounded by others who like them , care about them , and enjoy their company ; yet because these people do n't believe they are worthy of being liked , they are convinced that no one else likes them either .
So , if you are feeling as if nobody likes you , try to find out if there is some real evidence that others do n't like you , or whether you are just being very negative in your opinion of yourself .
On the other hand , there are times when it 's not just your imagination that others do n’t like you .
It might be really true that most of the people you meet are consistently rejecting you , even when you make social overtures and try to be as friendly to them as possible .
There are many reasons this can happen .
You may have moved to a society where the people are very tight knit with each other , and they do n't open up to newcomers easily .
You might be surrounded by people who automatically dislike people of your particular religion , ethnic background , sexual orientation , skin color , or bodily appearance .
You may be surrounded by people who reject you because the clothes you wear are not the latest and most expensive fashion .
In high school years in particular , many teens are strongly conformist , and can be very cruel to those who seem to be different from the norm .
Sadly , some people never grow out of the stage of judging others for trivial and superficial reasons .
If you are really are being rejected by others , it is important that you do n’t make the situation worse by attacking yourself .
This will only make you feel worse , and will make you lose confidence in approaching new people in the future .
Saying negative things to yourself could start you on a downward spiral of self - doubt and self - hatred .
Or you might turn your anger outwards in a spirit of bitterness and revenge towards other people .
This is not a solution that will win you friends or peace of mind .
It 's also important to take a good , hard look at yourself and the way that you interact with other people .
There may be specific behaviors that are causing others to dislike you , and these are behaviors which you can change .
Ask yourself the questions on this checklist .
If it looks as if any of these behaviors are a problem for you , it 's very likely that if you change this behavior , that other people will like you better .
1 . Are you always very negative and complaining all the time ?
Most people find this habit very annoying .
2 . Do you actively participate in conversations with others ?
Or do you hold back and let other people do all the work in making conversation .
If so , learn to improve your conversational skills so that talking with you is an experience that others look forward to .
3 . Do you endlessly talk about yourself and show little interest in the people you are talking with ?
Other people will become bored with you very quickly if you seem only interested in yourself .
4 . Do you try too hard to please others , always agreeing with everything that they say , and never having any opinions of your own ?
People wo n't respect you if you do n't respect yourself .
5 . Do you often say things that hurt the feelings of others and then say it was just a joke ?
Do you say mean things behind other people 's backs ?
No one will trust you if they think that you are basically an unkind person .
If you want to make other people your friends , it 's very important that you do n't give up .
Keep approaching people , keep trying to make conversation .
Get rid of your bad social habits if they are getting in the way of friendship .
If you are being given the cold shoulder by many of the people you encounter , particularly in your school or workplace , keep looking elsewhere for people you can confide in and befriend .
You can try in your church , in your community , and in your own family .
Work on developing the talents and good qualities within yourself so that you can appeal in a new way to other people with whom you will have more in common .
Continue to actively search out other people who will like you and accept you .
Have you been trying hard to make friends with no good results to show for all of your efforts ?
If it seems that you have been trying hard to make friends , but that other people still do n't want to be your friend , you may have come to the conclusion that there 's something wrong with you .
That maybe you are basically unlikeable .
Many of us go through such torment of self doubt , especially during our teenage years , when teens are often the victims of vicious bullying from their peers for no reason at all .
If you feel as if the people you are trying to befriend do n’t like you , the first thing you must do is to :
Do you have any real evidence that others do n't like you ?
Or are you just imagining the worst because you are always very harsh with yourself ?

Monster.com suffered a major data breach at the weekend , with a Trojan horse stealing more than 1.6 million records from the job search site 's database .
Symantec 's Security Response blog reports the Trojan , called Infostealer .
Monstres , can steal sensitive information from Monster.com by using employer accounts which have presumably been compromised by an attacker .
" Such a large database of highly personal information is a spammer 's dream , " Symantec security analyst Amado Hidalgo wrote in the blog .
Using the stolen account , the Trojan logs into Monster.com job recruiter website and searches for all available resumes , potentially lifting the name , email address , home address and phone numbers of its victims .
The program then attempts to post the stolen information on a remote server controlled by the attacker .
From Symantec 's blog :
The Trojan sends HTTP commands to the Monster.com Website to navigate to the Managed Folders section .
It then parses the output from a pop-up window containing the profiles of the candidates that match this recruiter 's saved searches .
The security firm reports the attackers have stolen over 1.6 million entries on the site , with personal information belonging to several hundred thousand individuals , mostly based in the US .
The main file used by the Trojan is ntos.exe , an executable also commonly used by Trojan .
Gpcoder .E , a similar piece of malware .
The Trojans share the Monster.com logo for the executable icon - leading Symantec to speculate the same group is behind both .
Adding to the mess , Trojan .
Gpcoder.E has reportedly been sent in Monster.com phishing emails .
The emails use the personal information to fool users into downloading a Monster Job Seeker Tool , which is in reality , Trojan .
Gpscoder.E .
This nasty executable encrypts files in the affected computer — and leaves a text file demanding the victim pay the attackers in order to recover the data .
Unfortunately , even a massive data security breach such as this one has become commonplace in recent years .
Security watchgroup Privacy Rights Clearinghouse lists 18 data breaches in the US this month alone - not counting Monster.com .
According to the organization , 159 million records containing sensitive personal information have been compromised in the US by security breaches since 2005 .
Symantec has told Monster.com of the compromised recruiter accounts so they can be disabled .
In the meantime , Symantec advises users not to publish personal information on the site - particularly Social Security numbers .
Users should use a separate disposable email address and avoid giving sensitive details until the prospective employer has been established as legitimate .
The firm also recommends users to observe basic security practices , such as keeping your computer up - to - date ; configuring your email to block attachments commonly used to spread viruses such as .vbs , .bat , .exe , .pif and .scr files ; and of course , never execute software that does n't come at your request , or has n't been scanned for viruses first . ®
Jack Thompson believes that a character appearing in Rockstar 's Grand Theft Auto IV is based on him , and wants it removed from the game .
Thompson arrived at this idea after reading an article in the September issue of Game Informer magazine about GTA IV , which explains that one of the first missions in the game is to kill a certain lawyer :
When Niko comes into this lawyer 's office , having used subterfuge to do so , Niko pulls a gun on the lawyer who says , " that the firm supports the second amendment and that ' Guns do n't kill people .
Video games do . ' "
Thompson goes on to say that the lawyer 's mentioning of video games " makes it clearly a reference to me , " and accuses Rockstar of " targeting " him .
He figures that the inclusion of the character amounts to a physical threat , and is demanding that it and " any other references that could reasonably be construed to be references to me " be removed from the game immediately .
Is it likely that the character is at least inspired by Thompson , who has so regularly set Rockstar in his sights ?
Oh , heck , yeah .
Sassy , sure , obnoxious , maybe , but a physical threat ?
That 's a bit of a stretch .

Russian students will be getting used to the Linux screen
By 2009 , all computers in Russian schools are to be run on Linux - which means they will not have to pay for a licence for software , such as Microsoft 's Windows .
Alexey Smirnov , Director General of the Company ALTLinux , said that schools formerly tended to run illegal copies of Microsoft operating systems , but after Russia entered the WTO , the laws became much stricter and schools began to be prosecuted for doing so .
" The situation became rather serious , and something had to be done , " he told BBC World Service 's Digital Planet programme .
" One possible decision was to buy licences for all the software being used - but so much software was being used , it proved too expensive ... so the decision was taken to use free software , although not immediately , but over three years . "
Main principles
The Linux software is to be tested first in three pilot regions , while others will have the option of installing it as a second operating system .
Microsoft's Steve Ballmer has claimed Linux infringed 42 patents
Mr Smirnov said that teachers will need to be trained to use the software and prepare new exercises for the children to do , and that this will entail increased costs in the short term .
" I 'm sure the free software is good enough for schools - but a lot of teachers do not have experience in Linux , or in free software and so on , " he said .
" So they should try it and test it .
It 's not good to make someone use free software - a person should have some choice . "
But he added that he believed schools should teach the main principles of all software anyway .
" If you study specific software , by the time you leave school it will be in other versions , " he said .
" It is not good to teach exact software .
But if you learn Open Office , you can easily understand Word , and vice - versa ... if we want to give really good education , we should make it possible to look inside how it is working , at least for those who are interested in this and how to do it . "
Not locked in
And he dismissed suggestions that using open source might put students at a disadvantage when it comes to finding a job , saying that it is already being used in many Russian universities and has proved advantageous to Russian developers .
Linux 's penguin logo has his own Russian look
" You can use your knowledge and grow very quickly .
It is very important just to be involved in these projects ... they put you in contact with high - level specialists . "
However , technology analysist Bill Thompson told Digital Planet that there was a also an element of political agenda to Russia 's decision .
" There probably is something about not wanting to be locked in to Western software , " he said .
" But there 's also a commercial agenda - not wanting to pay very large licences - and also an educational agenda , about not wanting to tie people in to a particular way of working . "
A research team in Sydney has created molecules that mimic those in plants which harvest light and power life on Earth .
“ A leaf is an amazingly cheap and efficient solar cell , ” says Dr Deanna D’Alessandro , a postdoctoral researcher in the Molecular Electronics Group at the University of Sydney .
“ The best leaves can harvest 30 to 40 percent of the light falling on them .
The best solar cells we can build are between 15 and 20 percent efficient , and expensive to make . ”
“ We ’ve recreated some of the key systems that plants use in photosynthesis , ” says Deanna .
Bacteria and green plants use photosynthesis to convert light energy into usable chemical energy .
Wheel - shaped arrays of molecules called porphyrins collect light and transfer it to the hub where chemical reactions use the light energy to convert carbon dioxide into energy - rich sugar and oxygen .
“ This process , which occurs in about 40 trillionths of a second is fundamental to photosynthesis and is at the base of the food chain for almost all life on Earth , ” says Deanna .
“ We have been able to construct synthetic porphyrins .
More than 100 of them can be assembled around a tree - like core called a dendrimer to mimic the wheel - shaped arrangement in natural photosynthetic systems . ”
These molecules designed by the team are about 1 billionth the size of a soccer ball .
But the large number of porphyrins in a single molecule means that a significant amount of light can be captured and converted to electrical energy – just like in nature .
“ Since they are so efficient at storing energy , we think they could also be used as batteries – replacing the metal - based batteries that our high technology devices depend on today , ” Deanna says .
“ Our preliminary results are very promising .
We are still in the early stages of building practical solar energy devices using our molecules , ” said Deanna .
“ The challenge is immense , but is crucial to providing alternative energy solutions for Australia and the world . ”
Now they ’ve made the molecules , the team along with their Japanese collaborators at Osaka University are working to combine them in the equivalent of a plant cell .
Then , over the next five years they will attempt to scale up the technology to commercial scale solar panels .

山形浩生 の「 CUT」連載が終了した。ワタシはかつて渋谷陽一信者で、「CUT」は創刊号から（たまに買い、主に立ち読みで）目を通してきた雑誌だが、山形浩生の連載が一番の目当てだった。その連載が終わり、氏が書くように「ジャニ系男性アイドル中心の雑誌になる」のなら、もうこの雑誌を手にとることもないだろう。
ただここ数年、氏の連載を以前ほど楽しめなくなっていたのは正直に認めないといけない。彼が変わったのか、ワタシが変わったのか。
両方変わったに決まっている。
それでもこの連載を通じ、いろんな面白い本を教えてもらったのは間違いない。以下、個人的に思い出深い回を紹介することでこの連載を勝手に振り返ろうと思う。
掲載号については、インデックスページと個別ページの記述にズレがあったりして正確を期すことができないので割愛させてもらう。
Dr. Roberts also correctly states that Bush \Cheney are more evil than Hitler \Stalin and that the followers of the NEO - CONS have a mentality that is " like that of the brown shirts that followed Hitler " .
Every American who voted Republican shares responsibility for the great evil America has brought to the Middle East .
The evil that America brought to Iraq transcends the tens or hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians who have been killed and maimed in the conflict .
The evil goes beyond the destruction of ancient historical artifacts and the civilian infrastructure of a secular state and the decimation of the lives , careers , and families of millions of Iraqis .
The violence and killing that Bush brought to Iraq has spread antagonism between Sunni and Shiite throughout the Middle East with potentially draconian consequences .
Bush ’s war has turned Muslim hearts and minds against America and made terrorism an acceptable means to resist American hegemony .
With his mindless war , Bush has created more terrorism than the world has ever seen .
The reasons given for the American invasion of Iraq have been exposed as lies , revealing America as either a country of fools and idiots or of war criminals .
Worldwide polls show that America is no longer regarded as a guiding light but is tied with Israel as the second greatest threat to world stability Iran was rated as the # 1 threat to the world .
Picture of Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and believe me he is as pissed off as he looks .
The Neo-Cons now try to portray Roberts as some senile old kook but in reality he is 7 years younger than Dick Cheney who is 66 .
I would also like to know why they were consulting Dr. Roberts on economic policy in both 2001 and 2002 if he were some brainless dude .
The fact is that he only conveniently became a " senile old fart " once he spoke out against their war .
As the Senate bill to block torture is blocked by Bush and Cheney , the promotion of torture in official circles continues .
Roberts outlined his conviction that the torture program was not set up to gain any kind of real information from accused detainees because torture is renowned for extracting useless and false information .
The real reason for the torture is to make the terrorists implicate themselves and thus create the perception of a real terrorist threat .
Roberts said that the CIA was aware that the vast majority of detainees are not terrorists , proven by the fact that Pakistani gangsters admitted to rounding up innocent people in street sweeps and selling them to the US government as terrorists for anything up to $ 25,000 .
These people are now at Guantanamo Bay .
Roberts pointed out that only nine so - called terrorists have been brought to trial and none have been convicted .* ( see David Hicks below )
Why do individuals have to be held for five years without trial if there is proof that they can be convicted with ?
Army interrogators have gone public with their frustrations that these people are obviously not terrorists but they are still ordered to keep them .
Images of mass ranks of terrorists are pure lies on the part of the insane Neo -Cons .
Roberts said that America is the most hated nation on earth by design and that the military is completely out of control .
The barbarism in Iraq practiced by the US occupational government will live in infamy when it is historically judged by hindsight .
I do n't care that Paul Craig Roberts is a Paleoconservative who worked as one of Reagans main financial henchmen for two terms as long as he is now calling for Bush and Cheney 's heads .
I obviously was n't a big fan of Reagan or his economic policies .
In fact Dr. Roberts was the " Father of Reaganomics " which was the economic plan of the Reagan White House .
The reason I feel this way about Paul Craig Roberts and others of his ilk is because the war in Iraq is evil .
We also need as many allies as we can get to help end this disasterous war .
Dr. Roberts has now left the Republican party and hopefully many more like minded GOP members will follow him ( Democratic Senator Jim Webb another former Republican for example also served under Reagan as the United States Secretary of the Navy ) .
While I do n't agree with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts pro big business and small government economic policies I realize that we need anti-war conservatives like him to help expose the dreaded NEO - CONS for what they truly are and that my friends is American Nazi's .
As Winston Churchill once famously put it " I 'd march into hell and ally with the devil himself to defeat Hitler . "
That 's exactly my sentiments towards the current Bush / Cheney Neo -Con administration .
The enemy of my enemy is my friend at least so temporarily .
I also agree with Dr. Roberts on sending Bush / Cheney to the Hague Court to have these Neo -Con Bastards tried as War Criminals and then as traitors after they have been impeached for getting us into this Iraqi mess .
* Update : David Hicks the so called Australian Taliban has since been convicted after this article was written .
He took a plea bargain which allowed him to return to Australia he is now free at home .
The way I see it he had a choice of being held indefinitely without a trial or taking the deal to go back home to live with his family in freedom since he had already been in Guantanamo for 5 years they gave him an offer that he could n't refuse .
David Hicks Video
Bush has now graduated from playing with toy soldiers .
A picture says a thousand words .
The Nazi's also claimed that they were just following orders .
A U.S. study suggests five preventive services could save more than 100,000 lives a year , including 45,000 by just taking a daily low - dose aspirin .
The study -- funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the WellPoint Foundation -- found serious deficiencies in the use of preventive care for the nation and particularly among racial and ethnic minorities .
Researchers said many lives could be saved by increasing to 90 percent the portion of :
-- Adults who take aspirin daily to prevent heart disease .
-- Smokers advised by a health professional to quit and are offered medication or other assistance .
-- Adults 50 and older who are screened for colorectal cancer .
-- Adults 50 and older immunized against influenza .
-- Women 40 and older who are screened for breast cancer .
-- Sexually active young women who are screened for chlamydial infection .
" This report illustrates that the health benefits would be great if more people took preventive actions , " said Dr. Julie Gerberding , CDC director .
" More illnesses would be avoided , fewer lives would be lost , and there would be more efficient use of our limited health care resources . "

Too Hot of a Potato : A Citizen Soldier 's Encounter With the Polygraph
George W. Maschke
2 February 2004
On Monday , 15 May 1995 , FBI polygrapher Jack Trimarco met me for the first time in his life and within three hours concluded that I am a spy , drug dealer , and drug abuser .
The FBI rejected my application to become an FBI special agent and entered my polygraph examiner 's false accusations of deception into my permanent FBI Headquarters file .
The FBI 's accusations have had life - changing consequences for me , and I am telling my story to help hasten the day that our government ends its misplaced reliance on the pseudoscience of polygraphy , a practice it has with good reason prohibited the private sector from employing .
Promotion to the rank of specialist four
I had held a security clearance since 1983 , when I enlisted as a private in the US Army as an interrogator .
After taking my fingerprints and running a National Agency Check ( NAC ) , the Army granted me a secret clearance .
After completing the interrogation course at the US Army Intelligence Center ( USAIC ) , Fort Huachuca , Arizona , and Arabic language training at the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center ( DLIFLC ) at the Presidio of Monterey , California , I served for more than two years as a strategic debriefer with a Military Intelligence unit overseas .
I debriefed human intelligence sources ( militarese for " people " ) in the Arabic language during this period and prepared Intelligence Information Reports ( IIRs ) based on my debriefings .
The Army twice awarded me the Army Commendation Medal ( ARCOM ) for my intelligence work .
I rose through the ranks from private ( E - 1 ) to sergeant ( E - 5 ) .
Newly commissioned as a second lieutenant ,
with my late father
While overseas , I took night courses at the University of Maryland , and in 1987 , the Army awarded me a two - year ROTC scholarship to finish my bachelor 's degree .
I majored in Middle Eastern studies and learned Persian ( Farsi ) to complement my Arabic .
In 1989 , I completed my bachelor 's degree , received a commission as a second lieutenant in the Army Reserve , and was assigned to the Military Intelligence branch .
After a Special Background Investigation ( SBI ) , the Army granted me a top secret security clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented Information ( SCI ) , a category of top secret information deemed particularly sensitive .
In 1990 , I returned to Fort Huachuca to attend the six - month Military Intelligence Officer Basic Course ( MIOBC ) .
While I was in training there , Iraq invaded Kuwait .
Shortly thereafter , the command took a survey seeking soldiers who spoke Arabic , Persian ( Farsi ) , or French .
I duly reported that I had working fluency in all three languages .
I expected that I 'd be called to active duty upon graduation from the course .
But none of the reserve officers in my class were called up at that time , and in the fall of 1990 , I began graduate studies .
It was not until January 1991 , after having called the Army Reserve personnel center several times to volunteer , that I received a call from a lieutenant colonel .
He spoke of a highly sensitive mission , and instructed me to report to the FBI 's Los Angeles Field Office ( LAFO ) in the Federal Building at 11000 Wilshire Boulevard .
An FBI employee guided me to a room furnished with a gray table , a steel chair , and a telephone .
Then I was left alone .
The phone rang .
The voice at the other end spoke in Arabic .
We conversed for about half an hour .
I had passed the test .
I took a leave of absence from the university and about a week later , I was at the Office of the Chief of the Army Reserve ( OCAR ) at the Pentagon .
Instead of joining our forces in the Persian Gulf region , as I had hoped and expected , I learned that I was to spend the war in Washington , DC , attached to the FBI 's Washington Metropolitan Field Office ( WMFO ) .
" 2ND LT .
George W. Maschke
United States Army
Presented with deep appreciation for
service in providing invaluable Arabic
translation assistance to the FBI during
Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm "
I spent the duration of the war working in a secure area with no windows at the Bureau 's Buzzard Point office tower , located across the street from an often foul - smelling sewage treatment plant .
I can not go into the details of what I did there , but it was of a counterintelligence nature and highly classified .
I am proud of the work I did there , and I admired the dedication of the men and women of the FBI who were working to prevent terrorism on the home front .
After Iraq capitulated , I spent another month and a half at the Los Angeles Field Office doing similar work .
The director of the FBI at the time , William S. Sessions , sent me a letter of appreciation for my work ( view PDF ) , as did my senior FBI supervisor , Supervisory Special Agent ( SSA ) Bruce Canaga ( view PDF ) .
After my release from active duty , I returned to the university , where I continued my studies .
Then , on 26 February 1993 , terrorists bombed the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan , killing John DiGiovanni , Robert Kirkpatrick , Stephen Knapp , William Macko , Wilfredo Mercado , and Monica Smith , an expectant mother .
Many more were injured .
Some five months later , I received a call from OCAR .
An NCO there remembered me from the Gulf War , and had found my phone number from a telephone directory .
She asked me to volunteer for " a mission in New York . "
I agreed , and after a brief stop at OCAR 's new office in Rosslyn , Virginia and in - processing at the Pentagon , I proceeded to the FBI 's New York Field Office .
The matter at hand was indeed the World Trade Center bombing ( TRADEBOMB ) case .
The Army had sent me and two other Arabic linguists to help the FBI in the translation of a bomb manual seized from a suspect in the case .
My fellow soldiers and I finished translating the book in about a month -- one - third of the time that the supervisory special agent in charge of the counterintelligence section to which we were assigned had anticipated .
About the time we had finished translating the bomb manual , two prosecutors from the US Attorney 's Office for the Southern District of New York , which was prosecuting the case , came to the FBI 's offices and asked for help translating some Arabic documents .
My Army colleagues and I gladly volunteered .
The FBI 's own people had been reluctant to work in the hot , stuffy offices of the US Attorney 's Office where the original documentary evidence from the case was stored .
And the original documents had been chemically treated to reveal fingerprints .
They were purplish and foul smelling .
Cotton gloves were required to handle them .
The FBI employees preferred to work with copies of the documents in the Bureau 's roomy air - conditioned offices .
But that was less efficient than working with the actual evidence , which was often much easier to read .
My fellow soldiers and I spent the next three months at the US Attorney 's Office cataloging , assessing , and translating documents that the FBI had failed to properly exploit for intelligence value .
Most of what we translated was submitted in court as evidence in the TRADEBOMB case and is a matter of public record , and that is why I can discuss these details .
I performed additional duties that I cannot discuss .
FBI Director Louis Freeh sent me a letter of appreciation for my work ( view PDF ) , as did then Secretary of Defense Bill Perry ( view PDF ) and then Army Chief - of - Staff General Gordon R. Sullivan ( view PDF ) .
The work I did in support of the TRADEBOMB case was the most important and satisfying work I had done in my life .
I felt had made a difference .
While in New York , I was again highly impressed by the devotion to duty and hard work of some of the men and women assigned to the TRADEBOMB case , though I also saw problems with the way the FBI managed its intelligence assets and had ideas on how to improve operations .
My two tours of duty with the FBI so impressed me that I decided to become a special agent in the FBI .
I wanted to make fighting terrorism my life 's work .
After being released from active duty in the TRADEBOMB case , I returned to the university .
Having completed my master 's degree before leaving for New York , I continued to work toward a doctorate .
In the Army Reserve , I was assigned through the Individual Mobilization Augmentee ( IMA ) program to Special Operations Command South ( SOCSO ) , then headquartered in Panama .
For seventeen days per year , I worked in the J - 2 ( intelligence ) section .
In late 1994 , expecting to have the courses necessary for my doctorate completed by the spring of 1995 , I applied to become a Special Agent in the FBI .
I took and passed a battery of general exams , and then tested in several languages , including Arabic and Persian ( Farsi ) .
On 10 May 1995 , SSA Sue C. of the Los Angeles Field Office called me .
She wanted me to start work in two weeks as a contract linguist pending agent hire .
I agreed to begin working 20 hours per week at LAFO .
She told me she 'd schedule a polygraph exam for me .
The following day , SSA Mike Hilliard , the chief of recruiting at Los Angeles , called me to schedule a face - to - face meeting at the FBI 's San Francisco office on June 9th .
The Bureau would pay for my flight and hotel .
On 15 May 1995 , I went to the Los Angeles Field Office for the polygraph exam that SSA Sue C. had requested for me .
Special Agent ( SA ) Jack Trimarco greeted me at the receptionist 's desk and escorted me to a room inside .
He began by telling me that the Bureau had done extensive checking of my background and knew that I was a person of strong moral character .
I was surprised by that remark , because I had only completed my Special Agent Qualifications Questionnaire ( Form FD - 843 ) and Application for Employment ( Form FD - 140 ) listing references -- the starting point for a background investigation -- the day before .
I carried them by hand to the FBI 's offices on the day of the polygraph exam .
The FBI had not had adequate time to investigate my background , and SA Trimarco had barely managed to squeeze me into his schedule a couple days earlier .
I knew he had to be lying , but I kept this to myself .
We then discussed my background and why I wanted to become an FBI agent .
I told him the same things I 've described to you thus far , but in greater detail .
Then , he asked me what I knew about the polygraph .
I told him that I had once served as a translator during a polygraph examination .
The Army polygrapher I was assisting had briefly explained to me how the polygraph works .
I knew that the polygraph measured the subject 's breathing , blood pressure , pulse , and perspiration rates ( the latter as indicated by skin conductivity ) .
I also knew that the polygrapher asked a number of " control " questions in order to compare the results with the physiological responses measured while the subject answered the " relevant " questions .
SA Trimarco told me that there was a new polygraph testing method , and that control questions were n't used anymore .
I was later to learn that he was lying to me about this , too .
He asked what the results of that polygraph exam at which I translated had been .
The polygrapher had found the test inconclusive and asked for my gut feeling as an interrogator .
I had sensed no deception on the part of the person being polygraphed .
SA Trimarco then assured me about the accuracy of the polygraph .
He said it was 98 % accurate .
He told me that one in three FBI Special Agent candidates are rejected because they lie during the pre-employment polygraph exam .
That seemed like a very high fraction to me .
How could so many people with something to hide want to be FBI agents ?
I did n't ask .
He claimed that he was one of the Bureau 's best polygraphers , and told me a story in support of that claim .
I doubted his story , though , because if it were true , he would have been divulging classified information to someone ( me ) who clearly did not have a need to know .
I will not repeat his story here , on the off chance that it was not a lie and that my revealing it would constitute a breach of security ( and possibly put a man 's life at risk ) .
We then went over all the questions that he was going to ask me during the polygraph exam .
The questions ranged from whether I had ever stolen anything , lied to a family member , or driven while under the influence of alcohol to whether I had ever sold or used illegal drugs , whether I had been careless in the handling of classified information , whether I had divulged classified information to any unauthorized persons , and whether I had had contacts with foreign intelligence services .
I had to answer " yes " to some of these questions .
At the age of seven or eight , I had indeed shoplifted a Hostess cupcake from the local supermarket .
My mother had made me go to the store manager , apologize , and pay for my stolen goods .
( And I paid for it once we got home , too ! )
And I had indeed had limited contact with foreign intelligence services when I was on active military duty overseas .
But that was all in the course of my duties , and it was with allied forces .
All aboveboard .
I had never sold or used an illegal drug .
And I had never driven while under the influence of alcohol .
We went over each " yes " answer that I gave , and SA Trimarco accordingly modified his questions , " Other than what we discussed , have you ever stolen anything ?
Other than what we discussed , have you had contacts with foreign intelligence services ? "
We continued this process until I could honestly answer " no " to all the questions .
SA Trimarco then hooked me up to the machine and asked me the questions we had reviewed .
About midway through , he complained that my breathing was slowing down and was too slow .
As I tried to breath faster to please him , he asked the remaining questions .
I think he repeated some questions .
When he was done , he informed me that I had shown signs of deception on the questions about unauthorized release of classified information and contacts with foreign intelligence agencies .
I was shocked .
How could he tell me I 'm lying when I 'm telling the truth ?!
He showed me the charts and pointed to a region where he claimed I had shown deception , but I could n't make head or tail of it .
We went through all the questions again .
When we were finished , SA Trimarco told me he was certain that I was being deceptive in denying having released classified information to unauthorized persons and in denying having had unauthorized contacts with foreign intelligence agencies .
In so many words , he was accusing me of being a spy .
I told him he was absolutely mistaken , that I 've never violated the trust my government has placed in me , and that I wanted to be re-tested .
He told me that the records of my exam would be sent to Washington for an expedited review and that I might be contacted for a second test , but that it was unlikely .
I left the Bureau 's offices where I had proudly served just four years earlier in a state of shock such as I have never experienced before or since .
I felt dizzy and numb all over .
I fully appreciate now the meaning of the word " dumbfounded . "
How could SA Trimarco think that I 'm a spy when I answered all his questions truthfully ?
When I got home , I called SSA Mike Hilliard , the chief of recruiting at LAFO , to protest my innocence .
The man who had been warm and cordial just four days earlier was now cold and hostile .
He claimed that " other " derogatory information about me had come to light .
I told him that if he really thought I was a spy , that the Bureau had damned well better launch a criminal investigation against me .
SSA Hilliard curtly replied that the Bureau just might do that .
And that was the end of our conversation .
Three weeks had gone by , and I had heard nothing from the FBI .
I wanted to re-take the polygraph exam to prove my innocence .
I sent the following letter to FBI Director Louis Freeh :
Monday , 5 June 1995 LOUIS J. FREEH , DIRECTOR , FBI JEH FBI BUILDING 10TH & PENNSYLVANIA AVE . , NW WASHINGTON , DC 20535 Dear Sir : I am an applicant for a Special Agent 's position with the FBI .
On 15 May 1995 I had a pre-employment polygraph interview at the Los Angeles Field Office .
The polygrapher concluded that I was attempting to deceive him .
He was absolutely mistaken .
I answered every question truthfully .
I made no attempt to deceive him either by lying or by omission of detail .
On the contrary , I provided him with additional information not asked for in Form FD - 140 , but that I thought would be important for a background investigator to know .
I ask of you that my application not be rejected on the basis of the polygrapher 's mistaken finding and that I be given the opportunity to clear my name .
I am a 12 - year veteran of the US Army , having served in both an active and reserve capacity .
I have served as an interrogator , strategic debriefer , and tactical intelligence officer --- and have continuously held a security clearance since 1983 .
Throughout my career , I have made devotion to duty and integrity the standards by which I live and work .
My military service has extended me the pleasure of working closely with the FBI .
During the Gulf War , I was mobilized and tasked to the Washington Metropolitan Field Office , where I supported the Bureau 's counterintelligence / counterterrorist operations .
After the World Trade Center bombing , I was recalled to active military duty and tasked to support the New York Field Office 's investigation of the bombing .
( You sent me a letter of appreciation after the bombers were convicted . )
In both cases , I worked closely with investigating Special Agents .
This experience leads me to pursue a career as a Special Agent in the FBI .
On both occasions , I knew that I was doing something truly important for our nation 's security .
I am convinced that my intelligence experience and language skills ( I speak Arabic , Farsi , and French well ) can best be put to use in the FBI .
Based on my experience , I believe that I can and will do well as a Special Agent .
I have a strong desire to serve .
Please give me the opportunity to clear my name .
Since May 15th , when your polygrapher told me I had " shown deception , " I have been at first completely dumbfounded , then agitated and confused .
The polygrapher 's demeanor and that of the chief of recruitment in Los Angeles changed instantly from warm and cordial to curt and suspicious .
I am eager for the opportunity to restore my reputation , and to prove that your previous confidence in me was not misplaced .
Sincerely , George W. Maschke 1LT , Military Intelligence USAR Enclosures : Letter from FBI Director Louis J. Freeh , dated 21 March 1994 Letter from FBI Director William S. Sessions , dated 14 November 1991
FBI Director Louis Freeh never replied .
Nor did anyone from the FBI contact me .
I could not imagine how the Bureau could not want to re-examine me after their ace polygrapher had determined that I was lying when I denied having disclosed classified information to unauthorized persons and having had contact with foreign intelligence agencies .
I had recently worked in the heart of the Bureau 's counterterrorist and counterintelligence operations in Washington , DC , Los Angeles , and New York .
Had I really been a spy , I could have compromised numerous highly sensitive investigations and put the lives of FBI personnel in danger .
And to top it all off , my father , who had died of cancer two months before my polygraph exam , had been a respected scientist with a Q clearance and had worked on classified projects in New Mexico .
If the son of such a scientist had indeed been in cahoots with a foreign intelligence agency , I would have thought that the FBI would want to know .
But no one called me .
I began to get a little paranoid .
I wondered if my phone was being monitored .
I wondered if I was the subject of a counterintelligence investigation .
I still do n't know , but I doubt that the FBI ever investigated me after falsely accusing me and rejecting my application .
The easiest way to investigate further would have been to ask me to take another polygraph exam .
I would have gladly done so .
While the FBI did not contact me , it contacted others .
At about the same time I had applied to be an FBI agent , I had also volunteered my time to the Los Angeles Police Department ( LAPD ) .
Detectives Bill F. and John R. of the department 's Anti-Terrorist Division ( ATD ) had asked me to look at some Arabic documents .
I was glad to help , and they eventually asked if I 'd be willing to become a technical reservist in the LAPD .
( Technical reservists are volunteers who have a special skill .
They do n't attend the police academy and they do n't carry a gun . )
I agreed to become a technical reservist , and by the time I had taken my polygraph exam with the FBI , I had already gone through the LAPD 's screening process and my LAPD identification card had just been made up .
Detective F. was holding it for me .
But after my polygraph exam with the FBI , the LAPD asked me to come to their headquarters at Parker Center in downtown Los Angeles to take a polygraph exam .
I gladly consented .
This was my opportunity to clear my name .
My suspicion that the FBI had contacted the LAPD was confirmed by the questions that Ervin L. Youngblood , the LAPD polygrapher , asked me .
His questions mirrored those that SA Jack Trimarco had asked .
In the course of the exam , Mr. Youngblood angrily accused me of employing " countermeasures . "
I forcefully ( and truthfully ) denied it .
At the time , I did not even understand what polygraph " countermeasures " are .
His angry outburst provoked a similarly angry reaction from me .
I told him that if he really thought I was lying and employing " countermeasures , " that he was a lousy polygrapher .
In my anger , I gave him a few other suggestions that I wo n't repeat here .
I had volunteered my time to my local police department and had answered all his questions truthfully .
I did not appreciate this sort of treatment .
At least SA Trimarco had not raised his voice when he accused me in so many words of being a spy .
I told Det. F. all about the unpleasantness with Mr. Youngblood .
He did not seem very concerned about the polygraph .
As he escorted me to the elevator to leave the building , he remarked in passing , " You just pucker up your asshole . "
At the time , I did not understand what he meant .
After having been labelled a spy by one polygrapher and accused of employing " countermeasures " by another , I realized I needed to learn more about polygraphy .
I read the first edition of Professor David Thoreson Lykken 's A Tremor in the Blood : Uses and Abuses of the Lie Detector .
A second edition has since been published by Plenum Press .
It is must reading for anyone who has been falsely accused based on the polygraph -- and for anyone involved in setting government employment policy .
I learned from Professor Lykken 's book that the exam that SA Trimarco of the FBI administered was a standard " probable - lie control question test " and that SA Trimarco had flat out lied when he told me that he was using a " new procedure " with no " control " questions .
I also learned that my own understanding of the term " control question " was different from that of the polygrapher who had explained the polygraph to me years before I sat for SA Trimarco 's polygraph exam .
To an interrogator like myself , a " control question " is " one to which you already know the answer . "
You ask it to check if the person you 're interrogating is being honest .
But in the polygrapher 's parlance , a control question is one that is not pertinent to what the polygrapher really wants to get at , but which he hopes and expects will provoke a deceptive response .
The polygrapher wants the subject to lie so that he can compare the subject 's physical responses measured while answering the " control " questions to responses measured while answering the " relevant " questions ( in my case , the ones about espionage that really counted ) .
If the responses to the " relevant " questions are stronger than those to the " control " questions , the subject must be lying .
Or so the theory goes .
If it seems overly simplistic to you , you 're right .
As Professor Lykken notes , " ... the theory and methods of polygraphic lie detection are not rocket science , indeed , they are not science at all . "
The question I was asked about drunk driving was a control question .
SA Trimarco mistakenly ( and I think arrogantly ) assumed that I ( as a soldier , I suppose ) must have driven while under the influence of alcohol .
He lectured me on the evils of drunk driving , and how nobody who ever drove while drunk could ever be an FBI agent .
It was a determining criterion in hiring .
( Curiously , he did not lecture me on the evils of espionage before hooking me up to his machine . )
Having assumed that I must have driven while intoxicated at some point in my life , the polygrapher tried to make me think that if I conceded having done so , the FBI would never hire me .
He wanted me to lie .
But I answered the question about drunk driving honestly and was n't in the least bit worried about it .
I have never driven while drunk .
I find it ironic that the FBI would hire people who have driven under the influence of alcohol and then lie about it to an FBI polygrapher .
Is that the kind of person you want carrying a gun and enforcing the law ?
That 's the kind of person the FBI 's pre-employment polygraph examination is designed to pass .
By the way , now that you understand the true function of the " control " questions ( you 're not supposed to know ) , you are no longer a suitable candidate for a polygraph test , even by polygraphy 's own simplistic theory .
But that does n't mean that if your job requires polygraph screening , you 'll be exempted if you admit your knowledge .
When I asked the president of the American Polygraph Association how polygraphers are to handle those who admit to knowing the truth about the " control " questions , he declined to provide a responsive answer .
But clearly , if the polygraph community were to begin routinely granting waivers to those who admit such knowledge , the news would quickly spread , and the whole polygraph house of cards would soon collapse .
I also learned about polygraph countermeasures -- means by which anyone can pass the polygraph , whether or not one is telling the truth with regard to the relevant questions .
Such techniques include contracting the anal sphincter muscle when answering the " control " questions .
That 's what Det. Bill F. had meant with the cryptic remark , " You just pucker up your asshole . "
Aldrich Ames , the CIA agent whose treachery cost the lives of US intelligence assets abroad , had easily " passed " his counterintelligence polygraph exams .
He was only one of many spies who beat the polygraph .
Those publicly known to have done so include Karel Frantisek Köcher ( aka Karl Koecher ) , Larry Wu-tai Chin , and Ana Belen Montes .
Det. Bill F. of the LAPD eventually called me and told me that he had been asked to ask me for my resignation , based solely on the polygraph .
On 15 January 1996 , I sent the following letter to then LAPD Chief Willie Williams by certified mail :
15 January 1996 CHIEF WILLIE WILLIAMS LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT 150 NORTH LOS ANGELES STREET LOS ANGELES CA 90012 Dear Chief Williams ,
In late 1994 , I began the process of becoming a Technical Reservist in the Los Angeles Police Department 's Anti-Terrorist Division .
Detectives Bill F. and John R. led me through the process .
I had placed my language ( Arabic and Persian ) and intelligence analysis skills ( I am an Army reserve intelligence officer and trained interrogator ) at your disposal .
On at least two occasions , I have come in to Parker Center to examine Arabic - language documents .
Dets. F. and R. suggested that I would be of more use to the Department if I were to volunteer and become a Technical Reservist , and I readily agreed .
I filled out the required forms , was fingerprinted , and had a background investigation including an interview with an investigator .
All went well .
Finally , I had a polygraph interview at Parker Center .
A senior polygrapher rudely and angrily accused me of employing " countermeasures " to thwart the polygrapher .
( Specifically , I was accused of breathing unnaturally slowly ) .
This is simply not true .
I made no effort to alter my breathing during the polygraph examination .
I answered all questions candidly and without mental reservation or purpose of evasion .
Some weeks after my polygraph examination , Det. F. informed me that a meeting had been held and it had been decided that I would be retained as a Technical Reservist , despite the polygrapher 's accusations .
But on Wednesday , 10 January 1996 , Det. F. called me and told me that he had been asked to call me and ask for my resignation .
He explained that a meeting had been held , and that it had been decided that if an exception to the polygraph policy were made in my case , then it would have to be made for everyone .
Chief Williams , I do not wish to resign my position as a Technical Reservist with the Los Angeles Police Department .
To do so would , in my opinion , amount to an admission of some sort of guilt or wrongdoing .
I have done nothing wrong .
If I do not enjoy your full support and confidence , then by all means do not hesitate to dismiss me .
But please send me a letter of dismissal , stating the policy reasons behind my dismissal .
Sincerely , George W. Maschke
I want to make clear that all personnel of the Anti-Terrorist Division , especially Det. Bill F. , have accorded me the highest degree of respect and professional courtesy .
Chief Williams never replied .
After having asked for and not received my resignation , the LAPD decided that I had never " actually " become a technical reservist ( my ID card was still in Det. F.'s possession ) , and that my resignation or dismissal was not really necessary , after all .
Meanwhile , I had still heard nothing from the FBI .
On 16 January , I sent another letter to FBI Director Louis Freeh :
Tuesday , 16 January 1996 LOUIS J FREEH DIRECTOR FBI 10TH & PENNSYLVANIA AVE NW WASHINGTON DC 20535 Dear Mr. Freeh , I am an applicant for a Special Agent 's position in the FBI .
On 15 May 1995 , I had a pre-employment polygraph interview at the Los Angeles Field Office .
The polygrapher , SA Jack Trimarco , told me that I was being deceptive , and that the recordings would be sent to Washington for an " expedited " review , after which I would be contacted and possibly re-polygraphed .
In June of last year , I wrote you a letter asking that I be given the opportunity to clear myself of the polygrapher 's accusations .
I have not received a response from you , and fear that my original letter did not reach you .
Thus I am writing again , and enclosing a copy of my original correspondence .
Eight months have elapsed since my polygraph interview , and I have yet to hear from anyone in the FBI regarding the status of my application .
I have received no response to a letter I wrote to the chief of recruitment at the Los Angeles Field Office , SSA Michael Hilliard .
I wish to reaffirm to you my sincere desire to serve my country as a FBI Special Agent .
I did not deceive the polygrapher or anyone else in the FBI .
I am eager for the opportunity to remove any doubts about my integrity .
Sincerely , George W. Maschke 1LT , Military Intelligence USAR Enclosures : Letter to you dated 5 June 1995 Letter of Appreciation from you dated 21 March 1994 Letter of Appreciation from FBI Director William S. Sessions dated 14 November 1991 Letter to SSA Michael Hilliard dated 7 December 1995
Again , Director Freeh never replied .
But in March , Deputy Assistant Director James A . Oppy wrote me apologizing for the delay in responding and stating :
Although your desire to become affiliated with this Bureau is appreciated , we are unable to further process your application based on the results of your polygraph examination .
As you are aware , all applicants for FBI employment must successfully pass a pre-employment polygraph examination .
The results of your examination were not within acceptable parameters .
This was the FBI 's polite way of telling me to go to hell .
All my honorable service to my country counted for nothing , and I would not be granted any opportunity to clear my name .
Because a man with a machine who had just met me the same day concluded that I am some sort of spy .
No appeal .
Several years later , I later requested all FBI files about me , including polygraph charts , under the Privacy Act .
My FBI HQ file was released to me on 24 July 2001 .
I learned that although SA Trimarco had only asked me about counterintelligence issues during his post - test interrogation , he had in fact deemed me to have been deceptive with regard to all of the relevant questions :
Series I Has anyone directed you to seek employment with the FBI ?
Answer - No .
Other than what you told me , have you ever been in contact with anyone from a non-U.S. Intelligence Service ?
Answer - No .
Have you ever provided classified information to any unauthorized individuals ?
Answer - No. Series II
Have you ever sold any illegal drugs ?
Answer - No .
Have you ever used any illegal drugs ?
Answer - No .
Have you deliberately withheld any important information from your application ?
Answer - No .
SA Trimarco concluded , " It is the opinion of this examiner that the applicant was deceptive when responding to the listed relevant questions in Series I and Series II . "
I was eager to see my polygraph charts , but in releasing my FBI HQ file , John H. Kelso , Jr. , Section Chief of the Freedom of Information - Privacy Acts Section , Office of Public and Congressional Affairs , averred , " At this time , we ware [ sic ] unable to locate your polygraph chart .
We are making every effort to locate this material .
When it is located , it will be processed and released to you . "
But at the time of writing ( Feb. 2004 ) , I have still not received the polygraph chart that the FBI used as the basis for branding me as a liar .
I would like to believe that the FBI truly is making " every effort " to find my polygraph charts .
But after more than two years of waiting , it is hard to believe that the Bureau is making any good faith effort .
About the time I applied for employment with the FBI , my top secret clearance with the Army was due for a periodic review .
My clearance had been administratively downgraded to secret pending review , a standard procedure , as five years had elapsed since my clearance was granted .
I was interviewed by an investigator from the Defense Investigative Service ( DIS , since re-organized and renamed the Defense Security Service ) , but for some five years , no determination on my top secret clearance was made by the Central Clearance Facility ( CCF ) at Fort Meade , Maryland .
On a winter
field exercise
After my FBI polygraph exam , I continued to serve in the Army Reserve in capacities that did not require access to top secret information and was promoted to captain .
I left Special Operations Command South to join a reserve linguist company in the Los Angeles area .
I served as company training officer , represented my unit at military intelligence functions , and earned and kept the trust and respect of my fellow soldiers , including all whom I told about my experience with the FBI .
In the fall of 1997 , I moved overseas to work for an international organization , and was assigned to the Army 's Individual Ready Reserve ( IRR ) .
Being in the IRR means that you 're basically just a name on a piece of paper , someone the Army can mobilize in time of need .
In January 1999 , I had another background interview , this time with an Army counterintelligence ( CI ) agent .
I learned that the reason that it had taken so long to update my top secret clearance was that the FBI had reported derogatory information about me to the Army based on the pre-employment polygraph exam .
I answered all of the CI agent 's questions truthfully and in detail .
Under the Privacy Act , I later received a copy of the CI agent 's report .
He concluded :
Subject responded favorably regarding questions posed about his conduct ( including use of alcohol or drugs ) , employment , school attendance , activities , associates , and personal finances .
The questioning developed no criminal conduct , nor any mental problems or treatment ; and the responses raised no questions of judgment or reliability .
Subject 's comments indicated he is loyal to the US ; and he reported for himself , family , and associates no involvement in or advocacy of force to overthrow the US Government or the use of force or violence to deny others their constitutional / legal rights .
Subject denied any personal knowledge of the unauthorized disclosures of classified information , the illegal transfer of US technology , or the involvement with any hostile intelligence activity directed against the US .
Subject provided information about his family , activities , associates , and personal life , none of which disclosed any adverse or questionable areas indicative of his susceptibility to coercion , pressure , or blackmail to act against the US .
Subject was completely cooperative , responded to all questions , without hesitation , and expressed no reservations about the holding of a security clearance .
In August 1999 , I learned that my security clearance had been upgraded to interim top secret , and I enrolled in the correspondence portion of the U.S. Army 's Reserve Component Military Intelligence Officer Advanced Course ( MIOAC ) .
Because the residency phase of this course ( at Ft. Huachuca ) requires a top secret clearance and must be completed in a timely manner following the correspondence phase , I had delayed starting the advanced course .
Meanwhile , I had begun to speak publicly on polygraph matters .
I took to heart the words of General George Washington , who wrote that " when we assumed the soldier , we did not lay aside the citizen . "
Through the website NoPolygraph.com , I had discovered that many others have been ( and continue to be ) being falsely branded as liars by the polygraph .
I felt compelled to publicly share my polygraph experience , and in July 1999 I wrote an initial version of this statement under the pseudonym " Captain Jones " for posting on NoPolygraph.com .
I also began researching polygraphy in earnest , and in December 1999 , wrote an article titled , " The Lying Game : National Security and the Test for Espionage and Sabotage " that was first published on the website of the Federation of American Scientists and is now available on AntiPolygraph.org .
On 18 September 2000 , Gino Scalabrini and I co-founded AntiPolygraph.org and published The Lie Behind the Lie Detector , a free e-book with chapters on polygraph validity , policy , procedure , and countermeasures .
We included information on countermeasures not to help liars beat the system , but to provide the truthful with a means of protecting themselves against the random error associated with an invalid test .
Some three months later , on 13 December 2000 , the Army 's Central Clearance Facility moved to revoke my security clearance .
Through a Privacy
Act request , I learned that Paul J. Travers , the CCF adjudicator who made the decision to revoke my security clearance , had written in a memorandum dated 11 November 2000 , " ... subject failed his FBI applicant polygraph regarding the issues of foreign contacts , unauthorized disclosure of classified information and drug use . "
He went on to speculate , " Could subject be the operative in an international spy ring or a courier for a drug cartel ? "
Travers was uncertain whether to revoke or grant my clearance , noting , " This is one of those cases that due to the fact subject is in the inactive reserves , we have information gaps . "
But rather than filling such supposed " information gaps " with facts by conducting further investigation to determine whether I was a spy or narcotrafficer , Travers instead suggested ... another polygraph !
Indeed , a handwritten marginal note on Travers ' typed memo confirms , " Check w / Linda ; go w/ polygraph . "
CCF then contacted the 902nd Military Intelligence Group 's polygraph section .
On 22 November 2000 , a polygrapher from the 902nd MI Group who used the code number 612 in lieu of his / her real name ( spooky , huh ? ) wrote in a memorandum of conversation :
Met with POC to determine whether a CI - polygraph could be administered to Subject .
Per POC , Subject is a very vocal anti-poly person , including having a web site , using the name Captain Jones .
He also regularly uses Chat Rooms to express his views and tells all how to defeat a poly .
While the CI issues are pertinent for a poly , POC is uncertain whether his boss would want to try and poly subject .
Will call later with the web site and the answer on poly .
With 616 , found one web site .
Do not know if it is the only one .
Printed same .
A printout of the original version of this statement ( then written under the pseudonym " Captain Jones " ) was attached to this memo .
I had wittingly included enough specific detail that I could be identified as the author if anyone in government really wanted to find out .
Apparently someone in the 902nd MI Group polygraph section did and had .
Five days later , on 27 November 2000 , polygraph operator 612 of the 902nd MI Poly Section wrote a follow - up memo stating :
Per POC 's boss , they will not do the poly on subject .
It is too hot of a potato and they feel a no - win scenario because of the potential to find it on the Internet and subject 's vehement attitude towards polys .
Discuss with 600 on 28 Nov 00 .
While the 902nd MI 's polygraph section opined that " the issues are pertinent for a poly " but that polygraphing me would be " too hot of a potato , " the Defense Security Service 's polygraph division ( S32 ) had a completely opposite view .
In a memorandum to " Janet " dated 30 October 2000 , acting chief Brock W. Butterfield had written :
Per your request , I have reviewed this case to determine if sufficient information was developed upon which to construct a polygraph examination .
It does not appear that specific allegations have been provided by the other government agency ( OGA ) [ that is , the FBI ] upon which to recommend the conduct of a DSS polygraph examination .
Subject 's failure of the OGA polygraph examination was in the area of pre-employment screening .
DSS conducts specific issue polygraph examinations to resolve adjudicatively significant issues that have been corroborated .
That does not appear to be the case with this Subject .
Based on what has been presented , it seems unlikely that we will receive any specific allegations .
Thus , a DSS polygraph examination appears inappropriate .
With DSS thinking a polygraph inappropriate and the 902nd MI Group thinking it was indeed appropriate , but that I was " too hot of a potato , " Paul Travers of CCF , who had been prepared to decide whether to grant or revoke my security clearance based on the outcome a polygraph test , finally decided to revoke it .
Unable to complete the Military Intelligence Officer Advanced Course , the residency phase of which requires a top secret clearance , I was ineligible for promotion from captain to major .
After I had been twice passed over for promotion , the U.S. Army Reserve notified me that I would be mandatorily ( but honorably ) discharged as of 1 February 2004 .
The FBI 's false accusation against me has cost me a career in the FBI , my position as a volunteer Technical Reservist in the Los Angeles Police Department , and ultimately cut short my career as a U.S. Army Reserve officer .
Had I not chosen to exercise my First Amendment right to speak publicly on polygraph matters , I might today be serving with U.S. forces in the war on terror : the 902nd MI Group 's polygraphers would not have judged me to be " too hot of a potato , " and I might well have passed their polygraph and kept my security clearance .
But I have few regrets about having spoken out .
In April 2001 , I had the honor of speaking before the National Academy of Sciences ' Committee to Review the Scientific Evidence on the Polygraph , and I find it gratifying that their final report , The Polygraph and Lie Detection , confirms AntiPolygraph.org 's argument that polygraph screening has no scientific basis and that a misplaced reliance on it poses a danger to national security objectives .
( It is deplorable that the U.S. Government has willfully ignored the conclusions of this report . )
I 've also spoken with numerous reporters , including Scott Pelley of CBS 60 Minutes II , who interviewed me and others for the story " Final Exam . "
In addition , my involvement in the antipolygraph effort has introduced me to some of the most conscientious people I know , people whom I am honored to count as friends .
I like to think that by working to expose polygraph " testing " for the pseudoscientific quackery that it is , I am perhaps making as significant a contribution to my country as I might have made had I been allowed to continue in government service .
I am not a spy .
I have not betrayed the trust that my government placed in me .
But I feel that my government has betrayed my trust -- and that of every citizen whose honesty and integrity it pretends to assess through the junk science of polygraph screening .

A controversial research project is trying to trace all human language to a common root .
Around 50,000 years ago , something happened to our ancestors in Africa .
Anatomically modern humans , who had existed for at least 150,000 years prior , suddenly began behaving differently .
Until then , their conduct scarcely differed from that of their hominid cousins , the Neanderthals .
Both buried their dead ; both used stone tools ; and as social apes , both had some form of communication , which some think was gestural .
But then , " almost overnight , everything changes very rapidly , " says Merritt Ruhlen , a lecturer in the Anthropological Sciences Department at Stanford University in Palo Alto , Calif .
Humans began making much better stone tools .
They started burying their dead with accouterments that suggested religion .
And perhaps most telling , Homo sapiens , the " wise " apes , began creating art .
" People started having imagination at this time much more than they had earlier , " says Dr. Ruhlen .
Many scientists think that fully modern human language enabled this " great leap forward . "
Language enabled abstract thought , the deciding factor in archaic humans becoming – well , us .
And because scientists surmise that language arose only once , they believe that before leaving Africa to colonize the world , all humankind spoke one language .
Linguists have dubbed it " proto - world " or " proto - sapiens . "
A multidisciplinary team of scientists at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico is working toward reconstructing that mother of all languages .
Headed by Nobel Laureate physicist Murray Gell - Mann , the international Evolution of Human Languages ( EHL ) project is developing a freely accessible etymological database of the world 's languages .
Where possible , EHL linguists are attempting to reconstruct – and then compare – ancestor languages , moving ever closer to the first human language .
Viewed by many linguists as a fringe movement , the project has attracted much criticism .
Many linguists say that historical languages cannot be studied beyond an 8,000 - year threshold ; they change too much , they say .
Some take issue with the project 's methods :
A few words shared among reconstructed languages does n't prove a familial relationship , they insist , especially far back in time .
Languages change constantly .
Speakers invent or borrow words to suit their needs .
But for reasons not completely understood , some languages change more than others .
Italian , for example , has remained much closer to ancestral Latin than French .
Lithuanian has many words that almost exactly match Sanskrit , which was spoken 3,500 years ago .
And some language " families " like Afroasiatic retain words in common even after more than 10,000 years of divergent evolution .
" That time limit is totally wrong , " says John Bengtson , vice president of the Association for the Study of Language in Prehistory in Cambridge , Mass .
" Languages that have been separated 8,000 years get down to a low percentage of common words .
However , that low percentage seems to be very stable . "
And there begins EHL 's approach .
Within languages , linguists think that because certain words – including the pronoun " we " and the number " one " – form the basis of a functional language , they are much less likely to change or be lost .
EHL linguists begin by comparing this " basic lexicon . "
They include " words that are thoroughly essential and must have been in human language before significant cultural advances were made , " writes EHL team member George Starostin , a linguist at the Russian State University for the Humanities in Moscow , in an e-mail .
Using this method , EHL has grouped all the world 's languages into 12 linguistic superfamilies .
They 've tentatively grouped four of these superfamilies , which include languages of Eurasia , North Africa , and some Pacific islands ( and maybe languages of the Americas as well ) into one super - superfamily dubbed " Borean . "
An ancestor to a large share of today 's languages , Borean was spoken some 16,000 years ago when glaciers covered much of Europe and North America , they say .
EHL linguists use several methods .
One – the most controversial , but not the most widely used , says Starostin – involves matching words and meanings across languages .
For example , Ruhlen and Bengtson have noticed that a word roughly corresponding to " water , " which they render in proto - sapiens as " AQWA , " appears in many languages .
In Latin it 's " aqua " ; in Japanese , " aka " means " bilge water " ; in Chechen , meanwhile , " aq " means " to suck " ; in an African Kung dialect , " kau " means " to rain " ; and in Central American Yucatec , " uk " means " to be thirsty . "
But critics look at etymologies like these and see only problems .
They 're too loose with meanings and sounds , they say .
And too many alternate explanations exist : Maybe the word was borrowed from one language and spread to the others .
Perhaps it 's onomatopoetic , a word that sounds like what it is .
( " Cock - a - doodle - doo " is an onomatopoetic word that appears in similar form in many languages , but that does n't prove relation . )
Finally , the shorter the word – in some of the languages , just one syllable rather than two or three – the greater the possibility of a chance match .
" You 've presented this list of words , but it looks like you can explain these lists in several different ways , " says Lyle Campbell , a professor of linguistics at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City .
" Their data is really easy to challenge , and it 's really easy to find words that are similar to one another across languages . "
EHL linguists argue that they 're only doing exactly what Sir William Jones , who first postulated a common ancestor for classical Greek , Latin , and Sanskrit , did in the 18th century .
( Indo - European , the eventual result of Jones 's initial observations , is perhaps the most widely accepted language family . )
Historical linguistics begins by observing similarities that occur more frequently than dictated by chance , they say – and they 're just starting .
The comparison to Jones also underscores another argument central to EHL 's endeavor .
The further one moves back in time , the more related languages should resemble one another , they believe .
" It is more risky because you 're comparing two or more hypotheticals to arrive at an even more hypothetical construction , " says Mr. Bengtson , " but we think it 's still a valid thing to try to do . "
Human genetic evidence appears to support EHL 's basic assumptions .
The human genome indicates that all humanity traces its ancestry to as few as 1,000 individuals who lived between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago .
This small founding population may explain how the capacity for language spread so quickly .
" Bottlenecks play a very important part in human evolution , " says Ruhlen .
" This was the first major bottleneck . "
Genetics also suggests two separate migrations out of Africa .
One followed the south coast of Asia , ending up in Australia at least 45,000 years ago .
The other took the land route through the Middle East into Central Asia , where they went both west into Europe and east , eventually reaching the Americas .
Very tentatively , EHL has grouped the world 's languages into three super - superfamilies corresponding to these migrations : those that correspond with the coastal route , which include Papuan languages ; those that correspond with the land route out of Africa , descendants of Borean , the best reconstructed ; and the " click " languages spoken by the San , or " Bushmen , " of southern Africa .
Scientists think that the San most resemble the first modern humans .
Their language , almost unique in its use of click sounds that perhaps other early languages lost , may best conserve traces of proto - sapiens .
Recently , EHL further refined its hypothesis .
How could the 16,000 - year - old Borean have engendered the lion 's share of Eurasian , North African , and American languages ?
Some 20,000 years ago , at the peak of the last ice age , the world lost much of its linguistic diversity , they argue .
Advancing glaciers pushed humanity south , mashing linguistic groups together .
As in later periods of human history – like now – only a few languages emerged from that mixing .
Borean , they say , was one of them .

LLVM 2.0 and Beyond !
The LLVM 2.0 release brings a number of new features and capabilities to the LLVM toolset .
This talk briefly describes those features , then moves on to talk about what is next : llvm 2.1 , llvm - gcc 4.2 , and puts a special emphasis on the ' clang ' C front - end .
This describes how the ' clang ' preprocessor can be used to improve the scalability of distcc by up to 4.4x .
Let 's cut through the crap .
The real reason why the GOP distanced itself so rapidly from Sen.
Larry Craig is because they'd be uncomfortable while taking a leak next to him at the urinal .
It really is hypocritical , because the Republicans , for nearly three decades now , have been out to screw every man , woman and child in America who does n't have a seven - figure bank account .
Republicans hate gay people .
In fact , the only thing they hate more than gay people are gay Republicans who are elected , then get busted by a vice cop for some sort of lewd conduct .
They do n't believe that a gay couple can remain monogamous , they perpetuate the negative stereotype of the gay lifestyle and they make no bones about their belief that every gay individual is condemned to hell .
Meanwhile , they create a hell on earth , where gay partners cannot share health benefits , are not allowed to solemnize their commitment to each other or serve their country , if they so desire , unless they remain closeted .
" Look at Clinton ! Look at Clinton ! " they 'll screech .
Yeah , look at Bill Clinton .
He got a blow job from a pudgy intern in the White House , denied it and paid the price .
So fucking what !
The woman was of age , many bosses pull their secretaries or interns in for a quickie and his lie ?
Of course he lied .
All married men who cheat lie when confronted .
The important thing , of course , is that Clinton never held himself up as the epitome of sexual morality .
He was and may well still be a hound , looking to bed any woman he can .
That 's his and Hillary 's business and , at least he is n't chasing anonymous sex in a public bathroom .
I do n't care if Craig copulates with men or women .
I do n't care if he 's into auto - eroticism .
I do n't care if he 's celibate .
I do care , however , about the hypocrisy of a man who apparently has so much self - hatred that he cannot come to grips with who he really is .
Especially when he makes a very strange claim that he " is not gay and never has been gay . "
Huh ?
I did n't know you could switch teams .
What 's most distressing are the comments of those who want to kill the messenger in this case Ëœ the media .
Was it fair for the Idaho Statesman to investigate this guy ?
Damn straight .
It is our responsibility in the media to defrock frauds and charlatans , so if you 're marching under the banner of wholesomeness and family virtue , you 'd damn well better hold up your end of the bargain , otherwise , you 're going to get exposed one way of another .
I mean , do n't wave the red cape and expect the bull not to charge after your ass .
This self - inflicted exposure , if you will , is going to cost Craig his seat in the Senate , cost him his juicy position as an adviser to Mitt Romney and jeopardize his seat on the board of the National Rifle Association , which , I guess does n't want to hear the jokes that are sure to come about a board member who can't shoot straight .
Serves him right .

My friend , David Brooks , does his best to reinforce the Hillary - Is - Inevitable consensus in Washington right now .
He may regret this , though :
On " This Week With George Stephanopoulos , " Clinton could have vowed to vacate Iraq .
Instead , she delivered hawkish mini-speeches that few Republicans would object to .
She listed a series of threats and interests in the region and made it clear that she ’d be willing to keep U.S. troops there to handle them .
Then we hear this from a right - wing reporter with access to Bush :
[ Josh ] Bolten said Bush wants enough continuity in his Iraq policy that " even a Democratic president would be in a position to sustain a legitimate presence there . "
" Especially if it's a Democrat , " the chief of staff told The Examiner in his West Wing office .
" He wants to create the conditions where a Democrat not only will have the leeway , but the obligation to see it out . "
If Clinton is that comfortable with a permanent occupation of Iraq at this point in the election cycle , how comfortable do you think she 's going to be next year ?
You think a politician so obsessed with gaining and wielding power is happy to relinquish any in the Middle East ?
Patrick Ruffini draws the obvious conclusion :
Hillary is morphing into a George W. Bush Democrat .
While that will draw heat from an increasingly desperate Obama , she will pay the price in the general election , not because she ’s totally wrong , but because Democrat - inclined voters will smell something fishy about their gal acting like the one they ’ve so long fantasized of kicking to the curb .
And if she wins , the BushClintonBushClinton consensus will be back .
The conservative Washington Establishment is swooning for Hillary for a reason .
The reason is an accommodation with what they see as the next source of power ( surprise ! ) ; and the desire to see George W. Bush 's invasion and occupation of Iraq legitimated and extended by a Democratic president ( genuine surprise ) .
Hillary is Bush 's ticket to posterity .
On Iraq , she will be his legacy .
They are not that dissimilar after all : both come from royal families , who have divvied up the White House for the past couple of decades .
They may oppose one another ; but they respect each other as equals in the neo-monarchy that is the current presidency .
And so elite conservatives are falling over themselves to embrace a new Queen Hillary , with an empire reaching across Mesopotamia , a recently deposed court just waiting to return to the salons of DC , a consort happy to be co-president for another four years , and a back - channel to the other royal family .
She 'll even have more powers than Clinton I , because Cheney has given her back various royal prerogatives : arrests without charges , torture , wire - tapping , and spy -ware on your Expedia account .
Only the coronation awaits .
Vivat !
Vivat !
Vivat Regina !
Unless , of course , the coronation is happening just a little too soon .

Visible and ultraviolet laser light has been used for years to cool trapped atoms -- and more recently larger objects -- by reducing the extent of their thermal motion .
Now , applying a different form of radiation for a similar purpose , physicists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) have used radio waves to dampen the motion of a miniature mechanical oscillator containing more than a quadrillion atoms , a cooling technique that may open a new window into the quantum world using smaller and simpler equipment .
Described in a forthcoming issue of Physical Review Letters , * this demonstration of radio - frequency ( RF ) cooling of a relatively large object may offer a new tool for exploring the elusive boundary where the familiar rules of the everyday , macroscale world give way to the bizarre quantum behavior seen in the smallest particles of matter and light .
There may be technology applications as well : the RF circuit could be made small enough to be incorporated on a chip with tiny oscillators , a focus of intensive research for use in sensors to detect , for example , molecular forces .
The NIST experiments used an RF circuit to cool a 200 x 14 x 1,500 micrometer silicon cantilever -- a tiny diving board affixed at one end to a chip and similar to the tuning forks used in quartz crystal watches -- vibrating at 7,000 cycles per second , its natural " resonant " frequency .
Scientists cooled it from room temperature ( about 23 degrees C , or 73 degrees F ) to - 228 C ( - 379 F ) .
Other research groups have used optical techniques to chill micro-cantilevers to lower temperatures , but the RF technique may be more practical in some cases , because the equipment is smaller and easier to fabricate and integrate into cryogenic systems .
By extending the RF method to higher frequencies at cryogenic temperatures , scientists hope eventually to cool a cantilever to its " ground state " near absolute zero ( - 273 C or - 460 F ) , where it would be essentially motionless and quantum behavior should emerge .
Laser cooling is akin to using the kinetic energy of millions of ping - pong balls ( particles of light ) striking a rolling bowling ball ( such as an atom ) to slow it down .
The RF cooling technique , lead author Kenton Brown says , is more like pushing a child on a swing slightly out of synch with its back - and - forth motion to reduce its arc .
In the NIST experiments , the cantilever 's mechanical motion is reduced by the force created between two electrically charged plates , one of which is the cantilever , which store energy like electrical capacitors .
In the absence of any movement , the force would be stable , but in this case , it is modulated by the cantilever vibrations .
The stored energy takes some time to change in response to the cantilever 's movement , and this delay pushes the cantilever slightly out of synch , damping its motion .

Do you really want your own electric car ?
I know I would love one , but it seems the large car companies are a little slow on delivering this sort of car , so lets just build our own .
Designed and built by high school students with the help of Art Haines the mastermind of this project .
The best part of this video is when he mentions that the students did n’t like the look of the car , so they made it look more like the Hummer , which gave him the added space to put on a front solar panel .

TOKYO – " This May 13 , buy your mom a Nintendo DS . "
With Mother 's Day fast approaching , Tokyo's subways and billboards are plastered with advertisements for chocolate and flowers .
But one of the most visible ads , running every few minutes on the TV monitors inside subway cars , suggests that you give your mom Nintendo 's portable videogame system and load it with software like Nintendogs , Brain Age or an interactive cookbook called 1000 Recipes .
It 's likely that more than a few consumers will take Nintendo up on the offer .
Since it launched in 2004 , the touch - screen Nintendo DS has sold well over 16 million units in Japan , outpacing every other game console on the market .
On the strength of games like puppy - raising simulators and brain - training ware , many of these sales have been to women .
Initially taken off guard , Japan 's game makers are now in the grip of girl fever – scrambling to market directly to women gamers who were once ignored .
" I 'd go to school and play the old gray Game Boy on the train , and people would stare , " says Eleanor Harada , a 31 - year - old computer programmer at a financial firm .
" It was n't normal .
Whereas now , if you 're a female and you 're on the train , you can take out a DS .
I think it helps that it looks more stylish than it used to . "
Style is a big piece of the marketing surge .
At Tsutaya , one of Japan 's largest media retail chains , signs reading " Girls ' Style " hang in the DS section , explaining to potential buyers what games are most popular with women .
In great part , they are the same titles popular with men : New Super Mario Bros. , Final Fantasy III , English Training .
Nintendo has been reticent about the exact numbers , but in late 2005 Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said about a third of Brain Age buyers in Japan were women .
But in growing numbers , titles are being crafted specifically with women in mind .
Following the surprise cross -gender success of Nintendogs , several of these are pet simulators .
Magazines like Sutekina Okusan ( Fantastic Wife ) , aimed at middle - aged housewives , advertise Nintendo DS games like Hamusutā to Kurasou , which translates to , " Let 's Spend Time With Hamsters . "
Self - improvement games comprise another genre aimed at the female audience – titles like My Happy Manner Book , an interactive Miss Manners - style guide to social situations .
Nintendo has had great success with a pair of interactive cookbooks : Cooking Navi has sold more than 800,000 copies , and 1000 Recipes more than 300,000 .
A game from Sega for young girls called Love and Berry has sold 1 million - plus copies .
Even when game designers are n't making games specifically for women , they 've learned the importance of keeping that rapidly emerging market in mind , says Keiichi Yano , designer of the Nintendo DS game Elite Beat Agents .
" When we come up with new project ideas , we take into consideration what the female gamer community is interested in and what DS games are selling for female users , " Yano says .
In Japan , anything that in sells women 's magazines – " learning , manners , food " – can also move games off the shelves , says Keiichi .
One indication that women are buying DS in droves is the cottage industry that has sprung up almost overnight for stylish protective DS pouches .
Of course , DS owners both male and female need slipcases to protect the system , which costs about $ 160 in Japan .
But the abundance of styles and colors are clearly aimed at women .
Some are like miniature purses , bedecked with colorful plastic jewels .
There are drawstring pouches in gold lamé , and elegant covers made of traditional kimono cloth .
These can run upwards of $ 30 or $ 40 each .
Sony , Nintendo's biggest competitor in Japan , is by and large missing out on the women - gamers boom .
Harada says the only people she 's ever seen on the train playing PSP have been men .
The PlayStation products still have the image here of being for hardcore gamers , while the DS – with its simple input methods and unique software – is seen as more accessible to beginning players .
" My friend who sits next to me ( at work ) was saying she might buy a DS for Common Sense Training , " Harada says .
" When I asked her why , she said it 's because it does n't seem difficult . "
Comment on this story .
The attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , yesterday announced that the Serious Fraud Office had halted its probe into allegations that a slush fund was used by BAE to pay Saudi dignitaries to secure multi-billion - pound deals .
Speaking in Brussels today , Mr Blair said that he took " full responsibility " for advising Lord Goldsmith that it was not in Britain 's national interests for the inquiry to continue .
The prime minister - who also insisted he was unworried by yesterday 's police interview about their cash - for - honours inquiry - said a continued investigation would have produced months or years of " ill feeling " between Britain and a key ally in the Middle East , probably to no purpose .
The decision prompted accusations of naked political interference in a criminal case in a bid to protect BAE Systems ' commercial interests .
The company 's share value soared by nearly £ 900 m after the announcement was made .
Lord Goldsmith 's statement in the House of Lords was unusual in that it did not refer to the claimed threats to British jobs , but instead concentrated on " national security " .
The attorney general told the House of Lords that he had consulted the prime minister , the defence secretary , the foreign secretary and the intelligence services , and they had decided that " the wider public interest ... outweighed the need to maintain the rule of law " .
The statement did not elaborate on the nature of the threat .
Challenge
The attorney general faces the prospect of a legal challenge after two pressure groups jointly instructed solicitors to explore the possibility of taking legal action against the decision .
The Campaign Against Arms Trade ( CAAT ) and the Corner House , a campaign group supporting environmental and social justice causes , will meet with solicitors on Monday .
Nicholas Gilby , a spokesman for CAAT , said : " The government 's commitment to fighting fraud means nothing if BAE Systems is placed above the law .
Democracy must not give way to bullying by arms companies .
" As with other criminal investigations , the Serious Fraud Office inquiry should be allowed to run its course . "
The two organisations were part of a coalition that wrote to the government earlier this month to call for the SFO inquiry to continue .
In their joint letter , CAAT , the Corner House , British American Security Information Council and Saferworld described as " pure fantasy " claims that the cancellation of the Eurofighter deal with Saudi Arabia would threaten 50,000 British jobs .
Aswini Weereratne , a barrister with Doughty Street Chambers , a leading human - rights chambers , said that judicial review was legally feasible but tricky .
" It is possible to judicially review the decision of the prosecuting authority not to prosecute , " she said .
" The courts do not like interfering with decisions relating to national security but there are signs that they are becoming more willing to challenge the government on national security , as with the issue of control orders . "
Additionally , anyone challenging the decision has to show that they have sufficient direct interest in case , or " standing " .
" To have sufficient interest to apply for judicial review a body would probably need to show that they had either been adversely affected by the decision or that they are raising an issue of public interest warranting judicial review and that they are the appropriate body to pursue such an application , " Ms Weereratne said .
" On that basis it is arguable that even a national newspaper might have sufficient interest ; alternatively an appropriate pressure group might do so . "
Jobs
At BAE Systems , staff were celebrating the decision to drop the inquiry .
The Saudis had threatened to pull out of a new deal to supply Eurofighter jets unless the investigation was abandoned , threatening thousands of jobs .
Shares in BAE fell by as much as 10 % in the last month as investors feared the worst for the Eurofighter deal , but the company value today soared from £ 12.79bn to £ 13.65bn .
Norman Lamb MP , the chief of staff to the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell , described dropping the inquiry as an " outrageous and disgraceful " decision .
" Coming straight after a threat from the Saudis to withdraw from future business , this completely undermines the UK 's reputation on good governance , " he said .
" How on earth can we lecture the developing world on good governance when we interfere with and block a criminal investigation in this way ? "
He added : " I think pressure has been applied .
I think it 's because the inquiry has been making substantial progress that it 's been brought to an end . "
The Lib Dems ' constitutional affairs spokesman , Lord Goodhart , said that it was clear that ministers had forced the decision upon the SFO 's director , Robert Wardle .
" We were told yesterday that there had been discussion the day before with the SFO .
The director of the SFO was given the night to think about it and came back yesterday morning and agreed , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
" So it 's clear that it was not the SFO 's own decision .
It was not instigated by the SFO .
This came from the top . "
But Lyndsay Hoyle , a Labour MP with many constituents who work for BAE in Lancashire , said that they were celebrating " an early Christmas present " .
" Quite rightly they were happy with the news , " he said , adding that it was a boost to a wide range of companies including Rolls - Royce , which builds engines .
" Tens of thousands of jobs were put at risk by a 1980s issue . "
He said that the investigation had been going on for too long and there was no evidence of any wrongdoing .
" Jobs would have gone , " he added .
Saudi lobbying
BAE and the Saudi embassy had frantically lobbied the government in recent weeks for the long - running investigation to be discontinued , with the company insisting it was poised to lose out on a third phase of the Al - Yamamah deal , in which the Saudis would buy 72 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft in a deal worth £ 6bn .
The Saudis had also hinted that they would do a deal with the French instead if the inquiry pushed ahead .
A 10 - day ultimatum was reportedly issued by the Saudis earlier this month .
This came at a time when the SFO appeared to have made a significant breakthrough , with investigators on the brink of accessing key Swiss bank accounts .
A PR campaign headed by Lord Bell saw MPs from all parties urging the dropping of the investigation , citing fears that jobs would be lost in their constituencies .
But in its statements last night the government said that commercial considerations had played no part in the decision .
Mr Wardle issued a terse statement saying that he had dropped the Saudi end of the investigation " following representations that have been made both to the attorney general and the director of the SFO concerning the need to safeguard national and international security " .
The destruction of its inquiry will be a severe blow to the SFO which has spent more than £ 2 m on what was its most extensive current investigation , and taken hundreds of pages of statements from witnesses .
David Lee , who was assistant director of the SFO from 1989 to 1991 , voiced his concern about the way the inquiry had been dropped .
" It seems to me a very unusual thing to happen .
I have certainly never seen it before , " he told Today .
" The timing is rather unfortunate next to the lobbying that has been going on .
We could all do with more detail on the reasons .
" Additionally we have some concerns ...
Is the right message being sent about the attitude to the potential for corruption and in particular what kind of precedent might be being set for other cases which are being investigated ?
" Indeed , are we actually seeing interference by political or diplomatic factions in the judicial and investigatory process ? "
BAE , in a statement , said it welcomed the dropping of the inquiry .
But the company and its executives may not yet be out of the woods .
The attorney general has allowed investigations to continue into BAE activities in Romania , Chile , the Czech Republic , South Africa and Tanzania , which legal sources say are making strong progress .
The UK made overseas bribery illegal in 2002 , under US pressure .
Labour ministers subsequently claimed they were determined to stamp out corruption , but in practice no prosecutions have taken place under the new law .

List : zfs - discuss Subject : [ zfs - discuss ] Mac OS X.5 " Leopard " : zfs works ; sudo kextload From : " G.W. " < gwb () 2 Realms ! com > Date : 2007-06-14 0:15:50 Message -ID : 7483685.1181805512306.JavaMail.Twebapp ( ) oss - app1 [ Download RAW message or body ]
I know it 's a pain , but you have to spend money to download Apple 's betas , that is , \ pay their developer fee .
If , however , this might inspire you to do this , you should \ know that zfs will run ( read and write ) on the latest build of Leopard , as Apple has \ ( somewhat cryptically ) said .
Apple also has a " non-disclosure " clause on their \ developer memberships , but they appear to have already made a number of public \ statements about zfs in Leopard .
So , here 's a generic ( and clumsy ) way to enable \ kernel extensions on a BSD system , of which Leopard is a variant ( actually , it runs \ over a version of Darwin ) .
And zfs is a kernel extension , and can be loaded like any \ other .
The zpool and zfs commands below you already know if you follow this thread .
Try this in terminal : % cd / System / Library / Extensions % ls - alF | less #
This will show you all the kernel extensions , *. kext , in a pager [ hit the space bar to page forward ; on the last page you should see : ... drwxr - xr-x 3 root wheel 102 ... ntfs.kext / drwxr-xr-x 3 root wheel 102 ... smbfs.kext / drwxr-xr-x 3 root wheel 102 ... udf.kext / drwxr-xr-x 3 root wheel 102 ... webdav_fs.kext / drwxr-xr-x 3 root wheel 102 ... zfs.kext / ( END ) # hit " q " ; this gets you back to the terminal ...
If you see zfs.kext , then the installer did indeed put it on your system .
Then : % sudo kextload zfs.kext password : # enter your admin password ; if that does n't work , become root \ with su You will get some error messages about the cache , probably from the files \ Extensions .
kextcache and Extensions.mkext .
But , zfs will load ( at least it will on a \ G5 dual 2.7 ) .
zfs , zpool , now work , and man zfs , man zpool will give you a man page .
As far as I can tell , this is the process to load a kernel extension on any BSD \ system , of which Mac OS X / Darwin is one ( the others are FreeBSD , NetBSD , OpenBSD ) .
HOWEVER , be aware that finder in almost any version of OSX tries to automount every \ possible file system .
Leopard does this as well ; unlike zfs and zpool under Solaris , \ Leopard automounts any pool created or imported with zpool , and sets the mountpoint \ under / Volumes , WITHOUT running zfs create , or set mountpoint : % zpool create zpool01 disk1 Automatically mounts in the finder and has the directory : / Volumes / zpool01 Again , this happens WITHOUT RUNNING zfs , which is quite different from Solaris .
You will have to fiddle with permissions , and you might have to do something like : sudo chmod - R / Volumes / zpool01 a+rwx to make the entire pool writable ( or some variant , g+rwx , etc. ) .
But it will work .
I have n't tried using zfs quota , set mountpoint= , set share= , but set compression=on \ seems to work , but I do n't see much compression going on .
On reboot ( or after a crash , which is frequent on beta builds ) the finder will , \ initially , not have the zfs kernel extension enabled , and will ask if you want to \ format the disk ( or slice , or however you set it up ) .
Click " ignore " ; DO NOT FORMAT \ THE DISK .
zfs already has , but the finder does n't know it yet .
Repeat the kernel extension commands above .
Then run : zpool import -f poolname
You can also try zpool scrub , but I 'm not sure if that helps .
You should have all the files you copied on the zfs system before the crash ( but no \ promises ; mine were , but maybe yours will not ) .
You can try " safe boot " with Leopard ( hold down the shift key on boot ) , and that \ might disable some problematic kernel extensions .
If someone knows how to modify Extensions .
kextcache and Extensions . mkext , please let \ me know .
After the bugs are worked out , Leopard should be a pretty good platform .
Hope this helps .
G.W .

THE FACTS
They are a staple in kitchens everywhere , but for about as long as microwave ovens have been around , people have suspected that the radiation they emit can destroy nutrients in food and vegetables .
According to most studies , however , the reality is quite the opposite .
Every cooking method can destroy vitamins and other nutrients in food .
The factors that determine the extent are how long the food is cooked , how much liquid is used and the cooking temperature .
Image Credit ... Leif Parsons
Since microwave ovens often use less heat than conventional methods and involve shorter cooking times , they generally have the least destructive effects .
The most heat - sensitive nutrients are water - soluble vitamins , like folic acid and vitamins B and C , which are common in vegetables .
If there were an Olympic medal for irony , this might have been a contender :
An international press freedom organization held a demonstration Monday to complain that China has failed to live up to promises that it would give foreign journalists the unfettered ability to cover the news in the run-up to the 2008 Summer Games .
The result ?
Not long after the demonstration ended , police roughed up and briefly detained the journalists covering the event .
The almost perfect incongruity of Monday ’s face - off reflects a discordant side of the Olympics that is sure to grow as the Games draw closer .

To China , the Olympics represent a golden opportunity to showcase the world ’s most populous nation and demonstrate how far it has come .
To international human rights organizations , it is an opportunity to show how far it still has to go .
With this week marking one year before the start of the Games , several organizations issued reports or held events sharply criticizing China ’s record on human rights and journalistic freedom , and calling on the International Olympic Committee to demand change .
“ Wednesday is one year before the Olympics , and we have a very strong feeling that the government is not making any positive moves in terms of press freedom , ” said Vincent Brossel of Reporters Without Borders , the Paris - based group that sponsored the demonstration Monday .
Brossel complained that the government continues to hinder foreign correspondents , jail Chinese journalists , block Internet sites and exhibit what he called a “ lack of respect for freedom of expression in China . ”
Amnesty International and the New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists echoed the complaint .

The country ’s domestic news media remain under tight state control , with virtually nothing published or broadcast that does not further the aims of the Communist Party .
Those who cross the line , typically on independent websites these days , face severe consequences .
Among the most famous recent examples is Shi Tao , a poet and journalist serving a 10 - year sentence for “ leaking state secrets ” -- the crime he was charged with in 2004 for writing an e-mail about media restrictions before the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre .
Foreign reporters do not generally face the same risks and have more freedom to report what they see .
But they do face harassment and threats , and until this year needed official approval to travel outside Western - influenced cities such as Beijing or Shanghai .
Some areas , such as Tibet , remain virtually off - limits .
Not long after being awarded the Games six years ago , China vowed to improve its human rights record .
In December , it announced new rules for foreign journalists , lifting the severe restrictions under which they had operated and essentially saying that , from January of this year until just after the Olympics , they could go anywhere and interview anyone .

Conditions have improved , according to two reports issued in the last week by Human Rights Watch and the Foreign Correspondents Club of China .
But both reports concluded that the government has not lived up to its promise and that reporters continue to face harassment , detention and stonewalling , especially in rural areas of the country where officials are either unaware of the new rules or ignore them .
“ The Chinese government ’s attempts to intimidate and detain foreign journalists for simply doing their jobs shows contempt for Olympic ideas of fair play , ” Brad Adams , Asia director at Human Rights Watch , said in a statement accompanying a 40 - page report issued Monday .
“ The ongoing harassment and detention of journalists makes Beijing ’s Olympic pledge on media freedoms seem more like a public relations ploy than a sincere policy initiative . ”
Ninety - five percent of 163 reporters surveyed by the Foreign Correspondents Club said conditions for journalists in China still do not meet international standards , and the club has recorded 157 incidents this year in which foreign reporters were detained , beaten , followed , given official reprimands or had their sources intimidated .
It ’s understood among foreign correspondents here that any attempt to delve into sensitive topics , or to cover controversial events such as relocations or demonstrations , will be met with harassment .
Reporters have been shoved into police cars and taken to detention centers , subjected to hours of questioning , threatened with expulsion .

When a New York Times team went to Guangdong province recently to see the factory where Thomas the Tank Engine toys had been coated with toxic lead paint , factory officials held the reporter , photographer and Chinese assistant for more than nine hours while demanding that they hand over photographs taken inside the plant and “ confess ” to trespassing .
Eventually , the three were released after writing a statement saying the photos had been taken without authorization .
Foreign correspondents who write articles that particularly annoy the government are sometimes called in by the Foreign Ministry for a tongue - lashing , with the strong implication that their work visas may be revoked or not renewed .
When Geoffrey York , a reporter for Toronto ’s Globe and Mail , recently wrote about a Canadian religious leader sentenced to life imprisonment in China for terrorism , he was called in to face official complaints .
The meeting , he said later , “ was ritualistic , but it was a warning . ”

At a news conference Monday , Jiang Xiaoyu , a vice president of the Beijing organizing committee for the Olympic Games , insisted that the new reporting rules had been well received , a claim that Chinese newspapers also have made in the last week .
“ The Beijing organizing committee welcomes reporters from around the world to objectively , fairly and comprehensively report on the Olympic preparation work , ” Jiang said .
“ We welcome even more constructive criticism on faults and problems . ”
A few hours later , Reporters Without Borders held its news conference and demonstration across from the Olympics office tower .
Brossel said the group was not calling for a boycott of the Olympics , but would like to see progress toward granting journalistic freedom .
Reporters Without Borders argues that “ cyber - police ” have become more active in recent months , shutting down websites the government finds objectionable .
And the organization issued a chronology of what it considered free - speech violations since the beginning of July .
Among these : “ Cyber - dissident ” Zhu Yufu was sentenced to two years in prison ; a young Internet user was arrested and charged with “ disseminating false information ” about floods in northeastern China ; and several websites were closed , including one devoted to contemporary Chinese poetry .

The demonstration followed a torrential rain and hailstorm that left a foot or more of water in some streets .
Several members of Reporters Without Borders , removing their shoes to ford a flooded street , climbed onto a freeway overpass and unfurled a poster depicting the Olympics logo with handcuffs in place of rings .
The flooding apparently kept police from reaching the demonstration on time .
By the time they arrived , Brossel and his accomplices had slipped away .
Police did , however , confront about a dozen journalists who had been covering the event , roughing them up , seizing their identification cards and detaining them for about two hours .
Police and Olympics officials had no immediate comment on the incident .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Citing executive privilege , President George W. Bush on Wednesday rejected a subpoena for his close adviser Karl Rove to appear before to the Senate Judiciary Committee in a probe over fired federal prosecutors .

Bush ’s move sets up a possible court showdown between the White House and Democratic lawmakers , who have sought to force Rove and other Bush aides to testify about the firing last year of nine federal prosecutors .
Critics say they were fired for political reasons .
“ Mr. Rove , as an immediate presidential advisor , is immune from compelled congressional testimony about matters that arose during his tenure and that relate to his official duties in that capacity , ” White House Counsel Fred Fielding wrote in a letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat .
Leahy made the letter available to Reuters .
“ It is a shame that this White House continues to act as if it is above the law .
That is wrong , ” Leahy said in a statement .
“ The subpoenas authorized by this Committee in connection with its investigation into the mass firings of U.S. Attorneys and the corrosion of federal law enforcement by White House political influence deserve respect and compliance . ”
The committee had subpoenaed Rove to testify at a hearing on Thursday morning , along with another White House aide , deputy political director Scott Jennings .
Rove will not appear at the hearing , while Jennings will appear but not testify about the fired prosecutors , Fielding said .
Fielding also said the White House would not hand over documents requested by the committee .
Democrats say the firings may have been intended to influence investigations of Democratic or Republican lawmakers .
Bush and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , who signed off on the firings , have said that they were justified but mishandled .
Gonzales also faces calls for a perjury investigation over the truthfulness of his testimony to Congress about the firings and the National Security Agency ’s warrantless domestic - spying program .
With the support of Bush , Gonzales has rejected bipartisan calls to resign .
Gonzales said in a letter to Leahy he had been truthful with the committee last week when testifying about the surveillance program , which contains elements that remain classified .
“ I was discussing only that particular aspect of the NSA activities that the President has publicly acknowledged , ” Gonzales wrote .
“ I recognize that ... my shorthand reference to the ‘ program ’ publicly ‘ described by the President ’ may have created confusion . ”
At least one member of the committee was unsatisfied with the explanation .
“ The Attorney General has done far more than create confusion , he ’s placed his office in disrepute , ” New York Democratic Sen.
Charles Schumer said in a statement .
“ After reading the letter , we renew our call for a special prosecutor with vigor . ”
The phrase is also being emblazoned on T - shirts .
YouTube videos of the incident , which was sparked by Meyer 's relentless questioning of Senator Kerry during a talk he was giving at the University of Florida , have been viewed almost 3 million times .
Meyer , 21 , stepped up to the microphone to ask cheeky questions about impeaching US President George Bush and whether Senator Kerry and Mr Bush were both members of the Skull and Bones society at Yale .
Meyer 's voice became louder and more aggressive as he continued his diatribe and , when he refused to step away from the microphone , he was restrained by police officers .
After struggling with police and resisting their attempts to remove him from the room , Meyer was subdued with a Taser .
" Do n't Tase me , bro ! " was the 11th most searched for phrase on Google and opportunistic web users have already registered internet domain names using spelling variations of the phrase .
( On Yahoo , " Andrew Meyer " is the fasting moving search term and " John Kerry " is fourth fastest . ) .
Remixed versions of the original clip , as well as various video responses from viewers , are pouring into YouTube .
Some have dubbed Meyer a " political martyr " and accused police of using force to curtail free speech .
A Facebook group recruited protesters for a march against police brutality on the University of Florida campus .
Florida investigators have been asked to review the use of the Taser by the police officers , who have been temporarily suspended on full pay , but the cultural firestorm is now blowing against Meyer after it was revealed he had a history of taping his own practical jokes .
Many see him as a desperate attention - seeker who got what he deserved , a view reinforced by revelations he organised someone to film the session with Senator Kerry .
One police officer told the Associated Press that Meyer , before beginning his questions , asked : " Are you taping this ?
Do you have this ?
You ready ? "
Video clips posted on his website , theandrewmeyer.com , show Meyer performing various practical jokes including standing in the street with a sign reading " Harry Dies " , just after the launch of the last Harry Potter book .
Meyer , who has not been formally charged , spent Tuesday night in a cell and has yet to give a comment to media .
He was arrested on charges of resisting an officer and disturbing the peace .
Senator Kerry , who asked police to let him answer Meyer 's questions , has criticised the arrest , saying he could have handled the incident himself .
" In 37 years of public appearances , through wars , protests and highly emotional events , I have never had a dialogue end this way .
I believe I could have handled the situation without interruption , " he said .
Q How many members of your household , if any , have died as a result of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 ( ie as a result of violence rather than a natural death such as old age ) ?
Please note that I mean those who were actually living under your roof .
None 78 %
One death 16 %
Two deaths 5 %
Threedeaths 1 %
Four + deaths 0.002 %
Given that from the 2005 census there are a total of 4,050,597 households this data suggests a total of 1,220,580 deaths since the invasion in 2003 .
The ORB polling agency , frequently cited in the press , has produced new research suggesting that up to 1.2 m had died as a result of violence rather than old age in Iraq since 2003 as of last month .
The press release is reproduced here , and there 's a story about it here .
Based on face - to - face interviews , this would seem to corroborate some of the more pessimistic extrapolations from the last Lancet study .
This is the explanation :
The story is n't getting much coverage .
In most news items I can find about it , it 's relegate to a small side box item .
For instance , here and here .
Nothing about it in any UK news source yet as far as I know .

RFID expert Lukas Grunwald says e-passport readers are vulnerable to sabotage . *
Photo : Courtesy of Kim Zetter * A German security researcher who demonstrated last year that he could clone the computer chip in an electronic passport has revealed additional vulnerabilities in the design of the new documents and the inspection systems used to read them .
Lukas Grunwald , an RFID expert who has served as an e-passport consultant to the German parliament , says the security flaws allow someone to seize and clone the fingerprint image stored on the biometric e-passport , and to create a specially coded chip that attacks e-passport readers that attempt to scan it .
Grunwald says he 's succeeded in sabotaging two passport readers made by different vendors by cloning a passport chip , then modifying the JPEG2000 image file containing the passport photo .
Reading the modified image crashed the readers , which suggests they could be vulnerable to a code- injection exploit that might , for example , reprogram a reader to approve expired or forged passports .
" If you 're able to crash something you are most likely able to exploit it , " says Grunwald , who 's scheduled to discuss the vulnerabilities this weekend at the annual DefCon hacker conference in Las Vegas .
E - passports contain radio frequency ID , or RFID , chips that are supposed to help thwart document forgery and speed processing of travelers at U.S. entry points .
The United States led the charge for global e-passports because authorities said the chip , which is digitally signed by each issuing country , would help distinguish official documents from forged ones .
But Grunwald demonstrated last year at the BlackHat security conference how he could extract the data on a passport chip , which is read - only , and clone it to a read - write chip that appears the same to an e-passport reader .
Now Grunwald says he was able to add data to the cloned chip that would allow someone to attack the passport reader .
He conducted the attack by embedding a buffer - overrun exploit inside the JPEG2000 file on the cloned chip that contains the passport photo .
Grunwald says he tested his exploit on two passport readers that were on display at a security conference he attended .
Buffer - overrun vulnerabilities occur when coding errors in software allow an attacker to overflow a section of memory dedicated to storing a fixed amount of data .
Carefully exploited , they often permit the hacker to execute his own instructions on the vulnerable computer , essentially taking over the device – though Grunwald has not attempted that level of compromise on e-passport readers .
If a reader could be compromised using Grunwald 's technique , it might be reprogrammed to misreport an expired passport as a valid one , or even – theoretically – to attempt a compromise of the Windows - based border - screening computer to which it is connected .
He wo n't name the vendors that make the readers he crashed , but says the readers are currently in use at some airport entry points .
He says there 's no reason to believe that readers made by other vendors would be any more secure .
" I predict that most of the vendors are using off - the - shelf ( software ) libraries for decoding the JPEG2000 images ( on passports ) , " which means they would all be vulnerable to exploit in a similar manner .
A second vulnerability in the design of the passport chip would allow someone to access and clone a passport holder 's fingerprint .
The International Civil Aviation Organization , the United Nations body that developed the standards for e-passports , opted to store travelers ' fingerprints as a digital photo , no different than if you were to press the tabs of your fingers against a flatbed scanner .
As a result , it 's possible to seize the image and use it to impersonate a passport holder by essentially hijacking their fingerprints .
Japanese researchers several years ago demonstrated the ability to make false fingerprints using gelatin material that could be placed over a finger .
To access any data on the passport , the attacker would need to unlock it using a machine - readable code printed on the passport 's face .
Additionally , the International Civil Aviation Organization recommends that issuing countries protect biometric data on the e-passport with an optional feature known as Extended Access Control , which protects the biometric data on the chip by making readers obtain a digital certificate from the country that issued the passport before the equipment can access the information .
That certificate is only valid for a short period of time , but the chips contain no onboard clock to handle the digital certificate 's expiration , which makes them vulnerable as well , says Grunwald .
" It 's a basic mistake , " he says .
The U.S. State Department had no immediate comment Tuesday .
Grunwald 's DefCon talk , " First We Break Your Tag , Then We Break Your Systems , " is scheduled for Friday .

Actually that demonstration is a fake one for the junta wants to prove that their soldiers are not terrorist and not shooting at people and it's also the junta 's plan to hide the truth of their terrorist evidences .
At the same time , in Rangoon , the riot police are hitting with iron bar to any group of people whether they are demonstrators or not .
After hitting violently , they arrest the people who collapse .

Secrecy shrouds UN mission to Burma
30th September 2007 , 12:33 WST
An urgent United Nations mission to bring Burma 's ruling generals and their many foes to the peace table was shrouded in secrecy on Sunday , with no word on progress from the country 's new jungle capital .
Officials were unreachable in Naypyidaw , 385 km to the north of Rangoon , which has been the centre of an uprising led by Buddhist monks .
...
The heavy - handed suppression of the protests had prompted criticism even from China , the closest the junta have to an ally , and rare condemnation from ASEAN ( the Association of South East Asian Nations ) , of which Burma is a member .
State - run media have proclaimed the restoration of peace and stability , and insist that security forces handled the protests " with care , using the least possible force " .
Diplomats flown to Naypyidaw received similar assurances .
At their height last Monday and Tuesday , the protests in central Rangoon filled five city blocks .
They are now reduced to a few hundred people taunting and cursing security forces , who have fenced off the protest area between two main pagodas , before vanishing into alleys when charged .
There is no sign now of the maroon - robed monks , the moral core of the deeply Buddhist nation , whose column stretched nearly a kilometre at the height of the protests against 45 years of military rule .
The monks were either arrested by the hundreds in overnight raids on their monasteries , or are penned in there by surrounding security forces who began a crackdown on Wednesday in Rangoon .
Soldiers and police fire occasional warning shots , ensuring the city remains scared of a repeat of 1988 , when the army put down an uprising , killing an estimated 3,000 people .

Protesters deterred b heavy security presence in Burma ’s largest city Sep 30th , 2007 by Thaung Nyunt YANGON , Myanmar ( AP ) - Thousands of soldiers and police were deployed in Myanmar 's largest cities Sunday , keeping even the most die - hard protesters off the streets .
Scores of arrests were made overnight , further demoralizing those seeking an end to decades of military dictatorship .
The top U.N. envoy on Myanmar , Ibrahim Gambari , was trying to persuade the country 's leaders to end a deadly crackdown on demonstrators that has sparked international outcry , and China and Japan urged their political and economic ally to resolve the crisis peacefully .
But such international pressure has had little impact in the past .
" I do n't think it will make much of a difference , " said a hotel worker , who like other residents asked not to be named , fearing retaliation .
" We have to find a solution ourselves . "

Monks jailed by kangaroo courts Military courts reminiscent of Nazi Germany
In a defiant gesture of disdain for world opinion and the mission of the United Nations special envoy Ibrahim Gambari , the Burmese regime is pressing ahead with the prosecution of about 1,000 monks rounded up so far after participating in peaceful protests in Rangoon and other Burmese cities , writes EDWARD LOXTON .
As Gambari arrived in Burma 's new capital , Naypyidaw , yesterday for talks with regime leaders on the crisis , news filtered out of Rangoon 's grim Insein Prison that kangaroo courts had begun sentencing the monks to long prison terms .
Several had been summarily given terms of six years , said one dissident source who has contact with political prisoners in Insein .
" The monks were stripped of their robes and thrust into prison uniforms , " he said .
" Monks who try to continue with their daily ritual are being beaten and humiliated .
Elderly abbots are being forced to squat on concrete floors until they collapse . "
http://www.mizzima.com/...
Speculation is rife that the No.2 man in the junta , Vice Senior General Maung Aye , who has been identified by the opposition to be one general who does n't want to shoot protesters met Aung San Suu Kyi a few days earlier .
However , many Burmese are still not ready to accept that this is true .
Meanwhile , diplomatic sources claimed that Russia wants to see a compromise in Burma but the main obstacle remains the head of junta Senior General Than Shwe .
" Russia views Than Shwe as a problem , " said a diplomatic source .
The military junta has come up with a condition and wants Aung San Suu Kyi should speak out to stop the anti-government demonstrations , sources added .

" There are rolls of barbed wire inside one of the entrances , yesterday I saw ammunition being carried in to the building .
" I could see the guards in there cooking and I could also see their automatic rifles propped up against the wall , and it 's difficult to exaggerate perhaps what an extraordinary image this is in a Buddhist society . "

Government cleans up damage to raided monastery Sep 30 , 2007 ( DVB ) - Ngway Kyar Yan monastery , which was raided by government troops on Wednesday , was quickly cleaned up and restored by the Ministry of Religious Affairs in advance of United Nations Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari 's arrival in Burma yesterday , according to sources close to the monastery .
The monastery , located in Rangoon 's South Okkalapa towhnship , was ransacked by government troops at midnight on Wednesday night during mass raids on monasteries in Rangoon .
Photographs showing the damage to the monastery following the raids were widely disseminated soon afterwards .
" All the mess left during the army 's raid in Ngway Kyar Yan monastery was cleaned up by officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs .
The monastery was also renovated and now it looks like a new one , " said a South Okkalapa resident who lives near the monastery .
Lines of communication must be reopening .

Burma :
Thousands dead in massacre of the monks dumped in the jungle Thousands of protesters are dead and the bodies of hundreds of executed monks have been dumped in the jungle , a former intelligence officer for Burma 's ruling junta has revealed .
The most senior official to defect so far , Hla Win , said : " Many more people have been killed in recent days than you 've heard about .
The bodies can be counted in several thousand . "
Mr Win , who spoke out as a Swedish diplomat predicted that the revolt has failed , said he fled when he was ordered to take part in a massacre of holy men .
He has now reached the border with Thailand . [ snip ]
Word reaching dissidents hiding out on the border suggested that as well as executions , some 2,000 monks are being held in the notorious Insein Prison or in university rooms which have been turned into cells .
There were reports that many were savagely beaten at a sports ground on the outskirts of Rangoon , where they were heard crying for help .
And , an email from a couple of days ago :

Sept 28 , 07 :
Update 9/28/07 : A dispatch received from someone with a relative in Yangon ( Rangoon ) , via Richard Reoch of Shambhala :
We just got phone call with our sister living in Yangon about a few hours ago .
We saw on BBC world , saying that 200 monks were arrested .
The true picture is far worse .
For one instance , the monastery at an obscure neighborhood of Yangon , called Ngwe Kyar Yan ( on Wei - za - yan - tar Road , Yangon ) had been raided early this morning .
A troop of lone - tein ( riot police comprised of paid thugs ) protected by the military trucks , raided the monastery with 200 studying monks .
They systematically ordered all the monks to line up and banged and crushed each one 's head against the brick wall of the monastery .
One by one , the peaceful , non resisting monks , fell to the ground , screaming in pain .
Then , they tore off the red robes and threw them all in the military trucks ( like rice bags ) and took the bodies away .
The head monk of the monastery , was tied up in the middle of the monastery , tortured , bludgeoned , and later died the same day , today .
Tens of thousands of people gathered outside the monastery , warded off by troops with bayoneted rifles , unable to help their helpless monks being slaughtered inside the monastery .
Their every try to forge ahead was met with the bayonets .
When all is done , only 10 out of 200 remained alive , hiding in the monastery .
Blood stained everywhere on the walls and floors of the monastery .
Please tell your audience of the full extent of the fate of the monks please please !!!!!!!!!!!!
' Arrested ' is not enough expression .
They have been bludgeoned to death !!!!!!

Reports emerging from Rangoon indicate that the temporary detention
centres based in Yangon Institute of Technology and General Institute
of Technology ( GTI ) is currently detaining 500 hundred monks .
The monks are refusing to accept Sune ( Alms food ..... food offering given to monk
by layperson just before 12 noon as main meal of the day ) from the
military junta .
The local population approached these detention
centres to offer food and they have been turned away by the

Burmese monks ' to be sent away '
Burmese people eat on the streets of Rangoon
Monks are absent , but people in Rangoon are going about their lives
Thousands of monks detained in Burma 's main city of Rangoon will be sent to prisons in the far north of the country , sources have told the BBC .
About 4,000 monks have been rounded up in the past week as the military government has tried to stamp out pro-democracy protests .
They are being held at a disused race course and a technical college .
Sources from a government - sponsored militia said they would soon be moved away from Rangoon .
The monks have been disrobed and shackled , the sources told BBC radio's Burmese service .
There are reports that the monks are refusing to eat .
Slightly less bad than them being killed , but why am I getting this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach ?
Anyway , go see sabrina 's tracking of this on PFF she 's keeping up with this in a way I can't right now :

The U.S. Army has ordered soldiers to stop posting to blogs or sending personal e-mail messages , without first clearing the content with a superior officer , Wired News has learned .
The directive , issued April 19 , is the sharpest restriction on troops ' online activities since the start of the Iraq war .
And it could mean the end of military blogs , observers say .
Military officials have been wrestling for years with how to handle troops who publish blogs .
Officers have weighed the need for wartime discretion against the opportunities for the public to personally connect with some of the most effective advocates for the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq – the troops themselves .
The secret - keepers have generally won the argument , and the once - permissive atmosphere has slowly grown more tightly regulated .
Soldier - bloggers have dropped offline as a result .
The new rules ( .pdf ) obtained by Wired News require a commander be consulted before every blog update .
" This is the final nail in the coffin for combat blogging , " said retired paratrooper Matthew Burden , editor of The Blog of War anthology .
" No more military bloggers writing about their experiences in the combat zone .
This is the best PR the military has – it 's most honest voice out of the war zone .
And it 's being silenced . "
Army Regulation 530–1 : Operations Security ( OPSEC ) ( .pdf ) restricts more than just blogs , however .
Previous editions of the rules asked Army personnel to " consult with their immediate supervisor " before posting a document " that might contain sensitive and / or critical information in a public forum . "
The new version , in contrast , requires " an OPSEC review prior to publishing " anything – from " web log ( blog ) postings " to comments on internet message boards , from resumes to letters home .
Failure to do so , the document adds , could result in a court - martial , or " administrative , disciplinary , contractual , or criminal action . "
Despite the absolutist language , the guidelines ' author , Major Ray Ceralde , said there is some leeway in enforcement of the rules .
" It is not practical to check all communication , especially private communication , " he noted in an e-mail .
" Some units may require that soldiers register their blog with the unit for identification purposes with occasional spot checks after an initial review .
Other units may require a review before every posting . "
But with the regulations drawn so tightly , " many commanders will feel like they have no choice but to forbid their soldiers from blogging – or even using e-mail , " said Jeff Nuding , who won the bronze star for his service in Iraq .
" If I 'm a commander , and think that any slip - up gets me screwed , I 'm making it easy : No blogs , " added Nuding , writer of the " pro-victory " Dadmanly site .
" I think this means the end of my blogging . "
Active - duty troops are n't the only ones affected by the new guidelines .
Civilians working for the military , Army contractors – even soldiers ' families – are all subject to the directive as well .
But , while the regulations may apply to a broad swath of people , not everybody affected can actually read them .
In a Kafka - esque turn , the guidelines are kept on the military 's restricted Army Knowledge Online intranet .
Many
Army contractors – and many family members – do n't have access to the site .
Even those able to get in are finding their access is blocked to that particular file .
" Even though it is supposedly rewritten to include rules for contractors ( i.e. , me ) I am not allowed to download it , " e-mails Perry Jeffries , an Iraq war veteran now working as a contractor to the Armed Services Blood Program .
The U.S. military – all militaries – have long been concerned about their personnel inadvertently letting sensitive information out .
Troops ' mail was read and censored throughout World War II ; back home , government posters warned citizens " careless talk kills . "
Military blogs , or milblogs , as they 're known in service - member circles , only make the potential for mischief worse .
On a website , anyone , including foreign intelligence agents , can stop by and look for information .
" All that stuff we used to get around a bar and say to each other – well , now because we 're publishing it in open forums , now it 's intel , " said milblogger and retired Army officer John Donovan .
Passing on classified data – real secrets – is already a serious military crime .
The new regulations ( and their author ) take an unusually expansive view of what kind of unclassified information a foe might find useful .
In an article published by the official Army News Service , Maj .
Ceralde " described how the Pentagon parking lot had more parked cars than usual on the evening of Jan. 16 , 1991 , and how pizza parlors noticed a significant increase of pizza to the Pentagon ....
These observations are indicators , unclassified information available to all … that Operation Desert Storm ( was about to ) beg ( i )n . "
Steven Aftergood , head of the Federation of American Scientists ' Project on Government Secrecy , called Ceralde 's example " outrageous . "
" It 's true that from an OPSEC ( operational security ) perspective , almost anything – pizza orders , office lights lit at odd hours , full or empty parking lots – can potentially tip off an observer that something unusual is afoot , " he added .
" But real OPSEC is highly discriminating .
It does not mean cutting off the flow of information across the board .
If on one day in 1991 an unusual number of pizza orders coincided with the start of Desert Storm , it does n't mean that information about pizza orders should now be restricted .
That 's not OPSEC , that 's just stupidity . "
During the early days of the Iraq war , milblogs flew under the radar of the Defense Department 's information security establishment .
But after soldiers like Specialist Colby Buzzell began offering detailed descriptions of firefights that were scantily covered in the press , blogs began to be viewed by some in the military as a threat – an almost endless chorus of unregulated voices that could say just about anything .
Buzzell , for one , was banned from patrols and confined to base after such an incident .
Military officials asked other bloggers to make changes to their sites .
One soldier took down pictures of how well armor stood up to improvised bombs ; a military spouse erased personal information from her site – including " dates of deployment , photos of the family , the date their next child is expected , the date of the baby shower and where the family lives , " said Army spokesman Gordon Van Fleet .
But such cases have been rare , Major Elizabeth Robbins noted in a paper ( .pdf ) for the Army 's Combined Arms Center .
" The potential for an OPSEC violation has thus far outstripped the reality experienced by commanders in the field , " she wrote .
And in some military circles , bloggers have gained forceful advocates .
The Office of the Secretary of Defense , for example , now regularly arranges exclusive phone conferences between bloggers and senior commanders in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Major Robbins , for one , has argued strongly for easing the restrictions on the soldier - journalists .
" The reputation of the Army is maintained on many fronts , and no one fights harder on its behalf than our young soldiers .
We must allow them access to the fight , " Robbins wrote .
" To silence the most credible voices – those at the spear 's edge – and to disallow them this function is to handicap ourselves on a vital , very real battlefield . "
Nevertheless , commanders have become increasingly worried about the potential for leaks .
In April 2005 , military leaders in Iraq told milbloggers to " register " ( . pdf ) their sites with superior officers .
In September , the Army made the first revision of its OPSEC regulations since the mid-'90s , ordering GIs to talk to their commanders before posting potentially - problematic information .
Soldiers began to drop their websites , in response .
More bloggers followed suit , when an alert came down from highest levels of the Pentagon that " effective immediately , no information may be placed on websites … unless it has been reviewed for security concerns , " and the Army announced it was activating a team , the Army Web Risk Assessment Cell , to scan blogs for information breaches .
An official Army dispatch told milbloggers , " Big Brother is not watching you , but 10 members of a Virginia National Guard unit might be . "
That unit continues to look for security violations , new regulations in hand .

Building the antenna
Biquad antennas can be built from common materials , which is nice because you do n't have to scrounge around for the perfectly - sized soup can .
We did have to buy some specialized parts before getting started though .
The most important part here is the small silver panel mount N - connector in the center of the picture ; the entire antenna will be built on this .
We purchased it from S.M. Electronics , part # 1113-000 - N331-011 .
The " N - connector " is standard across the majority of commercial antennas and you can connect them to your wireless devices using " pigtails . "
The longer pigtail in the picture is a RP - TNC to N - Male pigtail that we 'll use to connect our antenna to a Linksys WRT54G access point .
The short pigtail is a RP - MMCX to N - Male pigtail so we can connect to our Senao 2511CD PLUS EXT2 WiFi card which is pictured .
We also purchased 10 feet of WBC 400 coax cable so we would n't have to sit with the dish in our lap .
We got our surplus DirecTV dish from Freecycle .
We 'll cover the reason for the mini butane torch later .
Trevor Marshall built one of the first biquad WiFi antennas found on the internet .
We followed the slightly more thorough instructions found at martybugs .
net .
Here are the raw materials we started with :
The wire is standard solid - core 3 - conductor wire used for most house wiring .
We did n't have any copper printed circuit board material laying around so we used this thin sheet of copper and supported it using the 1/4 - inch thick black plastic pictured .
The first step in building the element was stripping and cutting a 244 mm length of wire .
We marked the wire every 31 mm with a permanent marker and began bending the wire into a double diamond shape .
We tried to make the length of each leg 30.5 mm .
The easiest way to make really sharp bends in the solid copper wire is to use two pairs of pliers .
With the pliers held perpendicular to each other bend the wire against one of the sets of jaws .
The element with all bends completed :
Next we cut out a 110 mm square of black plastic to use as a base for the reflector .
We drilled a hole in the center to clear our connector .
We then soldered a piece of copper wire to the center pin of our N - connector .
Next we soldered a piece of of wire to the outside of the connector .
We ran into some trouble here .
Our cheapy iron was not capable of getting the connector 's base hot enough to make a good solder joint .
We bought a butane torch and used that to heat up the surfaces .
This worked pretty well except it desoldered our center pin .
We recommend you solder the outside piece of wire first before doing the center one .
After the connector had cooled it was attached to the black plastic base using epoxy .
The thin copper sheet was attached to the front with epoxy and trimmed to fit .
We let the epoxy cure for a while before proceeding .
The next step was to solder our bow tie shaped element to the vertical wires .
The element was supported by two pieces of scrap copper trimmed to 15 mm to ensure proper positioning .
Then the extra wire was trimmed off and the outside wire was soldered to the ground plane to complete the antenna .
To make mounting to the dish easy we modified the original feedhorn .
Here is what it originally looked like .
After removing the housing , internal components and shortening the feedhorn looked like this .
The antenna is attached by inserting the N - connector into the tube and then connecting the coax cable .
Here is a picture of the final antenna assembly ready to be attached to the dish .
Since the satellite dish has an off - center feed it looks like it is pointed at the ground when it is level with the horizon .
Even though there are no angle markings for setting the dish at 0 degrees inclination we can still ensure that the dish is pointing at the horizon by setting the dish angle to 45 degrees and mounting it on a tube with a 45 degree angle .
Test results
The Engadget Corn Belt Testing Facility has broadband access provided by a local WISP .
So we knew if we plugged in our antenna we were sure to pick up something in the area .
We pointed the dish at the closest grain elevator , where the WISP mounts their antennas .
We connected the dish feed to our Senao card and started up Kismet .
We expected to get one AP , but five is even better .
Looking through the info strings we were able to determine where the APs were since the WISP had named them according to the town they are in .
The AP on channel 5 is the one we pointed at in town A , 2.4 miles away .
The AP on channel 6 is located in town B , 8.2 miles away .
The two APs on channel 1 are a bridge between town A and town C which is located 2.6 miles directly behind the dish .
Our next test was to hook our WRT54G up to the dish and point it at a hill 1 mile away .
We drove to the top of the hill and used an omnidirectional mini whip antenna with our Senao card to detect it .
Our router was picked up easily .
The found 14 other WISP APs including town D , 7.8 miles away .
The WISP is definitely using some high powered equipment if we 're just picking this up with an omnidirectional antenna .
For a final test we put the dish on the roof rack and parked on top of the hill to see if we could pick up any more APs .
Our final count is 18 APs , 17 of those belonging to the WISP .
This was a pretty fun project and shows that you can build decent wireless solutions using consumer gear .
For the curious :
The WISP gives its subscribers a patch antenna with a built in power - over - ethernet access point .
Once the antenna is mounted to the roof they run a single ethernet cable into the house which means they do n't have to worry about signal loss from coax .
These client boxes are manufactured by Tranzeo .
The underachiever who always looks uninterested .
The loudmouth who complains from Day 1 .
The choker who lets his team down when it matters most .
These are the players who drive their fans nuts .
In honor of these boo magnets , I set out to find the 100 players most hated by their home fans during their playing days in that city .
Some quick ground rules :
This is all in good fun , so we 're avoiding examples such as Donnie Moore , the Angels relief pitcher who committed suicide after several high - profile blown saves , or Andres Escobar , the Colombian soccer player who was murdered after scoring on his own net in the 1994 World Cup .
Also , remember that these are players hated by their own teams ' fans .
Everyone in the free world seems to hate Barry Bonds , but Giants fans love him , so he 's not in here .
Without further ado , here are 100 targets of your boos and batteries :
QUARTERBACK DIVISION
AP Photo Mr. Leaf , the gold standard for fan hatred .
The QB drafted one pick after Peyton Manning in 1998 was loathed by fans and teammates alike , a disaster both on the field and in front of a microphone .
When he finally retired in 2002 , former teammate and frequent verbal sparring partner Rodney Harrison summed it up best : " He probably did the best thing ; he took his money and ran . "
2. Tim Couch , Cleveland Browns : The No. 1 overall pick in the 1999 draft , Couch 's disappointing five - year tenure in Cleveland ended with fans calling for the immortal Kelly Holcomb to take his place .
3. Tony Eason , New England Patriots :
The first QB in Super Bowl history who failed to complete a pass .
4. Drew Bledsoe , New England Patriots : Before Tom Brady ever came along , Pats fans were calling for backup Michael Bishop to take his job , chanting " Bishop ! Bishop ! " while Bledsoe was still on the field .
5. Cade McNown , Chicago Bears :
Once busted for using a handicapped parking pass while at UCLA ; also tried to steal Playboy Playmate girlfriends away from both Tim Couch and Hugh Hefner .
He was a lousy QB , too , inspiring Bears fans to start the Web site tradecade.com .
6. Rex Grossman , Chicago Bears :
The popular sentiment in Chicago is that the Bears made it to the Super Bowl in spite of their quarterback , not because of him .
A mistake - prone gunslinger often criticized for making poor decisions , Grossman may be best known in the blogosphere for his various nicknames , including the Steve Spurrier - bestowed " Sexy Rexy " and , later , the " Sex Cannon . "
7. Andre Ware , Detroit Lions :
The former Heisman Trophy winner was drafted No. 7 overall by the Lions , only to start just six games in his four - year stint in Detroit .
8. Scott Mitchell , Detroit Lions : Surrounded by a potent offense that included Barry Sanders and Herman Moore , Mitchell led the Lions to the playoffs in 1994 , 1995 and 1997 .
But a sudden crash in 1998 led to Mitchell losing his job to Charlie Batch , then getting booted out of town .
9. Joey Harrington , Detroit Lions : The No. 3 overall pick in the 2002 draft , Harrington posted two of the worst seasons ever recorded by a QB , setting a record for the two worst yards per attempt ( YPA ) passing averages since the NFL - AFL merger .
10 . Byron Leftwich , Jacksonville Jaguars : The No. 7 pick in the 2003 draft , he was cut just four years later by the Jags , just in time for the season opener .
11 . Kordell Stewart , Pittsburgh Steelers :
An all - around talent who bounced between spectacular and horrific as a QB , Kordell lost the fans ' favor for good in the 2002 AFC Championship Game .
For more on Kordell , see also : Fantasy Seasons , Most Destroyed .
12 . Marc Wilson , Oakland Raiders and New England Patriots :
Never lived up to his great college career at BYU with the Raiders , then later guided the Pats to a 1 - 15 season , one of the worst in NFL history .
13 . Vinny Testaverde , Tampa Bay Buccaneers :
An interception machine with the Bucs , he was constantly heckled for his color blindness .
A Tampa radio station once rented a billboard after a loss to the Giants , with Testaverde standing in front of a blue background .
The billboard read : " Vinny thinks this is orange ! "
14 . Rick Mirer , Seattle Seahawks : Seahawks fans hoped for the next Joe Montana when Seattle drafted the former Golden Domer No. 2 overall in 1993 .
Instead , they got Hannah Montana .
15 . Chad Pennington , New York Jets : Were Jets fans cheering Pennington 's injury in Week 1 or just happy that Kellen Clemens was finally getting his shot ?
Whatever the case , Pennington 's frequent injuries and weak throwing arm made him unpopular in Gotham well before his latest setback .
16 . Brian Griese , Denver Broncos :
In an otherwise impressive string of successful seasons , the Brian Griese years rank as the ugliest during the Mike Shanahan era .
YANKEES DIVISION
17 . Ed Whitson , New York Yankees : High - priced free agent mercilessly booed and heckled by Yankees fans both for his on - field failures and for breaking manager Billy Martin 's arm in a bar fight .
To this day , Whitson refuses to sign any pictures or baseball cards showing him in a Yankees uniform .
18 . Kenny Rogers , New York Yankees : Ed Whitson with fewer death threats .
19 . Jeff Weaver , New York Yankees : Kenny Rogers with fewer death threats .
20 . Kevin Brown , New York Yankees :
Two incidents stand out in Yankees fans ' memory -- Brown breaking his hand and missing the end of the 2004 season after punching a wall in anger , and Brown returning for the playoffs that season , only to last less than two innings before getting pulled in the Bombers ' loss to the Red Sox .
21 . Alex Rodriguez , New York Yankees :
Sure , they love him now .
But just wait until he goes 49 - for - 50 with 49 homers and 150 RBIs in the playoffs , only to make the final out of Game 7 of the World Series .
Then we 'll know that A - Rod the Choker never left us .
Google " Kyle Farnsworth " and " The Dugout " and you 'll gain a better understanding of the Yankees ' goggle - wearing arsonist .
It 's hard to say what would be a bigger long shot for Professor Farnsworth : an All - Star appearance or a Mensa membership .
AP Photo Long live the Toad !
Long live the Toad !
Long live the Toad !
When your team 's owner calls you a fat toad in the media , things probably are n't going so well .
24 . Kei Igawa , New York Yankees :
Yes , he 's another Japanese pitcher who was horribly overpaid by the Yankees , then failed miserably on the mound .
On the plus side , he 's pretty slim .
25 . Carl Pavano , New York Yankees :
He 's been totally unfair to Yankees fans -- most of the players on this list have the courtesy to actually play once in a while and receive their boos .
PHILLIES DIVISION
26 . Dick Allen , Philadelphia Phillies and elsewhere :
The Albert Belle of his era , Allen was a fearsome power hitter who was still hated in Philly .
Some of the abuse , including a stream of racial epithets from fans , was unwarranted .
But Allen often came across as immature and selfish :
He once missed a doubleheader against the Mets because he went to see a horse race that morning and got caught in traffic on the way back , then walked out on the White Sox with two weeks to go in the 1974 season .
27 . Mike Schmidt , Philadelphia Phillies :
Yes , they even hated the greatest third baseman in major league history .
Schmidt 's reserved demeanor on the field gave some the perception that he was aloof , a trait Phillies fans hated most when Schmidt would walk back to the dugout after striking out .
In related news , Philly fans , while incredibly loyal to their teams , are also insane .
28 . Scott Rolen , Philadelphia Phillies :
Hated because he was n't Mike Schmidt .
29 . Von Hayes , Philadelphia Phillies : Another former Phillie who lacked passion , Hayes also carried the twin burdens of being a good , but not great player , and of being acquired in an infamous , lopsided traded with the Indians .
In reference to the trade , Hayes earned the unflattering nickname " Five - for - One . "
30 . Bobby Abreu , Philadelphia Phillies : Perpetually underrated offensive player who derives a lot of value from his great batting eye .
Or from Phillies fans ' perspective : lazy , good - for - nothing albatross who could n't get out of town fast enough .
31 . Pat Burrell , Philadelphia Phillies : Why do Phillies fans hate him ?
Let 's see : No. 1 overall pick , signed to a $ 50 million contract , terrible defender , who strikes out more than almost anyone else in baseball .
On the other hand , Burrell 's also one of the baseball 's most dangerous power hitters when he's on his game .
Watching Phillies fans figure out how to deal with Burrell 's recent hot streak has been a rare treat .
RED SOX DIVISION
32 . Calvin Schiraldi , Boston Red Sox :
The pitcher who set off the events that led to the infamous Bill Buckner boot .
Later went to Chicago , where Cubs fans could n't stand him either .
33 . Jose Offerman , Boston Red Sox : aka Jose Awfulman
34 . Edgar Renteria , Boston Red Sox :
One of several disappointing big - ticket acquisitions made by the Red Sox since the 2004 World Series win , Renteria was doubly hated for replacing popular ' 04 stretch - run pickup Orlando Cabrera .
A local radio station called him " Rent - A - Wreck , " as well as several names related to loose stool .
35 . J.D. Drew , Boston Red Sox :
The $ 70 million outfielder has earned the nickname " Nancy Drew " for his disappointing performance and passive approach at the plate .
A big hot streak by top prospect Jacoby Ellsbury might send Drew to the bench before Year 1 of his five - year deal is complete .
36 . Matt Clement , Boston Red Sox :
In a photo finish , it 's " HazMatt " over " DoorMatt " for best Clement nickname .
If you 're wondering where all the nicknames in sports went , by the way , the answer is WIP in Philly and WEEI in Boston .
METS DIVISION
37 . Doug Sisk , New York Mets :
So hated that a fan once sent him a mock prescription for cyanide , " to be taken daily . "
38 . Dave Kingman , New York Mets and everywhere else : Actually a pretty good hitter in his 16 seasons with the Giants , Mets , Padres , Angels , Yankees , Cubs , Mets ( again ) and A's .
But fans let him have it for every one of his 1,816 career strikeouts .
39 . George Foster , New York Mets : Blamed for the Mets ' largesse after the team gave him a fat contract before the 1982 season , hoping to recapture his 52 - homer form and ignoring his advancing age and falling numbers .
His attitude did n't help : Foster used to roll up to the stadium for games in a stretch limo .
40 . Roger Cedeno , New York Mets : Reader Jon Harpula 's take on Cedeno : " A fat man 's Juan Pierre . "
41 . Vince Coleman , New York Mets :
So many reasons for hatred to choose from , but I 'm going to go with this 1991 quote : " I do n't know nothing about no Jackie Robinson . "
Actually Vince , that should be , " I do n't know anything about Jackie Robinson . "
Please work on your grammar .
AP Photo
They 're not booing , they 're chanting ... actually , yes , they 're booing .
Wore earplugs to the plate to drown out the boos that greeted him for every at - bat .
43 . Braden Looper , New York Mets :
Blow late - inning leads , get booed in Queens .
44 . Mel Rojas , New York Mets :
Blow late - inning leads when you 're carrying extra poundage , and you get booed a lot in Queens .
45 . Guillermo Mota , New York Mets :
Blow late - inning leads even when you 're juicing , then return and post an ERA near six , and you might want to ask for a trade .
46 . Kazuo Matsui , New York Mets : Expected to improve the Mets ' offense and shore up their defense , Matsui instead stank at all facets of the game .
Bonus points for turning his career around now that he 's out of New York .
CUBS DIVISION
47 . LaTroy Hawkins , Chicago Cubs :
Whenever I try to argue that anyone can be a closer and that the last three outs of a game are no big deal , someone always brings up LaTroy Hawkins .
I have no rebuttal for LaTroy Hawkins .
48 . Corey Patterson , Chicago Cubs : A .215 batting average plus a half - dozen Old Styles per fan equals bad times at Wrigley .
Beloved by Cubs fans for his long home runs and gregarious personality , Sosa took much of the blame for the 2004 season , after Dusty Baker and abrasive local media members piled on and berated him for " only " hitting 35 homers that season .
50 . Todd Hundley , Chicago Cubs : A constant target of boos at Wrigley , Hundley once flipped off the fans during a home run trot , likely figuring he would n't get to run around the bases many more times .
It 's not easy to cheese off a fan base that loves your dad , but Hundley pulled it off .
His Baseball Reference page says it all .
POLITICAL DIVISION
51 . Mahmoud Abdul - Rauf , Denver Nuggets :
His refusal to stand for the national anthem before games earned him a brand of hatred that transcends sport .
HOCKEY DIVISION
AP Photo Here 's your $ 18 million ... now go get your shinebox !
First , fans in Ottawa started calling him " Alexei Cashin " after the Russian star sat out an entire season trying to get a raise .
Eight years later , the Islanders soured on him so badly that they bought out his contract for nearly $ 18 million just to make him go away .
53 . Andre Racicot , Montreal Canadiens :
The former backup goalie for the Habs let in so many goals that fans stuck him with an unforgettable and unforgiving nickname : " Red Light Racicot . "
54 . Patrice Brisebois , Montreal Canadiens :
The most hated Hab of the past decade , Brisebois earned the moniker " Breeze - by " for his tendency to let opposing skaters breeze by him .
After two years in Colorado , Brisebois inexplicably returned to Montreal for more abuse .
55 . Larry Murphy , Toronto Maple Leafs : Traded to his hometown team in 1995 , Murphy was the team 's highest - paid player and the scapegoat for the Leafs ' failures .
Later traded to Detroit , he won two Stanley Cups with the Wings ; on his first day with the Cup , Murphy brought it back to Toronto , deepening fans ' misery .
56 . Nikolai Antropov , Toronto Maple Leafs : Leafs fans can't decide what they hate most about Antropov -- his constant injuries , his stork - on - ice skating , or the fact that Toronto just signed him to a two - year contract extension .
57 . Eric Lindros , Philadelphia Flyers :
The bruising center once dubbed " The Next One , " Lindros became hated by many Flyers fans for failing to live up to his potential after a series of injuries and concussions derailed his promising career .
Lindros does garner sympathy in some corners , though , if only because the man he feuded with in Philly , Bobby Clarke , ranks as one of the most reviled executives in sports history .
58 . Keith Primeau , Detroit Red Wings :
A first - round pick who never lived up to the hype in Detroit , Primeau was another talented player criticized for being a poor skater .
Many
Wings fans see it as no coincidence that the team ended its 40 - year championship drought after Primeau was traded for Brendan Shanahan .
MULTITEAM OFFENDER DIVISION
59 .
Jose Mesa , 8 teams :
Actually deserves the scorn , both for his frequent late - inning implosions and his oh - so - pleasant off - field demeanor , including his famous comment about former teammate Omar Vizquel : " I want to kill him . "
60 . Armando Benitez , 6 teams :
Mets fans wo n't forgive him for the 1999 NLCS or 2000 World Series .
But Benitez has been an equal - opportunity save blower throughout his career , botching chances for what seems like half the league .
61 . Gary Sheffield , everywhere except San Diego and Detroit :
His foot - in - mouth tendencies rank with the all - time greats .
But nothing tops his early - career days with the Brewers ; in Milwaukee Sheffield openly admitted to tanking on purpose so that he would be sent to another team .
62 . Terrell Owens , 3 teams : San Francisco : implied that Jeff Garcia was gay .
Philly : feuded with Donovan McNabb .
Dallas : hated before he ever got to town , after celebrating on the star at midfield following a TD against the Cowboys .
" MAJOR LEAGUE " DIVISION
63 . Rick " Wild Thing " Vaughn , fictional Cleveland Indians :
His control problems in his rookie season made him the target of jeers from the sparse crowds in the Mistake by the Lake .
But a more consistent fastball , a pair of thick specs and a catchy theme song soon won the fans over .
Even Randy Quaid .
64 . Jack Parkman , fictional Cleveland Indians :
The Tribe hoped to build on their unlikely division title by signing the power - hitting catcher to bolster the offense .
Instead , the arrogant Parkman alienated teammates and fans , got traded to the archrival White Sox , and he later struck out against Vaughn with the AL pennant on the line .
LEGITIMATE JERKS DIVISION
AP Photo Trick or treat ... run !
It 's Albert Belle !
Once threw a ball at a fan in the stands , and also chased down a group of teenagers for egging his house .
One of the most feared hitters of the '90s , but Tribe fans barely put up with him even in the best of times .
66 . Lleyton Hewitt , Australia :
It takes a lot for an entire country to dislike their native son on the tennis circuit .
But Hewitt 's history of racist and homophobic comments ( he once accused a U.S. Open linesman of siding with James Blake against him on a series of foot fault calls , because both Blake and the linesman were black ) have made him hated by rival players , tennis fans and , yes , many Aussies too .
67 . John Rocker , Atlanta Braves :
Not a big fan of riding the subway , apparently .
68 . Bonzi Wells , 4 teams :
Threatening the all - time record for being " absent due to personal reasons . "
69 . J.R. / Isaiah Rider , 5 teams :
Threw a milk shake at a Jack In The Box worker ; convicted of assault for kicking a female sports bar manager ; spat at hecklers ; once pulled a woman into his car against her will .
Other than that , super guy .
70 . A.J. Pierzynski , Minnesota Twins , San Francisco Giants and Chicago White Sox : Clubhouse cancer ?
You bet .
But how about also being the guy traded for Joe Nathan , Boof Bonser and Francisco Liriano ?
The best story comes courtesy of GQ :
Three years ago in spring training , Pierzynski took a pitch to the groin .
Trainer Stan Conte rushed out and asked how he felt .
" Like this ! "
Pierzynski said , right before he kneed Conte in the family jewels .
WE WISH YOU WERE SOMEONE ELSE DIVISION
71 . Kyle Brady , New York Jets :
In retrospect , maybe Warren Sapp would 've been a better pick .
72 . Blair Thomas , New York Jets :
It was n't the Penn State running back 's fault that the Jets picked him No. 2 overall in 1990 , one of many draft blunders for the cursed franchise .
But he still bore the brunt of the blame .
73 . Glenn Davis , Baltimore Orioles : The O's gave up Curt Schilling , Pete Harnisch and Steve Finley to get him .
He could 've hit like Albert Pujols and they'd have hated him in Baltimore .
Also , he did n't hit like Albert Pujols .
74 . Tino Martinez , St. Louis Cardinals : Cards fans love everybody , but when Martinez failed miserably after several big years with the Yankees , Busch Stadium booed him for two full seasons .
75 . Adam Dunn , Cincinnati Reds :
In the eyes of Reds fans and their hatchet - wielding broadcasters , Dunn 's 40 homers and 100 walks a season are a big fluke , and only his high strikeout totals and sketchy defense matter .
The abuse has grown so harsh this season , you 'd think he sold the recipe for Skyline Chili to Osama .
PAINFUL MOMENTS DIVISION
76 . Scott Norwood , Buffalo Bills : Wide right .
77 . Salomon Torres , San Francisco Giants :
Lost the final game of the 1993 season , causing the 103 - win Giants to lose the NL West title by one game to the 104 - win Braves .
Old grudges die hard -- when Torres returned to San Francisco this season as a reliever with the Pirates , fans serenaded him with a chorus of boos .
78 . Mitch Williams , Philadelphia Phillies : Received death threats after serving up the winning home run to Joe Carter in the 1993 World Series , prompting hundreds of fans to call Philly 's sports talk radio station claiming to be the culprit .
Give Williams huge credit for keeping things in perspective , though .
Asked about the homer , Williams took the blame for the incident , but refused to feel sorry for himself : " I could be digging ditches .
I 'm not . "
79 . Bill Buckner , Boston Red Sox :
It 's a bit less depressing for Sox fans when Vin Scully and " RBI Baseball " are involved .
OK , not really .
BIG MAN STIFFS DIVISION
80 . Benoit Benjamin , Seattle SuperSonics : Did a better job perfecting the confetti trick with the Harlem Globetrotters than he did scoring in the NBA .
81 . Rafael Araujo , Toronto Raptors :
Three years after the Raptors drafted him eighth in the draft , he 's now plying his trade with Spartak St. Petersburg in Russia .

When your look is Drew Carey chic , yeah , you 're already in the hole .
Reader Clint Cunningham says : " We hate him .
We hated our GM for reacquiring him for his last season .
He has a Fred Flintstone tattoo , was bitch slapped by Shaq and appeared in ' Eddie ' with Whoopi Goldberg .
...
What is not to hate ? "
83 . Bryant Reeves , Vancouver Grizzles :
Oh , the venom that 's been spewed over the years because of GMs ' big -man fetishes .
POWER FORWARDS DIVISION
84 . Derrick Coleman , New Jersey Nets :
The poster child for unrealized potential , the former No. 1 pick 's path to superstardom was derailed by alcohol abuse , weight gain and a lousy work ethic .
85 . Chris Webber , Golden State Warriors :
Though not the malcontent Coleman was , C - Webb 's legacy in the Bay Area is still one of disappointment , as his feud with Don Nelson paved the way for an eventual 65 - cents - on - the - dollar trade out of town .
86 . Rasheed Wallace , Portland Trail Blazers : Broke the NBA record for technical fouls in a season , then broke his own record a year later .
He also earned a seven - game suspension for threatening referee Tim Donaghy after a 2003 home game .
Hmmm ...
FOOTBALL PLAYERS WHO DON'T FIT INTO AN OBVIOUS CATEGORY DIVISION
87 . Randy Moss , Minnesota Vikings and Oakland Raiders :
When he tries , he 's one of the all - time greats .
When he does n't , he 's Todd Pinkston with a higher salary .
He 's always Todd Pinkston .
89 . Eric Dickerson , Los Angeles Rams and Indianapolis Colts : Rams fans did n't like him asking for a new deal while he was still under contract , and he was soon dealt to the Colts .
A couple of years later , another long holdout made him Public Enemy No. 1 in Indy .
90 . Ricky Williams , Miami Dolphins :
Gave up his lucrative NFL career to travel the world and discover inner enlightenment .
Earned lots of enemies for his decision , but I 'd root for him over repeat DUI offender Leonard Little any day .
91 . Willis McGahee , Buffalo Bills :
Told a reporter he'd like to see the Bills move to Toronto .
Traded to Baltimore soon afterward .
92 . Jerramy Stevens , Seattle Seahawks : Talked trash about Jerome Bettis and ostensibly guaranteed victory before Super Bowl XL , then played a big role in losing the game by dropping several key passes .
His busts for hit - and - run driving , DUI and other offenses did n't help his popularity either .
BASEBALL PLAYERS WHO DON'T FIT INTO AN OBVIOUS CATEGORY DIVISION
93 . Garry Templeton , St. Louis Cardinals :
When fans booed the talented but petulant shortstop in an August 1981 game for not running out a ground ball , Templeton responded with a middle - finger salute .
With the relationship soured , the Cardinals were forced to trade Templeton , hoping to get a decent player in return .
They got Ozzie Smith .
94 . Johnnie LeMaster , San Francisco Giants : Career .222 hitter , nicknamed " Johnny Disaster " by Giants fans .
Once wore a uniform that said " Boo " on it as homage to his critics .
95 . Juan Gonzalez , Detroit Tigers :
You think you hate him now , Tigers fans ?
Imagine what could 've been .
Had JuanGone accepted the $ 140 million offer from the Tigers , he 'd just be serving out the end of his contract in the next two weeks .
HIGH -PRICED LETDOWNS DIVISION
96 . Carlos Zambrano , Chicago Cubs :
Too soon ?
Not after Big Z signed a five - year deal worth more than $ 90 million , then proceeded to stink up the joint .
Asked for his thoughts after a recent disastrous start , Zambrano whined : " I do n't accept that the fans were booing at me . "
97 . Richie Sexson , Seattle Mariners : Making $ 50 million and struggling to hit above the Mendoza Line will get you booed anywhere , even a short drive from your hometown .
98 . Barry Zito , San Francisco Giants :
Signed the richest contract for any pitcher in major league history .
Unfortunately , he is n't the best pitcher in major league history .
He 's not even the best starter on his own team .
Or the second best .
Or the third best .
99 . Mike Hampton , Colorado Rockies : Sure , he was terrible in Denver .
But man , his kids must be geniuses by now .
BOBBY AYALA DIVISION
100 . Bobby Ayala , Seattle Mariners : Often blamed for the Mariners ' inability to break through in the mid-to - late 1990s , despite a roster stocked with Hall of Fame talents such as Randy Johnson , Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez .
Normally it 's unfair to place all the blame on one player .
But did you see this guy pitch ?

遺伝子からみ た 「 差別・いじめ」の意味
実践・作成 者ＴＯＳＳ大分ＷＡＶＥ：松垣和年
村上和雄さんの講演を聞く機会があった。その中で「遺伝子のＯＮ ＯＦＦ 」と言う話の中で 「 いじめと遺伝子のＯＮＯＦＦ」に関わって興味深い話をうかがう事ができた。その講演の内容と「人生の暗号」（村上和雄著）をもとにした話である。
「 遺伝子」ときいて皆さんはどのようなことを思い浮かべますか。おうちの方と顔が似ている、背が高いなど親の持つ特徴を伝えるものが遺伝子です。ところが遺伝子の働きはそれだけではありません。日頃、皆さんが息をしたり、ものを食べたりいろんなことを考えたり喜んだりして生きていることすべてに遺伝子が関係しているのです。
さて、勉強にも遺伝子は関係しています。ノーベル賞をとるような人の遺伝子と先生や皆さんとの遺伝子はどれくらい違うのでしょう。 �@５０パーセント以上 � A３０パーセントくらい � B１０パーセントくらい � C１パーセントくらいの違いしかない�D１パーセント以下 答えは、�Dです。違いは０．１パーセントです。９９．９パーセントは同じなのです。それではどうして能力に違いが出るのでしょうか。遺伝子研究の世界的権威の村上和雄さんは次のように言います。
どんな分野の能力であれ、個人が遺伝子として抱えているものにそう大きな違いはない。現実に能力差として出てくるのは、遺伝子のＯＮＯＦＦが関係している。
（「 人生の暗号」村上和雄著 ２１ページより引用） 先生や皆さんも、ノーベル賞学者と同じような能力はあってもその良い遺伝子の多くが眠っていてスイッチが入っていないというわけです。それではどんなときに良い遺伝子のスイッチが入りどんなときにスイッチが切れるのでしょうか。
良い遺伝子のスイッチを入れるためには次のようなことをするといいのです。
１ 思い切って今の環境を変えてみる。
２ 人との出会い、機会との遭遇を大切にする
３ どんなときも明るく前向きに考える
４ 感動する
５ 感謝する
６ 世のため人のためを考えて生きる。 村上先生は次のような話もされました。ある実験のため、ねずみをいじめたのだそうです。いじめられたねずみはストレスでよい遺伝子のスイッチが切れます。しかし、よい遺伝子のスイッチが切れるのはこのいじめられたねずみだけではないのです。それを見ていたネズミたちもよい遺伝子のスイッチが切れるのだそうです。
いじめは 「自分がされるされない」だけでなく「いじめのある場所にいる」だけでその人の能力が十分発揮されなくなるのです。「いじめをしない」だけではなりません。いじめはなくさなければならないのです。
一人一人の力を十分に伸ばすためにもみんなでいじめをなくしていきましょう。

You might remember an Irish company called Steorn : in August 2006 it took out a full page advert in the Economist to announce that it had discovered a source of free energy , a perpetual motion machine no less , in triumphant defiance of that stuffy first law of thermodynamics .
Almost every newspaper gave it lavish coverage in return for this modest expenditure .
Steorn has claimed that its machine is validated by eight independent scientists and engineers " with multiple PhDs from world - class universities " ( although sadly it declined to name them , citing mutually binding non-disclosure agreements ) .
It now also has a panel of 22 scientists on a " jury " recruited from the ad .
I should therefore like to posit the first law of bullshit dynamics : " There is no imaginable proposition so absurd that you cannot find at least one person , somewhere in the world , with a PhD or professional post , who is happy to endorse it . "
As we 've already seen with the long history of perpetual motion claims you only need one or two experts , and as far as the media are concerned , there 's a story .
And when the negative evidence comes in - like this week with Steorn , say - there is a deathly silence .
Shh .
So , on July 4 a scaled down version of Steorn 's technology was to be displayed at the Kinetica museum in Spitalfields , east London , in front of live webcams and blinkered naysayers .
But sadly the doors have remained locked , and the most you can see on the live webcam is an immobile perspex disc - designed to show some special arrangement of magnets - and a statement about technical difficulties possibly caused by " intense heat from the camera lighting " .
I was looking forward to it .
At first the device was supposed to lift a weight , but then Steorn announced that it would simply rotate .
Steorn 's chief executive , Sean McCarthy , said that the company " decided against using the technology to illuminate a light bulb , because the use of wires would attract further suspicion from a scientific community that has denounced the invention as heretical " .
Let 's be clear : this invention is not heretical , it 's just highly improbable ( although I recognise that heresy is an important part of the branding , because even if it's a thermodynamic one , there 's still something attractively transgressive about getting one over on the law .
Very Billy Idol. Very Guns N' Roses . ) .
But in any case I would n't worry about the wire , Sean , because if I see magnets arranged on a perspex disc then I can imagine a simple way to keep a disc spinning , by creating a fluctuating electromagnetic field around it .
And of course , it 's amazing to think that the machine might work , but even more fortuitous is finding a source of unexpected modest and readily contained energy in the universe - like it did with nuclear fission .
Look , I 'm with everyone else in the media , and indeed the world .
I want fish oil pills to solve complex social problems in education .
I want one injection to be a major reversible cause of autism .
I want one invention to solve the world 's energy problems and I want my jetpack .
It 's 2007 for God 's sake .
Give me my jetpack , and give me my x-ray goggles .
This future is rubbish .
· Please send your bad science to bad.science@theguardian.com
For a host of reasons , I do try to limit my travel .
But I also do give talks , and I do do interviews , and this corner of the blog will tell you what 's upcoming .
If you 'd like me to come speak , send me an email at jewishfarmer@gmail.com , and we 'll see if we can work things out .
My Next Talk :
On February 16 at 3 pm , I 'm giving a FREE talk on the basics of food storage - why and how - at my friend Joy 's store , The Olde Corner Store 133 Factory , Gallupville NY 12073 .
518-872-1610 .
All are welcome , and Joy will be offering a discount to anyone who wants to get started in storing bulk foods .
Forbes : “ EMI Group boss Alain Levy said at press conference today that he believed Jobs would introduce multiple price points for iTunes music within the next year . ”
The story they ’re trying to tell you is that “ older , less popular songs could be discounted , and in - demand singles could go for more than a dollar . ”
Let ’s think this through , because I think the recording industry is lying about why they want different prices .
Before I start with that , have you ever noticed that movie theaters charge the same price for all movies , whether they are Steven Spielberg blockbusters or crappy John Travolta religious quackery disguised as science fiction that nobody in their right mind would want to see ?
Theoretically , when a super - duper - blockbuster comes out , like , say , Lord of the Rings , there ’s so much demand that the movie theaters just end up turning people away .
Econ 101 says that they should raise the price on these ultra-popular movies .
As long as the movie is sold out , why not jack up the price and make more money ?
Similarly , when stinkers like Lesbian Gangster Yoga with Ben Affleck come out , the movie theatre is going to be pretty much empty anyway … so Econ 101 says they should lower the price and try to get a few more bucks filling up the theater with price - sensitive moviegoers .
And indeed this is what the recording industry is telling you that they want to do on iTunes .
But they do n’t do it in movie theaters .
Why not ?
The answer is that pricing sends a signal .
People have come to believe that “ you get what you pay for . ”
If you lowered the price of a movie , people would immediately infer from the low price that it ’s a crappy movie and they would n’t go see it .
If you had different prices for movies , the $ 4 movies would have a lot less customers than they get anyway .
The entertainment industry has to maintain a straight face and tell you that Gigli or Battlefield Earth are every bit as valuable as Wedding Crashers or Star Wars or nobody will go see them .
Now , the reason the music recording industry wants different prices has nothing to do with making a premium on the best songs .
What they really want is a system they can manipulate to send signals about what songs are worth , and thus what songs you should buy .
I assure you that when really bad songs come out , as long as they ’re new and the recording industry wants to promote those songs , they ’ll charge the full $ 2.49 or whatever it is to send a fake signal that the songs are better than they really are .
It ’s the same reason we ’ve had to put up with crappy radio for the last few decades : the music industry promotes what they want to promote , whether it ’s good or bad , and the main reason they want to promote something is because that ’s a bargaining chip they can use in their negotiations with artists .
Here ’s the dream world for the EMI Group , Sony / BMG , etc. : there are two prices for songs on iTunes , say , $ 2.49 and $ 0.99 .
All the new releases come out at $ 2.49 .
Some classic rock ( Sweet Home Alabama ) is at $ 2.49 .
Unwanted , old , crap , like , say , Brandy ( You ’re A Fine Girl ) — the crap we only know because it was pushed on us in the 70s by paid - off disk jockeys — would be deliberately priced at $ 0.99 to send a clear message that $ 0.99 = crap .
And now when a musician gets uppity , all the recording industry has to do is threaten to release their next single straight into the $ 0.99 category , which will kill it dead no matter how good it is .
And suddenly the music industry has a lot more leverage over their artists in negotiations : the kind of leverage they are used to having .
Their favorite kind of leverage .
The “ we wo n’t promote your music if you do n’t let us put rootkits on your CDs ” kind of leverage .
And Apple ?
Apple wants the signaling to come from what they promote on the front page of the iTunes Music Store .
In the battle between Apple and the recording industry over who gets to manipulate what songs you buy , Apple ( like movie theaters ) is going to be in favor of fixed prices , while the recording industry is going to want variable prices .

The use of child camel jockeys is now banned in Dubai
The case was dismissed by a court in Miami two months ago , but is now being filed in Kentucky , where Sheikh Hamdan al - Maktoum has business interests .
It accuses the sheikh and many unnamed others of abducting and trafficking up to 10,000 boys from Africa and Asia .
A representative of Sheikh Hamdan has dismissed the lawsuit as baseless .
" Venue - shopping by the plaintiffs ' attorneys wo n't change the fact that this case simply does n't belong in US courts , " Dr Habib al - Mullah said in a statement .
" The lawsuit distracts attention from the truly important efforts by the UAE and Unicef to provide life - changing social services and financial compensation to boys formerly employed as camel jockeys . "
It has been illegal to use children as camel jockeys in the UAE since 1993 , but rigorous enforcement of the law is relatively recent .
' Forced labour '
The lawyers bringing the case said they were acting on behalf of thousands of families from Bangladesh , Pakistan , Mauritania and Sudan .
The slavery and forced labor they actually received will haunt them for the remainder of their lives
Lawsuit filed against Sheikh Hamdan
The lawyers said the boys were obtained through abduction , false inducement or agreement , and then smuggled across international borders by people posing as the boys ' parents .
" Once these individuals arrived in the United Arab Emirates or other countries of the Persian Gulf , they would then sell these boys into slavery to individuals in the camel - racing industry where the boys would , among other forced labour tasks , serve as jockeys , " they alleged in the claim filed to the court .
Sheikh Hamdan 's brother , Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al - Maktoum , the ruler of Dubai , was not named in the lawsuit , unlike in the action dismissed by the federal court in Florida .
The Miami case was dismissed by a judge after she ruled there was not a strong enough tie between Sheikh Hamdan and his businesses in the area .
In Kentucky , however , the Maktoum family has several racing horse stables and substantial business interests .
Introduction : The B - 52 Incident
On August 30 , a B - 52 bomber armed with five nuclear - tipped Advanced Cruise missiles traveled from Minot Air Force base , North Dakota , to Barksdale Air Force base , Louisiana .
Each missile had an adjustable yield between five and 150 kilotons of TNT which is at the lower end of the destructive capacities of U.S. nuclear weapons .
For example , the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima had a yield of 13 kilotons , while the Bravo Hydrogen bomb test of 1954 had a yield of 15,000 kilotons .
The B - 52 story was first covered in the Army Times on September 5 after the nuclear armed aircraft was discovered by Airmen ( see : http://www.armytimes.com/news/2007/09/marine_nuclear_B52_070904w/ ) .
What made this a very significant event was that it was a violation of U.S. Air Force regulations concerning the transportation of nuclear weapons by air .
Nuclear weapons are normally transported by air in specially constructed planes designed to prevent radioactive pollution in case of a crash .
Such transport planes are not equipped to launch the nuclear weapons they routinely carry around the U.S. and the world for servicing or positioning .
The discovery of the nuclear armed B - 52 was , according to Hans Kristensen , a nuclear weapons expert at the Federation of American Scientists , the first time in 40 years that a nuclear armed plane had been allowed to fly in the U.S ( see : http://www.nti.org/d_newswire/issues/2007_9_5.html#149D6ECF
) .
Since 1968 , after a SAC bomber crashed in Greenland , all nuclear armed aircraft have been grounded but were kept on a constant state of alert .
After the end of the Cold War , President George H. Bush ordered in 1991 that nuclear weapons were to be removed from all aircraft and stored in nearby facilities .
Recently , the Air Force began decommissioning its stockpile of Advanced Cruise missiles .
The five nuclear weapons on the B - 52 were to be decommissioned , and were to be taken to another Air Force base .
An Air Force press statement issued on September 6 claimed that there “ was an error which occurred during a regularly scheduled transfer of weapons between two bases . ”
Furthermore , the statement declared : “ The Air Force maintains the highest standards of safety and precision so any deviation from these well established munitions procedures is considered very serious . ”
The issue concerning how a nuclear armed B - 52 bomber was allowed to take off and fly in U.S. air space after an ‘ error ’ in a routine transfer process , is now subject to an official Air Force inquiry which is due to be completed by September 14 .
Three key questions emerge over the B - 52 incident .
First , why did Air Force personnel at Minot AFB not spot the ‘ error ’ earlier given the elaborate security procedures in place to prevent such mistakes from occurring ?
Many military analysts have commented on the stringent security procedures in place to prevent this sort of mistake from occurring .
Multiple officers are routinely involved in the transportation and loading of nuclear weapons to prevent the kind of ‘ error ’ that allegedly occurred in the B - 52 incident .
According to the Air Force statement , the commanding officer in charge of military munitions personnel and additional munitions airmen were relieved of duties pending the completion of the investigation .
According to Kristensen , the error could not have come from confusing the Advanced Cruise Missile with a conventional weapons since no conventional form exists .
So the munitions Airmen should have been easily able to spot the mistake .
Other routine procedures were violated which suggests a rather obvious explanation for the error .
The military munitions personnel were acting under direct orders , though not through the regular chain of military command .
This takes me to the second question
Who was in Charge of the B - 52 Incident ?
Who ordered the loading of Advanced Cruise missiles on to a B - 52 in violation of Air Force regulations ?
The quick reaction of the Air Force and the issuing of a public statement describing the seriousness of the issue and the launch of an immediate investigation , suggests that whatever occurred , was outside the regular chain of military command .
If the regular chain of command was violated , then we have to inquire as to whether the B - 52 incident was part of a covert project whose classification level exceeded that held by officers in charge of nuclear weapons at Minot AFB .
The most obvious governmental entity that may have ordered the nuclear arming of the B - 52 outside the regular chain of military command is the last remaining bastion of neo-conservative activism in the Bush administration .
Vice President Cheney has taken a very prominent role in covert military operations and training exercises designed for the “ seamless integration ” of different national security and military authorities to possible terrorist attacks .
On May 8 , 2001 , President Bush placed Cheney in charge of " [ A ]ll federal programs dealing with weapons of mass destruction , consequence management within the Departments of Defense , Health and Human Services , Justice , and Energy , the Environmental Protection Agency , and other federal agencies " ( see : http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/011805_simplify_case.shtml) .
Cheney subsequently played a direct role in supervising training exercises that simultaneously occurred during the 911 attacks .
According to former Los Angeles Police Officer Michael Ruppert , Cheney had a parallel chain of command that he used to override Air Force objections to stand down orders that grounded the USAF during the 911 attacks ( see : http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/011805_simplify_case.shtml ) .
Ruppert learned that the Secret Service had the authority to directly communicate presidential and vice presidential orders to fighter pilots in the air thereby circumventing the normal chain of command .
( Crossing the Rubicon , pp. 428 – 429 ) .
Furthermore : “ It is the Secret Service who has the legal mandate to take supreme command in case of a scheduled major event - or an unplanned major emergency - on American soil ; these are designated " National Special Security Events " . ”
http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/011805_simplify_case.shtml .
Ruppert and others have subsequently claimed that 911 was an “ inside job ; ” and Cheney through the Secret Service , played a direct leadership role in what occurred over 911 .
Consequently , it is very possible that Cheney played a similar role in circumventing the regular chain of military command in ordering the B - 52 incident .
It is likely that the B - 52 incident was part of a contrived " National Special Security Event " directly controlled by Cheney by virtue of the authority granted to him by President Bush , and through the Secret Service which has the technological means to by pass the regular chain of military command .
I now move to my third key question .
Why was the nuclear armed B - 52 sent to Barksdale AFB ?
If initial reports that the weapons were being decommissioned , but were mistakenly transported by a B - 52 bomber , then the weapons should have been taken to Kirtland Air Force Base .
According to Kristensen , this is “ where the warheads are separated from the rest of the weapon and shipped to the Energy Department ’s Pantex dismantlement facility near Amarillo , Texas ” ( see : http://www.nti.org/d_newswire/issues/2007_9_5.html#149D6ECF
) .
However , it has been revealed that Barksdale AFB is used as a staging base for operations in the Middle East ( see : http://tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2007/sep/05/staging_nuke_for_iran ) .
This is circumstantial evidence that the weapons were being deployed for possible use in the Middle East .
There has been recent speculation concerning a possible attack against Iran given reports that the Pentagon has completed plans for a three day bombing blitz of Iran according to a Sunday Times report ( see : http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2369001.ece ) .
The Report claims that 1200 targets have been selected and this will destroy much of Iran ’s military infrastructure .
Such an attack will devastate Iran ’s economy , create greater political instability in the region , and stop the oil supply .
A disruption of the oil supply from the Persian Gulf could trigger a global economic recession and lead to the collapse of financial markets .
In a synchronistic development , there have been reports of billion dollar investments in high risk stock options in both Europe and the U.S. that would only be profitable if a dramatic collapse of the stock market were to occur before September 21 .
Similar stock options were purchased weeks before the 911 attack in 2001 , and investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for possible insider trading .
The combination of the Sunday Times report and the Stock market option purchases is circumstantial evidence that plans for a concerted military attack against Iran have been secretly approved and covert operations have begun ( see : http://exopolitics.org/Exo-Comment-57.htm ) .
Seymour Hersh in May 2006 reported the opposition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the use of nuclear weapons against Iran .
In late April , the military leadership , headed by General Pace , achieved a major victory when the White House dropped its insistence that the plan for a bombing campaign include the possible use of a nuclear device to destroy Iran 's uranium - enrichment plant at Natanz , nearly two hundred miles south of Tehran . ….
" Bush and Cheney were dead serious about the nuclear planning , " the former senior intelligence official told me .
" And Pace stood up to them .
Then the world came back : ' O.K. , the nuclear option is politically unacceptable . '
http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/07/10/060710fa_fact .
Given earlier opposition by the Joint Chiefs of Staff , it is likely that the present attack plans for Iraq drawn up by the Pentagon do n’t involve the use of nuclear weapons .
In order to circumvent the regular chain of command , opposed to a nuclear attack , it is very likely that Vice President Cheney contrived a “ National Special Security Event ” that involved a nuclear armed B - 52 .
This would have given him the legal authority to place orders directly through the Secret Service to the Air Force officers responsible for the B - 52 incident .

Non-economists are often baffled by the disagreements among professional economists on the issues of the day -- from international trade to the minimum wage , from economic development to health policy .
I think the best way to understand the source of these disagreements is to recognize that there are two genres of economists .
I call them " first - best economists " and " second - best economists . "
Here is my guide to them .
You can tell what kind of an economist someone is by the nature of the response s/he offers when confronted with a policy issue .
The gut instinct of the members of the first group is to apply a simple supply - demand framework to the question at hand .
In this world , every tax has an economic deadweight loss , every restriction on individual behavior reduces the size of the economic pie , distribution and efficiency can be neatly separated , market failures are presumed non-existent unless proved otherwise ( and to be addressed only by the appropriate Pigovian tax or subsidy ) , people are rational and forward - looking to the first order of approximation , demand curves always slope down ( and supply curves up ) , and general - equilibrium interactions do not overturn partial - equilibrium logic .
The First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics is proof that unfettered markets work best .
No matter how technical , complex , and full of surprises these economists ' own research might be , their take on the issues of the day are driven by a straightforward , almost knee - jerk logic .
Those in the second group are inclined to see all kinds of complications , which make the textbook answers inappropriate .
In their world , the economy is full of market imperfections ( going well beyond environmental spillovers ) , distribution and efficiency cannot be neatly separated , people do not always behave rationally and they over - discount the future , some otherwise undesirable policy interventions can generate positive outcomes , and general - equilibrium complications render partial - equilibrium reasoning suspect .
The First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics is proof , in view of its long list of prerequisites , that market outcome can be improved by well - designed interventions .
Since they have given up on the textbook model , members of this group have an almost - infinite variety of " models " to choose from as they think of public - policy issues .
The first group 's instinct is always to apply the first - best reasoning to the case , ignoring market imperfections in related markets , while the second group almost always presumes some market imperfections in the system .
I am over - simplifying a bit , but not a whole lot .
Among commentators in the blogosphere , I think Gary Becker , Tyler Cowen , Greg Mankiw , and Brad De Long ( more often than not ) are first - best economists .
In is commentary on globalization , Jagdish Bhagwati is an unadulterated first - best economist , even though his best scholarly work is solidly cast in the second - best mold .
Meanwhile , the undisputed king of second - best economists is Joe Stiglitz .
He is joined by George Akerlof , Bob Shiller , Alan Blinder ( recently ) and Paul Krugman ( especially when he writes on deregulation and health policy , and increasingly , but not always , on trade ) .
I am definitely in the second - best camp as well .
When first - best economists are taken to task for ignoring real world complications -- i.e. , second - best interactions -- they provide a range of answers .
One is to downplay the significance of these issues by arguing that they are not convinced of the presence of the market imperfections in question .
Sure enough , empirical evidence is hardly ever strong enough to move prevailing priors .
A second argument is that the presence of additional market imperfections does not change the first - best logic ; it simply calls for each market imperfection to be treated with its own first - best solution .
This allows each expert in a field to propose first - best solutions in that field , leaving complications elsewhere to be dealt with by others .
Larry Summers had a nice point to make about this approach in his comments on a paper on banking reform in China ( Brookings Papers on Economic Activity , 2006:2 ) :
Like experts in many fields who give policy advice , the authors show a preference for first - best , textbook approaches to the problems in their field , while leaving other messy objectives acknowledged but assigned to others .
In this way , they are much like those public finance economists who oppose tax expenditures on principle , because they prefer direct expenditure programs , but do not really analyze the various difficulties with such programs ; or like trade economists who know that the losers from trade surges need to be protected but regard this as not a problem for trade policy .
( Come to think of it , is Larry Summers a first - best economist or a second - best economist ? )
A third argument is that the government could never get complicated interventions right , so we are better off sticking with simple solutions .
I have discussed this type of argument in an earlier post .
So at the end of the day , these disagreements are often grounded not in economics per se , but in strongly held prior views about the world in which we live in .
Which is why non-economists are right to get exasperated with us .
UPDATE : Bill C. reminds us that Keynes had some very apt things to say in his General Theory on this very same distinction .
His fight at the time was with the Classicals .
Here is Keynes , via Bill C. :
The completeness of the Ricardian victory is something of a curiosity and a mystery .
It must have been due to a complex of suitabilities in the doctrine to the environment into which it was projected .
That it reached conclusions quite different from what the ordinary uninstructed person would expect , added , I suppose , to its intellectual prestige .
That its teaching , translated into practice , was austere and often unpalatable , lent it virtue .
That it was adapted to carry a vast and consistent logical superstructure , gave it beauty .
That it could explain much social injustice and apparent cruelty as an inevitable incident in the scheme of progress , and the attempt to change such things as likely on the whole to do more harm than good , commended it to authority .
That it afforded a measure of justification to the free activities of the individual capitalist , attracted to it the support of the dominant social force behind authority .
As usual , Keynes puts it best .
UPDATE2 : The link in the following paragraph was incorrect ; I have now corrected it :
A third argument is that the government could never get complicated interventions right , so we are better off sticking with simple solutions .
I have discussed this type of argument in an earlier post .
It is highly relevant to Tyler Cowen 's response .

Washington – The Bush administration and China have both undermined efforts to tighten rules designed to ensure that lead paint is n’t used in toys , bibs , jewelry and other children ’s products .
Both have fought efforts to better police imported toys from China .
Now , both are under increased scrutiny after last week ’s massive toy recall by Mattel Inc. , the world ’s largest toymaker .
The recalls follow several other lead - paint - related scares since June that have affected products featuring Sesame Street characters , Thom as the Train and Dora the Explorer .
Lead paint is toxic when ingested by children and can cause brain damage or death .
It has been mostly banned in the United States since the late 1970s but is permitted in the coating of toys , providing it amounts to less than six parts per million .
The Bush administration has hindered regulation on two fronts , consumer advocates say .
It stalled efforts to press for greater inspections of imported children ’s products , and it altered the focus of the Consumer Product Safety Commission , moving it from protections for consumers to a more manufacturer - friendly approach .
“ The overall philosophy ( of the administration ) is regulations are bad , and they are too large a cost for industry , and the market will take care of it , ” said Rick Melberth , director of regulatory policy at OMBWatch , a government watchdog group formed in 1983 .
Today , more than 80 percent of all U.S. toys are made in China ; few get inspected .
“ We ’ve been complaining about this issue , warning it is going to happen , and it is disappointing that it has happened , ” said Tom Neltner , co-chairman of the Sierra Club ’s national toxics committee .
President Bush has asked the Department of Health and Human Services to report next month on ways to better ensure safe imports .
He also has asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to consider responses to lead - paint threats to children .
But as recently as December , the Sierra Club sued the Bush administration after the Environmental Protection Agency rebuffed a petition to require health - and - safety studies for companies that use lead in children ’s products .
The EPA and Sierra Club settled out of court in April , with the administration agreeing to write a letter to the CPSC that expressed concern about insufficient quality control on products containing lead .
From 1994 until 2001 , Ann Brown headed the CPSC under Presidents Clinton and Bush .
She did n’t push for a ban on lead in all children ’s products , partly because China ’s rise to export prowess had n’t yet unfolded .
“ Today , I would say there should be an outright ban on any lead in any toy product , ” Brown , who ’s working with Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s presidential campaign , said in an interview .

This is the original image with a roof spoiling the view ...
Research teams have developed an algorithm that uses sites like Flickr to help discover light sources , camera position and composition in a photo .
Using this data the tools then search for objects , such as landscapes or cars , that match the original .
The teams aim to create image libraries that anyone can use to edit snaps .
Stage one :
The roof is isolated and the algorithm searches for similar scenes
James Hays and Alexei Efros from Carnegie Mellon University have developed an algorithm to help people who want to remove bits of photographs .
The parts being removed could be unsightly lorries in the snaps of the rural idyll where they took a holiday or even an old boyfriend or girlfriend they want to rub out from a photograph .
To find suitable matching elements , the research duo's algorithm looks through a database of 2.3 million images culled from Flickr .
" We search for other scenes that share as closely as possible the same semantic scene data , " said Mr Hays , who has been showing off the project at the computer graphics conference Siggraph , in San Diego .
In this sense " semantic " means composition .
So a snap of a lake in the foreground , hills in a band in the middle and sunset above has , as far as the algorithm is concerned , very different " semantics " to one of a city with a river running through it .
Stage two :
It compares photos online to find a matching scene
The broad - based analysis cuts out more than 99.9 % of the images in the database , said Mr Hays .
The algorithm then picks the closest 200 for further analysis .
Next the algorithm searches the 200 to see if they have elements , such as hillsides or even buildings , the right size and colours for the hole to be filled .
The useful parts of the 20 best scenes are then cropped , added to the image being edited so the best fit can be chosen .
Early tests of the algorithm show that only 30 % of the images altered with it could be spotted , said Mr Hays .
The other approach aims to use net - based image libraries to create a clip - art of objects that , once inserted into a photograph , look convincing .
Stage three :
The finished picture has the roof removed and boats in a bay added
" We want to generate objects of high realism while keeping the ease of use of a clip art library , " said Jean - Francois Lalonde of Carnegie Mellon University who led the research .
To generate its clip art for photographs the team has drawn on the net 's Label Me library of images which has many objects , such as people , trees and cars , cut out and tagged by its users .
The challenge , said Mr Lalonde , was working out which images in the Label Me database will be useful and convincing when inserted into photographs .
The algorithm developed by Mr Lalonde and his colleagues at Carnegie Mellon and Microsoft Research analyses scenes to find out the orientation of objects and the sources of light in a scene .
" We use the height of the people in the image to estimate the height of the camera used to take the picture , " he said .
The light sources in a scene are worked out by looking at the distribution of colour shades within three broad regions , ground , vertical planes and sky , in the image .
With knowledge about the position , pitch and height of the camera and light sources the algorithm then looks for images in the clip art database that were taken from similar positions and with similar pixel heights .
The group has created an interface for the database of photo clipart so people can pick which elements they want to add to a scene .

Prices for key foods are rising sharply
By Kevin G. Hall
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its June inflation report that egg prices are 19.5 percent higher than they were in June 2006 .
Over the same period , according to the department ’s consumer price index , whole milk was up 13.3 percent ; fresh chicken 10 percent ; navel oranges 19.8 percent ; apples 11.7 percent .
Dried beans were up 11.5 percent , and white bread just missed double - digit growth , rising by 9.6 percent .
These numbers get lost in the broader inflation rate for all goods and services , which measured 2.7 for the same 12 - month period .
Across the economy , rising food prices were offset by falling prices for things bought at the mall : computers , cameras , clothing and shoes .
Yeah , good thing poor folk are buying computers and cameras to offset the discounted value of their disposable income by the rising cost of basic food .
Oh wait , they do n't .
In Bush 's fine tradition of looting the middle and lower class , once again we pay more to live day to day so the Riches can get a deal on a Dell .
Of course , this is Bush 's America , so it gets worse .
To make more milk , or raise more chickens that lay more eggs , farmers need feed corn and other feed products .
But corn prices have soared over the past year as Congress pushes ethanol , a renewable fuel made from corn .
Fields that previously grew soybeans are now yielding corn , and that ’s driven up the price of soybeans as they become scarce .
Iowa State University ’s Center for Agricultural and Rural Development shocked the farm sector earlier this summer with a report that corn farmers are expected to lock in prices of $ 4 a bushel through 2010 , about double what corn fetched two years ago .
Brilliant !
$ 4 a bushel for corn !
Sure hope the poor folk can live off the fumes of the ethanol - powered SUV the Riches are driving , and got from yet another Bush tax break .
The sheer insanity of Bush 's welfare system for the Riches are leading us to a recession , the offshoring of our jobs are leading to slow - to - no output growth of hard products , and the shaky dollar is leading to a recession .
Not to mention Bush has borrowed more money than the first 42 presidents combined , creating a huge government debt that makes increasing the money supply by purchasing government debt an investment some are starting to shy away from .
Like say China .
And if the price of basic goods and services rise , while we head into a Bush economic policy invoked recession , we are headed to one of the most dreaded lands in economic theory :
Stagflation .
But not because government regulation caused a failure in the market , but because the Bush Administration used the government to loot the lower and middle class and in a transfer of wealth to the riches in a gross mishandling of the allocation of goods and services .
He took from the many and gave to the few , but that was the plan all together .
To cause a special situation called differential accumulation , the playground of the " weapondollar - petrodollar coalition . "
This is when the big boys of capitalism use stagflation to beat the average on return on investment .
But here Bush and the Gang of the Haves really took it up a notch , instead of completing mergers and acquisitions during times of " peace " , they are using this system to accumulate wealth at disaggregate levels in a self - created Mid-east crisis with high oil prices .
It really is a work of economic art , pure evil , but still beautiful in its own way .
Of course , differential accumulation causes huge strife in the stratas of society , since the have - nots have to be looted to complete cycle of returns for the Riches .
But who is gonna stop them ?
That is the real question for 2008 .
Someone needs to , otherwise we wo n’t even be able to afford the egg on our collective faces .

Is this Turing machine universal , or not ?
A universal Turing machine is powerful enough to emulate any standard computer .
The question is : how simple can the rules for a universal Turing machine be ?
Since the 1960s it has been known that there is a universal 7,4 machine .
In A New Kind of Science , Stephen Wolfram found a universal 2,5 machine , and suggested that the particular 2,3 machine that is the subject of this prize might be universal .
The prize is for determining whether or not the 2,3 machine is in fact universal .

Pros and cons of laser combs for thinning hair treatment
Over the past decade , forehead and eyebrow rejuvenation surgery are different significantly .
The eyebrow lift , an activity once considered traumatic and invasive , fraught with lengthy postoperative rehabilitation , and burdened with complications objectionable for the aesthetic patient ( hair loss , anesthesia , scars , etc. ) , has turned into a welcomed medical procedure to both the surgeon and patient .
This has occurred as a result of the creation of the endoscopic technique of eyebrow lifting .
As with brand new surgical procedures , a period of trial and error , plus a steep learning curve , is inherent for the development and improvement of the technique .
This has been remarkably true with the endoscopic brow lift , since several cosmetic surgeons , regardless of their unique background and specialty training , were n’t knowledgeable about this technology when the procedure first emerged .
As in the creation of new technology , perseverance , efforts , and diligent study and observation will eventually define the significance , worthwhileness , and feasibility of this new technique .
This paradigm has held true with endoscopic brow lifting .
Contemporary surgeons that routinely perform the method have found that it must be an integral part of their surgical armamentarium that has revolutionized , modernized and simplifiedeyebrowliftingsurgery .

Genetic Patterns of Hair Growth : The Genetics of Alopecia
Though baldness is pretty standard , it can be a terrible thing to call home with , mainly when it changes your physical appearance .
Today , there are many solutions for guys experiencing baldness .
Hair loss in a long haul results in true of baldness called as Alopecia , medical terminology for losing hair due to various reasons .
Hair loss could be of numerous types changeable from person to a new bringing about spot baldness that is an age - old problem .
Alopecia , also called baldness , affects an estimated 35 million American men .
It can be categorized into two kinds , namely Alopecia Areata and Androgenetic Alopecia .
You can find out more here at hairline ink .
Alopecia areata is brought on by an abnormal response with the defense mechanisms , attacking the hair follicles and causing hair to fall in patches everywhere in the body .
On the other hand , androgenic - alopecia can be an inherited way of baldness where genetics plays a huge role .
This article will focus more on the latter kind of hair thinning , where the hair inside head thins out , and the hair thinning is permanent .
It can affect both males and females , but 60 % in the cases affect men .
The organs in the body produce several types of chemicals including hormones , enzymes , and also other vital substances .
Abnormalities of such chemicals could mean damage or perhaps a challenge with organ function .
Running a liver panel can reveal chemical imbalances which might detect liver damage because of toxins , hepatitis , or cirrhosis .
The advantage of running these tests is because they are non-invasive .
A doctor can exclude certain conditions without the need for surgery or other surgical procedure .
To get to the genetic roots of baldness , Regina Betz from the University of Bonn analyzed blood samples from 11 individuals a Saudi Arabian family .
This family inherited Hypotrichosis simplex .
Hypotrichosis can be a relatively common feature of an amount of complex hereditary syndromes .
However , the isolated variant , called hereditary hypotrichosis simplex ( HHS ) is particularly uncommon .
It affects less than one in 200 000 people and causes hair loss from a young age .

Learning how hair grows is vital to understanding how hair loss occurs and what can be done to treat it .
Wool is manufactured from keratin that ’s stated in the papilla which is located inside hair follicle underneath the skin .
The part of your hair that rises out of your follicle or even the visible part of tresses are referred to as shaft .
Hair growth is caused by actively dividing cells within the follicle .
As a result hair growth takes a healthy scalp and good the circulation of blood towards the follicle .
Genetic hair loss occurs because of the shortening of the hair ’s growth cycle , therefore makes all the hair thinner and shorter , plus a time comes once the growth stalls completely .
It is also accountable for developing thinning hair and interacts with the follicles of hair .
The hereditary baldness includes a very predictable pattern , which is often followed from one generation to another to predict by seeing your father and the father the way you should go .
By the time men reach fifty years of age 50 % from the men become bald .
In case of men thinning hair usually occurs about the crown or top from the head applying a receding hairline and leaving healthy hair on the back and sides from the head .
Several scientific studies conducted on the genetic inheritance of male patterned baldness demonstrate that this condition is androgen dependent .
If you want to know more about this you can visit hairline ink .
This disorder is hereditary and customarily follows the genetic inheritance pattern of your autosomal dominant trait .
Defects within the AR gene are connected with continuing development of male patterned baldness .
Mutations in the AR gene are related to higher risk having of patterned baldness that faces men .
The modifications or changes in the AR gene are generated by tiny variations within the number base pairs which in the gene .
Such genetic alterations are routine that face men who learn to have baldness in their early teens .
Research has shown that mutations in the AR gene are responsible for higher amounts of activated androgen receptors on the scalp .
It has been established that male patterned baldness is associated with the impact androgens have on the rate of hair regrowth , but there is still little information entirely on why alteration in the AR gene results in the upper chances of patterned baldness that face men who develop this issue .

Scalp Micro Pigmentation – Hue Changes Into Blue , Purple or anything Else ?
While many accept medical and non-medical strategies to combating hair loss and baldness , you may still find people who feel that surgery is the simplest way to go .
We can point out that this method from HairlineInk is very advisable for severe cases of baldness .
But some notice as the preventive intervention to prevent further hair loss in the future .
Many opt for surgery alone while some opt for surgery and medication to assist after that .
Here are some medicine strategies to hair replacement .
Seborrheic dermatitis or seborrhea is surely an inflammatory condition that may customize the face , chest , and scalp .
It causes red , itchy skin that will become sore because of constant scratching .
It is also seen as persistent dandruff , viewed as yellow or white flakes on the scalp and hair .
Seborrhea can be controlled with proper hygiene , use of antifungal agents , and topical steroids .
However , it features a tendency to recur .
With chronic seborrheic dermatitis , the scalp and follicles can be damaged , resulting in baldness .
Despite the numerous available alternatives to avoid falling hair , most of these products do not offer good results .
In most cases , people believe that it is hard to develop more hair rather than maintaining the current hair .
The market now offers numerous medications for such condition , however the most reliable choices hair surgical procedures or hair replacement surgery .
Unfortunately , this is n’t a reasonable option , particularly for ordinary individuals .
The good news is that is only a one - time investment that lasts longer .
Ringworm in the scalp presents with scaly skin the location where the hair was once ; it ’s as though your skin layer could flake off .
This requires diagnosis and a prescription for proper medication from your physician .
Once the ringworm is treated , the hair will re-grow .
There is an oral medication for it and also a shampoo .
Hormonal Changes .
Hair loss can often be attributed to a by - product with the hormone testosterone called as DHT .
Men and females have both testosterone and estrogen although humankind has more testosterone and ladies convey more estrogen .

The goddess Kali
On a well - worn road through central India , Lieutenant Subhani of the Bengal Native Infantry and his three traveling companions were nearing the final leg of their journey .
Ordinarily the Lieutenant would have only his pair of loyal orderlies to keep him company as he traveled , but today a third man walked alongside his horse⁠⁠ — a stranger who had joined him only that morning .
The year was 1812 , and the pleasant October weather made for an easy trek .
Subhani knew these roads could be dangerous for travelers , especially at this time of year , but he was untroubled .
Trained soldiers and well - armed , he and his men were an unlikely target for roving bandits .
But a much greater threat loomed over them on that dusty road , closer at hand than the travelers could have possibly conceived .
Accounts of a secret cult of murderers roaming India go back at least as far as the 13th century , but to modern history their story usually begins with the entrance of the British Empire in the early 1800s .
For some years , India ’s British administrators had been hearing reports of large numbers of travelers disappearing on the country ’s roads ; but , while disturbing , such incidents were not entirely unusual for the time .
It was not until the discovery of a series of eerily similar mass graves across India that the truth began to dawn .
Each site was piled with the bodies of individuals ritually murdered and buried in the same meticulous fashion , leading to an inescapable conclusion : these killings were the work of a single , nation - spanning organization .
It was known as Thuggee .
At its root , the word “ Thuggee ” means “ deceivers , ” and this name hints at the methods employed by the cult .
Bands of
Thugs traveled across the country posing as pilgrims , merchants , soldiers , or even royalty , in groups numbering anywhere from a few men to several hundred .
Offering protection or company , they would befriend fellow travelers and slowly build their confidence along the road .
Often the impostors would journey for days and hundreds of miles with their intended victims , patiently waiting for an opportunity to strike .
When the time was right , typically while their targets were encamped and at their most relaxed , a signal would be given⁠⁠ — reportedly “ Bring the tobacco ” ⁠⁠ — and the Thugs would spring .
Each member had a well - honed specialty ; some distracted their quarry , some made noise or music to mask any cries , while others guarded the campsite from intruders and escapees .
Thugs of the highest rank performed the actual killings .
As a prohibition against shedding blood was at the core of Thuggee belief , the murders were performed in a bloodless fashion .
The usual method was strangulation with a rumal , the yellow silk handkerchief each thug wore tied around his waist ; but an occasional neck - breaking or poisoning helped to add some variety .
It was a matter of honor for the Thugs to let no one escape alive once they had been selected for death .
Lieutenant Subhani and his orderlies had spent the previous night as guests at the home of Ishwardas Moti , a prestigious cotton merchant and local official .
There he had been introduced to another of Moti ’s guests , the man who was traveling with him now .
Moklal was his name⁠⁠ — a business associate of Moti’s , he was told , and one he had spoken of most highly .
“ Narsinghpur ! ” Moti had exclaimed upon hearing the Lieutenant ’s destination , “ What a fortunate coincidence !
Moklal is traveling that way as well .
Perhaps you could go with him for the extra protection ? ”
Subhani , though reluctant to take on a civilian traveling companion , did not wish to offend his host⁠⁠ — and at any rate , Moklal seemed amiable enough .
He agreed .
For the members of Thuggee , murder was both a way of life and a religious duty .
They believed their killings were a means of worshiping the Hindu goddess Kali , who was honored at each stage of the murder by a vast and complex system of rituals and superstitions .
Thugs were guided to their victims by omens observed in nature , and once the deed was done , the graves and bodies were prepared according to strict ceremonies .
A sacrificial rite would be conducted after the burial involving the consecration of sugar and of the sacred pickax , the tool the brotherhood believed was given to them by Kali to dig the graves of their prey .
Thugs were certainly not above robbing their victims , but traditionally a portion of the spoils would be set aside for the goddess .
Kali , despite her fearsome appearance , is not an evil deity .
For more mainstream Hindus , she is a goddess of time and transformation who can impart understanding of life , death , and creation .
To the members of the Thuggee cult , she was something else entirely .
Their Kali craved human blood , and demanded endless sacrifice to satisfy her hunger .
According to Thuggee legend , Kali once battled a terrible demon which roamed the land , devouring humans as fast as they were created .
But every drop of the monster ’s blood that touched the ground spawned a new demon , until the exhausted Kali finally created two human men , armed with rumals , and instructed them to strangle the demons .
When their work was finished , Kali instructed them to keep the rumals in their family and use them to destroy every man not of their kindred .
This was the tale told to Thuggee initiates .
All
Thugs were male , and membership in the cult was hereditary apart from a few outsiders allowed to join voluntarily and some young boys captured in raids .
Around their tenth birthday , the sons of Thugs would be invited to witness their first murder , but only from a distance .
Gradually over the years they could strive to achieve the rank of bhuttote , or strangler .
Thuggee membership was for life , all the way up to the elderly
Thugs who still did what they could for the group as cooks or spies⁠⁠ — yet the wives and daughters of these men might never know the truth about the male members of their family .
Their extreme secrecy combined with their mastery of murder made the Thugs the deadliest secret society in all of history .
In the early 19th century they were credited with 40,000 deaths annually , stretching back as far as anyone cared to count .
Some estimates put the overall death toll as high as 2,000,000 , but with the cult potentially operating for more than 500 years before formal records were kept , the true number is impossible to determine .
Even as the evidence began to mount , most members of India ’s British - run government remained dismissive of claims that a secret cult of murderers was terrorizing the countryside .
It would be the efforts of a single soldier that would eventually turn this apathy around .
After nearly a day ’s travel with his new companion , Lieutenant Subhani did not regret allowing Moklal to join him .
The man was talkative and well - educated , and his conversation seemed to shorten the long journey considerably .
As dusk approached , Moklal explained that his destination , a wayside grove where he planned to spend the night , was just ahead .
“ There I am meeting my friends .
Please , stay with us tonight , and let me repay you the courtesy of escorting me today . ”
Subhani , tired from the day ’s journey and already beginning to think of where he and his men might make camp , agreed .
A fire was burning by the time they reached the campsite , while around it an animated group of men were gathered .
A flurry of introductions went around⁠⁠ — many of these men were business associates of Moklal , it was learned , while others were family ⁠⁠ — and soon Subhani and his orderlies felt like part of the group , eating and laughing with the men .
William Henry Sleeman
Sir William Henry Sleeman was a sober , no - nonsense Bengal Army officer who from early on dedicated his career to the eradication of Thuggee .
Faced with a wall of disbelief and indifference from his superiors , he transferred to the Civil Service where he could gain enough authority to wage his war personally .
As a district magistrate by the 1820s , he gathered a force of Indian policemen under him and set to rooting out the cult with a variety of innovative policing methods .
By examining common attack sites and listening for reports of suspicious figures , Sleeman and his men formulated predictions of where the next large attack was likely to occur .
They would then turn the Thugs ’ own methods against them⁠⁠— disguised as merchants , the officers would wait at the chosen site for a group of Thugs to approach , and ambush them .
Information obtained from the prisoners was used to plan the next strike .
But Sleeman ’s job would not be easy , as one of the Thuggee cult ’s defining characteristics was its pervasiveness within Indian society .
In an era where strict caste divisions dominated every aspect of life , Thuggee was unique for transcending all such social barriers .
Anyone from a farmer to an aristocrat could be a Thug .
Many were even Muslims who , in a truly inspiring feat of rationalization , managed to reconcile their practice of human sacrifice to a goddess with their religion ’s strict ban on idolatry and murder .
When members of the brotherhood were not terrorizing travelers , they lived as normal⁠⁠ — often upstanding ⁠⁠— citizens , with ordinary social lives and occupations .
It was impossible to know who might be with the Thugs , even among one ’s closest friends .
What was more bizarre , and endlessly frustrating for Sleeman , was the level of protection the Thugs seemed to enjoy within India .
Though they clearly had the country living in fear , a strange ambivalence toward the cult existed .
Local police and officials turned a blind eye to reports of Thug activities , while peasants would simply work around the bodies that occasionally appeared in their fields and wells .
Landowners and Indian princes often explicitly shielded known
Thugs , to the point that they would sometimes violently clash with British soldiers on the hunt .
The reasons for this strange reaction to the cult are varied and complex .
In the case of the lower - ranked members of society , it most often may have simply been out of fear or superstition ; it was believed by some that the goddess Kali would take revenge on those who interfered with her followers .
The rich and powerful , for their part , may have had some vested interest in Thug activity : bribery , perhaps , or they may simply have been charmed by master con artists .
Some poor villages accepted the murder and robbery of rich travelers as simply a way of bringing wealth into the region⁠⁠ — for many , Thugging was apparently viewed as a regular tax - paying profession , as noble as any other .
Whatever the cause , it meant that Sleeman ’s men were more often than not met with silence as they probed residents for information .
But a few factors were in Sleeman ’s favor .
First , the Thugs ’ beliefs forbade them from killing certain groups , including women , fakirs , musicians , lepers⁠⁠ — and Europeans .
Thuggee was thus unable to retaliate against its English persecutors even when it had the opportunity .
Second , once captured , most
Thugs cooperated with authorities willingly ⁠⁠— one might even say gleefully .
Staunch fatalists , the imprisoned Thugs believed their situation was the result of their displeasing the goddess .
They therefore showed little remorse in turning in their brothers , believing that anything that happened to them would be the will of Kali .
Some suspect that Thuggee prisoners even deliberately accused innocent men ; unable to strangle in person during their incarceration , sending men to the gallows was a convenient way of keeping up their obligation to Kali .
As for those condemned to die , it is said that each went to his death with no trace of emotion , often requesting only that he be allowed to place the noose around his own neck .
With informants pouring in at an ever - increasing rate , Sleeman ’s campaign against the Thugs gained ground beyond anyone ’s expectations .
Within a few years the cult was crippled , and by the end of the 19th century the British declared Thuggee extinct .
Sleeman was hailed as a hero by most of India , and in many parts of the country he is still revered .
But there are those who have wondered if the British were too quick to congratulate themselves .
It is difficult for some to imagine how a secret fraternity that had survived for centuries and engrained itself into every facet of Indian society could have been eliminated in so short a time .
Certainly , the mass killings are a distant memory , and India no longer lives in fear of its shadow .
But in some remote areas , rumors still linger about the yellow - sashed strangers who welcome travelers with open arms and a friendly smile .
It was dark when Subhani and his new friends had finished eating .
For a time they sat in comfortable silence , with only an occasional quiet exchange passing between men seated across the fire next to one another .
But no one had yet turned in for sleep .
Moklal turned from the fire to Subhani .
“ Perhaps a smoke before bed ? ” he offered .
The Lieutenant nodded gratefully .
Moklal smiled , then looked up at someone apparently standing behind Subhani .
“ Bring the tobacco . ”


The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to hear a challenge to Indiana 's voter identification law , setting up a confrontation between officials who claim such laws prevent voter fraud and challengers who say ID requirements unfairly block some people from voting .
The case is to be argued in early 2008 , and a decision is likely by June , in time for the presidential election in November .
The Indiana law requires voters to show a government photo ID , such as a driver 's license or passport .
In January , a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit rejected claims by the state Democratic Party and civil rights groups that the law infringes on the voting rights of people without easy access to such IDs , particularly the poor and minorities .
MORE HIGH COURT : Lethal injection on the docket Judge Richard Posner , writing for the majority in the 7th Circuit , said the law was a valid attempt to control fraud .
He acknowledged that people who do not have photo IDs are " low on the economic ladder " and " more likely to vote for Democratic than Republican candidates . "
Judge Terrence Evans dissented , calling the law a " not - too - thinly - veiled attempt to discourage Election Day turnout by certain folks believed to skew Democratic . "
Richard Hasen , a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles , said a ruling in the dispute could resolve difficult election - law issues .
" Voter ID laws have been mired in partisan politics , and the court can now clarify how to balance concerns over voter fraud with potential disenfranchisement of poor voters , " he said .
Lawyer William Groth , representing the Indiana Democratic Party , said the 7th Circuit applied too lenient a constitutional standard to the law and failed to account for its burden on voter rights .
He said Indiana 's law is " the most onerous in effect in the nation . "
" There 's no right more important than the right to vote , " said Ken Falk of the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana .
" If recent history teaches us anything , it 's that each vote matters . "
Voter ID requirements are a relatively new phenomenon , spawned partly by allegations of fraud raised during the election in 2000 .
Since 2002 , a majority of states have adopted voter ID regulations .
Indiana Attorney General Steve Carter said the state 's 2005 law responded to fraud concerns , and he contended the challengers had not produced " a single actual voter who could not or would not vote because of the voter ID law . "

The long road to molecular electronics could be paved with DNA
( Nanowerk Spotlight )
One of the many fascinating concepts in nanotechnology is the vision of molecular electronics .
If realized , the shift in size from even the smallest computer chip today would be staggering - a quantum leap , so to speak ( literally ) .
Look at it this way : a single drop of water contains more molecules ( approx . 1.67 x 10 23 ) than the billions and billions of silicon chips ever produced .
Molecular electronics engineers of tomorrow might use individual molecules to perform the functions in an electronic circuit that are performed by semiconductor devices today .
Do n't get your hopes up , though , that your next iPod will be truly nano .
Scientists today are still struggling with the most basic requirements for molecular electronics , for instance , how to precisely and reliably position individual molecules on a surface .
DNA - based molecular electronics
DNA - based nanostructuring is one approach that could lead to promising results .
It has already been shown that DNA could be used to structure nanoscale surfaces .
Now , a team in Germany has demonstrated that nanoscale objects of very different size can be deposited simultaneously and site - selectively onto DNA - displaying surfaces , based on sequence - specific DNA - DNA duplex formation .
Already widely used today , DNA microarrays ( also called DNA chips ) that can contain hundreds of thousands of distinct probes , each bearing a reagent whose molecular recognition of a complementary molecule can lead to a signal that is detected by an imaging technology , most often fluorescence .
The traditional solid - phase array is a collection of DNA molecules attached to a solid surface , such as glass , plastic or silicon chip .
The ability of DNA sequences to bind to surfaces site - selectively has intrigued scientists who are excited by the vision of molecular electronics and who struggle with finding robust techniques that would allow the structuring of surfaces with nanometer precision .
" We know that DNA - based structuring can be done in principle " Prof. Clemens Richert tells Nanowerk .
" We now have developed a biomolecule - driven nanostructuring process that can be achieved with sub- micrometer spatial resolution , using dip - pen nanolithography .
Our methodology , in combination with nanolithography or similar techniques , might lead to a robust way of generating nanostructured surfaces , including surfaces for molecular electronics . "
Richert 's research group at the University of Karlsruhe worked with colleagues from the university 's Institute of Physical Chemistry and the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe ( both now part of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology - KIT ) to develop a technique that resulted in DNA - based self - sorting of nanoparticles .
They applied lanes of DNA to different regions of a gold surface , and each lane then attracted a different population of nanoparticles ( " DNA - Based Self - Sorting of Nanoparticles on Gold Surfaces " ) .
AFM images of gold nanoparticles adsorbed onto DNA - displaying gold surfaces ( Images acquired by Ulrich Plutowski )
" We are not aware of a study in which nanoparticles of so different a diameter ( meaning that they offer very different surface areas with which they can bind to the surface ) have been deposited site selectively , based on DNA - DNA interactions " says Richert , " and it was unheard of that it could be done with this level of reproducibility and accuracy . "
Since it is known that DNA can be covalently linked to them , the researchers in Karlsruhe chose gold nanoparticles of 15?60 nm diameter and planar gold surfaces for their study .
Richert says that gold nanoparticles , particularly nanoparticles of a larger diameter , readily adsorb onto gold surfaces .
" The interactions competing with sequence - specific DNA? DNA duplex formation can be quite strong . "
Also , there is more than an order of magnitude difference in aggregate binding strength between the 15 nm and 60 nm nanoparticles .
A 15 nm particle carries approximately 125 DNA strands whereas the 60 nm particle carries approximately 2,000 strands .
In order to negate the strong competing interactions , the researchers experimented with ' filler molecules ' for the nanoparticle surface .
" Beyond its simple steric function , our filler should serve two important roles " says Richert : " 1 ) preventing binding of the DNA to the gold surface , and 2 ) suppressing base pairing between short stretches of otherwise noncomplementary DNA . "
After a bit of trial and error , the team finally came up with an optimized protocol that performed well in control experiments , including hybridization with one type of nanoparticles only , the use of partially complementary third strands , and addition of fully unrelated , noncovalently linked DNA .
Self - assembly for molecular electronics
The Richert Group 's long - term goal is to assemble circuits on the level of molecular electronics .
They have programs involving single - walled carbon nanotubes ( " An Unexpected New Optimum in the Structure Space of DNA Solubilizing Single - Walled Carbon Nanotubes " ) and gold nanoparticles ( e.g. their most recent work cited above ) .
In addition , they are studying the deposition of DNA - coated carbon nanotubes .
Assembly processes on the nanoscale that are based on interactions between biomacromolecules are notoriously tricky .
A key issue is how to make them reliable and high - yielding .
RUBBISH generation and recycling rates vary among rich countries .
Americans are the most wasteful .
They churned out 740 kg of rubbish per person in 2003 .
Of this , 31 % was recycled or composted .
Densely populated Japan , on the other hand , threw out a mere 410 kg per person .
With land at a premium , nearly 80 % was incinerated , and a measly 16 % recycled .
Only Britain recycled less , burying most of its rubbish in landfill sites instead .
By contrast , green - minded Germany recycled 57 % of its total municipal waste , including nearly 90 % of all glass and over 70 % of paper and cardboard .

The boy 's mother described the prosecution as a joke
The boy was accused of throwing the pork snack at a 74 - year - old man in Woodhouse Park , south Manchester .
He denied the charge in a hearing at a Manchester Youth Court , where the judge questioned the decision to prosecute .
Greater Manchester Police and the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) are now reviewing the case , which the boy 's mother described as an " utter joke " .
She told the BBC : " They came to arrest him in my house , they took him into a police van .
They took him to Elizabeth Slinger [ police station ] , put him in a cell , took his photographs , his fingerprints , then interviewed him .
Greater Manchester Police takes all incidents of anti-social behaviour very seriously and they are investigated thoroughly
GMP spokeswoman
" And then they decided to charge him with common assault - with a sausage .
" It had quite a bit of an effect on him .
He could n't sleep .
He takes sleeping tablets anyway - but they did n't work . "
Asked whether she accepted that he needed to be punished , she told the BBC : " Definitely yes , but not to the extent that they have gone . "
The incident involving the boy , who cannot be named , was alleged to have taken place on 11 August .
The victim , who believed he had been hit with a stone , told police it was the latest in a series of incidents in which he had been intimidated by local youths .
Charging the boy was the only option because he had previously been issued with three reprimands , a GMP spokeswoman said .
" The officer 's decision to charge was completely in line with standard procedure , and took all available information into consideration , " she added .
" Greater Manchester Police takes all incidents of anti-social behaviour very seriously and they are investigated thoroughly . "
The police and CPS are now jointly reviewing the prosecution , she added .
Measuring Happiness and Satisfaction " Happiness among American men and women reaches its estimated minimum at approximately ages 49 and 45 respectively . "
To design effective social and economic policies , policymakers need a measure of individuals ' " well - being . "
Yet while such things as real Gross Domestic Product , lifespan , height , and the incidence of cancer can be counted , it is a much more complicated task to objectively quantify psychological well - being and happiness .
For example , recent statistical research has shown that countries like Denmark , Ireland , and the Netherlands are particularly happy , while nations such as Germany , Italy , and Portugal are less happy .
However , one could argue that words such as " happiness " or " satisfaction " cannot be communicated unambiguously and in exactly the same way across countries , so it is not easy to know whether such cross-national well - being patterns are believable .
In Hypertension and Happiness across Nations ( NBER Working Paper No. 12934 ) , co-authors David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald draw upon data on 15,000 randomly sampled individuals from 16 countries , and on other larger samples , to develop a measure of well - being related to the incidence of high blood pressure .
They find evidence to suggest that happier nations report fewer blood - pressure problems .
And , this seems to be true regardless of the dataset used in the analysis .
Nor do the results seem to be caused by differing numbers of physicians across countries .
The authors ' findings in this study rest on three assumptions : first , that it is reasonable to treat their survey evidence on high - blood - pressure problems as a proxy for true measures of hypertension .
Second , that people report high blood pressure in a more objective way than they report levels of happiness .
Third , that the patterns they find are not merely the product of something special for this particular sample of nations .
Of course , it is possible that the results of this study are not valid because an inherently cheery nation will be optimistic about everything .
However , it is hard to believe that someone told by their doctor that they have high blood pressure would have an incentive to conceal or misreport that .
For researchers in general , the attraction of a blood - pressure question in surveys is that it relies on medical facts given to the individual , and thus seems valuably different in character from conventional subjective questions about well - being .
Furthermore , the authors point out that while psychological health cannot be measured easily , it is nonetheless high in Denmark and low in East Germany .
While happiness and hypertension are linked , more research remains needed on how such connections may operate .
In Is Well - being U - Shaped over the Life Cycle ? ( NBER Working Paper No.12935 ) , Blanchflower and Oswald study happiness and life - satisfaction data for half a million Americans and Europeans .
They draw two main conclusions from the data : first , that psychological well - being moves along a U - shaped curve as we age .
Second , that there are important differences in the reported happiness levels of different age groups .
The authors suggest that reported well - being is U - shaped in age .
Happiness among American men and women reaches its estimated minimum at approximately ages 49 and 45 respectively .
Among European men and women , life satisfaction levels are at their minimum at ages 44 at 43 respectively .
The authors emphasize that , because their research controls for many other influences upon happiness and life satisfaction -- including income , education , and marriage -- these results should be read as truly describing well - being .
By definition , the authors caution , their study has one important limitation .
The international datasets that they use do not follow the same individuals over the years .
They also note that what truly causes the U - shaped curve in human well - being , and the noticeable regularity of its mathematical shape in different parts of the industrialized world , is not currently known .
Potential answers , some more plausible than others , include the following : first , that individuals learn to adapt to their strengths and weaknesses , and in mid-life quell the unfeasible aspirations of their youth .
Second , that cheerful people live systematically longer than those who are miserable , and that the U - shape somehow traces out , in part , a selection effect .
Third , that a kind of comparison process is occurring - for example , I may have seen school - friends die and as a result eventually come to value my blessings during my remaining years .
There are likely to be other explanations for the U - shaped effect , too .

I ’m pretty pissed right now .
Two days ago I blogged about an incident involving Rebekka Guðleifsdóttira .
Rebekka is one of the most popular photographers on Flickr and definitely someone that those of us who have been around for a while would consider “ Old Skool ” ( RIP ) .
Rebekka is a single mom and art student living in Iceland .
She ’s an artist and a talented one at that .
She does amazing things with her camera .
Recently she discovered that a gallery Only - Dreemin had been ripping her off .
They ’d sold thousands of dollars worth of her images and when she caught them and tried to make them give her the money that they stole from her they refused .
So Rebekka did what anyone with a following on the internet might do and she posted about her frustration and plight on her flickrstream .
And her story resonated loudly with the flickr community .
Her story made the front page of digg and by days end she had 100,000 views on this particular photograph with hundreds of supportive comments .
So what ’s got me pissed today ?
What ’s got me pissed today is that according to Rebekka , Flickr has removed her image from their site .
That ’s right .
Not only did they remove and kill her image and her * non- violent * words of protest , but they censored each and every one of us who commented on her photograph , who offered support to Rebekka , who shared in her frustration by wiping every single one of our comments off the face of the internet forever .
According to Rebekka , Flickr ’s explanation ?
“ Flickr is not a venue for to you harass , abuse , impersonate , or intimidate others .
If we receive a valid complaint about your conduct , we will send you a warning or
terminate your account . ”
WTF ?!?
So a flickr photographer gets ripped off .
Dares to complain about it .
Has an outpouring of support on the internet over it and Yahoo decides censorship is the way to handle this ?
This is the worst I ’ve seen from Yahoo yet .
You know when Yahoo decided to without my permission delete a photograph I ’d posted of Michael Crook and along with it a long dialog of community conversation I was pissed .
But I ’m even more pissed now .
Yahoo should not get away with this .
This type of censorship is not right .
They should apologize to Rebekka and reinstate this photo that they deleted and all it ’s comments .
These comments that Flickr do n’t belong to them .
They belong to all of us .
All of us , the community that makes Flickr even possible .
Remember the community Yahoo ?
Remember the community that Flickr used to stand behind .
I remember back when I posted a much earlier photo on Flickr when I ’d almost been ripped off by PriceRitePhoto .
I used this photo to put pressure on PriceRitePhoto which eventually put them and their sleazy business practices out of business .
You know what ?
Back when this happened I actually got a personal email supportive of my plight from someone on Flickr staff .
That was then though .
This is now .
Rebekka , I ’m sorry that Yahoo has decided to censor you .
Consider this post and the posting I ’ll make at Flickr a protest in support of you and your right to share your frustrations in your photostream and in your art .
This really sucks , and know that even without Flickr , the attention to this matter will not die down .
I ’m not sure how this company got to Flickr and Yahoo , but this will not make their problem of cheating you go away .
Because when people censor it only makes the censored story ring louder in the end .
Rebekka , you had my support when you originally posted about your plight and you have it now .
And to Yahoo and Flickr ?
Shame on you .
Digg this here .
Update : Flickr has formally responded on this matter and a debate regarding this “ mistake ” is going on over here in this Flickr Help Forum .
Feel free to chime in if you ’d like .
Update # 2 : More news on this now from the BBC .

Forth Methodology Applied to Programming :
1. BEGIN BEGIN BEGIN Identify and reject your illusions and ideas that do n't help .
2 . Identify and reject the non-problems blocking your problem or keep them but trick them into helping solve the real problem .
3 . First consider the options that everyone else would reject first , that is where the biggest algorithmic improvement is likely to be found .
3 . Carefully construct a well thought out solution .
4 . Optimize that solution design as far as it can go in that direction .
5 . Identify and reject the illusion that starting over is bad and you are ready to code .
Return to 1 . with a greater understanding of the issues UNTIL you collect all the good solutions that you can imagine .
6 . Compare solutions .
Construct experiments , benchmarks , simulations or whatever you need to confirm that you found the optimal approach to the problem .
7 . Continue to return to 1 . UNTIL the ideas are " right by design . "
8 . After making the problem look brutally simple by doing the factoring factoring factoring before coding approach the trival programming task of constructing a one - to - one image of the optimal solution in code .
9 . Code .
Build custom tools if they help .
Write code so simple and clear that bugs simply can't happen .
Make the code " right by design . " : define using one - liners about this long ; Interactively test each Forth word .
Extend the core language making your custom language and moving you toward your solution .
Return to 1 . UNTIL the code solution falls out .
10 . Write documentation so simple and clear that bugs simply can't happen .
Document the " right by design " algorithms and code .
Create a glossary with a description of each word .
Have fun at all times .
Enjoy the satisfaction of a job well done .
--------------------------------------------
If you do this right the easiest step is 9 .
If you start at 9 you understand 1 % of this methodology .
This methodology , framing a programming task here , can be applied to designing hardware , it has , or to any type of problem .
The inventor of Forth , Charles Moore , says that his language was designed to " avoid " the " unsolveable " problems in computer science .
He says that the " real " problem is the problem that you want to solve .
Adding unsolvable problems to the real problem is really your problem .
On each iteration you understand the problem better , each time you go through the loop , you find remaining places for new optimization .
After you found and removed the last bottleneck you find the next largest bottleneck in each sucessive iteration .
Mr. Moore repeated steps 1 - 10 on software for 20 years .
He declared that the programming problem had been solved .
The remaining problem was hardware .
Mr. Moore studied the problem and constructed his own new tools .
Mr. Moore repeated steps 1 - 10 on hardware / software for another 20 years .
Computers are hardware / software and Mr. Moore has been getting closer .
He used step by step iterative changes .
He said that he made a couple of wrong turns on a couple of landings and had to go back to find the up staircase again .
Learn to recognize when you have left the up staircase .
I admire him for all the times when he told us that he had been wrong in an approach or in a conlusion , that he had taken the wrong path before or told us something that was not true .
I see a lot of people taking a leap , or climbing up the vertical wall .
I tell them that there are stairs and that it is a longer , but easier and better path .
But some people will get stuck trying to go up the down escalator .
Consider using the up stairway .
If you find an up escalator somewhere please let us all know !

It was one such program that led Nunn and Turner to a warehouse in Ust - Kamenogorsk , an industrial city in eastern Kazakhstan , in October 2005 .
They were there to size up an effort , paid for in part by N.T.I. , to “ blend down ” 6,400 pounds of highly enriched uranium — enough to make dozens of bombs — into a form that could n’t be used in weapons .
The uranium was spent fuel from a decommissioned nuclear power plant situated near the Iranian border .
A few years earlier , he had made the following offer to Kazakhstan ’s president : N.T.I. would provide its expertise to relocate and then blend down the uranium , and it would pay half of the $ 2 million cost to do so .
By the time Nunn and Turner toured the Ulba Metallurgical Plant , the project was close to completion .
A portion of the uranium had not yet been blended down , however , and it lay stored in 20 or so tubes in a corner of the warehouse .
Nunn and Turner stood and gazed solemnly at it .
“ Here was the potential , right there in that little corner , in the hands of the wrong people , to wipe out cities around the world . ”
Nunn says .
“ That ’s a pretty stark realization . ”
N.T.I. intervened in Kazakhstan , Nunn explains , because the U.S. government did not act first .
It ’s not the only such example : in mid-2002 , more than 100 pounds of highly enriched uranium — stored in portable canisters that emit little radiation — was lying at the Vinca Institute of Nuclear Sciences , a civilian research reactor in Belgrade .
The security there would have been no match for even a small terrorist squad .
And Islamic militants operated in the region .
Clearly Vinca was a high - priority problem .
Yet even though the first American plans to rescue the material were drawn up during the Clinton administration , no action had been taken a year after Sept. 11 .
The obstacle was bureaucratic : in return for giving up the uranium , the Serbian government demanded help cleaning up Vinca ’s spent reactor fuel .
That qualified as an environmental cleanup , however , which the U.S. lacked the authority to pay for .
So N.T.I. stepped in and covered the $ 5 million cleanup fee .
It was n’t until August 2002 that a motorcade of technicians and machine - gun - toting commandos finally transferred the uranium from the Vinca Institute to a cargo plane that flew it to Russia to be blended down .
“ If there ’s anything that most Americans would think the government would happily chip in for , it ’s getting highly enriched uranium out of a place where it could fall into terrorist hands , ” says Matthew Bunn , a former nuclear - arms official in the Clinton administration who is now at Harvard and whose work is partly financed by N.T.I .
“ Yet ” — in Vinca — “ the government could not get this done without N.T.I. ’s money . ”

A small - town lawyer and politician who won an underdog campaign in Georgia in 1972 , Nunn quickly made his name in Washington as a defense - policy wonk .
Thanks to an intimidating expertise on defense affairs and a bespectacled air of judicious authority , Nunn was “ looked upon with awe ” by colleagues in both parties , says Pete V. Domenici , the Republican senator from New Mexico .
Such was his authority , in fact , that he comfortably rebuffed offers from George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton to serve as secretary of defense , knowing that he wielded even more power from his longtime perch as chairman of Senate Armed Services .
Nunn used that influence to consistently pro-military ends .
During the 1970s , he fought with liberal Democrats seeking to cut defense budgets and ultimately forced Jimmy Carter to accept substantial increases in defense spending .
Nunn also strongly defended the value and morality of nuclear weapons .
The nuclear - freeze movement , in his mind , was naïvely utopian .
“ We had to have a nuclear deterrent , ” he says today .
“ Not only that , but a first - use policy , ” which refers to the U.S. ’s stated willingness in certain circumstances to strike first with nuclear weapons .
Nunn considered a run for president in 1988 , and his name surfaced again after Michael Dukakis ’s crushing defeat in November of that year , which further persuaded centrist Democrats that they needed a Southern moderate as a candidate .
But that talk ground to a halt after Nunn opposed the first gulf war .
He urged at the time that sanctions and diplomacy be given more time and , in January 1991 , voted against the Senate ’s war resolution .
A sign went up on a Georgia highway calling him “ Saddam ’s Best Friend , ” and some suggested that he was cynically appealing to liberal Democratic primary voters .
As it happened , however , opposing such a short and easy war probably ruined Nunn ’s shot at the White House .
In Washington , his vote was considered a colossal political blunder .
“ He got a lot of political flak , ” says his friend Al From , the chairman of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council .
“ It probably hastened his decision to retire from politics . ”
( Nunn ’s vote “ profoundly influenced the next generation of senators that confronted plans for the second invasion ” 11 years later , says a former Clinton defense official who advises Congressional Democrats .
White House officials even invoked Nunn ’s “ mistake ” as they lobbied Congress to vote for war . )
By the mid-1990s , the cold war was over and the stature of defense gurus diminished .
Moreover , politics on Capitol Hill were changing .
The rise of fierce , Gingrich - style cultural politics made life uneasy for all Southern Democrats .
In 1993 , Nunn resisted Bill Clinton ’s attempt to allow gays to serve openly in the military , prompting a gay - rights spokesman to brand him a “ Jesse Helms Democrat . ”
Washington was growing far less hospitable to a moderate with little taste for the blood sport of partisan politics .
“ The premium is on stirring up your base , ” he says now .
When Nunn announced his retirement in 1995 , even the Republican Strom Thurmond urged him to stick around .
Nunn was just 58 when he left the Senate .
For more than 20 years , his life had been defined by the cold war and the fight against Communism .
That cause was over .
The CSS Working Group recently met face - to - face in Beijing , and have released a series of notes about some of the issues they discussed regarding the current and future states of CSS .
One interesting possibility that was raised is to allow rotation of page elements ; according to the original proposal , these are some of the possible use cases :
rotate a block of text 90 degrees as for a tab on left of page rotate an image ( or block of text ) an arbitrary amount use rotated column headings for narrow table columns
It must be stressed that this exists purely as an idea at the moment , so we wo n’t be seeing it any time soon .
Still , it would create many new possibilities in web design .
Following our discussion of the inherent ambiguity in the border - radius declaration , it has been decided that the simpler syntax used by Mozilla will used for the shorthand ; that is , in order to apply elliptical corners on elements , you will have to declare them all separately .
I think this is a good decision , and I ’m delighted that the CSSWG have listened to the views of the community .
A pat on the back for everyone involved !
Finally , the CSSWG are to release an annual ( ? ) snapshot of modules considered stable , in order that browser makers and developers can begin to implement them .
The 2007 snapshot will include :
The 2008 version is likely to include Paged Media and Media Queries , and possibly Ruby and Backgrounds and Borders .
So that ’s the state of CSS today .
Interesting stuff ; many thanks to the CSSWG for making it all public .

The local bishop had to step in to tackle the problem
So badly did relations deteriorate between the sisters of Santa Clara in Bari that the Mother Superior ended up in hospital with scratches to her face .
Now the local archbishop has intervened and asked the Vatican for permission to close the convent .
Sister Liliana is on her own there now and says she has no intention of leaving her home of the past 44 years .
The Clarissa nuns are regarded as the most austere order of the Roman Catholic Church , devoted to a life of prayer , penance and quiet contemplation .
But at the Santa Clara convent in Bari , the vow of silence was shattered by an unholy row .
Sisters Annamaria and Gianbattista say they were driven to distraction by the nasty habits of their Mother Superior , Sister Liliana .
They became so angry that during the summer they turned on her , scratching her face and throwing her to the ground .
The two nuns have now moved into a nearby convent , leaving Sister Liliana barricaded inside .
Despite the efforts of the Archbishop Giovanni Battista Pichierri to reconcile the three sisters he has been forced to call on the Vatican for help .
He wrote to the Holy See telling them the sisters had " clearly lost their religious vocation " and with only one nun remaining has asked for permission to close the convent down .
But Sister Liliana is not going without a fight .
She has been at the nunnery for 44 years and she is not going to be pushed about now .
She has written to the Pope telling him she will only leave when God decides it is time to go .
And since she is devoted to her vow of silence it is not that easy to reason with her .
March 2 , 2007 — jao
n the last issue of MIT ’s Technology Review , there ’s an interesting report , An Alternative to the Computer Mouse on Manu Kumar ‘s new way to interact with your computer via eye - sight .
The innovative part comes in the combination of eye and hand : you fix your stare on a given screen region , but that has no effect unless you press the appropriate key .
Once you do that , magic happens .
For instance , the region you were looking at gets amplified .
Or if you were reading a text near the end of the visible area , it will scroll automatically for you .
There ’s no secret hardware involved ( a high - resolution web cam and a bunch of infrared light - emitting diodes ) , although that does not mean that the equipment is cheap : Kumar uses a $ 25,000 monitor !
The tricky part happens to be a good eye - tracking algorithm , because it seems pupils are prone to jitter even when fixated on a point .
Kumar ’s solution is not yet perfect ( tests show that it misbehaves around 20 % of the times ) , but people participating in tests seem to prefer eyes to mouses .
The system is called EyePoint , and you ’ll find some screenshots here or , download a demo video here .
The project is integrated in Standford HCI Group ‘s GUIDe ( Gaze - enhanced User Interface Design , if you have to know ) , which includes other curious applications like EyeExposé ( i’ll let you try and imagine what it does ) .
Although not as fancy as other exotic input methods we ’ve seen in the past , this one looks much more practical : i can perfectly picture myself using EyePoint together with my keyboard and Emacs to browse around during code editing sessions .
I ’ll have to wait until prices drop a little bit , and algorithms get better , but that should be only a question of time .
The looming collapse of the US military in Iraq , of which a number of generals and former generals , including former Chief of Staff Colin Powell , have warned , is happening none too soon , as it my be the best hope for preventing military rule here at home .
From the looks of things , the Bush / Cheney regime has been working assiduously to pave the way for a declaration of military rule , such that at this point it really lacks only the pretext to trigger a suspension of Constitutional government .
They have done this with the active support of Democrats in Congress , though most of the heavy lifting was done by the last , Republican - led Congress .
The first step , or course , was the first Authorization for Use of Military Force , passed in September 2001 , which the president has subsequently used to claimÃ¢â‚ ¬Â¹improperly , but so what that the whole world , including the US , is a battlefield in a so - called ' War ' on Terror , and that he has extra-Constitutional unitary executive powers to ignore laws passed by Congress .
As constitutional scholar and former Reagan - era associate deputy attorney general Bruce Fein observes , that one claim , that the US is itself a battlefield , is enough to allow this or some future president to declare martial law , ' since you can always declare martial law on a battlefield .
All he'd need would be a pretext , like another terrorist attack inside the U.S. '
The 2001 AUMF was followed by the PATRIOT Act , passed in October 2001 , which undermined much of the Bill of Rights .
Around the same time , the president began a campaign of massive spying on Americans by the National Security Agency , conducted without any warrants or other judicial review .
It was and remains a program that is clearly aimed at American dissidents and at the administration 's political opponents , since the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court would never have raised no objections to spying on potential terrorists .
( And it , and other government spying programs , have resulted in the government 's having a list now of some 325,000 ' suspected terrorists '!)
The other thing we saw early on was the establishment of an underground government - within - a - government , though the activation , following 9 - 11 , of the so - called ' Continuity of Government ' protocol , which saw heads of federal agencies moved secretly to an underground bunker where , working under the direction of Vice President Dick Cheney , the ' government ' functioned out of sight of Congress and the public for critical months .
It was also during the first year following 9 - 11 that the Bush / Cheney regime began its programs of arrest and detention without chargeÃ¢â‚ ¬Â¹mostly of resident aliens , but also of American citizensÃ¢â‚ ¬Â¹and of kidnapping and torture in a chain of gulag prisons overseas and at the Navy base at Guantanamo Bay .
The following year , Attorney General John Ashcroft began his program to develop a mass network of tens of millions of citizen spiesÃ¢â‚ ¬Â¹Operation TIPS .
That program , which had considerable support from key Democrats ( notably Sen. Joe Lieberman ) , was curtailed by Congress when key conservatives got wind of the scale of the thing , but the concept survives without a name , and is reportedly being expanded today .
Meanwhile , last October Bush and Cheney , with the help of a compliant Congress , put in place some key elements needed for a military putsch .
There was the overturning of the venerable Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , which barred the use of active duty military inside the United States for police - type functions , and the revision of the Insurrection Act , so as to empower the president to take control of National Guard units in the 50 states even over the objections of the governors of those states .
Put this together with the wholly secret construction now under way -- courtesy of a $ 385 - million grant by the US Army Corps of Engineers to Halliburton subsidiary KBR Inc -- of detention camps reportedly capable of confining as many as 400,000 people , and a recent report that the Pentagon has a document , dated June 1 , 2007 , classified Top Secret , which declares there to be a developing ' insurgency ' within the U.S , and which lays out a whole martial law counterinsurgency campaign against legal dissent , and you have all the ingredients for a military takeover of the United States .
As we go about our daily lives -- our shopping , our escapist movie watching , and even our protesting and political organizing we need to be aware that there is a real risk that it could all blow up , and that we could find ourselves facing armed , uniformed troops at our doors .

Bruce Fein is n't an alarmist .
He says he does n't see martial law coming tomorrow .
But he is also realistic .
He says , ' This is all sitting around like a loaded gun waiting to go off .
I think the risk of martial law is trivial right now , but the minute there is a terrorist attack , then it is real .
And it stays with us after Bush and Cheney are gone , because terrorism stays with us forever . '
( It may be significant that Hillary Clinton , the leading Democratic candidate for president , has called for the revocation of the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq , but not of the earlier 2001 AUMF which Bush claims makes him commander in chief of a borderless , endless war on terror . )
Indeed , the revised Insurrection Act ( 10 . USC 331-335 ) approved by Congress and signed into law by Bush last October , specifically says that the president can federalize the National Guard to ' suppress public disorder ' in the event of 'national disorder , epidemic , other serious public health emergency , terrorist attack or incident . '
That determination , the act states , is solely the president¹s to make .
Congress is not involved .
Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee , has added an amendment to the upcoming Defense bill , restoring the Insurrection Act to its former versionÃ¢â‚ ¬Â¹a move that has the endorsement of all 50 governors -- but Fein argues that would not solve the problem , since Bush still claims that the U.S. is a battlefield .
Besides , a Leahy aide concedes that Bush could sign the next Defense Appropriations bill and then use a signing statement to invalidate the Insurrection Act rider .
Fein argues that the only real defense against the looming disaster of a martial law declaration would be for Congress to vote for a resolution determining that there is no ' War ' on terror .
' But they are such cowards they will never do that , ' he says .
That leaves us with the military .
If ordered to turn their guns and bayonets on their fellow Americans , would our ' heroes ' in uniform follow their consciences , and their oaths to ' uphold and defend ' the Constitution of the United States ?
Or would they follow the orders of their Commander in Chief ?
It has to be a plus that National Guard and Reserve units are on their third and sometimes fourth deployments to Iraq , and are fuming at the abuse .
It has to be a plus that active duty troops are refusing to re-enlist in droves especially mid-level officers .
If we are headed for martial law , better that it be with a broken military .
Maybe if it 's broken badly enough , the administration will be afraid to test the idea .
Dave Lindorff 's most recent book is " The Case for Impeachment " ( St. Martin's Press , 2006 ) .
His work is available at www.thiscantbehappening.net.
UPDATE : A source tells TMZ that it 's not Barry who 's writing this song -- in fact , " View " producers pulled the plug on Manilow 's performance when his people demanded that he appear on the show without Elisabeth .
Manilow has in fact performed on the show twice before -- both last year -- when Hasselbeck 's been co-hosting .
TMZ has learned that legendary singer Barry Manilow has pulled out of his scheduled appearance on " The View " tomorrow -- because he strongly disagrees with host Elisabeth Hasselbeck 's conservative view !
Paging Rosie O'Donnell !
In an exclusive statement to TMZ , Barry says , " I strongly disagree with her views .
I think she 's dangerous and offensive .
I will not be on the same stage as her . "
Barry , taking a stand !
Manilow is currently on a press tour promoting the release of his new album , " Greatest Songs of the Seventies . "
A network spokesman had no comment .

As of today SunRocket is no longer taking new customers .
Final layoffs expected tomorrow and the ramp down team of 25 has been put in place .
All employees affected will not be given severance .
Well done Lisa , well done !
Did you happen to get your $ 130,000 signing bonus ?
I must mention if Joyce and Paul were still around none of this would have happened .
They both had a clear vision of what SR should and could have been -- Lisa Hook took that away from them !

Re : SunRocket Days are OVER !
TMJ - Can
I ask why you changed your location from Arlington VA to NY today in your profile .
Also , can you please post any proof of this .
If it was told by an employee , then they must think they are out of job , so who was it .
Maybe , just the department that they worked in .
I guess , I would like more proof of a rumor like this , then one person in all the internet with the proof .
Especially since things like Signup are working , and they even updated the webiste with a new promo .
That does like a compnay that is going to die tomorrow .
You can PM me this information if you like .

It 's a message that appears when we try to fill out the online signup form .
A breakthrough in Iran - U.S. relations – a proposal from Iran in 2003 in which " an end to Iran 's support for anti-Israel militants and acceptance of Israel 's right to exist " was offered – was shunted aside by then - National Security advisor Rice , according to a former member of the NSC .
And as Secretary of State , she lied last week – or rather " misled " – Congress about it , the ex-aide said today .
Reuters has the he said / she said details .
Today , he said :
Flynt Leverett , who worked on the National Security Council when it was headed by Rice , said a proposal vetted by Tehran 's most senior leaders was sent to the United States in May 2003 and was akin to the 1972 U.S. opening to China .
Speaking at a conference on Capitol Hill , Leverett said he was confident it was seen by Rice and then - Secretary of State Colin Powell but " the administration rejected the overture . "
" The Bush administration up to and including Secretary Rice is misleading Congress and the American public about the Iran proposal . "
She said :
Rice 's spokesman denied she misled Congress and reiterated that she did not see the proposal .
...
Testifying before a U.S. Congress committee last week , Rice , said about Leverett 's previous public comments on the Iranian proposal : " I do n't know what Flynt Leverett 's talking about . "
She faulted him for not telling her , " We have a proposal from Iran and we really ought to take it . "
Ha ha ha .
It ’s his fault , you see !
This whole Iran crisis could have been solved years ago if she ’d only known !
But of course !
Yet ... he said :
... Powell , in a conversation about the Iranian proposal , told him [ Leverett ] he " could n't sell it at the White House . "
This was evidence it had been discussed there , he said .
She said :
On Wednesday , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said : " What she said is she has no recollection of having seen it .
She has said that repeatedly . "
Ah , yes .
The apparently highly infectious Amnesiac Defense Disease , running like the 1918 influenza through the White House .
Who can be expected remember such a small thing as a proposal from Iran to concede Israel ’s right to exist and stop arming anti-Israeli extremists ?
Why , the same people who forget whether they outed CIA agents , of course !
The proposal from Iran , which was relayed through the Swiss ambassador , can be viewed as a PDF file on the Washington Post website .

Louisiana Most Corrupt State in the Nation , Mississippi Second , Illinois Sixth , New Jersey Ninth
21 Corporate Crime Reporter 40 , October 8 , 2007
Louisiana is the most corrupt state in the nation .
That ’s according to an analysis of government data released today by Corporate Crime Reporter .
Louisiana ( 1 ) , Mississippi ( 2 ) , Kentucky ( 3 ) , Alabama ( 4 ) and Ohio ( 5 ) are the top five most corrupt states in the country , according to the analysis .
Rounding out the top ten are Illinois ( 6 ) , Pennsylvania ( 7 ) , Florida ( 8 ) , New Jersey ( 9 ) , and New York ( 10 ) .
“ If you type the word ‘ corruption ’ into Google News , the vast majority of news stories that come up are from overseas , ” said Russell Mokhiber , editor of Corporate Crime Reporter , a print weekly legal newsletter based in Washington , D.C. “ But public corruption is booming right here in the USA . ”
“ There have been more than 20,000 public officials and private citizens convicted of public corruption over the past two decades , ” Mokhiber said .
“ That ’s an average of 1,000 a year for the last twenty years . ”
Corporate Crime Reporter looked at the 35 most populous states in the nation .
( The fifteen states with population of under two million were not included in the analysis . )
The ranking is based on data from the Justice Department ’s Public Integrity Section ’s 2006 report – which was made public just last week .
The 2006 Justice Department report contains a compilation of all federal corruption convictions by state over the past decade .
“ We added up the total convictions for each state from 1997 to 2006 , ” Mokhiber said .
“ We then calculated a corruption rate for each state , which we defined as the total number of public corruption convictions from 1997 to 2006 per 100,000 residents . ”
Here are the 35 most populous states ranked by their corruption rate :
Louisiana ( 1 ) ( 7.67 ) , Mississippi ( 2 ) ( 6.66 ) , Kentucky ( 3 ) ( 5.18 ) , Alabama ( 4 ) ( 4.76 ) , Ohio ( 5 ) ( 4.69 ) , Illinois ( 6 ) ( 4.68 ) , Pennsylvania ( 7 ) ( 4.55 ) , Florida ( 8 ) ( 4.47 ) , New Jersey ( 9 ) ( 4.32 ) , New York ( 10 ) ( 3.95 ) .
Tennessee ( 11 ) ( 3.68 ) , Virginia ( 12 ) ( 3.64 ) , Oklahoma ( 13 ) ( 2.96 ) , Connecticut ( 14 ) ( 2.80 ) , Missouri ( 15 ) ( 2.79 ) , Arkansas ( 16 ) ( 2.74 ) , Massachusetts ( 17 ) ( 2.66 ) , Texas ( 18 ) ( 2.44 ) , Maryland ( 19 ) ( 2.31 ) , Michigan ( 20 ) ( 2.14 ) .
Georgia ( 21 ) ( 2.13 ) , Wisconsin ( 22 ) ( 2.09 ) , California ( 23 ) ( 2.07 ) , North Carolina ( 24 ) ( 1.96 ) , Arizona ( 25 ) ( 1.88 ) , Indiana ( 26 ) ( 1.85 ) , South Carolina ( 27 ) ( 1.74 ) , Nevada ( 28 ) ( 1.72 ) , Colorado ( 29 ) ( 1.56 ) , Washington ( 30 ) ( 1.52 ) .
Utah ( 31 ) ( 1.4117 ) , Kansas ( 32 ) ( 1.4109 ) , Minnesota ( 33 ) ( 1.24 ) , Iowa ( 34 ) ( 0.91 ) , Oregon ( 35 ) ( 0.68 ) .
Mokhiber warned that the study has its limitations .
“ The Justice Department is reporting only public corruption convictions that result from a federal prosecution , ” Mokhiber said .
“ Convictions that result from a prosecution pursued by state district attorneys or attorneys general , for example , are not included in the Justice Department statistics .
But the vast majority of public corruption prosecutions – perhaps as many as 80 percent – are brought by federal officials . ”
“ Also , public officials in any given state can be corrupt to the core , and if a federal prosecutor does n’t have the resources or the sheer political will to bring the case and win a conviction , the public corruption will not be reflected in the Justice Department ’s data set , ” Mokhiber said .
Mokhiber said that in the most corrupt states , corruption is undermining public trust in politicians and government .
He cited a Monmouth University / Gannett New Jersey poll released last week which found that New Jersey residents are increasingly suspicious of their politicians .
The poll found 60 percent of residents say there is “ a lot ” of corruption in the state , up from 34 percent four years ago .
The poll also found that New Jerseyans think 60 percent of legislators are willing to sell out to lobbyists , up from 52 percent four years ago .
Mokhiber said he thought it was a good sign that citizens groups , like the Better Government Association ( BGA ) of Chicago , were organizing around the issue of public corruption – even giving awards to corruption fighters .
Later this month , for example , BGA will present its annual Civic Achievement Award jointly to the U.S. Attorney ’s office in Chicago and the Chicago Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for rooting out corruption in northern Illinois .

First the percussive sounds of sniper fire and the thrill of the kill .
Then the gospel of peace .
Across the country , hundreds of ministers and pastors desperate to reach young congregants have drawn concern and criticism through their use of an unusual recruiting tool : the immersive and violent video game Halo .
The latest iteration of the immensely popular space epic , Halo 3 , was released nearly two weeks ago by Microsoft and has already passed $ 300 million in sales .
Those buying it must be 17 years old , given it is rated M for mature audiences .
But that has not prevented leaders at churches and youth centers across Protestant denominations , including evangelical churches that have cautioned against violent entertainment , from holding heavily attended Halo nights and stocking their centers with multiple game consoles so dozens of teenagers can flock around big - screen televisions and shoot it out .
The alliance of popular culture and evangelism is challenging churches much as bingo games did in the 1960s .
And the question fits into a rich debate about how far churches should go to reach young people .
Most of the time , an obscure federal investigative unit known as the Office of Special Counsel confines itself to monitoring the activities of relatively low - level government employees , stepping in with reprimands and other routine administrative actions for such offenses as discriminating against military personnel or engaging in prohibited political activities .
But the Office of Special Counsel is preparing to jump into one of the most sensitive and potentially explosive issues in Washington , launching a broad investigation into key elements of the White House political operations that for more than six years have been headed by chief strategist Karl Rove .
The new investigation , which will examine the firing of at least one U.S. attorney , missing White House e-mails , and White House efforts to keep presidential appointees attuned to Republican political priorities , could create a substantial new problem for the Bush White House .
First , the inquiry comes from inside the administration , not from Democrats in Congress .
Second , unlike the splintered inquiries being pressed on Capitol Hill , it is expected to be a unified investigation covering many facets of the political operation in which Rove played a leading part .
“ We will take the evidence where it leads us , ” Scott J. Bloch , head of the Office of Special Counsel and a presidential appointee , said in an interview Monday .
“ We will not leave any stone unturned . ”
Bloch declined to comment on who his investigators would interview , but he said the probe would be independent and uncoordinated with any other agency or government entity .
The decision by Bloch ’s office is the latest evidence that Rove ’s once - vaunted operations inside the government , which helped the GOP hold the White House and Congress for six years , now threaten to mire the administration in investigations .
The question of improper political influence over government decision - making is at the heart of the controversy over the firing of U.S. attorneys and the ongoing congressional investigation of the special e-mail system installed in the White House and other government offices by the Republican National Committee .
All administrations are political , but this White House has systematically brought electoral concerns to Cabinet agencies in a way unseen previously .
For example , Rove and his top aides met each year with presidential appointees throughout the government , using PowerPoint presentations to review polling data and describe high - priority congressional and other campaigns around the country .
Some officials have said they understood that they were expected to seek opportunities to help Republicans in these races , through federal grants , policy decisions or in other ways .
A former Interior Department official , Wayne R. Smith , who sat through briefings from Rove and his then - deputy Ken Mehlman , said that during President Bush ’s first term , he and other appointees were frequently briefed on political priorities .
“ We were constantly being reminded about how our decisions could affect electoral results , ” Smith said .
“ This is a big deal , ” Paul C. Light , a New York University expert on the executive branch , said of Bloch ’s plan .
“ It is a significant moment for the administration and Karl Rove .
It speaks to the growing sense that there is a nexus at the White House that explains what ’s going on in these disparate investigations . ”
The 106 - person Office of Special Counsel has never conducted such a broad and high - profile inquiry in its history .
One of its primary missions has been to enforce the Hatch Act , a law enacted in 1939 to preserve the integrity of the civil service .
Bloch said the new investigation grew from two narrower inquiries his staff had begun in recent weeks .
One involved the fired U.S. attorney from New Mexico , David C. Iglesias .
The other centered on a PowerPoint presentation that a Rove aide , J. Scott Jennings , made at the General Services Administration this year .
That presentation listed recent polls and the outlook for battleground House and Senate races in 2008 .
After the presentation , GSA Administrator Lorita Doan encouraged agency managers to “ support our candidates , ” according to half a dozen witnesses .
Doan said she could not recall making such comments .
The Los Angeles Times has learned that similar presentations were made by other White House staff members , including Rove , to other Cabinet agencies .
During such presentations , employees said they got a not - so - subtle message about helping endangered Republicans .
White House spokesman Scott M. Stanzel said the Hatch Act did not prohibit providing informational briefings to government employees .
Responding to a letter of complaint to the White House from 25 Democratic senators , Stanzel said : “ It is entirely appropriate for the president ’s staff to provide informational briefings to appointees throughout the federal government about the political landscape in which they implement the president ’s policies and priorities . ”
However , questions have emerged about the PowerPoint presentations , including whether Doan ’s comments crossed the line and whether the presentations violated rules limiting political activity on federal property .
Whether legal or not , the multiple presentations revealed how widely and systematically the White House sought to deliver its list of electoral priorities .
In the course of investigating the U.S. attorney matter and the PowerPoint presentations , Democratic congressional investigators discovered e-mails written by White House personnel using accounts maintained by the Republican National Committee .
For example , they discovered that Jennings , a special assistant to the president and deputy director of political affairs in the White House , was using an e-mail with the domain name of “ gwb43.com ” that the RNC maintained .
That domain name showed up in e-mail communications from Jennings about how to replace U.S. Atty .
H.E. “ Bud ” Cummins III of Arkansas to make room for Timothy Griffin , a Rove protege , in such a way as to “ alleviate pressure / implication that Tim forced Bud out . ”
Another Jennings e-mail using the RNC account requested that department officials meet with a former New Mexico campaign advisor who wanted to “ discuss the U.S.
Atty situation there . ”
The growing controversy inspired him to act , Bloch said .
“ We are acting with dispatch and trying to deal with this because people are concerned about it ... and it is not a subject that should be left to endless speculation , ” he said .

Carnegie Mellon University computer scientists have developed an interactive , online game featuring a little fish named Phil that can teach people how to better recognize and avoid email " phishing " and other Internet scams .
In testing at the Carnegie Mellon Usable Privacy and Security ( CUPS ) Laboratory , people who spent 15 minutes playing the Anti-Phishing Phil game were better able to identify fraudulent Web sites than people who spent the same amount of time reading anti-phishing tutorials or other online training materials .
Now , the CUPS Lab wants to see how Anti-Phishing Phil performs when he swims in a bigger , more diverse pond .
As part of a field test , researchers ask people to visit the online game * and click on the " Play the game ! " link .
Participants will be asked to take a short quiz , play the game and then take another quiz .
Those who leave their email address and participate in a follow - up quiz a week later will be eligible for a raffle prize of a $ 100 Amazon.com gift card .
Phishing attacks attempt to trick people into revealing personal information or bank or credit card account information .
Often , they involve emails that appear to be from a legitimate business , such as a bank , and direct recipients to visit a Web site that likewise appears to belong to that business .
There they are asked to " verify " account information .
In addition to spoof emails and counterfeit Web sites , some attacks even mimic parts of a user 's own Web browser .
" We believe education is essential if people are to avoid being ripped off by these phishing attacks and similar online scams , " said Lorrie Cranor , associate research professor in the School of Computer Science 's Institute for Software Research and director of the CUPS Lab .
" Unlike viruses or spyware , phishing attacks do n't exploit weaknesses in a computer 's hardware or software , but take advantage of the way people use their computers and their often - limited knowledge of the way computers work . "
Security experts disagree about whether user education is effective in reducing vulnerability to increasingly sophisticated phishing attacks .
But Steve Sheng , a Ph.D. student in Carnegie Mellon 's Engineering and Public Policy Department and lead developer of Anti-Phishing Phil , presented results of a lab study at the Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security this past July , showing that training could improve people 's ability to correctly identify legitimate and illegitimate Web sites .
The game format of Anti-Phishing Phil proved particularly effective , improving the users ' accuracy from 69 percent prior to training to 87 percent after playing the game .
" We designed the game to teach people how to use Web addresses , or URLs , to identify phishing Web sites , " said Sheng .
" That tactic can also be useful in analyzing suspicious email messages . "
In addition to Cranor and Sheng , Anti-Phishing Phil developers include Carnegie Mellon faculty members Jason Hong and Alessandro Acquisti , and students Bryant Magnien and Ponnurangam Kumaraguru .
CUPS has also collaborated with Portugal Telecom to develop a Portuguese version of the game called Anti-Phishing Ze .

Preliminaries
Although information is sometimes measured in characters , as when describing the length of an email message , or in digits ( as in the length of a phone number ) , the convention in information theory is to measure information in bits .
A " bit " ( the term is a contraction of binary digit ) is either a zero or a one .
Because there are 8 possible configurations of three bits ( 000 , 001 , 010 , 011 , 100 , 101 , 110 , and 111 ) , we can use three bits to encode any integer from 1 to 8 .
So when we refer to a " 3 - bit number " , what we mean is an integer in the range 1 through 8 .
All logarithms used in this paper will be to the base two , so log 8 is 3 .
Similarly , log 1000 is slightly less than 10 , and log 1,000,000 is slightly less than 20 .
Efficient Encodings
Suppose you flip a coin one million times and write down the sequence of results .
If you want to communicate this sequence to another person , how many bits will it take ?
If it 's a fair coin , the two possible outcomes , heads and tails , occur with equal probability .
Therefore each flip requires 1 bit of information to transmit .
To send the entire sequence will require one million bits .
But suppose the coin is biased so that heads occur only 1 /4 of the time , and tails occur 3 / 4 .
Then the entire sequence can be sent in 811,300 bits , on average .
( The formula for computing this will be explained below . )
This would seem to imply that each flip of the coin requires just 0.8113 bits to transmit .
How can you transmit a coin flip in less than one bit , when the only language available is that of zeros and ones ?
Obviously , you can't .
But if the goal is to transmit an entire sequence of flips , and the distribution is biased in some way , then you can use your knowledge of the distribution to select a more efficient code .
Another way to look at it is : a sequence of biased coin flips contains less " information " than a sequence of unbiased flips , so it should take fewer bits to transmit .
Let 's look at an example .
Suppose the coin is very heavily biased , so that the probability of getting heads is only 1/1000 , and tails is 999/1000 .
In a million tosses of this coin we would expect to see only about 1,000 heads .
Rather than transmitting the results of each toss , we could just transmit the numbers of the tosses that came up heads ; the rest of the tosses can be assumed to be tails .
Each toss has a position in the sequence : a number between 1 and 1,000,000 .
A number in that range can be encoded using just 20 bits .
So , if we transmit 1,000 20 - bit numbers , we will have transmitted all the information content of the original one million toss sequence , using only around 20,000 bits .
( Some sequences will contain more than 1,000 heads , and some will contain fewer , so to be perfectly correct we should say that we expect to need 20,000 bits on average to transmit a sequence this way . )
We can do even better .
Encoding the absolute positions of the heads in the sequence takes 20 bits per head , but this allows us to transmit the heads in any order .
If we agree to transmit the heads systematically , by going through the sequence from beginning to end , then instead of encoding their absolute positions we can just encode the distance to the next head , which takes fewer bits .
For example , if the first four heads occurred at positions 502 , 1609 , 2454 , and 2607 , then their encoding as " distance to the next head " would be 502 , 1107 , 845 , 153 .
On average , the distance between two heads will be around 1,000 flips ; only rarely will the distance exceed 4,000 flips .
Numbers in the range 1 to 4,000 can be encoded in 12 bits .
( We can use a special trick to handle the rare cases where heads are more than 4,000 flips apart , but we wo n't go into the details here . )
So , using this more sophisticated encoding convention , a sequence of one million coin tosses containing about 1,000 heads can be transmitted in just 12,000 bits , on average .
Thus a single coin toss takes just 0.012 bits to transmit .
Again , this claim only makes sense because we 're actually transmitting a whole sequence of tosses .
What if we invented an even cleverer encoding ?
What is the limit on how efficient any encoding can be ?
The limit works out to about 0.0114 bits per flip , so we 're already very close to the optimal encoding .
The information content of a sequence is defined as the number of bits required to transmit that sequence using an optimal encoding .
We are always free to use a less efficient coding , which will require more bits , but that does not increase the amount of information transmitted .
Variable Length Codes
The preceding examples were based on fixed - length codes , such as 12 - bit numbers encoding values between 1 and 4,000 .
We can often do better by adopting a variable length code .
Here is an example .
Suppose that instead of flipping a coin we are throwing an eight - sided die .
Label the sides A - H . To encode a number between 1 and 8 ( or between 0 and 7 , if you 're a computer scientist ) takes 3 bits , so a thousand throws of a fair die will take 3,000 bits to transmit .
Now suppose the die is not fair , but biased in a specific way : the chances of throwing an A are 1/2 , the chances of throwing a B are 1/4 , C is 1/8 , D is 1/16 , E is 1/32 , F is 1/64 , and G and H are each 1/128 .
Let us verify that the sum of these probabilities is 1 , as it must be for any proper probability distribution :
Now let 's consider an encoding ideally suited to this probability distribution .
If we throw the die and get an A , we will transmit a single 0 .
If we throw a B we will transmit a 1 followed by a 0 , which we 'll write 10 .
If we throw a C the code will be 11 followed by 0 , or 110 .
Similarly we 'll use 1110 for D , 11110 for E , 111110 for F , 1111110 for G , and 1111111 for H. Notice that the code for A is very concise , requiring a single bit to transmit .
The codes for G and H require 7 bits each , which is way more than the 3 bits needed to transmit one throw if the die were fair .
But Gs and Hs occur with low probability , so we will rarely need to use that many bits to transmit a single throw .
On average we will need fewer than 3 bits .
We can easily calculate the average number of bits required to transmit a throw : it 's the sum of the number of bits required to transmit each of the eight possible outcomes , weighted by the probability of that outcome :
So 1,000 throws of the die can be transmitted in just 1,984 bits rather than 3,000 .
This simple variable length code is the optimal encoding for the probability distribution above .
In general , though , probability distributions are not so cleanly structured , and optimal encodings are a lot more complicated .
Exercise : suppose you are given a five - sided biased die that has a probability of 1/8 of coming up A , 1/8 for B , and 1 / 4 for each of C , D , and E. Design an optimal code for transmitting throws of this die .
( Answer at end . )
Measuring Information Content
In the preceding example we used a die with eight faces .
Since eight is a power of two , the optimal code for a uniform probability distribution is easy to caclulate : log 8 = 3 bits .
For the variable length code , we wrote out the specific bit pattern to be transmitted for each face A - H , and were thus able to directly count the number of bits required .
Information theory provides us with a formula for determining the number of bits required in an optimal code even when we do n't know the code .
Let 's first consider uniform probability distributions where the number of possible outcomes is not a power of two .
Suppose we had a conventional die with six faces .
The number of bits required to transmit one throw of a fair six - sided die is : log 6 = 2.58 .
Once again , we can't really transmit a single throw in less than 3 bits , but a sequence of such throws can be transmitted using 2.58 bits on average .
The optimal code in this case is complicated , but here 's an approach that 's fairly simple and yet does better than 3 bits / throw .
Instead of treating throws individually , consider them three at a time .
The number of possible three - throw sequences is = 216 .
Using 8 bits we can encode a number between 0 and 255 , so a three - throw sequence can be encoded in 8 bits with a little to spare ; this is better than the 9 bits we 'd need if we encoded each of the three throws seperately .
In probability terms , each possible value of the six - sided die occurs with equal probability P=1/6 .
Information theory tells us that the minmum number of bits required to encode a throw is - log P = 2.58 .
If you look back at the eight - sided die example , you 'll see that in the optimal code that was described , every message had a length exactly equal to - log P bits .
Now let 's look at how to apply the formula to biased ( non-uniform ) probability distributions .
Let the variable x range over the values to be encoded , and let P( x ) denote the probability of that value occurring .
The expected number of bits required to encode one value is the weighted average of the number of bits required to encode each possible value , where the weight is the probability of that value :
Now we can revisit the case of the biased coin .
Here the variable ranges over two outcomes : heads and tails .
If heads occur only 1 / 4 of the time and tails 3 / 4 of the time , then the number of bits required to transmit the outcome of one coin toss is :
A fair coin is said to produce more " information " because it takes an entire bit to transmit the result of the toss :
The Intuition Behind the - P log P Formula
The key to gaining an intuitive understanding of the - P log P formula for calculating information content is to see the duality between the number of messages to be encoded and their probabilities .
If we want to encode any of eight possible messages , we need 3 bits , because log 8 = 3 .
We are implicitly assuming that the messages are drawn from a uniform distribution .
The alternate way to express this is : the probability of a particular message occurring is 1/8 , and - log ( 1/8 ) = 3 , so we need 3 bits to transmit any of these messages .
Algebraically , log n = - log ( 1/n ) , so the two approaches are equivalent when the probability distribution is uniform .
The advantage of using the probability approach is that when the distribution is non-uniform , and we can't simply count the number of messages , the information content can still be expressed in terms of probabilities .
Sometimes we write about rare events as carrying a high number of bits of information .
For example , in the case where a coin comes up heads only once in every 1,000 tosses , the signal that a heads has occurred is said to carry 10 bits of information .
How is that possible , since the result of any particular coin toss takes 1 bit to describe ?
Transmitting when a rare event occurs , if it happens only about once in a thousand trials , will take 10 bits .
Using our message counting approach , if a value occurs only 1/1000 of the time in a uniform distribution , there will be 999 other possible values , all equally likely , so transmitting any one value would indeed take 10 bits .
With a coin there are only two possible values .
What information theory says we can do is consider each value separately .
If a particular value occurs with probability P , we assume that it is drawn from a uniformly distributed set of values when calculating its information content .
The size of this set would be 1 / P elements .
Thus , the number of bits required to encode one value from this hypothetical set is - log P .
Since the actual distribution we 're trying to encode is not uniform , we take the weighted average of the estimated information content of each value ( heads or tails , in the case of a coin ) , weighted by the probability P of that value occuring .
Information theory tells us that an optimal encoding can do no better than this .
Thus , with the heavily biased coin we have the following :
P( heads ) = 1/1000 , so heads takes - log ( 1/1000 ) = 9.96578 bits to encode
P( tails ) = 999/1000 , so tails takes - log( 999/1000 ) = 0.00144 bits to encode
Avg.bits required =
= ( 1/1000 ) × 9.96578 + ( 999/1000 ) × 0.00144 = 0.01141 bits per coin toss

Why are you looking at me like that ?
she said .
And there she was again , before me with her warm , high - cheeked face tilted to one side in question , the fine throat rising out of the white blouse , brown , bepeached , as alive and expressive as any singing bird’s .
She wore a small gold watch pinned to her waist and her napkin was tucked there and I said , I was dreaming .
Did you realize that you make men dream ?
Her mouth became a firm straight line beneath her smiling eyes .
You sitting here eating my fried chicken and can tell me you ’re dreaming ?
And her head went back in girlish pout .
You give me back my something - to - eat this very minute !
But it ’s all part of the dream , I said .
You and the blossoms and the lunch and the weather .
All we need is some cold watermelon or perhaps some peach ice cream .
She arched her eyebrows and shook her head .
Now just listen to him .
Sounds like he wants everything .
I ca n’t figure you out , Mister Movie - Man , she said .
What do you mean ?
The way you talk sometimes .
Once in a while you sound just like one of us and I can’t tell whether you mean it or just do it to make fun of me .
But you know I would n’t make fun of you .
You know I would n’t .
. . .
I hope not , she said , but you do sound like us once in a while , especially when you get that dreamy look on your face .
. . .
I have n’t noticed , I said .
I just talk as I feel .
Well , I guess you feel like us every once in a while , I mean .
Can I ask you a question ?
Anything at all , Miss Teasing Brown , I said .
She smiled and lowered her sandwich .
Where ’d you come from to here , Mister Movie - Man ?
From different places back East , I said .
Oh , she said , I kinda thought so .
. . . You not from Chicago ?
Never been there , I said .
And looking at her nibbling the sandwich , her soft eyes on my face , I thought of some of them .
We had had a rough time , coming through all of that cloudburst of rain , and the unfriendly towns where the oil rigs pounded night and day , making the trip longer and our money shorter and shorter .
Getting stuck in the mud here and having engine trouble there , the tires going twice and the top being split by hailstones the size of baseballs and almost losing all of the equipment off a shaky ferry when we crossed a creek in Missouri .
Still , there was some luck with us — my luck or maybe Karp ’s — I have always honored my luck — and we managed to keep the film and the equipment dry and the patches and the boots held on the tires until we reached her town .
But on our way , moving through the Ozarks and the roads steep and rocky and having to push the car out of ruts and Karp complaining of ever having left the East and complaining , as we strained and sweated in the mud , against all the goy world and all our troubles were goy and our journey goy and goy our schemes .
But then along the way Donelson goaded him on :
Why the hell , Sweet Jesus , did you ever leave Egypt and all those spades ?
Why did n’t you stay and lay Pharaoh ’s second - best daughter and make another Moses ?
Put your back into it , Jew boy .
Act like a white man for once .
And having to step between them .
. .
What would she have made of it , the glamour she longed for locked in such grubby circumstance ?
Driving them as I was driven and some towns suspicious and others without the proper places to work and the people uninterested or the days without sun and the long hot stretches of green green green with no thoughts beyond continuing and little shade — Amen !
Then back there in the town where in the hotel the whores were all so ladylike , with high - style airs and comic bitchery and the bellhops black — except for the fat , bald - headed , full - lipped captain , whose pale , milky skin was so dense with freckles that he looked like a white man who ’d rusted in the rain three days after drowning .
He had our number when we first walked in , though how much of it I could n’t tell , but when I looked at him the spots seemed to detach themselves before my eyes and move to a tango rhythm across his broad expanse of face — da de dum dum — and back again .
His eyes casing me as though to say , I know and you know that I know , so what are you going to do about it ?
I slipped him a five we could n’t afford and I swear those spots returned each to its allotted place — muy pronto .
Thank you suh !
he said .
It ’s awfully white of you .
He knew all right , and he knew someone important , too , selling white women and bootleg whiskey to the leading white citizens and the drummer trade and to a few not so leading black ones who slipped in unctuously wearing starched waiter ’s jackets with the buttons missing .
Yes , suh ! and donating good sums of money to the Afro- American Episcopal Missionary Society and to a finishing school for young black upper-class ladies in Baltimore .
He had it made all right , with certain complications of adjustment it ’s true , but made .
He could have taught us all .
I kept away from him while we waited for sun and opportunity in that town in which he appeared to be the only one with a capacity for fantasy .
Dominated by those high gray walls and the freedom of both those inside and out seemed to be measured in days marked off on the calendar .
I ’m number so - and - so and I know my time and knowing my time I know the who - what - why - wherefore of me .
No dreams , please .
Well , so much the worse for you .
. . .
We tried everyone from the Chamber of Commerce to the bootleggers and no one interested in backing us in bringing a little poetry to the town .
We almost starved , broke and cooking beans in our room , patching and pressing with a secret iron borrowed from one of the girls until her pimp threatened Donelson .
We left before dawn , half drunk and unwashed and our bills unpaid , slipping into the damp streets by the baggage entrance , past seven stacks of pulp magazines abandoned by the drummers —
Argosy , Blue Book , Ace , and Golden Book being saved by the baggage man or the kids in his neighborhood — agent of cultural baggage — doing what he could to keep them reading , stopping on the outskirts of the town as the light grew and buying cheese and crackers in a lamplit general store where the men on the road gang bought their lunch .
And near Holdenville getting those shots of the motorcycle circling the overflow embankment around the storage tank in the refinery yard , leaning toward the parallel and his eyes like set points of madness behind his goggles , bent low , close over the handlebars , roaring as though intent upon circling there forever .
. . .
MOVIE TYCOONS VISIT CITY was the headline and there we were looking out from page 1 , my arms across their shoulders and all three looking dashing and devil - may - care , each with goggles on forehead and each with an air of potency , mystery .
The camera in the foreground .
It made it easy and I kept things simple , a pageant dedicated to the founding of the town with all the old - timers parading past the camera on horseback , or in buck - boards , then sitting before the courthouse in funeral - parlor chairs and an Indian or two in the background .
Shot everything from low angles to make them tall and imposing , and the fire engines I made a half - block long .
Holdenville , yes , the weather was fine and Holdenville could n’t hold us .
No , but what we made there was lost in Ponca City .
Roustabouts , Indians , a thousand and one ranch hands , and Wild Bill Tillman in the flesh in a white suit and white Stetson and astride a white horse every hour of every day in the streets .
Yes , but in the middle of a roaring circus who has time for silent scenes ?
Donelson went wild in the town , getting hot on the dice and winning a thousand then losing our stake before they cooled him off .
Then when he asked to see the dice they threw him into the street .
There was hardly enough money for gas then Karp to the rescue , found a cousin who helped us on our way .
And what a cousin , walking around in a blanket , a bullet - smashed derby , and a necklace of rattlesnake buttons , selling snake oil and mustard plasters .
Morris , the Osage Indian Jew , of whom Karp disapproved .
Listen , Morris said , here there ’s no minyan in fifty miles so what if I temporarily joined another tribe ?
And let me tell you something , wise guy : I been scalped like the best of them !

by Carl Sagan
“ A fire - breathing dragon lives in my garage ”
Suppose ( I ’m following a group therapy approach by the psychologist Richard Franklin ) I seriously make such an assertion to you .
Surely you ’d want to check it out , see for yourself .
There have been innumerable stories of dragons over the centuries , but no real evidence .
What an opportunity !
“ Show me , ” you say .
I lead you to my garage .
You look inside and see a ladder , empty paint cans , an old tricycle — but no dragon .
“ Where ’s the dragon ? ” you ask .
“ Oh , she ’s right here , ” I reply , waving vaguely .
“ I neglected to mention that she ’s an invisible dragon . ”
You propose spreading flour on the floor of the garage to capture the dragon ’s footprints .
“ Good idea , ” I say , “ but this dragon floats in the air . ”
Then you ’ll use an infrared sensor to detect the invisible fire .
“ Good idea , but the invisible fire is also heatless . ”
You ’ll spray - paint the dragon and make her visible .
“ Good idea , but she ’s an incorporeal dragon and the paint wo n’t stick . ”
And so on .
I counter every physical test you propose with a special explanation of why it wo n’t work .
Now , what ’s the difference between an invisible , incorporeal , floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all ?
If there ’s no way to disprove my contention , no conceivable experiment that would count against it , what does it mean to say that my dragon exists ?
Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true .
Claims that cannot be tested , assertions immune to disproof are veridically worthless , whatever value they may have in inspiring us or in exciting our sense of wonder .
What I ’m asking you to do comes down to believing , in the absence of evidence , on my say - so .
The only thing you ’ve really learned from my insistence that there ’s a dragon in my garage is that something funny is going on inside my head .
You ’d wonder , if no physical tests apply , what convinced me .
The possibility that it was a dream or a hallucination would certainly enter your mind .
But then , why am I taking it so seriously ?
Maybe I need help .
At the least , maybe I ’ve seriously underestimated human fallibility .
Imagine that , despite none of the tests being successful , you wish to be scrupulously open - minded .
So you do n’t outright reject the notion that there ’s a fire - breathing dragon in my garage .
You merely put it on hold .
Present evidence is strongly against it , but if a new body of data emerge you ’re prepared to examine it and see if it convinces you .
Surely it ’s unfair of me to be offended at not being believed ; or to criticize you for being stodgy and unimaginative — merely because you rendered the Scottish verdict of “ not proved . ”
Imagine that things had gone otherwise .
The dragon is invisible , all right , but footprints are being made in the flour as you watch .
Your infrared detector reads off - scale .
The spray paint reveals a jagged crest bobbing in the air before you .
No matter how skeptical you might have been about the existence of dragons — to say nothing about invisible ones — you must now acknowledge that there ’s something here , and that in a preliminary way it ’s consistent with an invisible , fire - breathing dragon .
Now another scenario : Suppose it ’s not just me .
Suppose that several people of your acquaintance , including people who you ’re pretty sure do n’t know each other , all tell you that they have dragons in their garages — but in every case the evidence is maddeningly elusive .
All of us admit we ’re disturbed at being gripped by so odd a conviction so ill - supported by the physical evidence .
None of us is a lunatic .
We speculate about what it would mean if invisible dragons were really hiding out in garages all over the world , with us humans just catching on .
I ’d rather it not be true , I tell you .
But maybe all those ancient European and Chinese myths about dragons were n’t myths at all .
Gratifyingly , some dragon - size footprints in the flour are now reported .
But they ’re never made when a skeptic is looking .
An alternative explanation presents itself .
On close examination it seems clear that the footprints could have been faked .
Another dragon enthusiast shows up with a burnt finger and attributes it to a rare physical manifestation of the dragon ’s fiery breath .
But again , other possibilities exist .
We understand that there are other ways to burn fingers besides the breath of invisible dragons .
Such “ evidence ” — no matter how important the dragon advocates consider it — is far from compelling .
Once again , the only sensible approach is tentatively to reject the dragon hypothesis , to be open to future physical data , and to wonder what the cause might be that so many apparently sane and sober people share the same strange delusion .
The 700MHz spectrum set to be auctioned by the Federal Communications Commission next January is some of the most highly sought after bandwidth to be made available in years .
One major wireless player may be left on the outside looking in when the bidding begins , however , if Frontline Wireless has its way .
In a complaint ( PDF ) filed with the FCC late last week , Frontline accused Verizon of violating the FCC 's lobbying rules .
Frontline wants the FCC to impose sanctions on Verizon , up to and including being barred from bidding on the beachfront spectrum that will hopefully become home to a new wireless broadband network .
Frontline is upset about a September 17 meeting between Verizon , FCC Chairman Kevin Martin , the FCC's Wireless Bureau Chief , and a handful of other FCC staffers .
After the meeting , Verizon filed an ex parte letter with the Commission that provided only a brief , one - sentence description of the event .
Frontline calls the brief description an " arrogant violation " of the FCC 's requirement that firms disclose the " summary of the substance " of their meetings with the FCC to other interested parties during ongoing proceedings ( in this case , the rule - making process for the 700MHz auction ) .
The FCC later instructed Verizon to make a more detailed filing covering the substance of the discussions , which Verizon did on September 25 with an additional one - paragraph description .
To no one 's surprise , Verizon used the meeting to rehash its opposition to the open access rules adopted by the FCC for the spectrum auction .
Indeed , Verizon has already sued the FCC in an attempt to get a federal court to overturn what the telecom describes as the " arbitrary " and " capricious " rules .
Like Verizon , Frontline did n't get what it wanted from the FCC during the rule - making process , either .
The company had pitched a plan to the Commission under which the winner of the auction for 10MHz of the available spectrum would also be given half of the 24MHz spectrum allotted for public safety use .
The company guaranteed it would build out the system within 10 years and promised it would reach 99 percent of all Americans .
Instead , the FCC decided to pair two separate 5MHz blocks ( Block D ) with larger blocks of spectrum already reserved for public safety use .
Under the FCC's Public Safety / Private Partnership , the winning bidder (s ) for the 5MHz blocks will need to build a national network good enough to meet coverage and redundancy requirements .
The 10MHz public safety and 5MHz blocks can then be combined to operate a commercial network , but public safety traffic will get priority on the network .
White blocks indicate available 700MHz spectrum .
Data source : FCC
Last week , Frontline asked the FCC to reconsider some of the rules , including what it described as the FCC's " capricious " $ 1.6 billion reserve prices for the 5MHz public safety blocks .
The company also wants the likes of AT&T and Verizon barred from controlling more than 45MHz of the available spectrum in order to avoid " unacceptable anticompetitive effects . "
Getting the FCC to bar Verizon from bidding in the upcoming auction would go a long way towards accomplishing Frontline 's goal of keeping the large telecoms from monopolizing the spectrum .
In the likely event that the FCC decides against preventing Verizon from bidding , Frontline helpfully attached a list of other possible sanctions , including fines and / or barring Verizon from further participation in the FCC 's rule - making process .

Machu Picchu is probably the most familiar symbol of the Inca Empire .
It is often referred to as “ The Lost City of the Incas ” .
The site was designated as a World Heritage Site in 1983 when it was described as “ an absolute masterpiece of architecture and a unique testimony to the Inca civilization ” .
Machu Picchu was constructed around 1450 , at the height of the Inca empire , and was abandoned less than 100 years later , as the empire collapsed under Spanish conquest .
Although the citadel is located only about 50 miles from Cusco , the Inca capital , it was never found and destroyed by the Spanish , as were many other Inca sites .
Over the centuries , the surrounding jungle grew to enshroud the site , and few knew of its existence .
In 1911 , Yale historian and explorer Hiram Bingham brought the “ lost ” city to the world ’s attention .
Bingham and others hypothesized that the citadel was the traditional birthplace of the Inca people or the spiritual center of the “ virgins of the sun , ” while curators of a recent exhibit have speculated that Machu Picchu was a royal retreat .
2 ANGKOR ( Cambodia ) : Contains the world ’s largest religious monument [ Wiki ]
Angkor served as the seat of the Khmer empire that flourished from approximately the 9th century to the 15th century A.D. More precisely , the Angkorian period may be defined as the period from 802 A.D. , when the Khmer Hindu monarch Jayavarman II declared himself the “ universal monarch ” and “ god-king ” of Cambodia , until 1431 A.D. , when Thai invaders sacked the Khmer capital , causing its population to migrate south to the area of Phnom Penh .
The ruins of Angkor are located amid forests and farmland to the north of the Great Lake ( Tonle Sap ) and south of the Kulen Hills , near modern day Siem Reap ( 13°24 ’N , 103°51 ’E ) , and are a UNESCO World Heritage Site .
The temples of the Angkor area number over one thousand , ranging in scale from nondescript piles of brick rubble scattered through rice fields to the magnificent Angkor Wat , said to be the world ’s largest single religious monument .
Many of the temples at Angkor have been restored , and together they comprise the most significant site of Khmer architecture .
Visitor numbers approach one million annually .
In 2007 an international team of researchers using satellite photographs and other modern techniques concluded that Angkor had been the largest preindustrial city in the world with an urban sprawl of 1,150 square miles .
The closest rival to Angkor , the Mayan city of Tikal in Guatemala , was roughly 50 square miles in total size .
3 MEMPHIS ( Egypt ) : ancient capital of Egypt [ Wiki ]
Memphis was the ancient capital of the first nome of Lower Egypt , and of the Old Kingdom of Egypt from its foundation until around 2200 BC and later for shorter periods during the New Kingdom , and an administrative centre throughout ancient history .
Its Ancient Egyptian name was Ineb Hedj ( “ The White Walls ” ) .
The name “ Memphis ” is the Greek deformation of the Egyptian name of Pepi I ’s ( 6th dynasty ) pyramid , Men-nefer , which became Menfe in Coptic .
According to Herodotus , the city was founded around 3100 BC by Menes , who united the two kingdoms of Egypt .
Estimates of population size differ widely .
According to T. Chandlerm , Memphis had some 30,000 inhabitants and was by far the largest settlement worldwide from the time of its foundation until around 2250 BC and from 1557 to 1400 BC .
Memphis reached a peak of prestige under the 6th Dynasty as a centre of the cult of Ptah .
It declined briefly after the 18th Dynasty with the rise of Thebes and was revived under the Persian satraps before falling firmly into second place following the foundation of Alexandria .
Under the Roman Empire , Alexandria remained the most important city and Memphis remained the second city of Egypt until the establishment of Fustat ( or Fostat ) in 641 .
It was then largely abandoned and became a source of stone for the surrounding settlements .
It was still an imposing set of ruins in the 12th century but soon became little more than an expanse of low ruins and scattered stone .
The remains of the temple of Ptah and of Apis have been uncovered at the site as well as a few statues , including two four - metre ones in alabaster of Ramesses II .
The Saqqara necropolis is close to Memphis .
4 PETRA : stone structures carved into rocks [ Wiki ]
Petra ( “ Rock ” ) lies on the slope of Mount Hor ( Jordan ) in a basin among the mountains which form the eastern flank of Arabah ( Wadi Araba ) , the large valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba .
It is famous for having many stone structures carved into the rock .
The long - hidden site was revealed to the Western world by the Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1812 .
It was famously described as “ a rose - red city half as old as time ” in a Newdigate prize - winning sonnet by John William Burgon .
Burgon had not actually visited Petra , which remained accessible only to Europeans accompanied by local guides with armed escorts until after World War I .
The site was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985 when it was described as “ one of the most precious cultural properties of man ’s cultural heritage . ”
Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream , Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to Gaza in the west , to Bosra and Damascus in the north , to Aqaba and Leuce Come on the Red Sea , and across the desert to the Persian Gulf .
Petra ’s decline came rapidly under Roman rule , in large part due to the revision of sea - based trade routes .
In 363 an earthquake destroyed buildings and crippled the vital water management system .
The ruins of Petra were an object of curiosity in the Middle Ages and were visited by the Sultan Baibars of Egypt towards the close of the 13th century .
The first European to describe them was Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1812 .
5 PALMYRA ( Syria ) : the Bride of the Desert [ Wiki ]
Palmyra was in the ancient times an important city of central Syria .
It has long been a vital caravan city for travellers crossing the Syrian desert and was known as the Bride of the Desert .
The earliest documented mention of the city by its pre-Semitic name Tadmor , Tadmur or Tudmur , is recorded in Babylonian tablets found in Mari .
Though the ancient site fell into disuse after the 16th century , it is still known as Tadmor and there is a small newer settlement next to the ruins of the same name .
n the mid-first century , Palmyra , a wealthy and elegant city located along the caravan routes linking Persia with the Mediterranean ports of Roman Syria and Phoenicia , came under Roman control .
During the following period of great prosperity , the Arab citizens of Palmyra adopted customs and modes of dress from both the Iranian Parthian world to the east and the Graeco - Roman west .
Tadmor is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible ( Second Book of Chronicles 8:4 ) as a desert city built by the King Solomon of Judea , the son of David .
Palmyra was made part of the Roman province of Syria during the reign of Tiberius ( 14–37 ) .
It steadily grew in importance as a trade route linking Persia , India , China , and the Roman empire .
In 634 the first Muslims arrived in Palmyra .
The city was taken by the Muslim Arabs under Khalid ibn Walid in 636 .
In the 6th century , Fakhreddine al Maany castle was built on top of a mountain overlooking the oasis .
The castle was surrounded by a moat , with access only available through a drawbridge .
The city of Palmyra was kept intact .
After year 800 , people started abandoning the city .
6 POMPEII ( Italy ) : buried by the volcano [ Wiki ]
Along with Herculaneum , this Roman city near modern Naples was destroyed and completely buried during a catastrophic eruption of the volcano Mount Vesuvius spanning two days on 24 August year 79 .
The volcano collapsed higher roof - lines and buried Pompeii under many meters of ash and pumice , and it was lost for nearly 1700 years before its accidental rediscovery in 1748 .
Since then , its excavation has provided an extraordinarily detailed insight into the life of a city at the height of the Roman Empire .
Today , it is one of the most popular tourist attractions of Italy and a UNESCO World Heritage Site .
7 PALENQUE ( Mexico ) : one of Mayan ’s most exquisite cities [ Wiki ]
Palenque is an ancient Maya city near the Usumacinta River in the Mexican state of Chiapas .
It contains some of the finest architecture , sculpture , roof comb and bas -relief carvings the Maya produced .
The ancient Mayan city of Palenque , with its superb jungle setting and exquisite architecture and decoration , is one of the marvels of Mexico .
First occupied around 100 BC , it flourished from about 600 to 700 AD , and what a glorious century that was .
The city rose to prominence under Pakal , a club - footed king who reigned from 615 to 683 AD , represented by hieroglyphs of sun and shield , he is also referred to as Sun Shield or White Macaw .
During Pakal ’s reign , many plazas and buildings , including the superlative Templo de las Inscripciones ( his Mausoleum ) , were constructed in Palenque , characterized by very fine stucco bas - reliefs .
Pakal ’s son Chan -Bahlum II continued Palenque ’s political and economic expansion and the development of its art and architecture and presided over the construction of the Grupo de la Cruz temples , placing sizable narrative stone stelae within each .
One can see the influence of Palenque ’s architecture in the Mayan city of Tikal .
The rival Mayan city of Toniná ’s hostility was perhaps the major factor in Palenque ’s precipitous decline after Chan - Bahlum II ’s death in 702 .
Sources speak of a devastating Toniná attack on Palenque in 730 .
After the 10th century Palenque was largely abandoned .
In an area that receives the heaviest rainfall in Mexico , the ruins lay undiscovered until the 18th century .
Frans Blom , an early - to - mid - 20th century investigator remarked : ‘ The first visit to Palenque is immensely impressive .
When one has lived there for some time this ruined city becomes an obsession . ’
8 VIJAYANAGAR ( India ) : capital of one of the largest Hindu empires [ Wiki ]
Vijayanagar , the capital of one of the largest Hindu empires ever , was founded by Sangama dynasty princes Harihara and Bukka in 1336 .
Its power peaked under Krishnadevaraya ( 1509 - 29 ) , when it controlled nearly the whole of the peninsula south of the Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers .
Comparable to Delhi in the 14th century , the city , with an estimated population of half a million , covered 33 sq km and was surrounded by several concentric lines of fortification .
Its wealth derived from the control of spice trade and the cotton industry .
Its busy bazaars , described by travelers such as Portuguese Nunez and Paes , were centers of international commerce .
The empire collapsed after the battle of Talikota in 1565 when the city was ransacked by the confederacy of Deccan sultans ( Bidar , Bijapur , Golconda , Ahmednagar and Berar ) , thus opening up southern India for Muslim conquest .
The ruins are set in a strange and beautiful boulder strewn landscape with an almost magical quality .
The undisputed highlight , the 16th century Vittala Temple , is a World Heritage Monument .
Started by Krishnadevaraya , it was never finished or consecrated ; its incredible sculptural work is the pinnacle of Vijayanagar art .
The outer pillars are known as musical pillars as they reverberate when tapped .
An ornate stone chariot in the temple courtyard containing an image of Garuda .
9 EPHESUS ( Turkey ) : one of the most important cities of early Christianity [ Wiki ]
Ephesus was an Ionian Greek city in ancient Anatolia , founded by colonists from Athens in the 10th century BC .
The city was located in Ionia , where the Cayster River ( Küçük Menderes ) flows into the Aegean Sea , and was part of the Panionian League .
Ephesus hosted one of the seven churches of Asia , addressed in the Book of Revelation ( 2:1 –7 ) .
It is also the site of a large Gladiator graveyard .
Ephesus was an important center for early Christianity .
Paul used it as a base .
He became embroiled in a dispute with artisans , whose livelihood depended on the Temple of Artemis there ( Acts 19:23 –41 ) , and wrote 1 Corinthians from Ephesus .
Later Paul wrote to the Christian community at Ephesus .
10 SANCHI ( India ) : the best - preserved group of Buddhist monuments [ Wiki ]
A UNESCO world heritage site in central India near the Betwa River , Sanchi is on a flat - topped sandstone hill , 90 m above the countryside , and stands the best - preserved group of Buddhist monuments in India .
Most noteworthy is the Great Stupa , discovered in 1818 .
It was probably begun by the emperor Asoka in the mid-3rd century BCE and later enlarged .
Solid throughout , it is enclosed by a massive stone railing pierced by four gateways on which are elaborate carvings depicting the life of the Buddha .
The stupa itself consists of a base bearing a hemispherical dome representing the dome of heaven enclosing the Earth ; it is surmounted by a squared rail unit , the world mountain , from which rises a mast to symbolize the cosmic axis .
The mast bears umbrellas that represent the various heavens .
Other remains include several smaller stupas , an assembly hall ( caitya ) , an Asokan pillar with inscription , and several monasteries ( 4th–11th cent .
CE ) .
Several relic baskets and more than 400 epigraphical records have also been discovered .

Few topics have ever been more exhaustively analyzed and discussed within Internet / Macintosh based forums than the Apple AirPort feature “ Interference Robustness . ”
The lack of information made available by Apple regarding the feature makes for a lot of confused and curious Mac users .
Unfortunately the aforementioned forums appear to be the only venue through which one can find any significant information regarding Interference Robustness .
In fact , I ran a quick search on “ Mac Help ” on my MacBook Pro and within all the documentation provided by Apple , Interference Robustness was mentioned on a single occasion .
And that reference was limited to “ If you are using an AirPort Extreme wireless card and are experiencing network interference , you can use the status menu to turn on Interference Robustness . ”
Simple enough , but several questions remain : “ What does it do and how does it work ?
When should I use it ?
If it cuts down on interference should n’t I leave it on all the time ? ”
These specific questions appear to be the most common topic of discussion online , and they 're specific questions that have been left unanswered .
Whether it ’s by design ( for one Steve Jobs reason or another ) or simply that they believe it ’s self - explanatory , the fact remains that Interference Robustness is the Area 51 of OS X .
I know it seems a bit cheeky to compare an OS X feature to a highly secure government compound which is said to host the development and testing of military aircraft , but seriously , try for yourself - Google it .
After some serious scouring , I honestly believe you ’d be more successful obtaining information regarding the goings on at the Groom Lake compound .
So after I ’d received no sound explanation from “ Mac Help , ” I went one step further and ran a similar search on the Apple website and was actually surprised to find zero results on the topic .
I then moved on to the Apple Support page and ran a similar query that provided me with 17 matches .
The majority of the results provided instructions on how to enable the feature through your AirPort and AirPort Extreme .
What they did not provide were answers to the questions people have been asking .
So what the heck is it ?
In order to move forward and tackle these questions and uncover the inner workings of Interference Robustness , we first need to cover some of the basics of Wireless Local Access Networks ( WLAN . )
Basic home networks utilize the 802.11 standard ( Wi - Fi ) developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE . )
To the best of my knowledge , all home networking hardware utilizes this standard .
Different variations of the 802.11 standard exist , beginning with 802.11a and adding modulation ratifications of 802.11 b , g , and the most recent n .
Each new modulation standard resolved issues from previous versions while also increasing range and data rate .
For instance , the indoor range for 802.11a is roughly 35 meters while the range for 802.11n is roughly 70 meters .
I ’m sure all of you can imagine how one would benefit from using a router that supported 802.11n in your home or home / office .
The amendments to the standards changed a lot of things but what they did n’t change was the operating frequency .
They operate under a 2.4- 2.5
Ghz band .
This is troublesome simply because most home appliances operate in the same band .
For instance most home cordless phones , microwave ovens and most Bluetooth devices have an op .
frequency of 2,4 Ghz .
So one can see how each connection may face interference .
Most wireless hardware manufacturers have already taken preemptive measures to battle interference from other sources .
Interference Robustness is Apple AirPort ’s insurance policy against interference caused by outside variables .
It ’s also important to understand that if you run a Mac and use a Linksys , Netgear , Belkin or one of the many other options one has , checking the “ Use Interference Robustness ” option will not work .
Interference Robustness is specific to Macs connected to Apple ’s AirPort Express and Airport Extreme .
So with all that having been said let ’s answer some questions .
What does it do ?
How does it work ?
The 802.11 protocol was designed to essentially adjust itself to protect itself from interference .
More specifically it adjusts packet size .
The idea is this : send smaller packets at higher speeds , and the access point will more securely receive the packets .
So when faced with interference , this option will literally adjust the transmission of packets to ensure the access point receives more packets .
When should I use it ?
It really depends on the situation .
Some users will experience WLAN issues based on the specific products they have in their home in this case use Interference Robustness .
Others will face WLAN issues because they either live or work in a highly populated area such as an apartment building or office building .
This would be an ideal time to use Interference Robustness .
Basically , whenever you face WLAN interference that is caused by outside variables , Interference Robustness will help .
If it cuts down on interference , should n’t I leave it on all the time ?
No .
This is very important to understand .
Using Interference Robustness will essentially slow down your wireless connection .
As discussed above , if you ’re looking for speed , you send a high frequency of large packets .
If you ’re looking to battle interference you send smaller packets at a lower frequency .
So your connection will be slow but strong .
I hope this helps you better understand why it ’s there and why it ’s necessary – for some more importantly how it works !

The Clash Within : Democracy , Religious Violence , and India 's Future by Martha C. Nussbaum Belknap Press / Harvard University Press , 403 pp. , $ 29.95
Last summer Foreign Affairs , Time , Newsweek , and The Economist highlighted a major shift in American perceptions of India when , in cover stories that appeared almost simultaneously , they described the country as a rising economic power and a likely “ strategic ally ” of the United States .
In 1991 , India partly opened its protectionist economy to foreign trade and investment .
Since then agriculture , which employs more than 60 percent of the country ’s population , has stagnated , but the services sector has grown as corporate demand has increased in Europe and America for India ’s software engineers and English - speaking back - office workers .
1
In 2006 , India ’s economy grew at a remarkable 9.2 percent .
Dominated by modern office buildings , cafés , and gyms , and swarming with Blackberry - wielding executives of financial and software companies , parts of Indian cities such as Bangalore , Hyderabad , and Gurgaon resemble European and American downtowns .
Regular elections and increasingly free markets make India appear to be a more convincing exemplar of economic globalization than China , which has adopted capitalism without embracing liberal democracy .
However , many other aspects of India today make Foreign Affairs ’ description of the country — “ a roaring capitalist success - story ” — appear a bit optimistic .
More than half of the children under the age of five in India are malnourished ; failed crops and debt drove more than a hundred thousand farmers to suicide in the past decade .
2
Uneven economic growth and resulting inequalities have thrown up formidable new challenges to India ’s democracy and political stability .
A recent report in the International Herald Tribune warned :
Crime rates are rising in the major cities , a band of Maoist - inspired rebels is bombing and pillaging its way across a wide swath of central India , and violent protests against industrialization projects are popping up from coast to coast .
3
Militant Communist movements are only the most recent instance of the political extremism that has been on the rise since the early Nineties when India began to integrate into the global economy .
Until 2004 the central government as well as many state governments in India were , as the philosopher Martha Nussbaum puts it in her new book ,
increasingly controlled by right - wing Hindu extremists who condone and in some cases actively support violence against minorities , especially the Muslim minority .
Many seek fundamental changes in India ’s pluralistic democracy .
In 1992 , the Hindu nationalist BJP ( Indian People ’s Party ) gave early warning of its intentions when its members demolished the sixteenth - century Babri Mosque in North India , leading to the deaths of thousands in Hindu–Muslim riots across the country .
In May 1998 , just two months after it came to power , the BJP broke India ’s self - imposed moratorium on nuclear testing by exploding five atomic bombs in the desert of Rajasthan .
Pakistan responded with five nuclear tests of its own .
The starkest evidence of Hindu extremism came in late February and March 2002 in the prosperous western Indian state of Gujarat .
In a region internationally famous for its business communities , Hindu mobs lynched over two thousand Muslims and left more than two hundred thousand homeless .…
I ’m approaching the 2008 election with a newfound sense of cynicism , but still feel an obligation to my country .
As it stands , all of my votes will be based entirely on YouTube videos .
So , it ’s looking like I wo n’t be voting for Dennis Kucinich
BRUSSELS -- Microsoft Corp .'s decision to drop its nine - year fight with European regulators could signal tougher regulation ahead for big , global technology companies operating in Europe .

This animation was made by projecting present - day plate motions into the future , and trying to take into account unpredictable events , such as the formation of new subduction zones .
By extending present - day plate motions into the future we can easily predict that Africa will collide with southern Europe closing the Mediterranean , that Australia will collide with S.E. Asia and China , and California will slide northward along the west coast .
Subduction is now beginning in the Central Indian Ocean , and it seems likely that new subduction zones will form off the east coast of the Americas .
( Subduction has already begun in the Puerto Rican trench and Scotia arc. )
If this happens , then Antarctica will be drawn northward towards India , and the Atlantic will close forming a new ring - shaped Pangea .
The dark blue areas are deep ocean basins .
The light blue areas are flooded continental shelves and oceanic plateaus .
The tan areas are land , and the yellow areas are mountains .
The continents are covered by the sea when there is a lot of rifting going on , and they are emergent when the continents are in collision .

The SEO community ’s buzzing over official word from Google that selling text links can hurt your PR and rankings .
It ’s truly sad that $ 600 - a- share Google is willing to ruin its own search results because they can’t figure out how to differentiate paid ads from useful links .
They ’re not always different things , either , one of many reasons why penalizing a site for carrying a text link is just wrong .
The search giant ’s argument is that too many people are buying links on websites in order to artificially boost their PageRank , a factor in determining search result ranking .
If you do n’t know why buying links affects Google , read Chris Beasley ’s Search Engine Optimization Guide .
It ’s truly the best SEO resource on the web .
All of the facts , none of the myths , based on tried and tested experience .
A poor quality site could potentially rank higher in search results than higher quality sites by buying many links from high - PageRank sites .
When Google ’s search results do n’t bring you the best sites first , they ’re less useful to searchers , and those searchers are more likely to consider alternative search engines like Live , Yahoo ! or Ask .
I recommend you try them all yourself anyway , as they ’ve all been working extremely hard over the past year to compete .
Especially Live and Yahoo ! have made huge leaps forward .
Their indexes are fresher , their algorithms smarter , and their presentation often gets you what you want faster than Google ’s bland result pages .
To get back on topic , Google needs to know the difference between a site linking out because it found the destination site useful to its visitors — an editorial vote for the site as PageRank is based on — versus a purchased link there because an advertiser paid for it .
They ’ve tried to do so algorithmically , and they ’re pretty good at it .
A link among a cluster at the top or bottom of a page , or near text like “ sponsors ” is worth less than one occurring amidst a paragraph of text in an article .
That ’s great .
That ’s what they ’re paying all those Ph.D. ’s to do — make Google smart enough to rank the web no matter what any site tries to do to manipulate the rankings .
But somehow they feel they ’re not identifying enough this way , and took it further , much further .
Official word now is that if Google knows you ’re selling text advertisements and that the buyers are purchasing them in order to benefit from your PageRank , that Google will penalize the seller ’s site .
Not penalize the links , but penalize the entire website selling them .
If it ’s a high - PageRank site , they ’ll knock down your PR .
If it ’s not , they ’ll directly hurt your search result rankings .
Either way the effect is to make your site appear less , if at all , in search results , reducing your traffic from Google .
Perhaps if you stop selling ads and swear off the practice , you ’ll get the penalties removed .
This is where a whole bunch of people cheer “ it ’s about time ! ” .
This is good for Google users , right ?
It ’s their search engine , they can dictate the rules however they like , and something that hurts those manipulating results by buying links is a good thing .
But I wholeheartedly disagree .
The premise that this improves the search results is n’t entirely true .
Sites selling text links are n’t somehow less useful because they support themselves on that type of advertising .
They ’re not somehow a less perfect match to what a Google searcher typed into the search box .
They ’re not somehow less worthy of the votes they got from other sites that gave them their result positions in the first place .
If at issue were only off - topic , clearly useless links that have no value to users of the linking site , I would n’t have a problem with this .
It ’d still be a further reaching “ rule ” than I ’d like , but I could accept that Google wants to devalue sites that are devaluing themselves by mucking up their content with off - topic links .
Those are less useful sites and deserve lower rankings .
But this is about all link advertising .
If a site only accepts advertisers whose sites complement their own , sites they would n’t be ashamed to vouch for anyway , then there ’s no reason to penalize that seller .
The amazingly informative and useful web we have today , which contains so much more in quantity and quality than the web of a decade ago , exists largely because there is money to be made here .
Commerce makes the internet go ’round just like the rest of the world .
Content producers and service providers create these websites because there ’s a potential to make money .
And text advertising , even when advertisers specifically want text links without “ nofollow ” attributes , support tens of thousands of these sites .
Google ’s success is built on the back of the high quality of the websites it indexes .
If doing a Google search did n’t bring you to a website with what you desired , there would be no reason to search .
These ad - supported websites are why Google has a market cap of $ 190 billion .
By penalizing sites for selling text advertising , Google is damaging their own search results .
They ’re removing good results from the list instead of the bad ones — the buyers that ranked artificially high .
This is wholly unlike anything Google ’s ever done .
Let ’s not forget that Google is the largest seller of text link advertising in the world themselves .
Buying text ads from Google is perfectly alright , but anyone else selling them without the “ ignore me please Google flag ” attached to each link is someone not worth indexing .
It ’s almost monopolistic to control so much of the advertising landscape , so much of the search traffic , and to use bullying like this with their search dominance to discourage advertising outside of their own service .
I think what Google has said they ’re doing is wrong .
It ’s wrong to penalize good sites that make money selling on - topic text ads that happen to not be Google AdSense ads .
It ’s wrong to screw up their own search results to make that happen .
It ’s wrong to apply the penalties manually , by people making judgement calls on a tiny subset of the web .
The only thing that would make me less disgusted with Google on this issue is if they were to backpedal and explain they are only concerned with the sites that sell completely off - topic links that have no value to users and only serve to manipulate search results .
Framework comparisons
Web framework comparisons are inevitable , and they 've been showing up more and more often .
A couple of weeks ago , Alan Green and Ben Askins put together a " RailsVsDjango " report , and they presented their findings at the Open Source Developers ' Conference in Melbourne , Australia .
In the latest batch , both from the last 24 hours , we 've got a relatively flame - baitish comparison of Django and Rails , along with a much more constructive comparison .
Reading comparisons like this , I 'm always reminded of a Mark Pilgrim piece from a couple of years ago .
NASA sure loves vehicles , and the agency is mighty proud of its latest effort , the Chariot lunar truck .
Designed from start to finish in just a year , the Chariot features 12 wheels driven by two electric motors through a two - speed transmission , allowing it to perform in a " bulldozer " mode with up to 4000 pounds of force or cruise at up to fifteen miles an hour .
The modular design also means that the steel alloy frame can be fitted with several different crew / payload combinations , including a small pressurized cabin and a sample collector .
There 's no telling when the Chariot might be deployed , of course , but we 're not going to be convinced until we see it stop a plane or drive through a swinging girder obstacle course .

Facebook ANKARA , Turkey ( AP ) 
The crossing of two U.S. jets into Turkish airspace over the border with Iraq appears to have been inadvertent , a U.S. Embassy official said Monday , a day after the Turkish military complained of the incursion .
The embassy official said the incident was under investigation .
The Turkish military reported on its website Sunday that two F - 16 jets roamed into the Turkish airspace for four minutes on Thursday , over the region of Uzumlu , in the province of Hakkari which borders Iraq .
It said it had informed the Turkish Foreign Ministry of the violation , and asked it to take the appropriate steps .
The U.S. official , speaking on condition of anonymity in line with embassy rules , said that " at this point , it appears to be an inadvertent crossing into Turkish airspace , and we will take action as appropriate once the finding is complete . "
" We respect Turkish airspace ; we have good relations with Turkey and take the issue very seriously , " the embassy official said .
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul played down the incident , saying Monday that such incursions occurred from time to time , NTV television reported .
The incursion occurred amid intensified debate in Turkey about whether to conduct a cross - border operation into northern Iraq to pursue separatist Kurdish rebels who stage attacks inside Turkey from bases there .
Turkish media have been reporting that the army was massing troops along the border , including in Uzumlu .
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said this week he would back Turkey 's generals if they decide to strike Kurdish rebels in Iraq .

An Australian " lawyer " is part of a gang of six up before Southwark Crown Court accused of attempting to convince the Bank of England to honour a breathtaking £ 28 bn ( $ 64.83bn ) in moody £ 1,000 and £ 500,000 notes , AFP reports .
The cunning plan centred on an " avalanche " of fake £ 1 k bills and 360 so - called " special issue " £ 500 k denominations .
The former were withdrawn from circulation in 1943 , with just 63 examples unaccounted for , while the latter never existed .
The court heard that the alleged crims ' " chief " Chin " Daniel " Lim , 50 , from Malaysia , together with Ross Cowie , 62 , who " described himself as an Australian lawyer " ; Kim Ming Teo , 41 , " said to be another lawyer " ; Ping Shuen Mak , 56 , from Hong Kong ; Kwok Kwong Chan , 55 , from China ; and Chi Kuen Chung , 53 , from Hong Kong , attempted to persuade Bank of England officials that the currency " belonged to a family of former Chinese nationalist officials - the oldest of whom was aged 116 " .
Martin Evan , prosecuting , told the court : " This case concerns what the prosecution say was an audacious plan to present counterfeits , pieces of paper that resembled - the prosecution would say only slightly - bank notes in order to persuade the Bank of England to honour the promise all bank notes carry , the promise to ' pay the bearer ' the amount shown . "
Evans further explained that if the notes had been genuine , it would have meant they were " worth nearly three quarters of the £ 39 billion currently in use around the world " .
Apart from the obvious flaw in the alleged scheme - the invention of a half - mil note - the jury heard that " the apparently forged signature on the notes was incorrect " .
AFP explains : " Sir Jasper Quintus Hollam - who was not appointed the chief cashier of the Bank of England until 1963 - always used his first two initials when signing his name , rather than just the second the alleged counterfeiters had used . "
The defendants , all of whom live in the London area , are charged with one count of conspiring to defraud the Bank of England between 1 December 2006 and 27 March this year .
All deny the charge .
The trial is expected to last six weeks . ®
David Shuster filled in for Chris Matthews this evening on " Hardball " where he interviewed neo-con author , Fouad Ajami , and absolutely shredded him over his Wall Street Journal OpEd comparing Scooter Libby to fallen U.S. Soldiers in Iraq .

BY ABOUT the age of six , the human brain is as big as it is ever going to be .
That may surprise most grown - ups , who notice that children do not display the mental agility of adults ( even though many fancy their own little angels are geniuses ) .
Children can remember facts but are less good at recalling the context in which those facts are relevant .
And they are easily swayed from long - term goals .
Even when youngsters try their hardest they cannot wait 15 minutes for two biscuits if they can scoff one now instead .
But as people grow , their brains change .
Before full volume is attained , the pruning starts .
Grey matter gets picked away at different rates in different parts of the organ .
Brain cells form white matter as their arms become covered in fatty sheaths that , like the plastic insulation around a metal wire , stop electrical signals leaking out as they zip along the nerve cells .
As the grey matter diminishes , the white matter steadily increases .
Which is why the brain can mature from an organ of overwhelmingly short - range connections into one with many long - distance links , as Bradley Schlaggar and his colleagues at Washington University , in St Louis , have found .
Dr Schlaggar likes to create diagrams of brain function using a technique called graph theory that is used , among other things , to analyse demand on power grids and the structure of the Internet .
He asks volunteers to lie in brain scanners and to think about whatever they wish .
Then he tries to identify which parts of the brain are simultaneously active — or almost so .
Where activity exceeds certain statistical thresholds , he plots a line between those bits of the brain on his diagrams .
Networking skills
This approach has led Dr Schlaggar to suggest why it is that adults can better resist impulses that derail long - term goals in children .
His work is based on an idea by his colleague Steven Petersen , who recently developed the hypothesis that two networks , rather than two areas of the brain ( as the mainstream theory has it ) , keep the adult mind concentrated on long - term achievement .
Dr Petersen and his colleagues identified 39 regions of the brain that were active when university students applied themselves to ten different tasks , each with varying levels of surprise built in .
Whether the students were listening to repetitive sounds and trying to predict when the next tone would come , or pushing the correct button if pairs of words were matched or mismatched in their meanings , some consistent synchronisation emerged .
Seven of the 39 regions looked busy when the brain was pursuing a successful strategy and maintaining a consistent effort .
Eleven other parts chipped in when that strategy slipped up and some innovation was needed for the student to complete the task .
Dr Petersen postulated that the first seven regions form one network , which he calls the “ cingulo - opercular network ” , and the second 11 form another , the “ frontoparietal network ” .
Dr Schlaggar next wondered how the connections within these two networks might develop .
So he turned to a second group , made up of children and teenagers , and asked them to think about whatever they liked while he scanned the blood flow inside the same 39 regions of their brains and calculated which parts were acting in unison .
What he found came as a shock .
In the 49 children , aged seven to nine , the two networks were always bound into a single web ; in the 43 adolescents , some of those connections had been undone ; and in his 47 adult volunteers , aged over 21 , the brain regions fired as two distinct networks .
Moreover , the web of activity inside the children 's heads depicted the cingulo - opercular ( sustaining ) network as being clamped inside the frontoparietal ( rapidly adapting ) one , suggesting why it is that youngsters grab one biscuit now rather than wait for two later .
Both studies were published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
But why are children no good at recalling the context in which they learn facts when they retain those facts fairly well ?
This question was fodder for an experiment by Noa Ofen , of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and her colleagues , described in this week 's online edition of Nature Neuroscience .
Like Dr Schlaggar , Dr Ofen measured the blood flow in the brains of young people , this time aged eight to 24 .
Rather than letting their minds wander , though , she asked her volunteers to try to remember photographs of 250 scenes .
Some were of kitchens or halls , others showed landscapes from her holidays in America and Israel .
When they came out of the scanner , Dr Ofen then tested her volunteers on how well they could recall the pictures .
Mixing those images with photographs that they had not previously seen , she asked whether each one was new or familiar and , if the latter , whether the volunteers could remember something about the context in which it had appeared .
Age , she found , did not help people recognise her snaps correctly .
However , it did steadily enrich the details they could add about the experience of forming the memory .
The scans enabled Dr Ofen to link her findings to brain development .
She noticed that , for all her volunteers , a part of the brain involved in forming memories — the medial temporal lobe — was flushed with blood whenever an image appeared in the scanner .
A second region called the lateral prefrontal cortex was also active in her older volunteers , and was most active in those aged over 18 during the formation of those memories whose context they best recalled .
She thus suspects that this could help to explain how fuller - bodied memories form as people grow old .
And to link her findings with the pruning of grey matter and the augmentation of white , Dr Ofen counted pixels of the two types of matter in two particularly important parts of that brain region .
Richer recollections indeed came with the whitening of older age .
O2 : Unlimited means less than 35 megs Another day , another " unlimited " claim .
This time from the mouth of O2’s CEO regarding their new " unlimited " data plans .
What he did n’t tell people at the iPhone unveiling is that unlimited actually means just 35 megs .
Spot the difference .
I ’ve been considering writing about the abuse of the word " unlimited " for a while and the unveiling of the UK iPhone yesterday has finally pushed me over the edge .
In the Q&A session after the presentation , O2 CEO , Matthew Key was asked " does unlimited usage truly mean unlimited ? " .
It ’s an excellent question because unlimited never means unlimited .
It ’s no practical and we all know it , yet companies still use the word to describe things , often accompanied with an asterisk , a footer and a link to a fair usage policy .
Sure enough , Key ’s response :
There is a limit : 1,400 internet pages per day would break the deal as part of fair usage agreement .
So skipping over the unlimited - with - a - limit part , what does 1,400 pages actually get you ?
This is important because downloading web pages is the least of my bandwidth consumption .
My n95 gets my podcasts and streams film from my computer so if , when O2 upgrades all its customers to " unlimited " data plans , I need to know what I ’m actually getting .
1,400 pages = 35megs
I could make up my own figures based on the weight of existing web - pages and use that but thankfully O2 already have published numbers saying what each megabyte gets you : 40 pages — a figure reiterated on the introduction letter that customers get sent in their first month .
A bit of jiggery - pokery and you can see that 1,400 pages = 35 megs .
As a daily browsing limit that ’s actually not so bad but there is one big loophole that O2 could still exploit to bring this figure down .
Notice what Key said :
1,400 internet pages per day would break the deal
So what does n’t break the deal ?
1,399 ?
Or 12 ?
So what you ’re really allowed to use is less than 35 megs a day .
Who knows what the real figure is going to be …
this is n’t , by any means , unlimited
This abuse of " unlimited " is n’t uncommon and 35 megs a day is n’t strange — it works out at around a gig a month .
If you dig through the fair usage policies of other mobile operators you ’ll see that it ’s perfectly in - line with the industry .
What I take offence with is that this is n’t , by any means , unlimited .
This is all exacerbated when you have a 3G connection and you can download things at 1.4 Mbps .
You could very easily use your daily bandwidth limit with 10 minutes of streaming video .
Using " unlimited " should be banned unless the service provider actually means to allow unlimited usage — something they ca n’t do anyway .
If they mean 1gig per month , they should say 1gig per month and not pussyfoot around .

XM Satellite Radio Holdings and Sirius Satellite Radio have agreed to merge , the two companies said today .
The deal would consolidate the only two companies in the emerging business of subscription - only satellite radio , and is sure to face scrutiny from federal regulators .
Investors and analysts have been speculating about a deal for months .
The two companies said in a statement that Mel Karmazin , the chief executive of Sirius , would become chief executive of the new company while Gary Parsons , the chairman of XM , would remain in that role .
Under terms of the deal , stockholders of XM will get 4.6 shares of Sirius for each share of XM , valuing XM at $ 4.57 billion .
Bush as Dictator – Not so Far Fetched – BE VERY AFRAID
This is extremely SCARY .
We might want to start paying more attention to this particular part of the Declaration of Independence .
Maybe it ’s time we all sat up and took notice .

As the nation focused on whether Congress would exercise its constitutional duty to cut funding for the war , Bush quietly issued an unconstitutional bombshell that went virtually unnoticed by the corporate media .

-- Bill O'Reilly , The Radio Factor with Bill O'Reilly " Tonight , " opens MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann , " as in the past few days , Bill O'Reilly has devoted large sections of his shows to defending himself against critics who pointed out the racism in his surprise that people in a black - owned restaurant know how to order iced tea without cursing about somebody 's mother . "
Though " an argument can be made " for a parallel between racism and mental deficiency , says Olbermann , he seeks to take a serious look into the possibility of real psychological problems plaguing the host of Fox News '
The O'Reilly Factor in light of recent remarks , construed racist , following a visit to a predominantly black restaurant .
O'Reilly , says Olbermann , is showing signs of paranoia stemming from a disconnect between the outside world " and his own head . "
" Americans should be very skeptical of the news media .
No longer can it be trusted . "
-- Bill O'Reilly
" We have n't trusted you in ten years , " quips Olbermann .
Marvin Kitman , author of The Man Who Would Not Shut Up : The Rise of Bill O'Reilly and self - proclaimed " leading O'Reillyologist , " is quoted in his recent Huffington Post blog post : " When I began studying him he was a semi- demented TV newsman , who rudely interrupted guests in debates , giving them the last word , which he also interrupted , but lately he seems to be losing it . "
" He seems more unhinged than usual , " says Kitman .
" He has two people on debating an issue when we 're lucky , but even when somebody is on his side , if they 're slightly off -- like , one degree - - he comes down on them -- and he 's just about ready to implode , I can see , looking at him . "
Kitman sees an air of paranoia around O'Reilly , and a fear that everybody 's out to get him , " which I guess is partially true . "
In O'Reilly 's recent " debut as a restaurant critic , " he adds , O'Reilly demonstrated his trademark case of " Achilles mouth . "
Olbermann wonders out loud if O'Reilly 's missed the kind of backlash that disgraced MSNBC host Don Imus received for his " nappy - headed hoes " gaffe due to a lack of expectation , on the part of the public , of common decency due to diminished mental capacity .
" I think he's on the verge of having a breakdown , " says Kitman .
" I think he needs psychiatric help . "
" Having a conversation with O'Reilly is like trying to take a drink of water from an open fire hydrant . "
-- Marvin Kitman , September 25 , 2007
The following video is from MSNBC's Keith Olbermann 's Countdown , broadcast on September 27 , 2007 :
As many as 20,000 private security contractors are working in Iraq
The Iraqi government said it wanted to determine whether such contractors were operating in compliance with Iraqi law .
The review comes a day after the Iraqi authorities ordered the US - based firm , Blackwater USA , to suspend all operations and leave Iraq immediately .
Blackwater has said its guards acted in self - defence in Sunday 's incident .
But the Iraqi interior ministry has claimed the men fired " randomly at citizens " in a crowded square in the capital , killing innocent bystanders and a policeman .
The Blackwater guards were protecting a convoy carrying officials from the US state department at the time .
Unclear status
The Iraqi government 's spokesman , Ali al - Dabbagh , said its decision to review the status of Private Security Companies ( PSCs ) was prompted by the " flagrant assault ... on Iraqi citizens " on Sunday .
BLACKWATER USA FACTS
Founded in 1997 by a former US Navy SEAL Headquarters in North Carolina One of at least 28 Private Security Companies in Iraq Employs 744 US citizens , 231 third - country nationals , and 12 Iraqis to protect US state department in Iraq ( May 2007 ) Provided protection for former CPA head Paul Bremer Four employees killed by mob in Falluja in March 2004 Personnel have no combat immunity under international law if they engage in hostilities
Profile : Blackwater USA
" Companies should respect Iraqi laws and the dignity of the citizens , " he added .
The BBC's Hugh Sykes in Baghdad says the status of the thousands of often heavily armed private security guards employed in Iraq is unclear .
The guards are considered neither civilians nor military personnel , although they do carry IDs from the US Department of Defense .
Order 17 of the Coalition Provisional Authority gives the guards immunity from Iraqi prosecution , but they have no combat immunity under international law if they engage in hostilities .
Any Iraqi review of their status would therefore only have an effect if the US authorities accept its conclusions , our correspondent says .
' Fair probe '
Earlier , the US Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice , telephoned Prime Minister Nouri Maliki to express her regret over the deaths and pledge to help carry out a " fair and transparent " investigation into the incident .
A spokesman for Ms Rice told the AFP news agency that she had " reiterated that the United States does everything it can to avoid such loss of life in contrast to the enemies of the Iraqi people who deliberately target civilians " .
The two agreed to hold any wrongdoers accountable , according to Mr Maliki 's spokesman .
Blackwater is one of the biggest private security contractors in Iraq and is reported to have a contract worth $ 300 m ( £ 150 m ) with the state department to protect its diplomatic staff and equipment there .
Last week , the US ambassador to Iraq , Ryan Crocker , spoke of the importance of private security contractors in Iraq and correspondents say their suspension would be a potentially serious blow to the state department 's work there .

I 'd rather phrase it this way : " Microsoft cannot declare itself exempt from the requirements of copyright law .
If it distributes , or pays others to distribute on it's behalf , material copyrighted by others and licensed for distribution only under the GPLv3 , it must comply with the terms of that license exactly as anyone else wanting to distribute copyrighted material must comply with the copyright owner 's license .
Doing otherwise is an infringement of copyright and a violation of copyright law .
No anticipatory repudiation can change this : one can repudiate a license , but one cannot repudiate the law .
Microsoft makes much of wanting people to respect it 's intellectual property and comply with it 's licenses .
It needs , in turn , to respect other people 's intellectual property and comply with their licenses . " [ Reply to This | # ]

If ( or when ) it comes down to a lawsuit , it 's going to be a doozy -- Microsoft
will spend * everything * to defend their side , and they are not strangers to
lawyering .
And GPL3 ( from what I 've read ) is a wicked powerful document .
If Groklaw was busy with SCO vs. IBM , SCO vs. Novell and SCO vs. Red Hat , it's
going to get insane with this suit .
Get your umbrellas , folks , it 's going to storm out soon .

It is unusual to see a press release from FSF .
Especially one like this .
This is their third press release this month , but there were none in July .
So far , 15 press releases for 2007 from FSF .
Mostly not very interesting beyond the scope of the FSF membership .
Something 's up .
I wonder what ?

It 's been five or six years now that Microsoft has been distributing GNU GPL'd software in the Interix ( now Services for Unix package ) -- in particular the gcc compiler .
The download includes GPLv1 and GPL v2 text ; some of the tools are licensed " GPL v2 and later " .
The source code , or where to find it , is nowhere to be seen ; perhaps Microsoft has felt itself above copyright law these past few years already ?
Microsoft 's claim that it is somehow exempt from copyright law is just silly .
Sean DALY [ Reply to This | # ]

To preface : I 'm a big fan of the GPL ( at least v2 and earlier ...
I have n't
really formed an opinion on v3 yet , because I have not really had a need to
research it thoroughly ) and have been for many years ( the earliest I can recall
using GPL software was late 80s / early 90s . )
I am also not a lawyer .
That said , I see some big problems with the way the FSF is approaching this .
If
I understand things correctly , this is essentially about the coupons that
Microsoft received from Novell and then distributed ( is continuing to
distribute ? ) to third parties , and how , if and when someone redeems one of those
coupons for software covered under GPL v3 , MS has distributed said software , and
is bound by the terms of GPL v3 .
If this is the case , that 's a pretty scary
notion .
It appears ( and appearances can be deceiving , I agree ) that MS , in this case , is
acting as either a reseller or an agent for Novell .
So if resellers and agents
can be bound by the language of GPL v3 , where does it end ?
If I 'm an integrator or VAR , and I provide a complete solution to someone ( say ,
RHEL as a base system , with my ERP , or IP PBX , or whatever other application on
top of it ) have I suddenly given up rights to any IP that I have a claim on ,
that is in the kernel , that I was not aware of ?
How about if I 'm a large retailer , like Walmart , and I sell a boxed copy of SUSE
to J. Random User , have I " distributed " it under the terms of the
license ?
Have I waived any rights as I result of this ?
The same theories aimed at Microsoft would seem to apply in the above cases .
Hopefully , I am wrong in my interpretation , because if that were the case , the
amount of FUD that could be spun against FOSS as a result would make what came
out of Lindon seem tiny in comparison . :( [ Reply to This | # ]

1. Lets start with an obvious truth : If Microsoft distributes GPL3 software
without agreeing to the GPL3 , they are committing copyright infringement .
There
are very clear legal consequences to distributing copyrighted works without a
license .
Both Microsoft and FSF know what they are .
2 . Those consequences do NOT include Microsoft becoming legally obligated to
comply with the terms of the GPL3 .
There is absolutely no written or case law
that supports the notion that a company can be forced to agree to the terms of a
license it has publicly repudiated .
I understand the power of the fantasy that
Microsoft will suddenly lose the ability to enforce its patents .
We need to
remember that this is pure fantasy .
Microsoft 's damages would be limited to the
existing civil and criminal penalties for copyright infringement .
In the event
of accidental distribution , these are likely to be quite minimal ( especially
from the perspective of a corporation worth hundreds of billions of dollars ) .
3 . The FSF statement implies that they will help sue Microsoft if they commit
copyright infringement .
This presumably includes contributory infringement and
vicarious infringement .
On the surface , this would be a good thing but ...
4 . Most commentators are saying that FSF intends to sue Microsoft for
Contributory Infringement or Vicarious Infringement based on the notion that
Microsoft 's material contribution is a cross licensing agreement .
5. FSF will lose such a case .
While it is true that there is no obviously on
point case law , asking a judge to expand the definition of contributory or
vicarious infringement in this way ( especially given recent rulings which limit
it ) is pure folly .
( I am still waiting for Eben to say that HE believes such a
case can be won .
If FSF sues on this basis , he will surely have to make such an
argument . )
6 . When FSF loses , countless headlines will proclaim ( inaccurately ) " GPL
Invalid " .
Many people will believe this , and open source will suffer .

Fundamentally , either ( a ) Microsoft is doing things with GPLed software which
would not be permitted by copyright law ( in the absence of the GPL ) , or ( b )
Microsoft is NOT doing things with GPLed software which would not be permitted
by copyright law ( in the absence of the GPL ) .
( Right ?
IANAL , but it seems like one of those two statements logically MUST be
true . )
If ( b ) is the case ( which seems to be what MS is claiming ) , then it does n't
matter what the GPL says ; the GPL only comes into effect when you need some
right which copyright law does n't already grant you .
( Indeed , the GPL itself
notes that there are certain things you are allowed to do with GPLed software
without needing to accept the GPL . )
But if ( a ) is the case ( which AFAICT would have to be what the FSF is arguing ) ,
then would n't that have to mean that MS is already violating the GPLv2 ?
So why
has n't the FSF sued to get them to stop distributing the vouchers ?

Microsoft will be " exempt " from the GPLv3 simply because they will
< b>< I>never </I></b> distribute or pay others to
distribute GPLv3 code : since the FSF foundation has made clear they believe that
paying others counts as distribution , the Novell deal will not encompass any
GPL v3 stuff .
So for all those who hope that Microsoft will somehow get caught with their hand
in the GPL cookie - jar / trap , forget about it .
They are already very careful , and
GPLv3 makes them even more careful .
Rather , what the GPLv3 does is make a large amount of future open - source
development unavailable to Apple .
Apple , unlike Microsoft , ships a large amount
of GPL based software : GCC , emacs , a lot of random utilities , etc .
And Apple 's solution is to buy up the copyright when possible ( CUPS ) , replace
( I 've heard talk about replacing gcc ) , and / or fork at the last GPL v2 version .
The GPLv3 is designed to be unpalitable to many companies : TiVo , Apple , Google ,
etc , and they will sooner forgoe anything released under GPL v3 than deal with
the liscence .
This is a < I >< b> feature < / b></I > of the
GPLv3 , not a bug .
But it is a feature that will only be noticed by its absence : large companies
avoiding GPLv3 code except for internal use .

I have been wondering how Microsoft could avoid the GPL ( v3 ) and still have the
mentioned agreements .
Seems like in court they would be asked ...
Q : Did you distribute Linux ?
A : No
Q : Did you cause Linux to be distrubted ?
A : ( They might say no but the certificates are indeed a cause of distribution . )
So if they knew of potential patent infringements in GPLed code but still
encouraged or caused distribution of Linux that would be contributory copyright
infringement I think .
( although IANAL )
If so , this would be true under both GPLv2 and GPLv3 .
Perhaps it is time for a lawsuit ? [ Reply to This | # ]

This press release has been described as the FSF response to the Monopoly 's
repudiation of the GPLv3 .
Consider it that and nothing more .
Do not interpret it as the FSF threatening
to go to court .
Certainly they will if they have to .
The most desperate will
lead the way to court .
Going to court is like deliberately firing a loose
cannon .
You can destroy yourself as much as your enemy .
Who is more desperate ?
A strengthening Free Software movement , or a
conviction - certified Monopoly who acts with impunity ?
Neither .
So the FUD
continues , standards are fought off , retailers sell 95 % Monopoly machines .
That
which the Monopoly has n't wrapped up , can be bought if necessary .
Meanwhile Linux grows of necessity .
It is spreading in the defense industry .
One consultant , who had to get a high security clearance , was hired for one DoD
( Dept of Def ) project .
All he does is put in hardened , secure , Linux servers .
He is now made to work on numerous projects for his contractor .
Security - minded
corporate entities adopt it .
It can be trusted .
It grows though not as much as
the Monopoly .
It is essential .
It keeps the prices down and the people
free , ... as in not slavery .
So do n't expect any court action until people start paying the Monopoly for
patents in Linux , or the Monopoly ship starts to list .

The key to this " FSF versus Gate $ and M$ issue " is hiring someone like
Karl Rove - who can FRAME ( Google G. Lakoff ) the issue so well ; that no matter
who sues who first ( or whatever ) - that Gate$ and M$ look like the devil
incarnate !
Rove was a Master at the above task .
Of course along with Rove , 2000 or more
" FRAMING BLOGGERS " are needed to carry the FRAMING message over the
net ; once , the Master Framer ( Rove or his substitute ) finished there linguistic

FSF NEEDS TO HIRE KARL ROVE ... NOW - Authored by : Anonymous on Tuesday , August 28 2007 @ 07:19 PM EDT

I do n't think that the FSF want to go to law ; however I do think they want to force Microsoft to repudiate the agreements they have made with Novell and others about GPL licensed code .
The risk to Microsoft is that the information that they have provided to Novell and others to enable " interoperability " may well have to be made available to all .
The risk to FSF is they they get involved in an expensive legal case that will be won by the side with the most money ( even if the law is against them Microsoft can stretch out the case for ten or more years and bankrupt the FSF . )

Just made a $ 1000 donation to FSF .
I never donated this much to a single cause
in my life before , but I think it 's worth it .
Really , let 's fill the FSF's
coffers for the oncoming battle for freedom .

And I suspect the FSF has been lining up all of its ducks in a nice little row
prior to making this announcement .
I think the FSF * knows * they are ready to take on the evil empire and win .
M$ fired the first round in this war but I believe that the FSF will fire the
last round in their * total * ( draw no quarter - take no quarter ) fight to utterly
destroy the empire and all those who support it .

If Micro$oft wants its IP respected , then it must take all neceessary measures
to isolate it from others ' IP .

IANAL ( Yet )
Certain code has one and only one license offered .
Microsoft distributes that
code AND repudiates the sole license .
What happens ?
One of two things ( maybe more , but I 'd keep my eye on the judge 's finances if
something else does happen ) .
1 ) A court denies Microsoft 's repudiation and enforces Specific Performance .
In
this case , that would be either an injunction against Microsoft suing for
violations of rights waived or an instant dismissal of any suit Microsoft brings
attempting to enforce the waived rights .
2 ) A person at Microsoft is found to have willfully infringed the copyright .
As
an infringer , and not a licensee , Microsoft is not likely subject to specific
enforcement .
But is unlikely to be able to deny willfull infringement ( likely
result -- someone pretty high up at Microsoft goes to jail ) .
There are other spurious defenses , but these are the big odds .
Microsoft
* publicly * denies one license .
It better have a way of showing plausible belief
in a different license ( or Public Domain ) as its justification for using code it
Microsoft knows it did n't write .

Commentary on Groklaw article titled " FSF to Microsoft : " You Can't Declare Yourself Exempt from GPLv3 "
And this press release from FSF leaves open their response to Xandros and Linspire .
Those two distributors contracted with Microsoft to patent encumber the GPL AFTER they knew the terms of GPL3 .
I had never thought about it in that way .
I was always surprised after Xandros and Linspire deals that FSF seemed silent for a long time ... and then of course there 's the Fuji , Xerox , Samsung , LGE , etc deals purportedly for embedded Linux MS patents and royalties .

Joint culpability for GPL2 ?

As I read the Microsoft statement , I understood it as saying MS will not
distribute any GPL3 licensed code .
If they indeed do not do anything with any
GPL3 code , then obviously they wo n't have any dealings with the GPL3 license
terms .
Calling it " exempt " is a weird way of putting it , but
technically it 's correct if they indeed never touch GPL3 code .

I do n't think the FSF should instigate litigation against MS , they should wait
until MS makes a move against a GPL entity , either developers , integrators or
end users .
Litigation is Microsofts forte , all you will be doing is fighting MSs favourite
battle on MSs home terrority .
MSs response to litigation is invariably to tie
the other fella up in court for ages and then settle out of court with the terms
kept secret .

I thought that MS 's announcement about GPL v3 said that they would not extend
the " promise not to sue " to any GPL v3 software .
After all , their
original promise states that they can change it or cancel it at any time for any
or no reason .
At that point they are not extending any patent protection on any GPL v3
software , and conveying any GPL v3 software would not require them to extend any
patent protection to anyone , even if they continue to promise the ptotection to
Novell Suse Linux customers for any GPL v2 software that they get from novell .

If I buy a copy of Windows XP from PJ and later Resell that copy to MathFox , I
have not infringed copyright : my actions are perfectly legal .
Likewise , if Microsoft buys 2 million copies of SuSE Linux and resells those
copies to various users - no copyright infringement has occured .
Its really simple .
No copies made = no copy - left licence activation .
Microsoft
can distribute Novells ' boxes of SuSE Linux and not activate or violate the
GPL .
Only if they _COPY_AND_DISTRIBUTE_ some GPL protected code do they activate the
GPL provisions .

I wrote this rant up awhile ago , waiting for the next time this hit the news .
It does n't quite suit this article , because it's not Pamela making the GPL v3 claims , but I think it will get the point across .
***************
I think you are badly misstating the facts here .
It appears that you want this to be true so badly that you 're not thinking it through .
Microsoft did n't sign any version of the GPL .
The only way you can prove that it applies to them is if they are doing something that copyright law would ordinarily forbid .
No matter what the GPL says about ' conveying ' or ' transferring ' , the only time it provably fired is when the entity involved did something that would otherwise be prevented by copyright law .
And even at that , it did n't fire if the company would prefer to pay the draconian copyright - infringement penalties .
Distributing vouchers is not covered under copyright .
It just is n't .
If I sell you a gift certificate for CDs at Target , I 'm not violating anyone 's copyright by doing so .
Microsoft is selling gift certificates , not copying software .
Copyright law covers only making and distributing copies of covered works , not vouchers talking about them .
Further , it is the entity using the GPL to break copyright law that chooses the terms under which it is allowed to do so .
You may wish Microsoft was distributing Linux to you under GPL3 , but THEY get to choose the terms , not you .
But they do n't even have to , because they 're not doing anything for which they need the GPL 's permission .
Novell is the only entity breaking copyright law , thus needing the umbrella of the GPL .
At most , you 'd get access to the Novell patents .
It looks to me that you folks want this so badly that you 're using very flawed analysis .
Microsoft has n't signed the GPL , so you have to prove that it took effect and bound them .
You simply can't do that , because what they 're doing does n't require the copyright holder 's permission .

From Microsoft 's annnouncement about GPL v3 :
Microsoft has decided that the Novell support certificates that we distribute to customers will not entitle the recipient to receive from Novell , or any other party , any subscription for support and updates relating to any code licensed under GPLv3 .
So Microsoft is saying that the certificates are not valid for getting any GPL v3 software from Novell .
This means that they are not conveying anything under the GPL .
Novell has , on the other hand , said that they plan on including GPL v3 code in future versions of Suse Linux , and that if customers come to them with a MS certificate , then they will give that customer the latest version of Suse Linux , which may include some GPL v3 code .
At that point , all MS has to do is change their " covenant not to sue " to specifically exclude any gpl v3 code from the promise , and no one will be violating the GPL v3 . [ Reply to This | # ]

Of course !
The Trolls are out in Force on Groklaw , as soon as an
article appears which seems detrimental to Microsoft .
As has
already been predicted , these Trolls are the children of the
corporate media , including Web - Sites like Slashdot , The Register ,
Linux Today and others .
The same corporate media which
Groklaw has links to on its first page .
This media depends on
advertisers , and Microsoft is one of the biggest , if not the biggest ,
advertisers in IT .
Thus the corporate media spread their
propaganda and slant their content to favour these advertisers .
Take for example this headline from PCLinuxOnline , which is
taken from VNU NET :
" FSF threatens Microsoft over GPLv3 "
( http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2197532/fsf-denies-microsoft-gplv3)
Nominally , this is a Web - site dedicated to Linux .
But yet it has
Microsoft propaganda on it , courtesy of the corporate media .
Whenever have you seen a headline from the corporate media
entitled something like " Microsoft threatens FSF " , making Microsoft
seem like an aggressive predator ?
Out of the two entities FSF
and Microsoft , who would you say has a history of being an
aggressive predator ?
This are the kind of vicious propagandist
which Groklaw has got in bed with by having their links on this
Web -site .
This is the kind of treatment that Groklaw can expect if
ever it threatens Microsoft 's monopoly .
And any site dedicated to
uncovering the injustice in the computer industry , and is mildly
successful , will sooner or later be run over by this juggernaut .

No one has made this clear .
Microsoft is not distributing SuSE Linux .
They are
distributing vouchers to get a copy from Novell .
Thus Novell is doing to
distribution and Microsoft is essentially giving a referral .
Even the argument
that Microsoft is indirectly distributing SuSE Linux seems weak , to me .
So what
is the FSF 's argument ? [ Reply to This | # ]
Erik Prince 's company has been paid more than $ 1bn for its services
Blackwater has come under scrutiny since a shoot - out last month in Baghdad in which 11 Iraqis were killed .
The FBI has begun investigating that incident .
The firm 's founder , Erik Prince , said his staff were brave and effective , and had acted " appropriately " .
But one of the committee asked if the firm was " a shadow mercenary force " .
" Blackwater appears to have fostered a culture of shoot first - and sometimes kill - and then ask the questions , " said Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings .
Blackwater is the main firm employed by the state department to provide security for its staff and visiting officials and businessmen .
It has earned more than $ 1bn ( £ 490 m ) from US government contracts since 2001 .
The state department paid the company more than $ 832 m ( £ 408 m ) for security work between 2004 and 2006 .
' Short ' on standards
The 16 September shooting incident is not featuring in the hearing by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , following a Justice Department request that it wait until the FBI 's investigation is concluded .
CONGRESS BLACKWATER REPORT
Earned more than $ 1bn ( £ 490 m ) from US government contracts since 2001 Staff involved in 195 shootings in Iraq between 2005 and 12 September 2007 Allegedly drunk employee killed Iraqi vice - president 's guard in 2006 , but was flown out of Iraq and faced no criminal charges 28 staff in Iraq sacked for weapons - related incidents , 25 for alcohol and drug violations
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Blackwater memorandum
But congressmen raised a number of other incidents they said showed that Blackwater fell short of the standards of the US military .
The committee 's chairman , Henry Waxman , referred to an incident in Afghanistan in 2004 when a Blackwater plane flown by inexperienced pilots crashed , killing US service personnel on board .
An investigation showed the pilots did not follow procedure , did not know where they were going and were treating their mission as " fun " .
" Is Blackwater , a private military contractor , helping or hurting our efforts ? "
Mr Waxman asked , referring to Iraq .
' Unaccountable '
Several representatives referred to an incident in which a Blackwater guard shot dead a bodyguard of one of Iraq 's vice - presidents while drunk .
He was hurried out of Iraq and faced no criminal charges .
They said the incident showed how " unaccountable " Blackwater and other firms were .
" Why are we privatising our military to an organisation that has been aggressive and in some cases reckless in the handling of their duties ? " asked New York Democrat Carolyn Maloney .
BLACKWATER USA FACTS
Founded in 1997 by a former US Navy Seal Headquarters in North Carolina
One of at least 28 private security companies in Iraq Employs 744 US citizens , 231 third - country nationals , and 12 Iraqis to protect US state department in Iraq Provided protection for former CPA head Paul Bremer Four employees killed by mob in Falluja in March 2004
Profile : Blackwater USA
Security firms in the dock
Mr Prince said Blackwater had taken firm action against the guard .
He was fined and fired .
" But we , as a private organisation , ca n't do any more , " he said .
" We can't flog him .
We can't incarcerate him . "
He also said that 30 Blackwater staff had been killed while working to defend US diplomats , but that none of its clients had died while in its protection .
" There is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men , " said Mr Prince , who is a former member of the US Navy Seals special forces .
Mr Prince , 38 , said his firm was happy to be subjected to greater oversight .
" Blackwater believes that more can and should be done to increase accountability , oversight and transparency , " he told the hearing .
Good value ?
Mr Waxman 's staff produced a scathing report on Monday that released details of several incidents involving Iraqi casualties , in which Blackwater employees had fired first on 163 out of 195 occasions .
In the majority of cases , the guards fired their weapons from moving vehicles without stopping to count the dead or assist the wounded , the report said .
He questioned whether private contractors should be used instead of US soldiers .
" The question for this hearing is whether outsourcing to Blackwater is a good deal to the American taxpayer , " he said .

In those first emotional days after Katrina laid waste to the Gulf Coast , widespread predictions of a political sea change arrived from liberal and even some conservative commentators .
“ Americans are ready to fix their restless gaze on enduring problems of poverty , race , and class that have escaped their attention , ” Newsweek ‘s Jonathan Alter wrote in a September 2005 cover story .
Some went so far as to forecast the dawn of a new America , one stunned out of both complacency and conservatism by the images of suffering on the Gulf Coast .
Katrina , one commentator suggested , would permanently “ redefine the political landscape . ”
But within just a few weeks of the hurricane , something had changed in the press coverage and the public response :
As the floodwaters receded , so , too , did the powerful images — the portraits of racially segregated suffering , of death by poverty .
America ’s — even liberal America ’s — focus appeared to be moving away from the experiences of Katrina victims and the deep , systemic problems they revealed .
In the end , the leap from pathos to policy was never made .
Instead , a narrower lens was focused on the foibles of the Bush administration — for instance , its hiring of a political crony , Michael Brown , to head FEMA ( and , later , Brown ’s infamous emails about wardrobe choices and dinner plans as New Orleans residents were literally drowning in their homes ) .
Democrats were quick to attack President Bush , but when it came to advancing meaningful policy changes , they came up short on momentum .
It quickly became clear that the public “ meaning ” of Katrina , which had initially seemed so obvious to so many , was actually up for grabs — and so , too , was its impact on U.S. politics .
In the coming weeks and months , conservatives hit their stride .
The Bush administration , with the help of its friends in the Washington establishment and elsewhere , turned the disaster in New Orleans from a crisis into an opportunity — a chance to extend , rather than repeal , the conservative revolution that had begun 25 years earlier .
The campaign to accomplish this apparent political paradox would operate on many levels and with astonishing success .
While the country was absorbed by watching the president try to stuff an uncooperative political rabbit back into his hat , the real tricks were taking place offstage .
The PR campaign .
This began with a carefully constructed plan — engineered , to no one ’s surprise , by Karl Rove — to shift blame away from the White House , accompanied by promises of “ investigations , ” and followed by a highly stage - managed expression of conservative compassion by Bush .

The advancement of conservative social policies , including an overhaul of the federal budget .
Despite some haggling among conservatives , Bush ’s pledge to help the victims from Katrina would be used to justify a series of cuts that had always been favored by the right — robbing the poor to give ( for a little while ) to the poor .

The remaking of New Orleans .
A variety of carefully planned “ rebuilding ” strategies , along with a selective apportionment of resources , would effectively clear out many of the city ’s poor African Americans to make way for a richer , whiter simulacrum of the Big Easy .
A variety of carefully planned “ rebuilding ” strategies , along with a selective apportionment of resources , would effectively clear out many of the city ’s poor African Americans to make way for a richer , whiter simulacrum of the Big Easy .
A free - for - all for corporate contractors .
There were billions of dollars to be made on the reconstruction of New Orleans and the rest of the Gulf Coast , a good share of it awarded to companies with political connections , and a fair portion of that lost to greed , waste , incompetence , and fraud .
The following timeline tracks developments in these four areas , focusing on the disaster that followed the disaster , when the tragedy and travesty of what happened on the Gulf Coast was turned into an opportunity to advance political and policy goals and increase private profits .
In most cases , the groundwork for this was laid within the first hundred days .
September 2
President Bush makes his first post - Katrina trip to New Orleans .
The visit includes staged photo ops that may have actually impeded aid efforts .
September 4
The New York Times reports on a White House plan — hatched days earlier while the hurricane ’s victims were still stranded and dying — to “ contain the political damage ” from the Bush administration ’s failure to respond promptly and decisively to Hurricane Katrina .
Managed by Karl Rove and White House counselor Dan Bartlett , the strategies for this PR campaign include dodging questions , obfuscating facts , and redirecting blame to state and local authorities .
September 5
Facing falling poll numbers after ignoring or downplaying the magnitude of the Gulf Coast crisis for a week after the storm , the president makes a second trip to Louisiana .
On this visit , unlike the first , there are no jokes about his drinking days in the Big Easy , although he still follows a carefully planned itinerary that circumvents the worst - hit areas and puts him in contact with only “ friendly audiences . ”
Meanwhile , after touring the Houston Astrodome , where many Katrina evacuees have taken refuge , Barbara Bush suggests that the accommodations are “ working very well for them ” since “ so many of the people in the arena here …were “ underprivileged anyway . ”
September 6
At a press conference , surrounded by cabinet members , the president is asked whether he intends to fire any of the members of his administration responsible for the botched rescue effort .
Bush replies that he intends “ to lead an investigation to find out what went right and what went wrong . ”
He decries “ the blame game , ” but makes veiled references to problems with “ the state government and the local government ” — per the administration ’s previously outlined damage - control strategy .
Fast Forward : Prepared by White House Homeland Security Advisor ( and controversial political climber ) Frances Fragos Townsend and released in February 2006 , the report is a study in the selective use of facts .
At one point , for example , Townsend quotes an assessment that “ the President … took extraordinary steps prior to landfall . ”
A look at the footnotes to the report shows the source of the quote to be a speech made by none other than Townsend herself .
The Katrina disaster becomes an enormous boon to contractors with friends in high places .
One of the first to swing into action is Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg , Brown & Root , which begins work repairing Gulf Coast Naval and Marine facilities under a pre-existing arrangement with the Department of Defense .
Fast Forward :
By the end of the year , KBR has secured contracts worth nearly $ 170 million .
It ca n’t have hurt that KBR had retained the services of former FEMA director ( and Bush crony ) Joseph Allbaugh , who had registered as a lobbyist for the company six months prior to Katrina .
Allbaugh also lobbied on behalf of the Shaw Group , which is owned by the chair of the Louisiana Democratic Party .
Shaw received two $ 100 million no -bid contracts shortly after Katrina .
As the White House PR campaign gathers momentum , conservatives launch their own campaign to control the ideological and policy implications of Katrina .
Figures like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly rush to blame the disaster on the welfare state .
In the right - wing weekly Human Events , Jack Kemp describes the disaster not as a tragedy exacerbated by government failures , but rather as “ a golden opportunity ” to implement “ government policies that facilitate and empower the private sector and private citizens . ”
A week later he warns , “ We should n’t be bamboozled by the left ’s exploiting of Katrina to lobby for bigger , more centralized government . ”
September 7
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and House Speaker Dennis Hastert ( who ’d recently remarked of New Orleans that “ a lot of that place could be bulldozed “ ) announce the formation of a House - Senate “ Hurricane Katrina Joint Review Committee . ”
The announcement comes at a gathering attended only by Republicans , after a Republican planning session .
Democrats boycott the committee , since Republicans would outnumber them in accordance with their ratios in Congress .
They call instead for a 9/11 Commission - style independent investigation .
September 8
Congress approves a second White House request for Katrina relief spending , bringing the total to $ 62.3 billion .
Members of Congress and watchdog groups immediately raise questions about the procurement process for Katrina - related contracts , including insufficient oversight and lack of competitive bidding .
By executive order , the president suspends the Davis - Bacon Act , which requires federal contractors to pay the regional prevailing wage , in areas hit by Katrina .
The move is attacked by organized labor and praised by anti-government conservatives .
September 9
In a memo to all federal contracting agencies , the Department of Labor suspends affirmative action requirements on all reconstruction contracts .
Baton Rouge Republican Congressman Richard Baker is overheard telling a group of lobbyists , “ We finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans .
We could n’t do it , but God did . ”
September 10
New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin convenes a meeting of prominent local business leaders — dubbed by some the “ forty thieves ” — and public officials to plan the city ’s future .
A key figure at the meeting is millionaire Jimmy Reiss , head of the Business Council of New Orleans ( which has a history of advocating for luxury development in the city ) .
The Wall Street Journal reports that Reiss — who “ helicoptered in an Israeli security company ” to guard his house after the storm — says “ the new city must be something very different … with better services and fewer poor people .
‘ Those who want to see this city rebuilt want to see it done in a completely different way : demographically , geographically , and politically . ' ”
Days later , Reiss tells
Newsweek that he is thinking about how “ to use this catastrophe as a once - in - an - eon opportunity to change the dynamic ” of the city .
that he is thinking about how “ to use this catastrophe as a once - in - an - eon opportunity to change the dynamic ” of the city .
The first of several contracts from FEMA and the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals for the recovery of bodies is awarded to Kenyon International , whose parent company , Service Corporation International ( SCI ) , a Bush campaign contributor , has previously been implicated in a high - profile scandal in Texas .
The company has also been sued for illegally dumping and desecrating corpses in Florida .
Fast Forward : After two months , Kenyon bills the State of Louisiana more than $ 6 million for collecting 535 bodies .
New Orleans ’ numerous family - owned African American funeral homes , meanwhile , are turned down when they offer to volunteer their services after the disaster , and none receive any subcontracts from Kenyon to bury victims .
The Department of Homeland Security refuses to promise that undocumented immigrants will not be arrested if they seek help from relief agencies — a promise the agency did make after the 9/11 attacks .
DHS does , however , temporarily suspend sanctions on employers in the region who hire workers without proof of citizenship , a move that paves the way for contractors to obtain cheap , easily exploited migrant labor .
September 11
The White House ’s spin operation seems determined to cast the federal government ’s role in responding to Katrina as a “ backup ” for state and local governments .
Michael Chertoff , in particular , questions the Department of Homeland Security ’s authority to take action without a state request , and suggests that a new “ model ” is needed for dealing with “ ultra - catastrophes ” — possibly one that puts the Pentagon in charge .
But a section of his own agency ’s 426 - page National Response Plan , released with much fanfare in January 2005 , clearly gives DHS broad authority to bypass states and localities to mobilize search - and - rescue operations , medical teams , and a host of other emergency essentials .
September 12
Alarmed by the plans for billions in relief spending , conservative and libertarian think tanks begin issuing their own plans , in which the disaster becomes a justification for massive ( and permanent ) cuts to the federal budget — and indeed , the entire federal government .
In a detailed plan , the Heritage Foundation proposes a host of longtime conservative goals : sweeping rollbacks of regulations protecting workers and the environment ( to hasten the rebuilding process ) ; opening the Arctic Wildlife Refuge to drilling ( to compensate for disrupted oil supplies ) ; school - voucher programs ( for displaced children ) ; and an immediate suspension of the estate tax ( for any millionaires killed by Katrina ) .
After being relieved of responsibility for overseeing on - site relief efforts along the Gulf Coast several days earlier , Michael Brown officially resigns as head of FEMA .
September 14
The New York Times reports that Karl Rove has been placed in charge of the federal government ’s Katrina reconstruction effort , suggesting that it is viewed as a facet of the White House ’s political damage - control operation .
September 15
Bush makes a televised speech on Katrina reconstruction from New Orleans ’ Jackson Square .
It is a high - stakes political moment for the president , and the address is elaborately stage - managed .
Camouflage netting masks debris - filled streets and Bush stands alone in front of the city ’s grand cathedral , bathed in an otherworldly light ( from floodlights brought in for the purpose ) .
During the address , Bush echoes ideas — and in some cases language — found in the Heritage Foundation ’s plan , including various forms of deregulation to expedite the recovery .
He proposes a “ Gulf Opportunity Zone ” ( replete with tax breaks that critics warn are an invitation to fraud ) ; private “ Worker Recovery Accounts ” to help victims find new jobs ( based on an earlier program already rejected by Congress ) ; and an “ Urban Homesteading Act ” to hand out federal land by lottery to low - income families , a plan denounced by congressional Democrats as “ a recycling of an idea that made sense in the 19th century , ” whose “ primary effect will be to unload undesirable federal title property and to use Katrina as the excuse . ”
Fast Forward : The Recovery Accounts and the Homesteading Act never materialize — nor do the majority of the promises made in the Jackson Square speech .
The House votes to create the so - called House Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina , which is made up of 11 Republicans ; the Democrats again recuse themselves .
Fast Forward :
The committee hears wide - ranging testimony , and in February 2006 issues a report that is surprisingly sharp in its criticism of the Bush administration .
Among other things , it cites a “ failure of leadership ” and singles out Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff .
“ A blinding lack of situational awareness and disjointed decision making needlessly compounded and prolonged Katrina ’s horror , ” the report ’s preface states .
James Inhofe , chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , and Louisiana Senator David Vitter introduce the first of several bills that use the Gulf Coast disaster as a reason to suspend or weaken environmental regulations .
This bill , S. 1711 , aims to allow the Environmental Protection Agency to waive or modify the application of any law under its jurisdiction , if doing so is necessary to respond “ to a situation or damage relating to Hurricane Katrina . ”
Federal and state agencies have already issued short - term waivers of laws regulating air and water pollution , fuel standards , asbestos removal , and many other environmental standards .

Despite his reliance on free - market solutions , the sweeping nature of Bush ’s promises in the Jackson Square speech and their projected price tag stir anxiety among conservatives , some of whom are already alarmed by the administration ’s Iraq war spending .
Conservative publications dub the recovery plan “ the GOP ’s New Deal ” and “ Bush ’s disaster socialism . ”
The speech clearly causes concern at the Heritage Foundation , which identifies “ potential dangers ” in the president ’s remarks and offers stern reminders of the post - Katrina conservative battle plan for the White House and for Republicans in Congress .
The administration ’s top federal procurement official , David Safavian , who has been responsible for implementing new , streamlined government - contracting policies for Katrina relief and reconstruction , resigns suddenly from the White House Office of Management and Budget .
September 18
In an interview on Fox News , Senator Lindsey Graham , the South Carolina Republican , says , “ You know , there ’s so much opportunity here to go back into the budget and extract some savings to help pay for this hurricane relief that I look at it as an opportunity for the Congress to get back to its roots of being fiscally sound and conservative .
Maybe something good can come from this hurricane . ”
While Katrina recovery costs are immediate and temporary , the cuts that Graham refers to are meant to be permanent , yielding an overall gain for conservative budget and policy goals .
September 19
David Safavian is arrested in connection with the Jack Abramoff scandal on charges of obstructing a criminal investigation .
September 21
The Republican Study Committee , a group that includes Congress ’ most conservative members , issues its own plan for paying for Katrina recovery , which it calls “ Operation Offset . ”
The plan aims to reduce the federal budget by nearly $ 100 billion in 2006 alone and nearly $ 950 billion over 10 years — nearly five times the projected cost of hurricane reconstruction .
OMB
Watch , the government watchdog group , later describes the proposal as “ a historical laundry list of nearly every budget cut Republicans have proposed , imagined or yearned for over the years . ”
These include cuts to most entitlement programs that serve the poor , as well as an array of the right ’s favorite targets — from foreign aid and family planning for teens to the National Endowment for the Arts and Corporation for Public Broadcasting .
September 21
In response to “ Operation Offset , ” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities points out that nearly 40 percent of the cuts are in assistance to the nation ’s lowest - income residents , which would disproportionately affect African Americans , women , children , the elderly , the sick , and the disabled — in other words , the same vulnerable groups that had suffered most from Hurricane Katrina .
In one of the first comprehensive reports on the environmental impact of the storm , the U.S. Public Interest Research Group offers a grim assessment .
The affected areas are a center of the oil , gas , and chemical industries and “ home to 31 hazardous waste sites and 466 industrial facilities that handle large quantities of hazardous substances . ”
Numerous oil spills and the widespread release of toxic chemicals add to the existing public health crisis .
Contributing to the disaster is a history of weak environmental regulation in the region .
September 23
The Los Angeles Times reports
that after meeting with White House aides , Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) officials nixed plans to issue housing vouchers to help the estimated 650,000 people displaced by Katrina .
Vouchers enjoy considerable bipartisan support , but the Bush administration decides to limit the use of vouchers and instead give some families a one - time payment for housing , and warehouse others in trailer parks .
September 24
The suffering of Gulf Coast residents is compounded by the arrival of another major hurricane , Rita , on the Texas - Louisiana border .
A handful of people are killed by the hurricane itself , but dozens more die in the largest two - day evacuation in history , which leaves people trapped in gridlock for hours or even days , some without enough water , food , or gasoline .
September 26
September 28
Republican Senator Charles Grassley , chair of the Senate Finance Committee ,
complains that the White House is behind efforts to block a bill he coauthored that seeks to extend Medicaid coverage to more Katrina and Rita victims and help affected states with Medicaid costs .
The program , modeled on one implemented for victims of 9/11 , has the support of both the Democratic and Republican Senate leadership , state governors , the American Medical Association , the Red Cross , and more than 100 other nonprofit organizations .
Instead , the administration continues to support its program of state Medicaid Wavers , despite reports that many storm survivors are being denied Medicaid and are living without basic health care or medications .
September 29
During a visit to Houston , HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson declares , “ Whether we like it or not , New Orleans is not going to be 500,000 people for a long time .
New Orleans is not going to be as black as it was for a long time , if ever again . ”
Jackson predicts that the African American population of the city will drop from 67 percent to 35 to 40 percent simply because black neighborhoods have been the worst hit .
“ I ’m telling you , as HUD secretary and having been a developer and a planner , that ’s how it ’s going to be . ”
Jackson also expresses doubts about whether the Ninth Ward should be rebuilt at all , and tells the Houston Chronicle ’s editorial board , “ I wish that the so - called black leadership would stop running around this country , like Jesse and the rest of them , making this a racial issue . ”
But it will grow increasingly clear that the disaster is being used to advance what some have already begun to call an “ ethnic cleansing ” of New Orleans .
September 30
New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin announces the formation of the Bring Back New Orleans Commission , which is made up largely of local businessmen .
Joseph Canizaro , one of the city ’s biggest developers and a member of the commission , echoes comments by HUD Secretary Jackson when he says , “ As a practical matter , these poor folks do n’t have the resources to go back to our city , just like they did n’t have the resources to get out of our city .
So we wo n’t get all those folks back .
That ’s just a fact .
It ’s not what I want ; it ’s just a fact . ”

FEMA manages to almost meet its self - imposed deadline to clear Katrina evacuees from often - nightmarish temporary shelters — from a peak of 270,000 , only about 15,000 remain .
This is accomplished , however , largely by moving them to hotel rooms , where about 600,000 evacuees now live , at a cost of $ 11 million a day .
October 17
Governor Kathleen Blanco creates the Louisiana Recovery Authority to “ coordinate the continuing rebuilding effort . ”
The group ’s membership , The Nation points out , is “ dominated by representatives of big business , has only one trade unionist and not a single grassroots black representative . ”
The LRA will control the allocation of federal recovery funds , a large share of which is slated for the state ’s primary housing initiative , the “ Road Home ” program .
Fast Forward :
As of May 2007 , the program has provided rebuilding funds to just 16,000 of the 130,000 homeowners who requested Road Home assistance .
At this point , ICF Consulting , the firm that received a contract to administer the claims , announces that the program is facing a $ 3 billion shortfall and unable to pay those who ’ve been promised assistance .
November 1
Governor Blanco announces plans to conduct a series of meetings on budget cuts .
On the first day ( November 6 ) , she announces
$ 500 million in cuts from the Louisiana state budget , with health care and higher education taking the biggest hits .
Blanco and her supporters say the cuts reflect the expected precipitous drop in tax revenues — but critics point to the large tax breaks being offered to business and industry in the name of encouraging reconstruction .
November 2
In Senate hearings , a group of civil engineers and scientists release the preliminary findings in their investigation into the causes of the New Orleans levee failures .
They conclude that the breaches primarily responsible for flooding the city were caused by flaws in the design and construction of the levees by the Army Corps of Engineers .
Fast Forward :
These findings are confirmed by other independent investigations , as well as by the Corps ’ own report .
Some former Corps officials blame Bush - era funding cuts .
Other critics argue that congressional earmarks misdirected Corps funding toward pork - barrel projects , rather than toward the most pressing needs .
November 29
FEMA attempts to evict the approximately 150,000 evacuees who still remain in hotels .
Fast Forward : FEMA eventually issues two month - long extensions — the first after evacuee protests and bad press , the second after a court order .
Most of the evacuees are finally forced out in February and March of 2006 .
December 1
For the first time since Katrina struck , residents of the Lower Ninth Ward are permitted to visit their homes after being given shots and masks and passing through National Guard troops that have been blocking access to certain neighborhoods .
Meanwhile , residents have been locked out of public housing projects .
Many dangers to health and safety are real , but policies — and plans for the city ’s reconstruction — seem designed to discourage the return of African Americans and especially low - income residents ,
wiping certain neighborhoods off the map while enriching developers and corporate contractors .
December 2
Governor Blanco postpones the New Orleans mayoral election , which is slated to be held in February .
Fast Forward :
The election is held in April after a federal judge refuses to grant a second postponement , despite evidence that a disproportionate number of African Americans displaced by the disaster will find it difficult or impossible to participate .
December 11
A New York Times editorial titled “ Death of an American City ” states bluntly that “ we are about to lose New Orleans , ” while other media outlets note that the president has not visited the disaster zone for two months and has mentioned the Gulf Coast in speeches “ four times in November and twice so far this month , and then only fleetingly . ”
A White House adviser tells a reporter that Katrina has “ fallen so far off ” the president ’s “ radar screen , you ca n’t find it . ”

In the past , the Communist Party has reflexively turned to engineering projects to address water problems , and now it is reaching back to one of Mao ’s unrealized plans : the $ 62 billion South - to - North Water Transfer Project to funnel more than 12 trillion gallons northward every year along three routes from the Yangtze River basin , where water is more abundant .
The project , if fully built , would be completed in 2050 .
The eastern and central lines are already under construction ; the western line , the most disputed because of environmental concerns , remains in the planning stages .
The North China Plain undoubtedly needs any water it can get .
An economic powerhouse with more than 200 million people , it has limited rainfall and depends on groundwater for 60 percent of its supply .
Other countries , like Yemen , India , Mexico and the United States , have aquifers that are being drained to dangerously low levels .
But scientists say those below the North China Plain may be drained within 30 years .
“ There ’s no uncertainty , ” said Richard Evans , a hydrologist who has worked in China for two decades and has served as a consultant to the World Bank and China ’s Ministry of Water Resources .
“ The rate of decline is very clear , very well documented .
They will run out of groundwater if the current rate continues . ”
Outside Shijiazhuang , construction crews are working on the transfer project ’s central line , which will provide the city with infusions of water on the way to the final destination , Beijing .
For many of the engineers and workers , the job carries a patriotic gloss .
Yet while many scientists agree that the project will provide an important influx of water , they also say it will not be a cure - all .
No one knows how much clean water the project will deliver ; pollution problems are already arising on the eastern line .
Cities and industry will be the beneficiaries of the new water , but the impact on farming is limited .
Water deficits are expected to remain .
“ Many people are asking the question : What can they do ? ” said Zheng Chunmiao , a leading international groundwater expert .
“ They just cannot continue with current practices .
They have to find a way to bring the problem under control . ”

On a drizzly , polluted morning last April , Wang Baosheng steered his Chinese - made sport utility vehicle out of a shopping center on the west side of Beijing for a three - hour southbound commute that became a tour of the water crisis on the North China Plain .
Bush tells
Rush he 's ' deeply concerned ' about the US leaving the Middle East RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday November 1 , 2006 Print This Email This During an interview with conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh , US President George Bush expressed deep concerns about the possibility of the United States leaving the Middle East , raising fears that extremists could topple governments to " control oil resources . "
" Give me a second here , Rush , because I want to share something with you , " Bush said .
" I am deeply concerned about a country , the United States , leaving the Middle East . "
Bush said that he was " worried that rival forms of extremists will battle for power , obviously creating incredible damage if they do so ; that they will topple modern governments , that they will be in a position to use oil as a tool to blackmail the West . "
" People say , ' What do you mean by that ? ' "
The president continued .
" I say , ' If they control oil resources , then they pull oil off the market in order to run the price up , and they will do so unless we abandon Israel , for example , or unless we abandon allies . ' "
" You couple that with a country that does n't like us with a nuclear weapon , and people will look back at this moment and say , ' What happened to those people in 2006 ? ' and those are the stakes in this war we face , " Bush said .
" On the one hand we 've got a plan to make sure we protect you from immediate attack , and on the other hand we 've got a long - term strategy to deal with these threats , and part of that strategy is to stay on the offense , " Bush continued .
" Part of the strategy is to help young democracies like Lebanon and Iraq be able to survive against the terrorists and the extremists who are trying to crush their hopes , and part of the democracy is for a freedom movement , which will help create the conditions so that the extremists become marginalized and unable to recruit . "
Limbaugh called Bush 's comments " extremely visionary . "
A transcript , as well as audio of the Bush interview can be found at Limbaugh 's Website
AROUND 700 m Asians , mostly men , cannot get through the day without puffing on a cigarette .
The habit is thought to kill around 2.3 m
Asians every year , almost half of the global victims of smoking .
Cigarette consumption in China soared between 1970 and 1990 but has fallen slightly since .
Most Asian countries have signed the WHO 's tobacco - control treaty , committing themselves to restricting cigarette marketing , curbing smoking in public and helping smokers to give up .
Not a moment too soon : not only is smoking among men far more common than in the West , there is concern that Asia will follow the Western trend , with more women taking up smoking as men quit .

Bush ’s " war on terror " quickly became Bush ’s war on Iraqi civilians .
So far over one million Iraqi civilians have lost their lives because of Bush ’s invasion , and four million have been displaced .
Iraq ’s infrastructure is in ruins .
Disease is rampart .
Normal life has disappeared .
Self - righteous Americans justify these monstrous crimes as necessary to ensure their own safety from terrorist attack .
Yet , Americans are in far greater danger from their own police forces than they are from foreign terrorists .
Ironically , Bush ’s " war on terror " has made Americans less safe at home by diminishing US civil liberty and turning an epidemic of US police brutality into a pandemic .
The only terrorist most Americans will ever encounter is a policeman with a badge , nightstick , mace and Taser .
A Google search for " police brutality videos " turns up 2,210,000 entries .
Some entries are foreign and some are probably duplications , but the number is so large that a person could do nothing but watch police brutality videos for the rest of his life .
A search on " You Tube " alone turned up 2,280 police brutality videos .
PrisonPlanet has a selection of the most outrageous recent cases .
Police brutality has crossed the line from using excessive force against a resisting Rodney King to unprovoked gratuitous violence against persons offering no resistance , such as the elderly , women , students , and elected officials .
Americans are not safe anywhere from police .
Police attack Americans in university libraries , in public meetings , and in their own homes .
Last week we had the case of the University of Florida student who was repeatedly Tasered without cause for asking Senator Kerry some good questions in the question and answer period following Kerry ’s speech .
Two days after the Florida student was gratuitously brutalized , Senate Republicans defeated Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy ’s bill to restore habeas corpus protection .
A UCLA student was Tasered by police without cause for studying in the university library without having his student ID on his person .
Following police orders to leave , the student was walking toward the door when police grabbed him and repeatedly Tasered him .
On September 19 , 2007 a young woman was repeatedly Tasered without cause by a large brutal cop in a parking lot outside a night club in Warren Ohio .
On September 14 , 2007 , Roseland , Indiana , city council member David Snyder was ejected from a council meeting by dictatorial council chairman Charlie Shields .
Snyder had protested being limited to one minute to speak .
Police goon Jack Tiller escorted Snyder out , and as Snyder exited the building , Tiller , following behind , pushed Snyder to the ground and without cause began beating Snyder in the head with a nightstick .
Snyder was hospitalized .
Local TV news stations throughout the US offer an endless stream of police brutality videos , which are then posted on the stations ’ web sites , often with an opportunity for citizens to express their opinion of the incidents .
There are many disturbing aspects to police brutality cases .
One disturbing aspect is that the police always arrest the people that they have gratuitously brutalized .
There was no justification whatsoever to arrest councilman Snyder , or the UCLA student , or the University of Florida student .
The cops committed assault against innocent citizens .
The cops should have been arrested for their criminal acts .
Instead , the cops cover up their own crimes by arresting their victims on false charges that are invented to justify the unprovoked police violence against citizens .
Another disturbing aspect is that no one tells the police to stop the brutality .
" Free " Americans are so intimidated by police that on February 19 of this year male customers in a Chicago bar stood aside while a drunk cop weighing 251 pounds beat a 115 pound barmaid , knocking her to the floor with his fists and repeatedly kicking her , for obeying the bar rules and not serving him more drinks .
Yet another disturbing aspect is that a minority of citizens will justify each act of police brutality no matter how brutal and how unprovoked .
For example , WNDU .com ’s poll of its viewers found that 64.2 % agreed that Snyder was a victim of police brutality , but 27.8 % thought that Snyder got what was coming to him .
" Law and order conservatives " and other authoritarian personalities invariably defend acts of police brutality .
Perhaps the police brutality pandemic will bring the day when we will be able to say that a civil libertarian is a law and order conservative who has been brutalized by police .
The most disturbing aspect is that the police usually get away with it .
I remember decades ago when civil libertarians in New York City tried to stop police brutality by establishing civilian review boards to introduce some accountability into the police ’s interaction with civilians .
Law and order conservatives at William F. Buckley ’s National Review went berserk .
Accountability was " second - guessing " the police .
The result would be a crime wave .
And so on .
Police forces have always attracted bullies with authoritative personalities who desire to beat senseless anyone who does not quake in their presence .
In the past police could get away with brutalizing blacks but not whites .
Today white citizens are as likely as racial minorities to be victims of police brutality .
The police are supreme .
The militarization of the police , armed now with military weapons and trained to view the general public as the enemy , against whom " pain compliance " must be used , has placed every American at risk of personal injury and false arrest from our " public protectors . "
In " free and democratic America , " citizens are in such great danger from police that there are websites devoted to police brutality with online forms to report the brutality .
Nine years ago Human Rights Watch published a report entitled , " Shielded from Justice : Police Brutality and Accountability in the United States . "
The report stated :
" Police abuse remains one of the most serious and divisive human rights violations in the United States .
The excessive use of force by police officers , including unjustified shootings , severe beatings , fatal chokings , and rough treatment , persists because overwhelming barriers to accountability make it possible for officers who commit human rights violations to escape due punishment and often to repeat their offenses .
Police or public officials greet each new report of brutality with denials or explain that the act was an aberration , while the administrative and criminal systems that should deter these abuses by holding officers accountable instead virtually guarantee them impunity .
" This report examines common obstacles to accountability for police abuse in fourteen large cities representing most regions of the nation .
The cities examined are : Atlanta , Boston , Chicago , Detroit , Indianapolis , Los Angeles , Minneapolis , New Orleans , New York , Philadelphia , Portland , Providence , San Francisco , and Washington , D.C. Research for this report was conducted over two and a half years , from late 1995 through early 1998 .
" The brutality cases examined , which are set out in detail in chapters on each city , are similar to cases that continue to emerge in headlines and in survivors ’ complaints .
It is important to note , however , that because it is difficult to obtain case information except where there is public scandal and / or prosecution , this report relies heavily on cases that have reached public attention ; disciplinary action and criminal prosecution are even less common than the cases set out below would suggest .
There is no way to hold police accountable when the president and vice president of the United States , the attorney general , and the Republican Party maintain that the civil liberties and the separation of powers mandated by the US Constitution must be abandoned in order that the executive branch can keep Americans safe from terrorists .
Even before the " war on terror , " federal police murdered 100 people in the Branch Davidian compound at Waco , and no one was held accountable .
Who is a terrorist ?
If the police and the US government have the mentality of airport security , they cannot tell a terrorist from an 86 - year old Marine general on his way to give a speech at West Point .
Retired Marine Corps General Joseph J. Foss was delayed and nearly had his Medal of Honor confiscated .
Airport security regarded the pin on the metal as a weapon that the 86 - year old Marine general and former governor of South Dakota could use to hijack an airliner and commit a terrorist deed .
In America today , every citizen is a potential terrorist in the eyes of the authorities .
Airport security makes this clear every minute of every day , as do the FBI and NSA with warrantless spying on our emails , postal mail , telephone calls , and every possible invasion of our privacy .
We are all recipients of abuse of our constitutional rights whether or not we suffer beatings , Taserings , and false arrests .
The law makes it impossible for Americans to defend themselves from police brutality .
Law and order conservatives have made it a felony with a long prison sentence to " assault a police officer . "
Assaulting a police officer means that if a police thug intends to beat your brains out with his nightstick and you disarm your assailant , you have " assaulted a police officer . "
If you are not shot on the spot by his backup , you will be convicted by a " law and order " jury and sent to prison .
No matter how gratuitous and violent the police brutality , a " free " American citizen can defend himself only at the expense , if not of his life , of a long stay in prison .
Osama bin Laden must wish that he had such power over Americans .
The Best of Paul Craig Roberts
Radiohead is experimenting with allowing you to pay whatever you want for the new Radiohead album , apparently on the theory that you ’ll download it anyway , of which they get zero , or buy a CD from a label , of which they get very little .
My friend Iain waiting patiently for a Radiohead concert a long time ago in a place far away .
( Image courtesy Nat . )
I thought it might be useful to add two facts for those trying to figure out what to pay for this .
First , what you ’ve actually given to Radiohead ( as opposed to the distributors ) for past albums .
Terry Fisher ’s stimulating Promises To Keep has a useful appendix discussing what goes where when you buy a CD .
Bottom line from Table A.3 , p. 262 : on average , 12 % of the money when you buy a CD goes to the artist ; another 4 % to the composer .
Of course , these numbers are approximate , and averages : some marketing money and other expenses are then taken back from the artists , CDs sold in Canada are even worse ( the distributor gets a much larger share ) , and some megastars get higher numbers in their contracts .
But 16 % is a good ballpark figure for the percentage of a CD purchase that goes to the composer - musician , which means if you paid $ 14 for the last few Radiohead albums Radiohead actually saw about $ 2.24 of your $ 14 .
Secondly , the actual costs of the album .
The majority of costs of traditional CD sales go to various overheads - distribution , marketing , etc .
So far , Radiohead has done no marketing for this album , except the website .
For the digital product , the distribution costs are very , very low .
Assuming they use very high quality mp3 files ( call it 1/4 gig ) , and going from the prices charged by Amazon ’s S3 service for bandwidth , Radiohead ’s cost for distribution will be a little less than five cents .
Combine these two numbers and you get a price floor of about $ 2.30 – if you pay that much for the digital downloads , Radiohead is probably seeing exactly as much money from you for this album as they will have seen from previous albums .
Obviously , this is just a ballpark figure , but it is in the right range .
Drop below that , and you ’ve basically taken advantage of their experiment .
I personally have decided to split the difference with Radiohead ; of the $ 11.70 that is no longer going to marketing , distribution , etc. , half will stay in my pocket , and the other half will go to the band ( on top of the base $ 2.30 ) .
I ’m doing this partially because they were probably hosed by the labels in the past , partially because I want to encourage this kind of experimentation in the music industry , and partially , frankly , as a bonus for being very good musicians -
I like the idea of compensating good artists more than bad artists , instead of having admitted price - fixers set roughly uniform prices across the industry .
But yeah , bottom line : if you give Radiohead three bucks , you can probably safely sleep pretty easy at night that you ’re not helping them starve .
And if you give more , well , you ’ve supported some economically innovative artists .
Congratulations .
( And to Berkman folks still reading this blog : yes , this would be a good time for Terry to put out a press release pushing his own thinking in this area ;)
“ It would be like the Dow Jones , ” he said .
“ Nobody accuses the Dow Jones of being biased .
It would be good information for all of us .
And then you could say who ’s winning and losing . ”
So far , Republicans like Mr. Kingston are hanging with the president on the spending bill .
They voted overwhelmingly against a measure , vetoed by Mr. Bush earlier this month , to set a timeline for troop withdrawal .
But they must also worry about re-election in 2008 — a worry the president no longer has .
Having already lost control of Congress , they can ill afford another election in which Iraq is the dominant issue .
A standardized metric might give them a useful exit strategy .
But Michael O’Hanlon , the lead author of the Iraq Index , is skeptical .
He says metrics are “ important grist for a fact - based debate , ” but history shows it is dangerous to rely on too few of them .
“ Metrics were used in Vietnam , and we had the wrong ones , and in my opinion they did net harm to the debate , ” Mr. O’Hanlon said , adding , “ I ’m afraid that Congressman Kingston is going to continue to be frustrated , because we ca n’t be exactly precise about which indicators are the conclusive ones . ”
In any event , such an index would be politically unpalatable to the White House , which does not want to back itself into a corner by agreeing to someone else ’s standard for progress .
The White House says the only progress report that counts is the one from Gen. David H. Petraeus , the new top commander in Iraq , and Ryan Crocker , the new ambassador , who are expected to testify on Capitol Hill in September .
The two are apparently trying to prepare .
They have spent the last month in Iraq consulting with a team of independent advisers who have been asked to “ think through the question of , Is the current strategy for waging war going well or not ? ” said Stephen Biddle , a defense policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations and member of the team .
Mr. Biddle could not talk about his work , he said , but he did fault the White House for not being more open with the public about its own idea of what constitutes progress .
“ By being unbelievably vague about everything , ” he said , “ they ’re making it very hard for congressmen and senators to go to their constituents and say , ‘ Look , here ’s why things are going better than you might imagine . ’ ”
Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. , last week released this years progress report on its recycling efforts .
Through its extensive recycling efforts , Nissan has already exceeded the targets set under the Nissan Green Program 2010 mid-term environmental action plan .
Nissanâ€™s love of recycling may have been spurred by trying to achieve compliance with the Japan Automobile Recycling Law , enacted on January 1 , 2005 .
The progress report focused on three key areas :
Automobile Shredder Residue ( ASR ) ja
Airbag - related components
Fluorocarbons ( CFCs / HFCs )
Under the Nissan Green Program 2010 action plan , the company plans to accelerate its recycling efforts to achieve an average 95 % recovery rate for end - of - life vehicles ( ELVs ) by FY2010 .
In Japan , this is four years ahead of the 2015 regulations .
In FY2006 , Nissan recycled 95,240.3 tons from the 128,827.9 tons of ASR ( 635,440 vehicles ) recovered .
This represents a recovery ratio of 73.9 % , which exceeds the 70 % standard required by law .
Nissan is already in compliance nine years ahead of the 2015 legal requirement .
The effective recycling recovery rate stands at 95.2 % * , against the 95 % target set under the Nissan Green Program 2010 environmental action plan .
This has been accomplished four years in advance of the 2010 target .
A total of 439,526 airbag - related products ( 229,049 vehicles ï¼‰were received .
Recycling involve ELV recovery processing as well as on - board deployment .
The airbag recycling ratio stood at 94.3 % , exceeding the legal requirement of 85 % .
A total of 160,200kg of fluorocarbons were collected ( 507,037vehiclesï¼‰ and processed appropriately .
The cost of these recycling efforts amounted to 5,523,193,204 yen .
On the contrary , recycling fees and income generated from the business of managing recycling operations totaled 5,642,113,359 yen , contributing to a net surplus of 118,920,115 yen .
The cumulative balance from the recycling operations from FY2004 to FY2006 results in a deficit of 58,206,881 yen ( $ 478,460 dollars ) , which is consistent with the forecast cost .
The company says it will continue with its efforts to reach the ultimate recovery ratio of 100 % i.e. to reuse and recover 100 % of the materials from ELV into usable resources .
Additional efforts to increase ELV recycling include :
Materials recycling to develop new methods in creating usable materials from ELVs Measures to achieve zero land - fill waste ( in Japan )
In the long - term , Nissan is also making improvements to the recyclability of new vehicles including :
Expansion of vehicle design to enable easy dismantling and recycling of the vehicle Development of recycling technologies for hybrid , electric and fuel cell vehicles
Are you listening American car companies ?
You need to wake up fast , you are falling behind in the hybrid market , the EV market , the Plug in market , and now you are about to be trumped on the life cycle market .
You will be ( even more ) irrelevant in a couple years if you do n’t get your act together .
Here is a quick sketch of a car I think will make you billions .
Electric with small gas back up generator for long trips .
The gas generator only is used to charge the battery , not to drive the car , and as such the tank is only about 5 gallons .
It should come in two seater sports model , 4 door family sedan , and light truck .
I want to be able to plug it into my wall socket , some built in solar panels on the roof for trickle charging in the sun while I am in the office working would be nice too .

ON THE night of March 13th 2006 , 47 lacrosse players at Duke University , North Carolina , paid a couple of strippers to entertain them .
Things went badly from the start .
The girls arrived late .
One of them , Crystal Mangum , was so drunk that she could not utter a coherent sentence .
Her “ dance ” lasted four minutes .
But over the next few days a sordid evening mutated into a life - ruining tragedy .
Ms Mangum alleged that some of the players had beaten and gang - raped her .
And the full force of the American legal system and media machine was deployed against a group of young men who were presumed to embody all the evils of America 's demons of racism and sexism .
The students Ms Mangum accused are white : Ms Mangum is black .
The accusation was a transparent lie from the start .
Ms Mangum , who had been picked up by the police , brought up the subject of rape only when she was confronted with the possibility of a spell in a mental hospital .
She recanted her accusation and then recanted her recantation .
She told conflicting stories that numbered her assailants at anything from two to 20 .
Her co-dancer described her claims as “ a crock ” .
The police who interviewed her on the first night regarded her charges as incredible — and , in truth , she had a long record of alcohol and drug abuse , mental instability and making up far - fetched stories .
Yet , a few weeks later , three of the students were arrested and charged with rape amid the usual media frenzy .
Why did such a tissue of lies produce a high - profile prosecution ?
And why did the media and many of Duke 's faculty side with the stripper , not the lacrosse players ?
This is the subject of “ Until Proven Innocent ” , a superb new book by Stuart Taylor and K.C. Johnson : a book that not only reads like a legal thriller ( John Grisham provides one of the blurbs ) , but also exposes deep problems with America 's legal system and academic culture .
The architect of the disaster was Mike Nifong , the district attorney for Durham County , North Carolina .
Mr Nifong faced a close election campaign , and he relentlessly went after the young men .
He ignored a mass of contradictory evidence when he took up the case .
He spent hours talking to the press and smearing his victims .
When DNA evidence failed to support Ms Mangum 's story , he first refused to hand it over to the defence and then ignored it .
Mr Nifong was ably assisted by the national media and Duke faculty .
The print media churned out headlines about “ a night of racial slurs , growing fear and finally sexual violence ” , and the TV talking heads revelled in the story line .
This column , to its shame , echoed the prevailing wisdom .
Radical students stomped around the campus banging pots and demanding justice ( one sign recommended castration ) .
And a crowd of radical professors pronounced the students guilty as sin .
Some professors used the “ rape ” to illustrate lectures on racial and sexual repression .
Several gave invective - laden interviews to the press .
On April 6th 2006 , 88 faculty members took out a full - page advertisement in the college newspaper condemning the lacrosse players .
In April 2007 , all charges were dropped .
The case provides a vivid example of the way in which a rogue prosecutor can warp the legal system .
“ The prosecutor has more control over life , liberty and reputation than any other person in America , ” wrote Robert Jackson , one of America 's great attorneys - general , in 1940 .
“ While the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our society , when he acts from malice or other base motives , he is one of the worst . ”
There are more of them out there
Mr Nifong was clearly one of the worst .
But he is not alone : American prosecutors increasingly mimic the win- at - any - cost ethic of defence lawyers .
A study by the Centre for Public Integrity in 2003 found that numerous prosecutors had stretched , bent or broken the rules .
The case also provides a vivid example of the evils of political correctness , which is rampant in the media .
One writer noted that “ You could n't invent a story so precisely tuned to the outrage frequency of the modern , metropolitan , bien pensant journalist . ”
A striking number of professors were willing to trample all over legal process in their rush to declare the lacrosse players guilty before charge , let along trial .
And they did so solely on the basis of the players ' race and gender .
One professor , Houston Baker , denounced the lacrosse players as “ young white , violent , drunken men veritably given licence to rape , maraud , deploy hate speech ” .
Duke 's politically - correct faculty thus produced a mirror image of the worst racism of the South in the 1950s , when people were pronounced guilty — and denied their legal rights — solely because they were black .
While all this was going on Duke 's president , Richard Brodhead , did little , if anything , to defend the lacrosse players or to criticise the faculty for its lynch - mob mentality .
A university that charges students over $ 40,000 per year essentially abandoned three of them to the bullying of an out - of - control prosecutor .
Some people have at least learned from the disaster at Duke .
Mr Nifong has been sacked and stripped of his law licence .
Last week he was sent to jail , though only for a day , for his numerous misdemeanours .
The press has struggled to put the record straight — and several people have written their own mea culpas .
The only people who , it seems , have learned nothing from all this are Mr Nifong 's enablers in the Duke faculty .
Even after it was clear that the athletes were innocent , 87 faculty members published a letter categorically rejecting calls to recant their condemnation .
And one professor , proving that some academics are as far beyond parody as they are beneath contempt , offered a course called “ Hooking up at Duke ” that purported to illustrate what the lacrosse scandals tell us about “ power , difference and raced , classed , gendered and sexed normativity in the US . ”
JERUSALEM , June 29 — Israel ’s disgraced president , Moshe Katsav , submitted his resignation to parliament this morning amid fierce public criticism after the state agreed to drop rape charges against him in exchange for an admission of guilt for lesser offenses .
Mr. Katsav ’s resignation , one of the terms of the agreement , is to go into effect on Monday .
Once out of office , he will be charged with committing an indecent act without consent , sexual harassment of two women and harassing a witness , the attorney general , Menachem Mazuz , announced on Thursday .
Under the shadow of the investigation , Mr. Katsav took a leave of absence from his presidential duties , which are largely ceremonial , in January ; his seven - year presidential term was due to end on July 14 .
In a curt letter sent to Parliament Speaker Dalia Itzik by courier , the contents of which were published in the Israeli media , Mr. Katsav made no reference to the reasons for his resignation and did not express any remorse .
He only stated his request to move up the end of his term by two weeks and announced his resignation .
In comments here , Mike of Angle provides some expert opinion :
1 ) The vast majority of print publications -- newspapers and magazines -- are sold for less than it costs to print , ship , and distribute them .
If you 're going to make a profit , it 's going to come from advertisers .
This makes their voice more powerful than readers ' .
2 ) It 's always easier to justify displeasure on the part of readers than advertisers .
If you have 10,000,000 daily readers ( 5,000,000 that actually pay for it , and a rate - base of 8,500,000 ) and 2,000 advertisers , it 's easier and cheaper to replace 100 , 1,000 , or even 10,000 readers than x dollars of ad contracts .
And their logic is correct .
How many of us still deliver our eyeballs to -- or even pay for -- the NYT , after Judith Miller ?
Sure it made us mad , but we still read .
3 ) Advertiser displeasure is felt immediately and goes straight to the bottom line : " Mr. DeBeers is on line four and he 's hopping mad about the article on diamond - mining . "
Reader displeasure is felt mostly in retrospect : " Dear Sirs , I was deeply dismayed to read your irresponsible and one - sided blah - blah - blah ... "
" Well , we 've gotten twenty of these .
Maybe we should consider running an Ombudsman feature . "
" Ahh , do n't worry about it -- they 'll find something else to complain about tomorrow . "
4 ) What each advertiser provides is significant and concrete --x dollars of business -- while what each reader provides is variable , miniscule , and difficult to quantify .
I would imagine that a publication gets its circ audited no more than twice a year , and smaller publications even less frequently .
If you run something that an advertiser does n't like , you lose money today , and you know exactly how much you lose .
If you run something a reader does n't like , perhaps they write a letter ; and perhaps they stop reading .
But unless they also convince 100 of their friends to stop reading , the impact is vanishingly small .
And even when it 's not infinitesimal ( rare ) , and can be tied definitively to x or y article ( difficult ) , there is the assumption with a mass - market product that 100 readers paying 75 cents can be replaced a lot more cheaply and easily than an advertiser that pulls $ 100,000 worth of ads .
Losing readers only costs you money if its significant enough to drop below your rate - base ( which is usually lower than your readership , to give advertisers a good deal ) .
A single article cannot lose you 1 % of your circ , but it can cost you 1 % of your advertising .
If you 're going to err , you err on the side of pissing off readers , not advertisers .
The proliferation of purely advertiser - supported venues since 1950 has made print much more susceptible to advertiser pressure .
The lag time between cause and effect makes advertiser pressure much more immediate , targeted , and painful than reader discomfort .
And the short - term nature of capitalism ( and any publicly traded business ) only increases these effects .
To be blunt -- and with all due respect to anybody who disagrees -- to believe that readers exert anywhere near the pressure that advertisers do , shows merely that the speaker has never been the editor or publisher of anything .
But people WANT to believe this , because they 're used to getting the Sunday NYT for cheap .
If you want a publication to be independent , you must be willing to pay the freight .
Publications are not magically exempted from the rules of capitalism just because we wish they were .

VIENNA ( Reuters ) - State restrictions on use of the Internet have spread to more than 20 countries that use catch - all and contradictory rules to help keep people off line and stifle feared political opposition , a new report says .
Sacha Baron Cohen ( C ) is shown in a scene from the film ' Borat : Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan ' in this undated publicity photograph .
State restrictions on use of the Internet have spread to more than 20 countries that use catch - all and contradictory rules to help keep people off line and stifle feared political opposition , a new report says .
The report cited a prominent incident in 2005 when Kazakhstan seized all .kz Internet domains and closed one deemed offensive and run by Cohen .
REUTERS / Fox Searchlight Pictures / Handout
In “ Governing the Internet ” , the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) presented case studies of Web censorship in Kazakhstan and Georgia and referred to similar findings in nations from China to Iran , Sudan and Belarus .
“ Recent moves against free speech on the Internet in a number of countries have provided a bitter reminder of the ease with which some regimes , democracies and dictatorships alike , seek to suppress speech that they disapprove of , dislike , or simply fear , ” the report by the 56 - nation OSCE said .
“ Speaking out has never been easier than on the Web .
Yet at the same time , we are witnessing the spread of Internet censorship , ” the 212 - page report said .
In a new case not covered by the report , a senior Malaysian minister vowed this week to apply law prescribing jail terms for Web writers of comments said to disparage Islam or the king .
Malaysian police grilled one on - line author over postings the ruling party described as an attack on the country ’s state religion and a bid to stir racial tension .
In Kazakhstan , rules on Internet use are so vague and politicized that they “ allow for any interpretation ... , easily triggering Soviet - style ‘ spy mania ’ ” where any dissident individual or organisation could be branded a threat to national well - being and silenced , according to the OSCE report .
It cited a prominent incident in 2005 when Kazakhstan seized all .kz Internet domains and closed one deemed offensive and run by British satirist Sacha Baron Cohen , who had made the acclaimed spoof film “ Borat : Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan ” .
In a speech to the OSCE parliament on Thursday , Kazakh Information Minister Yermukhamet Yertysbayev insisted Kazakhstan was determined to build democracy and create an “ e- government ” expanding Internet service and making “ our media more free , contemporary and independent ” .
The OSCE report said Kazakhstan ’s state monopoly on Internet providers tended to deter use by making prices for all but very slow and limited dial - up service far higher than those for West Europeans even though Kazakh incomes are much lower .
Georgian law contained “ contradictory and ill - defined ” provisions which might “ give leverage for illegitimate limitation ” of free expression on the Internet , the report said .
George Dillman may be the most famous among a handful of martial artists that travel around the globe to teach people the art of pressure point fighting for a hefty fee .
In this video , which appeared on National Geographic , he demonstrates his ability to focus Chi , a sort of mystical energy , to knock people over without even touching them .
I do n't dispute that martial artists can render a volunteer unconscious with a relatively gentle touch during a carefully - controlled demonstration .
But I wonder how compliant the assistant must be .
Perhaps the underlying principle at work here is the power of suggestion rather than causing an overload to the nervous system or using a jedi mind trick .
If this method of fighting is so effective , why is n't it used in mixed martial arts competitions ?
Perhaps because it takes years to master , is too dangerous to use on a delicate cage fighter , or can be countered by an unintentional wiggle of the tongue or toe .
The explanations for pressure points and acupuncture have a lot in common .
In fact , the spots on the body where martial artists are trained to strike lie along the so - called meridians of the prickly therapy .
A recent study of acupuncture showed that it does not matter where the needles get stuck .
Faith healers can knock people out too , but their explanation is a bit different .
I grew up with Microsoft operating systems .
I ’ve been through MS - DOS 5.0 , Win 3.1 , Windows 95 , 98 , Millenium Edition , NT 4.0 , 2000 , and XP .
Notice how I stopped there .
After over a decade of Windows , I decided to give Ubuntu a try and now have no reason to install Vista .
Here are ten reasons why I chose Ubuntu :
1. Performance
I think its pretty ridiculous to require at least 1GB of RAM , a dedicated graphics card ( Aero ) , and additional USB thumb drives ( ReadyBoast ) to be able to run an operating system .
Vista I ’m looking at you .
Ubuntu simply runs faster and does not demand that much hardware to do so – thats the beauty of the Linux kernel .
2. Applications out of the Box
The Windows ’ application set is pretty weak right after a fresh install .
You get a calculator , notepad and other archaic remnants of software developed in 1995 when Windows 95 was released .
Ubuntu comes with Open Office , The Gimp ( image editor ) , GAIM ( instant messaging ) , and RhythymBox ( music organizer ) just to name a few .
3. Package Manager
When I do need to install software , I can search for whatever I want from the Universal Repository in Ubuntu .
I can install or remove batches of programs in a single run .
Not only this , but all my software updates automatically because Ubuntu ( or Linux in general ) uses the concepts of packages .
In Windows , installing removing , and updating programs is painful and a lengthy process .
A package manager makes things quick and smooth – not to mention software in the universal repository has been tested by the community to not break your system .
You ca n’t garauntee that in Windows when you ’re downloading executables from anywhere on the net .
4. Security
I do n’t have to worry about viruses or spyware .
Yes this sounds like an Apple fanboy thing to say , but its true .
Linux is a derivative of UNIX which was built on the foundation of robustness and security .
I ’m not going to get into the details as to why it is more secure unless you want an operating systems lecture – but not having to run additional scanning software I get my beloved CPU cycles back , giving me better performance =D .
5. A Real Terminal
Use bash , the default terminal in Ubuntu for five minutes and you ’ll see just how powerful it is compared to the Command Prompt .
In fact the command prompt ca n’t really do much except for launch applications without having to install perl or other GNU libraries on top of it .
With Bash I can write scripts gallore to extend the functionality of Ubuntu and make my life easier .
5. Restarting Your Computer Sucks Part 1
Ubuntu hardly ever requires a restart , but in the case you do need to restart its usually not the kernel that froze but your window manager .
In Ubuntu I can restart my window manager without restarting my entire machine by pressing CTRL +ALT + BACKSPACE .
This is about a three second process .
What happens when your screen freezes in Windows ?
You warm up a bowl of Easy Mac while you wait while Windows restarts .
6. Restarting Your Computer Sucks Part 2
Updates are a good thing , they patch up holes in software and make things run smoother .
Whats bad is having to restart your computer when you have to make an update , ahem – Windows .
In Ubuntu you can receive thousands of updates without having to restart your computer , in fact you can even download a new kernel and still be running the previous one .
This is what software engineers dub “ robustness . ”
7. Six Month Release Cycle
Ubuntu is released with better features every 6 months .
I would be pretty disappointed to have waited 5 years for Vista to see that its merely a dumbed down version of XP with a skirt .
8. No Pirating Necessary
With Ubuntu I do n’t have to pirate my operating system .
Its free .
So is the included software .
Even if you do n’t pirate Windows you still feel the backlash from Microsoft because you are forced to download spyware such as Microsoft Genuine Advantage which verifies that your software is legit .
Even if you ’re the good guy you ’re stuck paying over $ 200 for an operating system with spyware installed by default .
9. Choice
The Linux philosophy is about freedom .
I have a choice between which window manager I want to use , I can extend any part of my operating system , I can tweak it to perform and look the way I want .
Ubuntu is a reflection of me .
In Windows you ’re pretty much stuck with one interface , and no individuality .
Maybe this was acceptable for older folks , but for those of us who are Generation Y – self expression are our strengths .
10 . Community
Ubuntu stands for humanity to others .
The Ubuntu community can help me answer any questions I have or solve any problems within one day .
Thats a very quick response time , and the amount of knowledge in the forums , wiki’s , and blogosphere is astounding .
I learn more and more every day .
Granted , there are lots of Windows help on the internet , but nowhere is it as close to being streamlined as the Ubuntu team .
Man Bush chose to lead Pentagon contracting probes left under fire to become Blackwater COO Jason Rhyne and Nick Juliano

The private security firm Blackwater USA , which has faced mounting criticism following an incident earlier this month in which armed guards from the group purportedly killed 11 unarmed Iraqi civilians , has numerous links to the White House as well as many current and former Republicans .
The connections include the firm 's chief operating officer Joseph Schmitz , who was tapped by President Bush in 2002 to " oversee and police the Pentagon 's military contracts as the Defense Department 's Inspector General . "
The relevation was first reported by Ben Van Heuvelen in Salon .
Serving until 2005 , Schmitz went on to preside over " the largest increase of military - contracting spending in history " and joined Blackwater just a month after his departure from the Pentagon , according to Van Heuvelen .
" The resignation comes after Sen. Charles Grassley ( R - IA ) sent Schmitz several letters this summer informing him that he was the focus of a congressional inquiry into whether he had blocked two criminal investigations last year , " according to a 2005 article in the LA Times .
Then - Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , Grassley " accused Schmitz of fabricating an official Pentagon news release , planning an expensive junket to Germany and hiding information from Congress .
Schmitz is the senior Pentagon official charged with investigating waste , fraud and abuse . "
CEO testifies in Congress today Blackwater CEO Erik Prince will testify today before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in a hearing centered on the use of private contractors in Iraq -- but the appearance was at first contested by the State Department , who Van Heuvelen said " directed Blackwater not to give any information or testimony without its sign - off . "
Secretary of State Condoleeza
Rice later agreed that Prince could testify .
" The ties between State and Blackwater are only part of a web of relationships that Blackwater has maintained with the Bush administration and with prominent Republicans , " the story continues .
" From 2001 to 2007 , " says Salon , " the firm has increased its annual federal contracts from less than $ 1 million to more than $ 1 billion , all while employees passed through a turnstile between Blackwater and the administration , several leaving important posts in the Pentagon and the CIA to take jobs at the security company . "
Von Heuvelen goes on to detail additional links between the firm's " luminaries " and the Bush administration and Republican party , including : Erik Prince , Blackwater 's founder , who has donated " roughly $ 300,000 to Republican candidates and political action committees .
Through his Freiheit Foundation , he also gave $ 500,000 to Prison Fellowship Ministries , run by former Nixon official Charles Colson , in 2000 . "
J. Cofer Black , Blackwater Vice Chairman , a 28 - year veteran of the CIA Van Heuvelen describes as " one of the more prominent faces associated with the Bush administration 's interrogation and extraordinary rendition policies . "
Black is also a senior adviser to GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney .
Rob Richer , Vice President for Intelligence , who is the former head of the CIA Near East Division .
" In 2003 , " according to Salon " he briefed President Bush on the nascent Iraqi insurgency .
In late 2004 , he became the associate deputy director in the CIA 's Directorate of Operations , making him the second - ranking official for clandestine operations . "
Fred Fielding , a former outside counsel for the firm , who " has had a long career as a lawyer to prominent Republicans .
From 1970 to 1972 , he was an associate White House counsel in the Nixon administration ; from 1972 to 1974 , he was present for the denouement of that administration as deputy White House counsel . "
Fielding is a former counsel to President Reagan and current White House counsel to President Bush .
Ken Starr , another counsel to Blackwater , who was hired by the firm in 2006 , is best known " as the Independent Counsel who investigated Bill Clinton .
He revealed the intimate details of Clinton 's affair with intern Monica Lewinsky in the infamous Starr Report and set in motion Clinton 's impeachment by Congress . "
Hired guards were involved in more than one shooting per week Private guns - for - hire from Blackwater USA fired their weapons nearly 200 times while working in Iraq , and in four - of - five incidents the security contractors fired the first shots , according to a new Democratic - sponsored congressional report .
Blackwater is facing increased scrutiny since a Sept. 16 incident in which the company 's security personnel killed between 11 and 20 Iraqi citizens during an incident in which Iraqi investigators say the private contractors were unprovoked before opening fire on the crowd .
The Democratic staff of the House Oversight Committee released a 15 - page report Monday that examined Blackwater 's actions in Iraq based on incident reports compiled by the company and other government documents .
The report found that since 2005 Blackwater guards were involved in 195 " escalation of force " incidents in Iraq during which they fired their weapons , an average of 1.4 per week .
In more than 80 percent of those cases Blackwater guards fired first , according to the report , in an apparent violation of the company 's mandate allowing only defensive fire to prevent " imminent and grave danger . "
" In practice , however , the vast majority of Blackwater weapons discharges are preemptive , with Blackwater forces firing first at a vehicle or suspicious individual prior to receiving any fire , " the report notes .
Blackwater has received more than $ 832 million in contracts from the State Department to guard diplomats and embassy officials in Baghdad , but the new report reveals that State has done little to reign in or punish rogue contractors .
" There is no evidence in the documents that the committee has reviewed that the State Department sought to restrain Blackwater 's actions , raised concerns about the number of shooting incidents involving Blackwater or the company 's high rate of shooting first , or detained Blackwater contractors for investigation , " the Democratic staffers write .
At a hearing Tuesday , Blackwater owner Erick Prince will testify along with several State Department officials at an Oversight Committee hearing investigating the Sept. 16 shooting along with other incidents unearthed by the committee .
Several Republicans requested a delay in the hearings until internal State Department investigations conclude .
The FBI says it is beginning its own investigation into the shooting as well .
The controversy apparently has not eliminated Blackwater 's ability to secure government contracts .
On Friday , the Pentagon announced that a Blackwater subsidiary , Presidential Airways Inc. , would receive a $ 92 million contract for air transportation services in Afghanistan , Kyrgyzstan , Pakistan and Uzbekistan .
Monday 's report shows that the State Department not only did n't seek criminal repercussions against rogue guards , in at least one instance the US government acted in concert with Blackwater to help an employee return stateside after he had killed an Iraqi guard .
" Even in cases involving the death of Iraqis , it appears that the State Department 's primary response was to ask Blackwater to make monetary payments to ' put the matter behind us , ' " the report says .
" The most serious consequence faced by Blackwater personnel for misconduct appears to be termination of their employment . "
During the company 's time in Iraq , it has fired 122 contractors for problems ranging from violent behavior , to alcohol abuse , to inappropriate use of weapons , according to the report .
The Oversight report pointed to a shooting on Christmas Eve last year in which an apparently drunk Blackwater contractor shot and killed a security guard to Iraqi Vice President Adil Abd- al - Mahdi .
Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki's top aide called the incident " murder , " and last month 's shooting rekindled Iraqis ' anger over the Dec. 24 , 2006 event .
Blackwater fired the contractor and arranged to have him evacuated from the country ; two days later he flew from Baghdad to Jordan , where he returned to the US with the " authority of the DOS [ Department of State ] Regional Security Officer , " according to the report .
US Embassy officials worked with Blackwater in arranging a $ 15,000 payment to the family of the slain guard .
" According to the State Department , the incident is still under investigation by the Justice Department , " the report notes .
" However , given the passage of nine months with no charges filed , it is unclear whether there is any serious effort to pursue a prosecution in this matter . "
“ Funny … I thought there was a pharmacy ( geo allo ) on that corner ” .
So what ’s happening to those green crosses ?
That pharmacy on the corner – like all the other offices across France , to use the professional term – put up the shutters for good last year rather than being sold on as a going concern which has been the tradition .
That just shows how fast economic transformation can occur .
When I last spoke to a pharmacist some ten years ago , who now retired – she told me that her calling offered “ a good living , security , a certain prestige and a lot of personal pleasure ” .
That conclusion was modified somewhat when I talked to some other expert at her pharmacy at Nice .
She recently became , by the way , the best - known pharmacist in France .
A profession in crisis
Although by no means a pessimist , she confesses that things have changed and that her occupation is in crisis .
For me , that ’s no great surprise since , like many immigrants , I ’ve been puzzled by the number of shops you pass showing that distinctive green cross .
When I enquired a decade ago France had one pharmacy for every 1600 inhabitants – compared with one for every 5000 Brits and one for every 15,000 Danes .
“ That must be very hard on the elderly , ” she remarked “ who ’ve got a long trip to pick up their medicines . ”
But why does France have so many pharmacies ?
“ Several reasons , I ’d say .
The French have always cared a lot about their health and they like medical services to be close at hand and , of course , over the past 60 years the Sécu has subsidised these preferences .
Until recently to be a chemist did offer the gratifications .
So what ’s going on ?
Essentially there ’s a financial crisis .
As Jean - Marie Soyer , president of the pharmacists ’ suggestion in the Alpes - Maritimes , told Nice - Matin recently , “ Of 466 officines in the department some two - thirds are facing financial difficulties .
Their prices are fixed by the government and they ’ve moved up very slowly .
It ’s generally agreed that since the Nineties our margins have fallen by about 50 % .
And then in their effort to shrink the deficit of the Sécu the government has been putting pressure on doctors to prescribe less and at the same time on some products the amount of repayment has been cut or even eliminated and so demand goes down .
On top of that you ’ve got a fall in the number of GPs .
The ideal site for an officine is close by a cabinet de généraliste .
If a doctor retires and is n’t replaced the local pharmacy sees a drop in turnover .
New forms of competition
And , of course , there are now new ways of competing to be faced .
“ That ’s right .
For example , we ca n’t rely on para- pharmacy to increase our turnover .
That ’s been largely taken over by the supermarkets who can discount seriously .
Then there ’s the internet .
It ’s a menace and mainly for people ’s health .
It ’s just not on to buy medicines online with no proper advice and often no quality control . ”
And what if the supermarkets get into the core business , as they hope to do ?
It is for sure , not a good development .
Whatever they say now , they ’d end up giving pharmaceuticals like groceries .
And there is a difference . ”
Do we see any reason for being optimistic ?
Of course we do .
At the beginning there was a lot of consumer doubt and the pharmaceutical companies still try to pressure doctors into prescribing famous products but the amount of generics within the sale of prescription medicines is now over and over and it keeps rising .
At a different level many pharmacists – once fiercely independent – have seen the advantage of collaboration and have come together in what we call groupements de conseils which offer benefits in areas like wholesale buying and marketing .
It does n’t always work out even though a lot of them have tried it out .
One criticism I ’ve heard of pharmacies concerns a big difference in the pricing of over - the - counter products .
A survey found that a box of sweets for the shore throat could cost anything between € 3.0 and € 6 .
“ Maybe in the country where there ’s less competition you can get away with a bit of gouging .
In town you have to charge what the market will bear .
There ’s a trade website that specifies what ’s currently being charged for many items and that has to be your guide . ”
The urgent and immediate service of every sick man in France by a Pharmacy de garde wich stays open during the day and the night too is what makes pharmacists play an essential role in the life of French people .
The human side makes it rewarding
It ’s always interesting to ask any professional or dentists ( dentiste urgence ) if they ’d like their children to have the same career as them .
How did they respond to this ?
They ’ve answered that for me .
No way would they like to be chemists .
They ’ve seen how hard the work is , they usually are at the store more than at home–and they do n’t fancy all that paperwork we face these days .
Certainly , you have to put in a lot of time to make a living and that ’s after 10 - year exercise .
But there ’s another side to it : as a neighborhood pharmacist plays an important part in peoples ’ lives as a source of advice and comfort that no website can rival .
It ’s the human side of the job that makes it rewarding .
Nobody is thinking of early retirement . ”
Shopping for that new high - definition television this summer ?
Skip it , and take a vacation instead , says a University of Colorado at Boulder psychologist who studies happiness .
Assistant Professor Leaf Van Boven has conducted numerous surveys and experiments spanning several years and has found that life experiences , such as vacations , generally make people from various walks of life happier than material possessions .
One reason for this is that experiences are more open to positive reinterpretation , or mental editing , than material possessions .
And vacations are a perfect example of this , according to Van Boven .
" Often we take a vacation and things just do n't always go according to plan , " Van Boven said .
" The weather may not be perfect , or you spend hours waiting in line .
The nice thing about memory is that we sort of forget about all those inconveniences .
We put this very favorable spin on experiences , and that 's harder to do for material possessions , because they are what they are . "
It 's not that we block out the negative memories altogether , Van Boven says , but rather that we just do n't remember them with the same force as the good memories .
" When I went to Disneyland last summer with my wife and two kids , the whole meaning of that trip was to give the kids this experience of seeing all of those characters and going on the fun rides , " he said .
While he did his share of standing in line , that 's not the memory he carries .
" In my memory , it 's the rides and seeing the characters and it's spending way too much money for a hamburger for this idyllic family meal , " Van Boven said .
Another reason he cites for hitting the road over buying the new TV is that experiences contribute to social relationships .
" They have more of what we refer to as social value , and we know that social relationships are a huge component of well - being and life satisfaction , " Van Boven said .
Closely tied to this idea that experiences have more social value is that people also usually have intrinsic motivations for pursuing experiences like vacations .
" One of the things that people tell us is that when they pursue experiences they often do so out of a desire to satisfy intrinsic goals , so they will go backpacking or skiing because they want to challenge themselves , they want to push themselves in new ways , " he said .
Material things are much less likely to be viewed that way .
In fact , Van Boven says people who pursue experiences more than material things are often more popular with others too .
" When you are known as being experiential you become a more likeable person than when you are known as a materialistic person , " he said .
So how can we get the most out of our vacations ?
Van Boven has two suggestions that he says are somewhat contradictory .
The first is to just relax when planning a vacation .
Van Boven says there 's too much pressure to take vacations to the hottest new spots , to appease relatives or to check it off the " go to " list .
" We should be worried about taking vacations with the wrong motives , " Van Boven said .
" I think we ought to be a little more on guard about the motives underlying the types of vacations that we take . "
His other advice is to fit a little more into our vacations .
" Sometimes you just want to sit down and relax and not do anything , and that 's great , " Van Boven said .
" But the problem is if you spend all your time doing that , what are the memories that you 'll have ?
" Even if you 're a little bit tired , or tempted to just sit around the hotel room or sit around the beach , maybe it 's worth going out and doing some of those things you really would like to do , because chances are when you look back you 'll forget the fact that you were a little bit tired at that moment , " he said .
One other option for vacationers is to volunteer for part of a trip .
" I have never , ever heard someone regret helping someone else , " Van Boven said .
" Go somewhere , help out and then spend a few days traveling on your own and relaxing on your vacation .
That 's a wonderful combination . "
Unfortunately several current studies and surveys have shown that Americans are taking fewer and shorter vacations than in years past .
" Who knows why Americans do n't take more vacations , " said Van Boven .
" I think part of the reason is that it 's very easy to believe that we are going to take a lot of vacations in the future , but for right now , we need to work hard to earn the money so that we can go take these vacations .
But we know this does n't always happen . "

Lara broke a horrifying story this week on CBS about the nightmare some Iraqi children in an orphanage faced .
" Iraqi Orphanage Nightmare . "
Abu Ghraib came to my mind .... She was on CNN 's Reliable Sources and talked about the troubles she had trying to get this story cleared within our military and the Iraqi government .
I 'm sure the Bill Kristol 's of the world would say that this is " just an unfortunate incident . "
Download Download
She also responded to Bill O'Reilly 's argument about why he does n't cover the Iraq war all that much ...
LOGAN : Well , I mean , with all due respect to Bill O'Reilly or anyone who takes that line , I mean , I just -- it 's ridiculous .
It 's completely and utterly ludicrous .
And how can you -- the media 's job is not to serve one side or the other .
That 's never been our job .
We 're there to be the watchdog for all sides .
So it 's not up to us to say , oh , you know , it does n't -- it does n't do well for the war effort if you show how many people are being killed , so we 're not going to show it .
I mean , what are we talking about ?
That 's not even journalism .
It 's so ridiculous .
I actually do n't think that I should -- I mean , you should n't have to stoop to address those kinds of issues .
And also , I mean , where are all of these people who think that we 're helping the terrorists ' cause ?
I mean , what about the fact that this is the reality , that these bombings are still taking place , that in spite of the surge , and people are still dying in Iraq , that huge numbers of American soldiers are dying over here ?
I mean , now we 're in the game of hiding , only telling what some people want to hear ?
That 's not what we do .

KURTZ : The bad news out of Iraq has been pretty relentless , as anyone with a television set knows .
But this week there was a story that reminded us , whatever your feelings about the war , that American forces can accomplish some positive things in this bloody conflict .
The circumstances though were just horrifying .
CBS 's Lara Logan reported on a military unit that made a gruesome discovery in a building in central Baghdad .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
LARA LOGAN , CBS CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT
( voice over ) : Inside the building , a government - run orphanage for special needs children , they found more emaciated little bodies tied to their cribs , kept this way for more than a month , according to the soldiers called in to rescue the 24 boys .
STAFF SGT .
MICHAEL BEALE , U.S. ARMY : I saw children that you could see literally every bone in their body , they were so skinny , had no energy to move whatsoever , no expression on their face .
LT .
STEPHEN DUPERRE , U.S. ARMY : Kids were tied up , naked , covered in their own ...
LOGAN ( on camera ) : Feces ?
DUPERRE : ... waste , feces .
And there were just three people that were cooking themselves food , but not for the kids .
LOGAN : In the kitchen ?
DUPERRE : Yes , ma'am .
LOGAN : With all these kids starving around them ?
DUPERRE : That 's correct .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KURTZ : And joining us now from Baghdad to talk about the story and coverage of the war is CBS 's chief foreign correspondent , Lara Logan .
You 've seen a lot of war and devastation on your beat .
What was your gut reaction personally when seeing the pictures of these young boys ?
LOGAN : It was hard to believe .
I mean , nobody can look at those pictures and not be absolutely shocked to the core .
And I think that that 's one of the big problems with this story , because the Iraqis who were there that night , the soldiers who were there and saw how these boys were kept , they understand just how evil it was , what was done to them .
But what you 're hearing from the Iraqi government and even from some American officials is that , oh , there was no electricity , that 's how it happened , and they were tied up for their own good .
And , you know , they 're special needs children , they do n't -- they are disabled , so they would have been dead otherwise if they had n't been in this place .
And my feeling is , if anyone who can say anything like that has n't looked at those pictures and has n't seen those children and does n't want to see those children -- because to take that kind of line when you know what was done to these boys , I think it 's criminal .
KURTZ : How did you get on to this story ?
Was it an effort by the U.S .
military to generate some good news for a change for the American side ?
LOGAN : Now , Howie , you cover the media , so you know that no good journalist discloses their sources .
I can't tell you how I came upon the story , but what I can tell you is that it was not an attempt by the U.S. military .
In fact , what you will be interested to know about is how difficult it was for me to tell this story , which the soldiers themselves thought the media was deliberately hiding it .
What they did n't know was that the Army had n't told anyone about this for a week .
And I found out through my own private means , and when I did , I went to the military .
I was given a lot of support from the unit , a lot of support from the division .
But as it started to go higher up the ranks , to the more political thinkers on the American side , I hit a wall .
And I was told that I needed Iraqi government permission from the Ministry of Labor to do this story , because they said the Iraqis had the lead .
That 's one of their favorite sayings over here , is the Iraqis have the lead on this .
And my response to that was , why do I need permission from the Iraqi government to speak to American soldiers ?
And I was told because , you know , the Iraqis were the ones who saved these boys .
And I said , " Well , that 's very interesting , because I am looking at photographs of American soldiers carrying emaciated boys , and I do n't see any Iraqi soldiers in these pictures . "
And there was a silence on the end of the phone by someone who was actually trying to help me .
And they said , " OK , we 'll come back to you . "
And actually , it 's only because I had a two - hour meeting with a top general in this country who gave me his full approval .
That was how I broke through the wall and managed to get to do the story .
KURTZ : Boy , it 's fascinating that they actually would throw roadblocks in your path .
Now , as you know , in the middle of the week the Iraqi labor minister put out a statement and said , " We totally reject the tricks they use to manipulate and distort facts and show the Americans as the humanitarian party .
That could not be further from the truth .
Is it just propaganda for their alleged kindness ? "
What did you make of that response by the Iraqi government ?
LOGAN : You mean besides blind rage on my part when I heard those words ?
KURTZ : Right .
LOGAN : That -- I mean , it really -- that was how we all felt , because to say something like that , to make this political , to make this more about politics and about staying in power , and self - justification than about these boys , as I said to you before , I think that 's criminal .
And it 's not only deceitful , it 's completely and utterly untrue .
And I do n't know how -- I mean , Prime Minister Maliki ordered all the people involved in this incident at the orphanage to be arrested .
And yet , the minister of labor stood at that press conference where he made those remarks and had the manager of the orphanage next to him , standing there to publicly defend and justify his actions .
I mean , so that demonstrates to me not only that Prime Minister Maliki either does n't have control or is not exercising control , and that the ministry -- the minister of labor is , I mean , he 's dishonest and he should n't be allowed to do this .
I mean , but this ministry is what you call a Sadrite ministry connected to Muqtada al - Sadr and Jaish al - Mahdi , and it seems like they are able to do their own thing .
And they will try and justify this any way they can .
KURTZ : Right .
Let 's talk about the broader issue of war coverage .
FOX 's Bill O'Reilly says that the other networks -- he did not mention CBS -- are constantly showing bombings and suicide attacks and other violence in Iraq to undermine President Bush , and that this is giving the terrorist what they want .
What 's your reaction to that kind of criticism ?
I know you wrestle with how much violence to show in your regular reports .
LOGAN : Well , I mean , with all due respect to Bill O'Reilly or anyone who takes that line , I mean , I just -- it 's ridiculous .
It 's completely and utterly ludicrous .
And how can you -- the media 's job is not to serve one side or the other .
That 's never been our job .
We 're there to be the watchdog for all sides .
So it 's not up to us to say , oh , you know , it does n't -- it does n't do well for the war effort if you show how many people are being killed , so we 're not going to show it .
I mean , what are we talking about ?
That 's not even journalism .
It 's so ridiculous .
I actually do n't think that I should -- I mean , you should n't have to stoop to address those kinds of issues .
And also , I mean , where are all of these people who think that we 're helping the terrorists ' cause ?
I mean , what about the fact that this is the reality , that these bombings are still taking place , that in spite of the surge , and people are still dying in Iraq , that huge numbers of American soldiers are dying over here ?
I mean , now we 're in the game of hiding , only telling what some people want to hear ?
That 's not what we do .
KURTZ : All right .
Got about half a minute .
You reported on Friday that some Iraqi politicians are plotting to topple Prime Minister Maliki through a vote of no confidence .
Why have n't we heard more about that story from other news organizations ?
LOGAN : You know , I really do n't know .
I can't speak to other news organizations .
I mean , that was an exclusive story , getting those people to speak to us and speak to us on camera , and to talk about this .
I know that other reporters are following it and investigating it , but nobody wants to just report what other people are reporting unless -- and this is complicated .
You know , there are rumors all the time over here about different parties forming together to topple the government , but this was much more than rumors .
This is something concrete .
And Prime Minister Maliki is now trying to counter that with another movement .
But these are difficult stories to tell .
And what people often do n't appreciate about serious journalists is that it takes a lot of time and reporting and hard work to be absolutely sure before you go into print or before you go on air .
KURTZ : Right .
LOGAN : And I think that 's what some of my colleagues might be doing at this time .
KURTZ : All right .
Well you had them on camera .
A fascinating story .
Lara Logan , thanks very much for joining us from Baghdad .
And please , stay safe
LONDON ( CNNMoney.com ) --
This month 's rise in global interest rates is probably a sign of the beginning of the end of an era of supercheap money - a change with profound implications for the recent record - setting stock rally , the buyout boom and economic growth worldwide .
The question now is how much more rates might rise in the United States and elsewhere , and how that will affect world markets - and hundreds of millions of investors and consumers from Tokyo to Frankfurt to New York .
The yield on the 10 - year Treasury note , which affects rates throughout the economy , has spiked to the highest level in five years on growing worries about rising rates worldwide .
For years , the world has enjoyed historically low interest rates .
This has helped fuel a boom in corporate mergers and private equity buyouts and a rally in stock prices and in other assets , such as real estate .
But with economic growth outside the United States picking up and fanning inflation , central bankers around the world are pushing rates higher in a bid to cool growth and avoid bigger problems later on .
" There 's been too much global liquidity and now we are seeing a shift away from multi-decades of declining rates and declining inflation , " said Josh Stiles , managing director of research firm IDEAglobal in New York .
" This is the end of the cheap money cycle , " Marc Pado , U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York , said .
The European Central Bank , which sets rates for most of Europe , hiked rates to a six - year high last week .
The Bank of England and Bank of Canada are both expected to raise rates next month , and the Bank of Japan is expected to hike rates by the fall .
Higher rates raise the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers and are poised to impact everything from economic growth and corporate profits to the performance of stocks and bonds and the payments that home owners make .
Here 's a brief look at what higher rates will mean for global economy , financial markets and investors around the world .
Bonds
There has been no market where concerns about inflation and rising interesting rates have played out more dramatically than in the usually staid bond market .
The yield on the benchmark 10 - year Treasury note hit 5.3 percent this week , the highest level in five years .
Yields have backed off a bit since then , but are still up from just 4.5 percent three months ago .
The drop in bond prices - and rise in yields , which move in the opposite direction - has come as bond traders unwind bets that rates would stay low - or even head lower still .
" People are being more optimistic about the U.S. economy , and therefore have written off rate cuts from the Fed that they were expecting , " said Laurent Fransolet , head of European fixed income research at Barclays Capital in London , referring to the Federal Reserve .
After having been so low for so long , investors are waking up to the reality that yields will rise to more " normal " levels .
Long - term
Treasury yields have been kept low in recent years , in large part due to strong buying from foreign central banks .
But as those overseas investors diversify their holdings , their appetite for U.S. government debt is expected to drop , analysts say .
That in itself could feed more bond market selling and more upward pressure on rates .
Bond yields are n't just rising in the United States .
The yield on a global basket of government bonds is at 4 percent - the highest level since December 2000 , according to the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Global Treasury index , which tracks the performance of government bonds from 33 countries .
Those heavily invested in bonds may be lamenting the heavy selling , but the rise in yields may be something investors have to get used to , said Ken Mayland , president of ClearView Economics , a firm specializing in economic research .
" Demand for capital has become much more intense .
The improvement in the world economy justifies paying a higher yield - that 's not a bad thing , " he said .
Higher yields also make bonds a more attractive investment , and if yields keep climbing , as many market watchers expect them to do over the next few years , that could lure some investors away from stocks .
Stocks
Global stock markets have rallied , supported by the buyout boom and a flood of funds from investors large and small alike .
But rate concerns pummeled stocks over the past two weeks , until the markets snapped back Wednesday and showed further signs of life Thursday .
Before the recent pull back , the Dow industrials and broader S&P 500 had risen to record highs .
Stocks in Europe were rallying too .
The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is close to its record high .
Why all the turmoil in stock markets ?
Rising rates dampen economic growth , and that can hurt corporate profits - and stock prices .
They also are likely to crimp merger and buyout activity , which has been a key source of support for stocks worldwide .
" Valuations are a function of interest rates , " says Christopher Zook , chairman and chief investment officer at CAZ Investments in Houston .
" As interest rates move higher , valuations will come down , " he said .
Investors are starting to reassess their willingness to take on risk , but rates will have to move much higher before they really start to hurt the stock market , analysts said .
The recent selloff took the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 down about 3 percent apiece - a modest decline given the market 's recent run .
Still , it 's not clear the selling is wrung out of the market yet .
Peter Dixon , strategist at Commerzbank in London , expects markets to level off as investors reassess where they see opportunity .
" The warning shots fired by the market will perhaps make investors stop and think about whether they can continue to pile into asset classes without abandon and not have to pay the price at some time , " he said .
It will take some time for this to play out in the market , and some markets may be hit harder than others .
Dixon thinks European stocks will sell off less than in the United States , mostly because recovering consumer demand should offer support .
Economic growth
Rising rates could hurt economic growth , especially in the United States , where rising mortgage rates could threaten the already fragile housing sector by increasing the burden on home buyers .
The housing sector already faces pressure from an oversupply of homes on the market and falling home values in some markets .
The sector also faces risks from ongoing problems in so - called subprime loans to borrowers with weak credit .
Weakness in the housing sector has worried economists , and the market still may worsen .
At their last meeting in May , Federal Reserve officials said the downturn in housing was turning out to be more severe than expected .
But even though central banks abroad are raising rates , the Fed wo n't necessarily follow along .
The U.S. economy grew at just a 0.6 percent rate in the first quarter - the weakest in just over four years - though the second quarter looks to be stronger .
Still , Paul Donovan , senior global economist at UBS in London , noted that inflation seems to easing and said he expects the U.S. economy to slow further in the second half .
He believes it 's actually more likely that the Fed will lower rates eventually , rather than hike them , as many investors now fear .
And when it comes to the global economy , the outlook remains upbeat .
The main reason central banks are lifting rates overseas is that global growth has been strong , and is n't slowing as much as economists had expected .
" Globally , growth has in some cases surprised on the upside .
You 've got a situation where rates are rising because growth is n't slowing relative to where expectations were rather than a situation where rates are pushing down growth , " Donovan said .
He expects global growth of 4.9 percent this year , which matches the forecast from the International Monetary Fund .

A NASA contract worker barricaded himself inside a Johnson Space Center building Friday and killed one of two hostages before committing suicide .
William A. Phillips , a 60 - year - old engineer , fatally shot co-worker David Beverly in the chest with a snub - nosed revolver about 1:40 p.m. , authorities said .
More than three hours later , with Houston police and JSC security officers inside the three - story Building 44 , Phillips shot himself in the head .
Police found a second hostage , Francelia Crenshaw , also a contract worker , bound to a chair with duct tape in the same room .
She was taken to Christus St. John Hospital near the center and later released .
It was not clear why Phillips — described as a model employee for 13 years by Mike Coats , JSC 's director — went on the rampage .
Police were unable to communicate with him during the standoff .
On a chalkboard in the room where his body was found , Phillips left a list of names and phone numbers and a scribbled note , which was not immediately understandable , Houston Police Chief Harold Hurtt said .
There was apparently a dispute between Phillips and Beverly , but the gunman did not threaten Crenshaw , who was uninjured , Hurtt said .
Unmarried and with no children , Phillips ' closest relative is a cousin , Hurtt said .
Police also searched Phillips ' sparsely furnished house in Clear Lake for more than an hour , but found nothing to indicate he had planned the confrontation , officer Gabe Ortiz said .
Ties to shuttle work
Phillips worked for Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. , which employs more than 1,000 employees in its five - year contract with NASA .
The Pasadena , Calif . - based company has a wide - ranging business that includes aerospace and defense contracts , as well as providing services to the energy , pharmaceutical , building and automotive industries .
For NASA , the engineering firm has been involved in designing a system to analyze the impact of debris that might hit the space shuttle 's wings , according to the company 's Web site .
John Prosser , the company 's executive vice president of finance and administration , confirmed Phillips ' employment but would not release any details of his work history .
" We do not release personal data , " Prosser said , adding that the company would not release any further comment until the conclusion of the case .
Phillips worked with Beverly , a NASA civil servant , and Crenshaw , who is an employee of MRI Computer Services , in Building 44 , located at the center of the sprawling 1,600 - acre campus .
Evacuation ordered
In all , about 50 people work in the building , which includes offices and labs for engineers working on communications and tracking systems related to the space shuttle program .
After the first reports of gunfire , employees evacuated the building and others were ordered to remain in their offices for several hours .
Nearby , Space Center Intermediate School kept its teachers and 900 students inside until 3:30 p.m .
The standoff , officials said , did not disrupt activity at Mission Control , where the agency was preparing for Saturday 's return of a Russian spacecraft carrying two Americans .
Coats updated employees on the situation in an e-mail message Friday night .
' ' A tragedy struck our NASA family today , " he wrote .
'' While we do n't understand all that has happened .
Our hearts and prayers go out to the families and co-workers who lost their loved ones today and the survivor who endured a tragic ordeal . "
Coats said he expected the NASA facility to return to normal operations on Monday , largely because the incident was confined to one building .
However , NASA Administrator Michael Griffin was flying to Houston to meet with Coats and his staff Saturday morning to discuss operations .
NASA , meanwhile , will offer counseling to employees , Coats said .
Phillips was known in his neighborhood as a quiet man who kept to himself .
Joseph Thomas , who lived across Jade Meadow Court from Phillips for three years , did not recognize his name and rarely saw him .
Michael Russell , who lived in the same well - kept subdivision as Phillips for 13 years , said he had waved at him on the way to work Friday , and was stunned to learn of the violent outburst just hours later .
" There was nothing in his behavior , the way he acted or what he said that would give you any indication that he would snap like this , " Russell said .
Few neighbors said they even knew where Phillips worked .
Prompting look at stress
The baffling tragedy was a second jolt to NASA in less than three months .
Former astronaut Lisa Nowak is accused of trying to kidnap a rival for a space shuttle pilot 's affections in February .
Nowak , who drove to Florida from Houston to confront the other woman , became the first astronaut charged with a felony and subsequently became the first astronaut fired from the astronaut corps .
The two incidents raised questions about the stress level of workers at the NASA installation .
" We need to look at it , " Coats said late Friday .
" Are the employees stressed out here or no ?
I do n't know .
We 've tried to keep our fingers on that pulse .
We work our folks pretty hard , no question about it . "
NASA will take a second look at security , said Eileen Hawley , the agency 's director of external relations .
Anyone who comes onto the campus must carry an employee badge or a visitor badge .
Visitors must show a driver 's license or some other form of identification to enter the property .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton is returning about $ 850,000 in campaign contributions from a fundraiser who was arrested last week after trying to escape sentencing on a decade - old criminal charge , the campaign said on Monday .
“ In light of recent events and allegations that Mr. Norman Hsu engaged in an illegal investment scheme , we have decided out of an abundance of caution to return the money he raised for our campaign , ” spokesman Howard Wolfson said in a statement .
The campaign is refunding about $ 850,000 to some 260 donors this week , Wolfson said .
The Washington Post characterized the refund as one of the largest in political history .
Hsu was convicted of fraud in 1992 .
He had evaded authorities for years , spending time in Asia before emerging in recent years in the United States as a generous donor to Democrats , including Clinton presidential rival Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois .
FBI agents arrested Hsu on federal charges of unlawful flight on Thursday evening at a Grand Junction , Colorado , hospital .
He had failed to appear at a hearing in California on Wednesday .
“ Hsu donated to numerous charities and more than two dozen candidates and committees .
Despite conducting a thorough review of public records , our campaign , like these others , were unaware of Mr. Hsu ’s decade - plus - old warrant , ” Wolfson said .
Wolfson said the campaign was tightening its vetting procedures for fundraisers who solicit donations , including criminal background checks , to guard “ against this type of situation in the future . ”
California Attorney General Jerry Brown ’s office said last week that Hsu would be returned to the state to face sentencing for his conviction arising from a business scheme that bilked about 20 investors of approximately $ 1 million .
I believe there 's a healthy balance all programmers need to establish , somewhere between …
Locking yourself away in a private office and having an intimate dialog with a compiler about your program .
Getting out in public and having an open dialog with other human beings about your program .
I 've talked about this a few times already , so I wo n't belabor the point .
Most programmers are introverts , so they do n't usually need any encouragement to run off and spend time alone with their computer .
They do it naturally .
Left to their own devices , that 's all they 'd ever do .
I do n't blame them ; computers are a lot more rational than people .
That 's what attracts most of us to the field .
But it is possible to go too far in the other direction , too .
It 's much rarer , because it bucks the natural introversion of most software developers , but it does happen .
Take me , for example .
Sometimes I worry that I spend more time talking about programming than actually programming .
At the point when I spend all my time talking about programming , and very little of my time programming , my worst fear has been realized : I 've become a pundit .
The last thing the world needs is more pundits .
Pundits only add ephemeral commentary to the world instead of anything concrete and real .
They do n't build any lasting artifacts ; instead , they passively observe other people 's work and offer a neverending babbling brook of opinions , criticism , and witty turns of phrase .
Perhaps that 's why I find this blog entry from SEO Black Hat so inspiring :
Do it F *** ing Now .
Do n't wait .
Do n't procrastinate .
The winners in this world are not the ones who find the greatest excuses to put off doing what they know will make them more money .
The winners are the ones that prioritize and seize the day .
Create a list of action items to make sure your important tasks get accomplished .
Every project you 're working on should be in action .
If you 're not moving , you 're standing still .
Your next step towards making money must not be " something I 'll take care of maybe sometime next week . "
If it 's going to help make you money : Do it F *** ing Now .
Some of you may think that you do n't need the " f*** ing " in " do it f*** ing now " .
You do .
You need that impact , that force , that call to action , that kick in the ass to get you moving .
Otherwise , you 'll end up another loser that had a great idea a long time ago but never did anything about it .
Dreamers do n't make money .
Doers make money .
And doers " Do it F *** ing Now . "
It 's like a stiff jolt of heavily caffeinated coffee .
It may be a bit too Glengarry Glen Ross for some .
Specifically this speech , and this scene .
Even if it 's intentionally over the top , I think this advice applies to programming , too .
The best programmers get off their butts .
As Cade Roux noted in a comment , the text on the Glengarry Glen Ross blackboard is " Always Be Closing " , but we should read it as …
Always Be Shipping
It 's helpful to discuss features , but sometimes the value of a feature is inversely proportional to how much it has been discussed .
Our job as software developers is to deliver features and solve business problems , not to generate neverending discussion .
Ultimately , As Marc Andreessen notes , we will be judged by what we – and our code – have done , not the meta - discussion that went on around it .
For the background part , I like to see what someone has done .
Not been involved in , or been part of , or watched happen , or was hanging around when it happened .
I look for something you 've done , either in a job or ( often better yet ) outside of a job .
The business you started and ran in high school .
The nonprofit you started and ran in college .
If you 're a programmer : the open source project to which you 've made major contributions .
Something .
If you can't find anything – if a candidate has just followed the rules their whole lives , showed up for the right classes and the right tests and the right career opportunities without achieving something distinct and notable , relative to their starting point – then they probably are n't driven .
And you 're not going to change them .
Maybe " Do it f*** ing now " is too extreme , but at the very least , make sure you spend at least as much of your time doing as discussing .
Unfortunately , I can't tell you what the right things are to do .
If I knew that , I 'd probably be a millionaire by now .
You 'll have to decide what 's actually worth doing yourself .
Who remembers the deadly liquid bomb airliner plot ?
Most of you , we 're guessing , as there are still a lot of fairly mindless restrictions on taking liquids aboard planes - no matter that the plot was actually rather far - fetched .
But fear not , UK readers , as your unelected representatives are alert to your interests .
Yesterday saw the liquid ban debated in the House of Lords , as ordinary legislative nobles grilled government mouthpiece Baron Bassam of Brighton .
The good Baron , raised to the peerage from among the common herd after more than a decade 's trusty service on Brighton council , did n't seem to have been furnished with a very comprehensive brief .
Here are a few of the pearls he offered :
" We continuously monitor the effectiveness of , in particular , the liquid security measures ... "
How , one might ask ?
But hold on :
" The fact that there has not been a serious incident involving liquid explosives indicates , I would have thought , that the measures that we have put in place so far have been very effective . "
Ah , that 's how .
On which basis the measures against asteroid strike , alien invasion and unexplained nationwide floods of deadly boiling custard have also been remarkably effective .
At times , the debate seemed to verge on the whimsical .
" We should not complain too loudly , " said the Baron .
" I always celebrate the fact that there is effective security at airports ...
A friend of mine had two jars of Marmite confiscated , which I thought was a bit tough at the time , but these are the things that we have to put up with . "
The only possible reading of this is that , now that the Baron has been briefed in by security experts , he no longer considers the Marmite seizure unjustified .
The implications of this are literally breathtaking .
Yes , that 's right : the government have warning of a fiendish terrorist plot to destroy airliners using EXPLODING MARMITE .
( Aiee ! )
And that 's not all .
Consider this question by the Baron of Battersea :
" My Lords , when these measures were first introduced , there was a complete prohibition on taking tubes of toothpaste or any liquids .
This was subsequently changed .
Why ? "
The response from the troubled Brightonian insta-noble was very much in accordance with the traditions of upper - house debate .
" My Lords , " quoth he , " I can only assume that it was because the level of threat from a tube of toothpaste was considered rather less than that from a bottle of liquid . "
Fortunately Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall was there to cut through the muddle and get to the root of the issue .
" Does my noble friend agree , " she inquired , " that one of the best ways of avoiding the problems of security at airports is not to fly at all ?
Perhaps his department might discourage people from flying rather than encouraging them to get round the security problems . "
Baron Bassam fell back on the oh - shut - up - you - old - fool gambit , saying : " I know that my noble friend has a particular thing about flying and I entirely respect her point of view .
However , I think that we would all recognise that aviation plays an important part in the life of our country . "
But the wily second Baron Elton - one of that rather unique class of only - in - Blighty legislators , the elected hereditary peers * - delivered a telling blow , with a question many of us have wanted to ask at airports .
" What damage can be done by 105 millilitres of liquid that cannot be done by 100 millilitres of liquid ? " he snapped , testily .
This completely floored Baron Bassam .
" My briefing does not extend to that , " muttered the confused government toff .
" I suspect that this is based on science . "
Ah , science .
That 's all right then . ®
* Note for non -UK readers : Elected hereditary peers are a real thing .
One is born a lord , and then elected by one 's fellow hereditary toffs to a seat in the upper house of Parliament .
It was , like most of the British constitution , supposed to be a temporary stopgap measure .
PHOTO : Xenon lights .
( Tim Dillon , USA TODAY ) Bright lights , big controversy By James R. Healey , USA TODAY
You 're driving at night , ' round a bend and  ouch !
 you 're staring down the barrel of high - caliber headlights boring right at you .
Some creep left on the high beams , you grumble .
But no , those are too bright , too white , almost blue , like an iceberg .
What the heck are those lights ?
Can that much glare be legal ?
Is n't it unsafe ?
The lights are xenon - gas - ignited , high - intensity - discharge ( HID ) headlights , often known simply ( and incorrectly ) as xenon ( ZEE - non ) headlights .
They are wildly popular with some motorists , and , if properly aimed , they are quite legal .
Read more Video Xenon lights illuminate safety concerns
But they are not benign :
The glare they produce is real , and its effects measurable in scientific studies .
HID headlights pour out more illumination than conventional tungsten - halogen headlights do , especially to the sides .
And they do it at the blue end of the color spectrum where the eye 's sensitive at night .
The result : Oncoming drivers are often surprised by the light and frequently say it hurts .
" They 're too bright , " says motorist Michelle Massey of St. Louis , who often drives her sport- utility vehicle on secondary roads at night .
She 's afraid that the glare 's bad enough , and the vehicles close enough to each other on winding two - lane roads , that a collision is likely .
Tim Dillon , USA TODAY
The government is looking at the lights .
Federal safety regulators are concerned , as well .
In fact , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) is about to start a process that paves the way for the biggest change in headlight regulations since they were established in 1968 .
The agency also will look at glare from high - mounted truck and van headlights , and from auxiliary fog and driving lights .
NHTSA " has been receiving complaints of glare " and wants to hear , officially , what people have to say , says Richard Van Iderstine , chief of the agency 's visibility and injury - prevention division .
NHTSA could do nothing , could swing the other way and overhaul regulations so that every headlight would have to be redesigned , or come to rest between those extremes .
No decision is likely for more than a year .
Seeking input The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration plans to ask for public comment on headlight glare this summer .
The invitation will be published in the Federal Register and on the agency 's Web site , www.nhtsa.dot.gov.
In what could be an epic battle , the xenon warrior princes will be automakers and driving enthusiasts in support of bright whites vs. many ordinary motorists tired of squinting and squirming .
" They are major cool , " says Gordon Wangers , driving enthusiast and boss at AMCI , a California testing firm that validates automakers ' advertising claims .
" I never tire of switching them on and watching that bluish - white , fire - up - and - focus routine .
In fact , I always do it two or three times to show off if I have passengers , " Wangers says .
The only drawback Wangers sees is that " on dark , twisting roads , the line between lighted and dark is too pronounced .
... Conventional headlights have a more natural fade area . "
Wangers says he's not bothered by HID glare when he's on the other end of the beam .
Nor is Matthew Strahan of Mount Pleasant , Tenn. , who 's about to buy an Acura CL with HID lights and thinks " they are useful .
They do well in the rain . "
Driving toward HID lights has " never bothered me at all , " he says , and " it makes no difference to me " that others dislike the glare .
If it were n't the headlights , people would find something else to complain about , he 's sure .
' They bother my eyes ' Headlight repair costs soar
If nothing else , high - intensity - discharge ( HID ) headlights have sent headlight repair and replacement costs through the sunroof .
The cost trend was sharply upward even before HID lights because automakers had begun using sleek , one - piece composite halogen headlights that integrated with modern styling better than older , less - expensive round or rectangular lights .
The composite 's one - piece design means it has to be replaced completely even if damage is minor or cosmetic .
Add HID lights ' expensive components to a fender - bender and stand back .
Somebody 's going to have to write an enormous check .
If it 's your insurance company , expect it to eventually show up in your rates .
State Farm Insurance , the biggest auto insurer , offers some illuminating contrasts between the replacement costs for standard halogen lights in composite housings and xenon - fired HID lights .
As a benchmark for what 's dirt - cheap among today 's headlights , consider the base - level Chevrolet Astro cargo van .
Its headlights are $ 50 each to replace .
Step up to a fancier Astro with composite halogen headlights and the bill rises to $ 128 - still chump change in the world of HID lights .
On the other side are motorists like Rebecca Boudreau of Aliso Viejo , Calif. , who sums the universal objection nicely : " I do n't like them .
They bother my eyes .
I think that they 're bad for ( others who are ) driving . "
What 'll make this tough to resolve is that both sides are right : HID lights provide better lighting , and they also produce more glare .
Headlights have to meet federal minimum and maximum illumination standards , measured at a variety of points around the light beam .
But within those standards , there 's enough room  physically and legally  for light to shine where oncoming drivers think it should n't .
Despite complaints from oncoming drivers , the glare from HID lights does n't seem to cause accidents , hard as that might be to swallow .
NHTSA knows of no injuries or deaths caused by HID glare .
And University of Michigan studies of HID glare found that , while it annoys oncoming drivers , it does n't disable them .
" Discomfort glare is not always related to disability glare .
Our result is about discomfort , " says Michael Flannagan , research scientist at the university 's Transportation Research Institute .
The university has spent at least 10 years trying to quantify the problem , and thinks it has done so .
The short version : Oncoming drivers are bothered by HID glare because of its harsher , blue light .
Light from conventional tungsten - halogen headlights is toward the softer , red end of the spectrum .
Halogens have to put out 1.5 times as much light as HID lights do to cause the same wincing , squinting and looking away .
" We think there is some problem with glare , but we think it 's a good trade - off , " Flannagan says .
" Our overall opinion of HIDs is that they are good things .
HID lamps can be , and normally are , better for seeing . "
A recent Society of Automotive Engineers technical paper agrees .
It notes that HID lights ' wider beam and greater output makes them dramatically better than tungsten - halogen lights " in detecting edge - of - roadway hazards , such as pedestrians and animals . "
But the same factors also " may produce more glare , " acknowledge the authors , John Van Derlofske , John Bullough and Claudia Hunter of the lighting research center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N.Y .
' They 're pretty cool '
Though HID lights are distracting , toning them down seems unlikely .
Automakers are pushing them as the hot item , starting with luxury cars .
" They 're pretty cool , " says Fred Heiler , spokesman for DaimlerChrysler 's Mercedes - Benz brand .
HID headlights are standard on the top- end Mercedes - Benz S- class sedans and CL coupes , and optional on all other Mercedes models .
" There 's been some discussion about them because they 're brighter , but we know it 's primarily the color of the light , and not the intensity , that takes some people by surprise .
...
We 're going to the trouble and expense in order to use something as close to daylight as possible , " Heiler says .
Automakers like HID lights because : 
They can be profitable , either as stand - alone options or as part of high - dollar packages .
Mercedes charges $ 850 for the HID option , and that 's cheap .
Catalog firms get up to $ 1,500 for kits that replace ordinary lights with bona fide HID lamps . 
Their efficiency  nearly three times the light from the same power  gives auto designers freedom .
They can sculpt and squeeze and shape headlights as they do sheet metal , confident that HID bulbs throw off enough light to meet federal standards .
Normal halogen bulbs confined and shaped the same way might not .
In other words , HID technology gives designers lots of light to waste in pursuit of styling goals .
Because HID lights are on high - end cars , they 've become a fashion statement .
Auto - parts firms sell blue - tint halogen lights that resemble the HID color , for those dying to have their $ 9,000 Kia Rios mistaken at night for $ 120,000 Mercedes - Benz S-classes .
" People will put blue filtering on filament bulbs and advertise it as giving ' HID - like performance . '
It does n't .
It gives you the coloring , " Flannagan says .
In fact , ersatz HIDs could be triggering many of the complaints because " They are causing a lot of glare .
They 're bad optically and scattering light all over , " he says .
Xenon acts as a fire starter High - intensity - discharge ( HID ) headlights would take a few minutes to get bright if xenon were not added to the gas sealed inside the headlights .
That 's how the lights have come to be known , incorrectly , as xenon headlights even though xenon is n't what produces the characteristic blue - white color .
Xenon , which ignites easier and faster than other HID gases , acts as a starter .
It accelerates HID lights ' start - up process , making the technology suitable for cars and trucks , where waiting a few minutes for lighting is impractical .
With xenon involved , HID lights are shining pretty well after 1 second , and are as ready as they 'll ever be in a few seconds .
Xenon is responsible for the bright flash as the headlights are turned on , and it 's xenon that glows brightly temporarily until the harder - to - ignite gases are fully awake .
Mirrors inside the light assembly capture , amplify and direct the light ; lenses aim and focus it .
But the real ones have won the hearts of driving enthusiasts .
" From a driver 's standpoint , they 're the greatest thing since sliced bread .
The drivers who have them are n't complaining about them .
They light up the road markings much better , " says David Van Sickle , director of auto and consumer information for the motorists ' organization AAA .
But Massey , the St. Louis SUV driver , insists there 's no need for the special lights : " Regular ones are fine .
No matter how much better you can see , it can't be so much better that it 's worth blinding people . "
Road signs play role
You can blame U.S. road - sign regulations for some of the HID glare .
U.S. signs are n't universally lighted and do n't all reflect light the same .
Thus , headlights have to throw some light upward and outward , to make sure you can read overhead and roadside signs , according to federal regulations .
In Europe , home of most of the world 's 2 million HID - lighted vehicles , glare seldom is mentioned .
European road signs routinely and consistently are lighted , so headlights need n't beam up and , in fact , are required not to .
That keeps the light out of other drivers ' eyes .
Folks who 've been around auto and regulatory circles awhile suspect that complaints are at least partly a reaction to the fact that HID lights are different .
NHTSA veterans say the agency got similar ban - the - bulb complaints in the 1980s , as automakers shifted to halogen lamps from their predecessors , sealed - beam lights with bulbs .
Halogens appeared brilliant white  blinding , people insisted  in contrast to the yellowish - light sealed beams .
Now , halogens are the ones that look yellowish in contrast to blazing , blue - white HID lights .
Another Society of Automotive Engineers paper tackles headlight glare and its side issues , warning that " agitation over the effect of glare caused by powerful headlamps has gradually increased until we are threatened with drastic legislation . "
That one 's by engineer Alden L. McMurtry  published in 1917 , addressing the transition to electric headlights from acetylene - arc lamps .

I have a confession .
I am an Open Source developer and my platform of choice is the .NET framework by Microsoft .
Not only that , I actually believe it is a good thing to support Open Source projects in the Microsoft ecosystem .
Yeah , really .
In response to this tidbit , I have heard and am bracing to hear replies such as …
Why would you do that ( support Open Source on Microsoft ) ?
Or
It ca n’t be Open Source if it ’s on the Microsoft platform .
One rationale given is that it ai n’t really Open Source unless the entire stack is Open Source .
I call this the all or nothing view of Open Source .
For example , one popular stack is the LAMP stack .
That typically stands for Linux , Apache , MySql , and PHP , each of which are Open Source systems .
Interestingly enough though , the stack appears to end with the software layer .
For example , proprietary hardware running the LAMP stack does not invalidate the Open Sourceness of the stack .
In contrast , I have the vacation view of Open Source .
While I would love to be on vacation all the time , I ’m pragmatic and I ’ll take as much as I can get .
Some vacation is better than no vacation .
Think About The Developers
Besides , why should PHP scripters have all the fun ?
There are legions of developers gainfully and productively employed writing software using .
NET .
Why should n’t they get to experience some of the benefits of using Open Source software ?
So what if their stack is proprietary .
Is it so wrong that these developers are more productive because of tools like Log4Net ?
Do n’t they deserve a bit of Open Source spice in their lives ?
But You Lose Out On Freedom !
There are as many flavors of Open Source as there are “ developers ! ” in a Ballmer speech .
But what they all share in common is some level of Freedom .
In general , the freedom to view and change the code .
The only difference is really in the level of freedom and how that freedom should apply .
I wrote before in my guide to Open Source Licensing that with some licenses such as the GPL , the freedom of access to the code is paramount .
Any code that makes use of the GPL must itself be Open Source and licensed in a compatible fashion as the GPL .
Whereas with licenses such as the new BSD or MIT license , the freedom of the user of the code is paramount .
There are pretty much no restrictions to using the code , even within proprietary systems .
Despite these philosophical differences , most reasonable people agree that they both constitute subsets of Open Source software .
I Have Freedom Where I Most Need It
The stack that I use with Subtext might be called WISC which consists of Windows , IIS , SQL Server , and C# .
It sounds like a board game that Elmer Fudd might play on the weekends .
Pretty much every layer of that stack is proprietary software .
This is where the vacation view comes into play .
On this stack , I ’ll never be able to view the Windows source and recompile it with a bug fix .
But in truth , I ’ll probably never have the need ( nor capability ) to do so .
Often , the part I do need to change on a day to day basis is much higher up the stack .
It ’s the stuff that more directly applies to my business needs .
It ’s software like Lucene .
NET that I ’m more likely going to tweak and build a business on top of it .
This is n’t to say I would n’t mind being able to view the source for Windows , but it ’s a balancing act .
On the one hand , I like Open Source software .
On the other hand , I like to feed my family by being productively employed and the Microsoft platform is great for being employed .
Sure there are plenty of PHP and Ruby jobs , but I honestly really like writing C# code and the tools available to do so .
Only A Moron Thinks It ’s An OxyMoron
In the end , I hold firmly to the belief that .NET is a viable platform for Open Source software .
It might not meet everyone ’s expectations for what Open Source is supposed to be , but it ’s a good thing to many people and it is here to stay .
If you do n’t believe me , just look at the list of projects mentioned in the comments to this CodingHorror post .
You ’ll see that Open Source in the Microsoft Ecosystem is more than just viable , it ’s thriving and deserves to be recognized .
Among atomic particles , the neutron seems the most aptly named :
Unlike the positively charged proton or the negatively charged electron , neutrons have a charge of zero .
But new experiments conducted in three particle accelerators suggest the neutron is more like an onion when it comes to electromagnetism : with a negatively charged exterior and interior and a positively charged middle sandwiched between them .
While the sum of these charges cancel each other out to produce a net charge of zero , the findings change our understanding of how neutrons interact with the other particles in the atom , said University of Washington physics professor Gerald Miller , writing last week in the online edition of the scientific journal Physical Review Letters .
" When a particle like an electron interacts with a neutron , where it hits will affect how it behaves and where it goes , " Miller told CBC News .
" These results change what we know of how neutrons interact electrically with anything . "
Enrico Fermi had previously suggested neutrons might have a negative exterior and a positive interior , Miller said .
But this is the first experimental evidence to suggest the extra layer of complexity .
The findings , obtained from colliding electrons with neutrons and then measuring the angles of outgoing electrons , could help scientists better understand how electromagnetism interacts with the strong nuclear force that keeps protons and neutrons bound together in the nucleus of an atom .
It could also have a profound change on our understanding of neutron stars , the super - dense pulsating stellar objects made up mostly of neutrons that form in the tail end of a star 's evolution , Miller said .
If the idea of a neutron having three differently - charged parts seems familiar , it may be because in quantum physics , neutrons are said to be made of three smaller particles called quarks : one " up " quark with a charge of +2/3 , and two " down " quarks with a charge of - 1/3 .
When joined together , the three quarks have a charge of zero .
Miller 's findings would seem to suggest an actual physical location for these quarks within a neutron , but the truth , he said , is much more complicated .
" We 're not talking about location as much as we are talking about density , " he said .
" What we are saying is the probability of finding a particular charge density is a function of distance .
Quarks are constantly moving within a neutron , so this tells us the odds of finding more of them in one area over another . "
The connection between quarks and charge location also breaks down when examining the proton , said Miller .
While a proton is made up of one down quark and two up quarks , the same accelerator tests found the proton was positively charged throughout , with the middle region possessing a stronger charge than the interior and exterior .

Web of Lies
by Beth Ann Bovino
[ For information about 3QD and what we are all about , click here , or here for our main page .
Also , after appearing on 3QD , this story was picked up by several news organzations , and even the FBI commented on it .
For example , see this from the front page of the NY Daily News . ]
A man called the other night and asked to speak with Beth Ann Bovino .
Not interested in a conversation about the midterm elections or whether I need a new phone service , I considered “ She ’s not home ” .
Instead , I asked " whom may I say is calling ? "
He said his name ( correctly , I had caller ID ) .
He then ran into a series of statements about me : that I live at 304 West XXth Street ( I do ) and that I have a one bedroom with a fireplace ( yes again ) .
He asked if I am renting my place ( I ’m not ) .
That ’s when he told me that someone had placed an ad on Craig ’s List in my name .
According to the ad , I live on the 5th floor of an elevator building ( an upgrade from my 5th floor walkup ) .
It comes at the low monthly rent of $ 1500 including utilities .
( Later I found out they also had it listed at times for $ 1190 and $ 1100 . )
It has a deli , a grocery store , and a laundry room .
I have a washer / dryer in my apartment , so maybe they could have charged more .
I had it delisted from Craig ’s list , but decided to apply .
I know from experience it ’s a pretty nice place , and even at $ 1500 it ’s a steal .
I applied to the ad ’s email [ email protected ]
Ann Bovino ( she said “ Beth Ann Bovino is my full name . ” ) got back to me .
She wrote “ I have available the apartment but now I 'm in Fremont - CA .
This is the reason that I want to rent it .
To start this deal you have to send me 1 month in advance and I will ship you the keys overnight .
You can move in the apt in the same day when you receive the keys . ”
She included pictures of " my " home : http://pictures.aol.com/galleries/annbovino.
[ All photos here are taken from this site . ]
Aside from the picture of my building , the rest are fiction .
The bathroom fixtures received a lot of attention .
The tub made it in over half the photos , while the modern faucet got a close up .
However , I already have furniture and since there would n’t be any moving costs , I asked for a discount if the place comes unfurnished .
I also asked if there was anyone else at the building who could show me the apartment ?
A super or someone else ?
Ann Bovino wrote : “ I understand your position but the keys are with me and the only option is to ship you the keys .
I have an idea for this deal .
First you have to send me money on your friend or relative name via Money Gram because I want to be sure that you are a serious person and you really want to rent my apt .
In the same day I will ship you the keys via UPS and after you will see the apt and you make a decision you have to resend the funds on my name for pick up the money . ”
She generously offered to support all MoneyGram fees .
She also cut the rental price to $ 1400 , unfurnished .
I responded that I was concerned about sending money without talking to someone over the phone .
The same “ I understand your position ” piece was sent in reply , but it added “ PS .
I would love to speak with you by phone but I can't because I 'm a deaf - mute person and I am teaching in CA for a deaf - mute school . ”
So there it is .
I ’m a deaf - mute person who moved to Fremont , California to teach deaf - mute children .
I understand other people ’s positions and will even bend on the price .
I may even be able to pro-rate the agreement ( though that was unclear ) .
While this was entertaining , my real self got concerned .
Ann Bovino reposted the apartment rental .
A number of people came by to check out this dream apartment .
I let them know just that .
It was a dream .
And a fraud .
I called 311 to find out how to stop this .
311 did n’t have the facts to help much .
Though they were supportive , they sent me to the N.Y.
State Attorney Local Office , who sent me to Consumer Affairs , who told me , for some unexplained reason , to contact my local post office .
However , an intensive internet search gave me some information to act , or at least know what I was up against .
I found out that this kind of fraud is a variation of the “ Four - One - Nine ” ( 419 ) or “ Advanced Fee Fraud , ” which has been around since the early 1980's and that we have all seen .
Emails sent with the SUBJECT : URGENT !!!
in the header undoubtedly lead into this kind of fraud .
It was dubbed " 419 Fraud ” after the relevant section of the Criminal Code of Nigeria .
Usually it operates as follows : the target receives an unsolicited fax , email , or letter , usually from Nigeria or another African nation ( though not always ) , and contains either a money laundering or other illegal proposal .
Or you may receive a Legal and Legitimate business proposal .
Variations of Advance Fee Fraud seem endless .
At some point , the victim is always asked to pay an Advance Fee upfront .
There are a number of web sites that look into this .
One particularly interesting and very funny site is http://www.scamorama.com.
Together with the book , scam - o - rama , it is designed specifically for scam busters ( or those that support their cause ) .
On their site they ask the question : “ Can a scammer pretending to be an orphan from a Sierra Leone mining town find happiness scamming people ?
Well yeah , if he gets away with it . ”
Their research , on an admittedly small data set , suggests disturbing trends : Travel and banking in West Africa are fatal to imaginary people .
Airplane crashes have the most fatalities overall , while the Sagbama Express is most dangerous road .
They write “ the ‘ bank customers ’- all foreigners ( European , Asian , Arab , American ) - have died , usually in ghastly ( air , motor ) accidents .
The banks may exist .
The victims ' names may belong to real people who probably want them back .
( I do . )
Some names belonged to real people whose tragic deaths were lifted from obituaries .
Some victims have died multiple times , not learning from previous experience .
Some died from combinations of natural disaster . ”
The book and the web site detail the ' 419 ' advance fee fraud scam and the damage it does ( hundreds of millions of dollars yearly ) .
They also document the people who try to get back at them .
On one side are the scammers , those who commit the fraud .
Then there are the ‘ scambaiters ’- those who write back to lead the scammers on with stories and waste their time .
There is one scambaiter who actually got money FROM the scammer ( about $ 3 ) .
It inspired my game .
It has now been over three weeks since I first heard that my name has been used .
Given the stats , my name has now likely been involved in a few more devastating accidents / illnesses / natural disasters .
I could suffer still more virtual tragic ends if I do nothing .
I contacted the local police department with no luck .
However , one web site finally offered a chance to redeem my name .
The Internet Crime Complaint Center ( IC3 ) http://www.ic3.gov/faq/ is co-sponsored by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) and the National White Collar Crime Center ( NW3C ) .
The IC3's mission is to serve as a vehicle to receive , develop , and refer criminal complaints regarding the rapidly expanding arena of cyber crime .
The IC3 aims to give the victims of cyber crime an easy - to - use reporting mechanism .
The web site receives thousands of complaints each month .
The complaints filed are all processed and may be referred to the appropriate law enforcement or regulatory agencies for possible investigation .
Ultimately , however , investigation and prosecution are at the discretion of the receiving agencies .
If you ’re a victim , keep any evidence you may have relating to your complaint , such as payment receipts , mail receipts , a printed copy of a website , or copies of emails .
Keep phone numbers or addresses of anyone connected , either the culprit or other targets .
You may be requested to provide them for investigative purposes .
While it seems farfetched , there have been arrests .
Most recently , the FBI and Spanish police have arrested 310 people in Malaga , Spain in connection with a € 100 m bogus ( email ) lottery scam run by Nigerian gangs .
The gang also offered rewards for those willing to stash money taken out of Iraq by the family of Saddam Hussein or money found after the 9/11 attacks .
It was the biggest 419 bust in history , and may result in drastic reductions of scam mails .
The scammer posted my apartment again .
I remain a Californian deaf - mute .
As of this date , my horrible airplane or automobile death has not been announced .

Peak oil should no longer be a matter for debate .
still many vested interests feel obliged to debunk it , governments are still loathe to talk about the looming energy supply crisis .
When will the truth be allowed to be seen , and what will the reaction be when it is ?
I do want this blog to be interactive .
Comments on any article welcome , as are new article requests .
The Open Mobile Terminal Alliance ( OMTP ) has published a recommendation paper suggesting that mobile phone manufacturers all use micro USB connectors to charge , and connect , their handsets .
The recommendation document - available as a PDF file here - suggests that mini USB , the connector already being used on many devices , might be OK in the short term , but that everyone should migrate to micro USB real soon now , and that both data transfer and charging should take place over the same cable .
The OMTP is a network operator talking - shop - producing documents for phone manufacturers that explain what operators would like to see in handsets .
Phone manufacturers can sign up as ' advisors ' , and both Nokia and Ericsson are ' sponsors ' , but the membership is limited to network operators .
Obviously everyone would love to see all mobiles using the same charging and data connections , but telling a manufacturer that they can't make a phone 2 mm thick becasue the ' industry standard ' plug wo n't connect is less easy .
Handset designers tend to have their own ideas about what matters , and as the majority of handsets are sold on their stylish appearance , what the designer says generally goes .
The fact that the standard stereo headphone socket is lacking on the vast majority of handsets , even music - based ones , is indicative of how cavalier manufacturers can be with standards when it comes to shaving a few millimetres off the case .
Proposing a standard will get the OMTP lots of good press , and everyone will say what a good idea it is , but next time a designer comes up with eye - candy that needs a proprietary connector the manufacturers will drop the " standard " like a stone . ®

Thousands of festival - goers were today facing the prospect of a second day of muddy mayhem at Glastonbury .
Revellers raved through the night despite torrential downpours which left the 1,000 - acre Worthy Farm site a quagmire .
Last night Arctic Monkeys , making their festival debut , headlined the Pyramid Stage with a blistering performance in front of more than 100,000 people .
Rain - soaked festival - goers were given a glimmer of hope by forecasters , who predicted conditions would dry up by this afternoon .

Fans were refusing to let bad conditions ruin their fun , as they partied in the mud .
Long queues formed outside stalls selling Wellington boots and anoraks , as 140,000 people tried their best to forget the rain .
Outdoor shop Millets are preparing an emergency tent drop after stores at the site sold out as revellers realised their own were unable to withstand the muddy deluge .
An articulated lorry filled carrying 4,500 tents and an extra 8,000 tent pegs will leave Millets ' Northampton depot at first light to make the 148 mile journey down to Shepton Mallet .

Millets spokeswomen at Glastonbury said : " The problems occur because so many people do not practice putting up a tent before they get to Glastonbury .
Loads of people borrow tentsor use an old tent which has meant essential elements such as the poles are missing . "
Some people even cheered as the heavens opened on the first day , while many bravely faced the conditions - bare chested .
Forecaster John Hutchinson at MeteoGroup UK said further showers are expected today but the sun could break through .
" We 're not talking about beautiful clear blue skies but there will be some sunny spells , " he said .

US indie kings The Killers , Paul Weller and Iggy and the Stooges will attract huge crowds this evening .
Organiser Michael Eavis said he would be watching American solo artist John Fogerty before rushing across to the Pyramid Stage to see The Killers .
Avon and Somerset police said crime remained similar to 2005 levels , with 71 people arrested by yesterday morning .
Thomas Buchan , a 24 - year - old barman from Bristol , said : " It is difficult to beat the first day , but a little less mud might just do it . "

Dave , 23 , a student from Bournemouth , entertains one group by running down a hill then hurling himself onto the mud in his pants .
There is , it seems , a sort of bizarre pleasure in the weather , as Peter Stone , 24 , a painfully thin man with massive hair tells me , " Unless it rains - we do n't really enjoy it . "
The Glastonbury crowd are an eclectic bunch .
There are hand - holding middle aged couples with neat hair , anoraks and hiking boots ; very stoned Nu Age types in top - to - toe tye dye and tattoos .
Then there are the posh students - arguing loudly and ostentatiously about how much weed they smoked last night before passing out .

And festival fashion ?
The standard uniform is a combination of wellies , cowboy hats , jeans / flirty skirts / leggings , cleavage ( if available ) and a can of lager .
But some have made some bigger decisions - not all suited to a British monsoon .

Everything from tutus to go - go girl outfits , three - piece suits , top hats and even five big fat Smurfs - naked but for a couple of litres of blue body paint and a pair of small white briefs , which look suspiciously padded out .
To be fair , the weather is n't anyone 's fault and there are thousands of helpful staff .
But while the entrance - where we 're given programmes , special black bracelets , maps and bin bags ( which all fall immediately in the mud ) - is beautifully organised , the tepee village ( an hour 's muddy hike from the car park ) is less so .
" Oh sorry , " says the tepee manager , " I think we must have given yours away by accident .
But there 's another tepee place on the other side of the park . "

At a press conference today , Intel 's Pat Gelsinger revealed fresh details of the company 's forthcoming 45nm processor family , codenamed Penryn .
Penryn is the 45nm successor to the Merom / Conroe / Woodcrest microarchitecture that underlies the popular 65nm Core 2 Duo processor line .
Gelsinger opened the briefing with a discussion of the success of the company 's " tick - tock " model of processor innovation , a model in which process shrinks and major architectural revisions are rolled out on a staggered two - year time scale .
" Today 's disclosures clearly lay out that this engine is delivering and delivering on track , " said Gelsinger , responding to what he characterized as initial skepticism that the model could work .
Gelsinger then moved on to discuss Penryn , which is the first product that will be produced on Intel 's new high -k dielectric 45 nm process .
Penryn is more than just a shrink — it 's a derivative of Core 2 Duo ( codenamed Merom ) with a number of improvements .
Gelsinger laid out those improvements in more detail than we 've seen so far , so I 'll outline them below .
Penryn 's improvements : SSE4 support , better virtualization
Penryn's back end boasts two major advances over its predecessor .
First is a new radix - 16 divider that offers a 2 x performance improvement on division operations vs. Core 2 Duo .
The fast divider also speeds up a range of operations that depend on the divider hardware , like the square root function .
Penryn's SQRT operation is 4 x the speed of Core 2 .
The other major back - end improvement is support for the SSE4 extensions , a group of 50 new vector instructions aimed at speeding up media and other data - parallel applications .
SSE4 will be paired with a new " Super Shuffle Engine , " a full - width , single - pass , 128 - bit shuffle unit .
This will enable Penryn 's vector hardware to perform 128 - bit shuffle operations ( e.g. pack , unpack , packed shift ) in a single clock cycle .
The beefed up shuffle capabilities will help Penryn align incoming vector data in the SSE registers so that the execution hardware can go to work on it .
Intel claims that SSE4 , in combination with other new features that I 'll describe shortly , will offer Penryn a performance improvement of as much as 40 percent over Core 2 Duo on some software like video codecs , and as much as 20 percent on games .
A big part of this performance boost will no doubt be due to the higher frontside bus speeds that Penryn will support .
Penryn - based Xeon systems will sport frontside bus speeds of up to 1600MHz .
Intel estimates that the increased FSB speed could yield up to a 45 percent speedup on bandwidth - and floating - point - intensive applications on the fastest Penryn - based quad - core systems .
To go with the faster FSB , Intel has also upped the cache on the Penryn processors .
Dual - core parts will have 6MB of shared L2 , while quad - core products will have 12MB .
These caches will also be paired with an enhanced version of Intel 's Smart Cache technology .
The new Smart Cache will let Penryn speculatively execute across cache lines , eliminating the typical stall associated with non-aligned loads .
Intel will take advantage of the 45nm process not only to increase the amount of cache , but also to raise clockspeeds without significantly boosting power dissipation .
Penryn parts will eventually reach the 3GHz mark , and may go even higher .
The TDP numbers for Penryn desktop quad - core parts will be 95 and 130 watts , with desktop dual - core parts coming in at a 65 W TDP .
The TDP numbers for the 45nm Xeon will be 50 W / 80 W /120W , depending on clockspeed .
For dual - core , the numbers are 40 W / 65W/80W .
For Penryn - based mobile parts , Intel will introduce a new low - power state that they 're calling Deep Power Down .
In the new state , the core clock is turned completely off , along with the L1 and L2 caches .
Process state is saved in a special part of the processor so that the system can be restored on wakeup .
The other big power - related news about Penryn is that it will be an enhanced version of Intel 's Dynamic Acceleration Technology .
The new version will let Penryn detect when one core is largely idle — and thus not drawing much power — so that it can boost the clockspeed of the other , more active core while remaining in the same power envelope .
For single - threaded applications where only one core is used , this will enable Penryn to speed up that one thread by devoting more power to the core on which it 's running .
Penryn boosts virtualization
One of the major features that Penryn brings to the table is a pretty important improvement to the performance of its Virtualization Technology ( VT ) .
Specifically , the performance of its virtual machine ( VM ) exit and VM entry instructions has been boosted so that VM transition times decrease by an average of 25 to 75 percent .
Right now , a lot of folks who 're testing out VT have been disappointed that its performance is n't much better than existing , non-VT - based virtualization solutions like VMware .
Specifically , VMware products use a binary translation engine that ingests regular x86 OS code and produces a " safe " subset ; VMware claims that this binary translation approach is as fast as , or faster , than VT - based approaches because the OS does n't have to do costly VM transitions in order to execute privileged instructions .
( These claims are debated ; I 'm merely reporting the fact that they are made . )
A major decrease in VM transition times will help the performance of VT - based solutions like Xen , and it would make the " which virtualization package to use ? " debate even more about management and less about relative performance than it already is .
All told , Intel will introduce six Penryn products this year , spanning the full range of segments from ultra-mobile to server .
A full fifteen Penryn products are currently in development .

I was in the passenger side of my friends car , on a quiet saturday driving home from crossgates mall .
I am usually driving , so i was taking this time as a passenger to take in the beauty that is I - 90 .
As i am innocently gazing out my window , i notice a large blue chevy i belive pick up truck 2 lanes over .
Normally i would of not looked twice but something caught my eye .
You sir were waving wildly at me , thinking i might know you , i took my sunglasses off to get a better look at you .
Some movement again caught my eye , you were no longer waving at me , but fiddaling with your pants .
This should of been a sign to turn away , but i was confused .
Thats when it happend .
You some how managed to keep one foot on the gas , along with your right hand on the steering wheel .
and in a matter of seconds were able to stand up with your whole front body facing me ( which im still baffled how you managed to do this ans drive ) you then started pelvic thrusting your ' cash and prizes ' in my direction , while laughing hysterically , like i just opend a can of peanuts , but a snake made out of springs popped out .
This action looked much like any movie where you see a male stripper pelvic thrusting , but unlike its done in the movies usually with the saftey of boxer shorts , or tight black pants like the Chippendales wear .
Not you sir , no no .
You had the pants , and the boxers pulled down , and your t shirt pulled up a little .
I even saw belly button .( see picture examples ) This act lasted around 5 , or 6 seconds , then you cowardly took the next exit to escape my face full of horror .
Im sure scareing me for life is hilarious .
and im not exactly sure what the thrill was of flashing me on I - 90 .
Im sure it wasnt to impress a friend , because you were alone .
And you were not an old guy , im sure you could of had a girlfriend , or a wife , so flashing a random 21 year old girl on the highway is a little baffaling to me .
But this letter flasher guy , is not to express my anger twords you .
Its to let you know , my friend that was driving is upset she missed this horrifying / hilarious act , and would like you to drive by us again , but this time on the driver side .
Thanks buddy .( i probably spelled 10000 things wrong in here , im at work , im typing fast , i dont give a shit ) ( ALSO my drawing of flasher guys ' cash and prizes ' are of fruit , because again , im at work , and i cant draw penises on paint in the fear of beign fired )

Giving babies antibiotics doubles the chances they will suffer from asthma by their seventh birthday , research has revealed .
A study of more than 13,000 children added to the growing evidence that exposure to germs in the first few months of life aids the development of a healthy immune system and protects against allergies .
Researchers also found that infants exposed to the hairs of a family dog before their first birthday were less likely to suffer from asthma later in life .
Many doctors believe that the modern obsession with cleanliness could be linked the dramatic rise in allergies over the last few decades .
The study , published in the journal Chest , looked at the medical histories of 13,116 children from birth to age seven .
Two - thirds were given an antibiotic before their first birthday .
Researchers found they were far more likely to have asthma than those not given the drugs -- and the more courses of antibiotics they were given , the greater the chances .
When the scientists excluded those given antibiotics for breathing problems - who might be expected to have a higher chance of developing asthma -- the connection appeared even stronger .
Asthma in seven - year - olds was nearly twice as likely in children given an antibiotic for a nonrespiratory tract infection than in children who had been given no antibiotics at all .
One woman donated her wedding dress to the exhibition
The Museum of Broken Relationships asks people in the cities it visits to donate mementos of everything from short flings to painful divorces .
Originating in Croatia , the show has visited Bosnia - Herzegovina and Slovenia and has amassed more than 300 exhibits .
Berliners have donated more than 30 objects , including a wedding dress and an axe used to break an ex's furniture .
Zvonimir Dobrovic is organising the Berlin show in the Tacheles arts centre , a former squat in the heart of the city .
" It 's such a nice , simple idea , because everyone can relate to it , " he told the BBC News website .
I left on a scorching summer 's day - I thought going on foot or taking a tram would be incredibly stupid - so I got on the bike
" It 's not pretentious , it 's interactive , a place where people can present their own stories and compare them to others . "
Members of the public are asked to give or donate an object , along with a short description of what it means to them , the time of the relationship , and where they are from .
" Even if the objects seem ordinary the stories are very individual and they make the exhibition come alive , " Mr Dobrovic said .
" People really enjoy being here , we get couples who spend a long time here , looking and laughing and hoping it never happens to them , and then people who 've just broken up who want to tell us their stories , " he added .
Cathartic effect
The idea was born when two Zagreb artists , Olinka Vistica and Drazen Grubisic , split up and wanted to do something creative with the pain they were feeling .
" The exhibition comes from a sincere , universal experience and helped us in our break - up process " , Ms Vistica told the BBC News website .
Some of the objects donated are ordinary , some more unusual
The artists decided to collect the objects left over from their relationship and put them on display and asked their friends to do the same .
Ms Vistica says the exhibition can have a therapeutic effect .
" The normal impulse is to destroy the mementos of a relationship in order to recover , but we thought of using creativity to overcome the pain of the experience and also remember the joy those objects once held for us , " she said .
The cathartic effect is evident in some of the descriptions accompanying the objects .
One woman donated an axe and described chopping up the furniture of her cheating female lover .
" The more her room filled up with chopped up furniture , the more I started to feel better .
Two weeks after she was kicked out she came to take the furniture .
It was neatly arranged into small heaps and fragments of wood . "
After Berlin the exhibition travels to Belgrade , Skopje and Stockholm and there are plans for possible shows in Tokyo , New York and Sao Paulo .
We asked if you would consider donating anything to such an exhibition .
Your comments :
Yes , I lost 4yrs in the process of getting out from it .
The first thing i did was I went to her place and gave back everything associated to her but i would have donated if i would have had got a chance .
It is something you want to express so much but no way out .

A black and white lacy corset from Valentines Day 2 years ago , the only vestige left from my last relationship , everything else I torched already .
natalie ... , arizona
Having gone through four or so relationships , there are most definitely " mementos " from each that I would consider donating .
Some items would be a testament to the positive discourse two humans have on a short walk through life together , while others would be a trophy awarded for having survived a miserable journey .
One such item of the later would be a scrap book commemorating a vacation given by a former girlfriend .
When the relationship ended miserably , I removed all photographs including said ex and threw them in the trash .

This may sound strange but breaking up with my previous ex was the best thing that ever happened to me .
She was an abusive person due to the fact she came from an abusive family .
S was physically and sexually abused since young and this affected her emotional stability .
When we broke up , I gave away almost everything of hers and whatever she gave me .
It was a spiritual cleansing .
If I still have those stuff , I would send them to the museum with a long report of my story .

I once donated an ex boyfriend 's pillow to an animal shelter to be used as a doggy bed .
I would agree that donating romantic momentos is a very cathartic experience . :)
Lyn , Tucson , AZ
The idea of having this museum is amazing .
Can I denote myself to the museum with the name branded as " dumped by the one she loves most " ?
Yau , Hong Kong
Actually , I would like to take a few things back from my ex .
The weepy songs I recorded just for him , the countless empty hours I spent trying to be entertained by his sarcastic discontent .
My liver !
( Some parts just do n't regenerate . )
My best pillow talk , my concentration , my faith in love ...
Anna , Philadelphia , USA
I read this article and seriously considered going to Germany just to see the exhibit .
There are so many things I would love to donate ...
I just wish I could donate the feelings too .
Now , if someone could figure out how to do that - how much better my life would be !
Sue C , London , UK
I can understand the idea behind it the exhibit and apppreciate it , but when I look into my own history I find that I have already abandoned just about everything related to the people in question and that the few things I have kept remind me of the good times , in a bittersweet kind of way .
I would n't give them up .
Alex , Sydney , Australia
I have already purged everything from my divorce and as I am now in an incrediably happy relationship with my partner ( now wife ) of the last 7 years , the old relationship is of little interest to me .
However , had this been around when my wife decided to leave me for a balding ner - do - well , I would have happily donated her and all her baggage to the exhibition !
Peter , Hong Kong
had it been two years back i.e. right after the break - up my 7 years relationship ( includes 5 years marriage ) , i would have donated all i had .
for the past two years i have been getting rid of things that associates him or his memory and still could not get rid of all ..

What could I donate ?
1 . the picture CD he burned for me of one of our trip that I never even opened .
I just threw it away .
He had given it to me after it was over .
I put it in the trash can , then thought about recovering it because maybe there were photos that I wanted , not of us but of the places we visited .
Then I thought oh why bother .
I remember precisely that I wanted to own the images of our trip and did not want his images of them .
That trip abroad was fraud to me as he went under the pretense we were still together .
In his mind , he was already gone .
I guess I can't donate this item though since it 's probably somewhere in the city 's landfill but ...
2 . The rock music on my computer which started because he was introducing me to American music .
He 's a rock music lover and going to concerts was one of the big things for him ( and thus I went along ) .
I had previously only listened to world music and classical .
I still rarely listen to the rock stuff .
How does one donate MP3 Rock music ?
I think the music was the most pervasive introduction to American popular culture I 've ever had .
I enjoyed it .
3 . Then there was the Panda Bear that sat on top of my bookshelf for a long time after the breakup .
I remember the first time he gave it to me , it was sitting on his bed .
He wanted to apologise for something he did and that was the way he did it .
After the breakup , I had no idea what to do with the bear so it sat on top of my office bookshelf for over 7 years .
Then , I met a new friend who was having tremendous pain in school and so I thought she could enjoy the comfort of a fluffy bear .
She has it now .
Cornelia , USA
My ex left a gas powered leaf blower in the garage when he moved out , plus a gallon of gasoline .
I suppose I can't transport the gasoline to the exhibit , and it would be fabulous to offload that unused unwanted machinery .
Janine ...
Ohio , United States
The exhibit sounds somewhat interesting , but I disagree with the sentiment that this is universal , or something everyone can relate to .
I have never been through a breakup of any sort , really , certainly nothing like what is portrayed here .
I was married at the age of 22 and am still married to the same wife , having just turned 40 .
The exhibit might amuse me if I saw it , but it would n't really resonate with me .
John , Surabaya , Indonesia
This is therapeutic !
I have lots to get rid up .
It just sits in a box in the basement anyway .
emiy , Cleveland , U.S .
This is the 32nd anniversary of my divorce , a divorce made in heaven if ever there was one .
For years I was a good sport , staying in touch , getting along .
It would have been much saner to just fill a warehouse with the debris from the marriage and then set it on fire .
I wish I 'd known about this exhibition back then ...
