But it is not Friday night .
It is 3:30 Saturday afternoon .
Champagne corks are always popping somewhere , of course , and the high life never disappears entirely , especially in New York .
But these days , a $ 750 magnum of Perrier - Jouët stands in striking contrast to the scene outside Bagatelle ’s glass - paneled door , where the Dow has lost half its value since the fall of 2007 , the recession has claimed a net total of 4.4 million jobs since it began , more than 850,000 families lost their homes to foreclosure last year , and the word “ depression ” is being heard in the land .

For decades the New York brunch has been far more than just a meal .
It is an institution , an event that can start in midmorning and continue until late afternoon , a ritual in which eggs Benedict are routinely washed down by a seemingly endless stream of mimosas and Bloody Marys .
And in recent months , two restaurants in the meatpacking district have begun taking Saturday brunch to a remarkable level of indulgence and expense , even by New York standards .
The latest incarnation of Saturday brunch began last April at Bagatelle , a French bistro with decorative moldings , crystal chandeliers and striking white décor ; it seats 95 people .
Six months later , the high - end brunch arrived at Merkato 55 , a space on Gansevoort Street that can accommodate about 300 people and typically attracts a younger and slightly less affluent crowd , though the term affluent in this context may be relative .

Seymour Hersh : Obama helped end Israel 's Gaza offensive Muriel Kane

The prospects for a long - delayed peace agreement between Israel and Syria are now better than ever , according to investigative journalist Seymour Hersh .
Writing in the current issue of the New Yorker , Hersh asserts that , despite Syria 's anger over Israel 's recent Gaza incursion , " renewed Israeli - Syrian negotiations over the Golan Heights are now highly likely . "
" Those talks would depend largely on Americas willingness to act as the mediator , " Hersh emphasizes , " a role that could offer Barack Obama his first -- and perhaps best -- chance for engagement in the Middle East peace process . "
Obama has shown numerous signs of being eager to change the equation in the Middle East .
Even before his inauguration , Hersh notes , " the Obama transition team also helped persuade Israel to end the bombing of Gaza and to withdraw its ground troops . "
When former Vice President Dick Cheney learned that Obama had been putting pressure on the Israelis , he angrily disparaged him as " pro-Palestinian " and described him as someone who would " never make it in the major leagues . "
" The differences between Obamas Syria policies and those of the Administration of George W. Bush have attracted relatively little attention , " Hersh writes , recalling Bush 's long list of preconditions for any improvement in US - Syrian relations and mockery of Syrian President Bashar Assad for believing that he holds the key to peace in the region .
According to Hersh 's sources , Syria is eager for peace with Israel and is backed in this by " Arab leaders who are invested in the Israeli - Palestinian peace process . "
In addition , the failure of Israel 's campaign in Gaza to dislodge the Hamas government has given Assad room to negotiate without seeming to be appeasing Israel .
Assad himself emailed Hersh last winter to say , " We still believe that we need to conclude a serious dialogue to lead us to peace " and to note that he believes a personal meeting with President Obama would be essential .
Obama , for his part , has expressed a willingness to meet with Assad without preconditions .
Many Americans and Israelis now see a potential Syrian - Israeli peace agreement as an effective way of breaking up the " Iranian - Syrian axis " and either isolating Iran or forcing it to join in regional talks .
Assad , on the other hand , appears to be aiming to convince America to engage on a more friendly basis with the Shiite states in the region , rather than aligning exclusively with the Sunni regimes in Egypt , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia .
There is widespread resistance within Israel to returning the Golan Heights to Syria , which would be a central issue in any negotiations .
However , says Hersh , even hardline Israelis may find the prospect of negotiating with Syria -- if only in secret -- far more appealing than dealing with the Palestinians .

Gov. David A. Paterson plans to introduce legislation on Thursday to make marriage between same - sex couples legal in New York , advancing his push for greater rights for gay men and lesbians , at a time when other states have done so .
Mr. Paterson ’s plans represent the most public effort yet by the governor , who has been a consistent supporter of gay rights , to position himself and New York at the crest of a broadening national movement .
The move allows him to lead on an issue that could prove defining in his governorship , which has so far been marked by political missteps and the crumbling economy .
But it is also something of a political gamble , because the legislation faces an uphill climb in the State Senate .
Democrats acknowledge that they do not have enough votes there to get the measure approved , meaning that its chances could rest in the hands of a few Republicans .
The state of California accused Wells Fargo & Co. of fraud Thursday for the company ’s role in an investment meltdown that has been compared to the Bernard Madoff scandal in magnitude .
Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown sued three Wells Fargo investment subsidiaries , alleging they committed securities fraud by telling California investors that $ 1.5 billion of risky securities sold to them were as safe as cash .
The securities “ were sold to customers on the basis that they were like cash and people could get their money back in eight days , ” Brown said in an interview .
“ Now , it turns out they were not like cash and people ca n’t get their money back even after many , many months , and they ’re mad as hell . ”
The lawsuit , filed in state court in San Francisco , seeks to recover the money invested by about 2,400 Californians in what are known as auction - rate securities marketed by the Wells Fargo subsidiaries .

Auction - rate securities , generally backed by student loans , municipal bonds or other debt , have interest rates that are reset periodically through auctions -- sometimes as often as once a week .
More than $ 330 billion of the securities were sold in recent years to investors attracted to their yields , which could be a percentage point or more above a typical money market fund .
Regulators have alleged that many banks and investment firms deceived their clients into believing that auction - rate securities were as safe as a money market account .
But when the market for auction - rate securities collapsed in February 2008 , many investors could n’t sell the securities , or could sell them only at a loss .
“ Auction - rate preferred securities is the largest fraud ever perpetuated by Wall Street on investors , ” said Harry Newton , a private investor who operates the AuctionRatePreferreds.org website .
“ It dwarfs all frauds in history , including Madoff . ”
Several financial - service companies that issued auction - rate debt have agreed to repurchase billions of dollars of the devalued securities to settle claims by regulators that they defrauded investors .

Last month , Wachovia Corp. , which Wells Fargo acquired last year , agreed to repurchase $ 1.5 billion of the securities from California investors in a settlement with the state Department of Corporations that also included a division of Citigroup Inc .
Brown said that case did n’t involve the securities at issue in the lawsuit he filed Thursday .
Brown ’s lawsuit names Wells Fargo Investments , Wells Fargo Brokerage Services and Wells Fargo Institutional Services as defendants .
It alleges that they began selling auction - rate securities in 2001 and continued to sell them right up to the collapse of the market last year , despite signs that the market was beginning to crack in the second half of 2007 .
The state alleges that Wells Fargo sales personnel were n’t properly trained in the intricacies of auction - rate securities , and that the risks of the investments were n’t explained to clients .
Investors included retirees and small businesses , and accounts ranged from $ 25,000 into the millions of dollars , the suit says .
In one case cited by Brown , a Bay Area company shifted $ 400,000 in working capital from a money market account to auction - rate securities .
The business intended to use the money to expand , according to the attorney general ’s office , but when the auction - rate market failed , the company could n’t access the money and instead was forced to lay off workers .
Advertisement
San Francisco - based Wells Fargo disputed the state ’s allegations , saying it had taken steps to help customers hit by the collapse of the auction - rate market , including offering loans to tide them over .
“ We fully understand and deeply regret the effects this prolonged liquidity crisis has had on our clients , ” Charles W. Daggs , chief executive of Wells Fargo Investments , said in a statement .
“ Wells Fargo could not have predicted these extraordinary circumstances , and even with the benefit of hindsight is not responsible for them . ”
Wells Fargo also is facing similar action from the state of Washington .
Advertisement
Andrew Stoltmann , a Chicago attorney representing several auction - rate securities investors with claims against brokerage firms , said it was “ unfortunate that it ’s taken as long as it has for the California attorney general to act on this issue , but better late than never . ”
A spokesman for Brown said , “ We try to be careful in doing our work and bringing the strongest possible case . ”

New Nintendo DSi console launches with music player , camera and online gaming ability
Nintendo's latest handheld console has hit the British high street today , 48 hours before it hits American shores .
It is priced at £ 149.99 , although Tesco and Amazon are selling them for £ 144.97 .
The latest version of the DS confirms the console has moved beyond a simple games player with two cameras , internet browsing and a music player .
Retailers are warning of a shortage of the new console despite the fact it will cost 30 per cent more than in the U.S.
All the major console retailers have found it necessary to create waiting lists for customers wanting a DSi .
The Nintendo DSi is available in white and black and is priced at £ 149.99
Available in black or white , it is the lightest member of the Nintendo DS family .
It has a 3.25 " screen and is 12 per cent thinner than the Nintendo DS Lite .
The latest version can connect to the internet via a WiFi link allowing users to download games and software from the new Nintendo DSi store and play their friends whereever they are in the world .
The console has two built - in cameras , which detect facial features and body movements .
This means users can play Wii-style games , such as WarioWare using movement alone rather than relying on the traditional buttons and stylus .
Although the cameras are crude by new mobile phone standards , they come with 11 special camera effects .
The device can be used to capture , customise and share photos with friends and family .
A distortion tool is available to create ' quirky and fun ' images and also draw Mario Bros characters that look like loved - ones .
Journalists try out the new Nintendo DSi today in Sydney .
It is on sale for £ 149.99
Volume and sound quality have also been improved and users can use the DSi as a music player using an SD card to store favourite tunes .
Although it lets you play AAC files ( with .m4a , .mp4 , and .3 gp file extensions ) it does n't support the MP3 format .
Still it does have a DJ tool where you can store up to 18 different 10 - second sound bites .
From there , you can add sound effects , and change the speed and octaves .
Nintendo had sold 96 million DS consoles worldwide by the end of 2008 .
President Obama ’s massive mortgage - bailout plan is nothing more than a thinly disguised entitlement program that redistributes income from the responsible 92 percent of home - owning mortgage holders who pay their bills on time to the irresponsible defaulters who bought more than they could ever afford .
This is Obama ’s spread - the - wealth program in action .
Team Obama is rewarding bad behavior .
It is enlarging moral hazard .
It is expanding its welfarist approach to economic policy .
And with a huge expansion of government - owned zombie lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , Team Obama is taking a giant step toward nationalizing the mortgage market .
Reporting from the Chicago commodity pits , my CNBC colleague Rick Santelli unleashed a torrent of criticism over this scheme .
Santelli said : “ Government is promoting bad behavior . . .
Do we really want to subsidize the losers ’ mortgages ?
This is America !
How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor ’s mortgage ?
President Obama , are you listening ?
How about we all stop paying our mortgages !
It ’s a moral hazard . ”
All this took place on the air to the cheers of traders .
Santelli called for a new tea party in support of capitalism .
He ’s right .
Obama ’s so - called mortgage - rescue plan amounts to $ 275 billion in new debt that will have little if any lasting impact on deeply corrected housing prices or the mortgage - default problem that stemmed from the insistence of government to throw home loans at lower - income people .
A modest reduction in mortgage rates will have little impact on home prices , as Harvard professor Ed Glaser has shown .
And by the way , re-default rates on modified mortgages have been running 50 to 60 percent .
This is not going to change .
So why should we throw more good money after bad ?
Meanwhile , Wall Street is awakening to the disappointment that the securitized mortgages behind the toxic assets that have done so much damage to banks and the credit system are not being treated in the Obama program .
The oversight is incredible .
There are no safe - harbor provisions to protect mortgage servicers against lawsuits if agreements are broken .
The ownership of these securitized mortgage pools is wide and far , spanning the globe .
Breaking contracts is exceedingly difficult , especially without any legislated legal protection .
Of course , banks that have whole loans can choose to modify them if they want .
And in some cases it ’s much better to modify than foreclose .
But 70 percent of this bank - owned paper is performing .
It ’s the securitizations that have clogged up the world credit system .
Then there ’s the bankruptcy - judge cram - down , which would allow the courts to renegotiate interest rates and loan principal .
This would abrogate private contracts and throw out the rule of law .
Do we think future investors will put up mortgage capital if they fear judges will overturn the terms of contracts ?
Home - loan supplies will fall and mortgage rates will rise .
Then there ’s Fannie and Freddie , the big winners here .
Only their products are eligible for mortgage relief .
Jumbo mortgages are not .
Neither are private - label mortgages created by various non -bank lenders .
Fan and Fred already run 48 percent of the mortgage market .
Obama ’s proposal would greatly enlarge that and move the mortgage system toward government nationalization .
What ’s even more incredible is Team Obama ’s stubborn refusal to have any faith in the free market .
In some of the hardest hit areas of the country , markets are already solving the housing problem .
Writing on his Carpe Diem blog , University of Michigan professor Mark Perry notes that while California home prices dropped 41 percent in 2008 , home sales in the state jumped 85 percent .
It now looks like 2008 sales for single - family houses will exceed levels reached in 2007 .
What ’s more , the unsold - inventory index for existing single - family detached homes in December 2008 was 5.6 months compared with 13.4 months for the year - ago period .
And the median number of days it took to sell a single - family home dropped to 46.1 in December 2008 compared with 66.7 in December 2007 .
So inventories are dropping , the number of days to sell a home are falling , and sales are rising in the wake of lower prices .
If the government really wants to help , instead of bailing out irresponsible mortgage holders , it should support new and younger families who want to buy starter homes and begin to climb the ladder of prosperity .
All this is free - market economics 101 .
And I say , let free - markets work .
Let ’s remember that most folks -- even those with underwater mortgages , where the loan value is more than the home value -- do not walk away from their obligations .
They do n’t want to wreck their credit -- and their homes are their castles .
That ’s the American way .
But if we penalize the good guys and subsidize the bad ones , we are undermining the moral and economic fabric of this country .
Human history is the greatest story ever told .
It 's also , courtesy of the attached social , political and religious significance , the most dangerous .
So what happens when games try and tell it ?
Advertisement
All kinds of things .
See , games do history a little differently .
Other mediums , such as film , books and even comics , are re-telling a story .
They add drama and embellish the facts to varying degree ( see : Braveheart ) , yes , but in essence , they 're historical , as they 're re-counting actual events .
Advertisement
Games , though , are interactive .
You 're not being told a story .
You 're the one telling it , acting it out .
Every man you kill , every city you conquer and every nation you destroy is n't a case of retreading history .
It 's rewriting it .

Which , in many ways , is exciting !
It 's a blast seeing Babylon become an atomic power in Civilization , or to see Sweden become a global superpower in a game of Total War .
But in many ways , it 's also a challenge for developers .
How do they balance the need for some degree of historical accuracy with the need to create an entertaining video game ?
Some do n't .
There are developers – and these can often be found creating games in which action is the primary focus – who use historical events as a bullet point on the back of the box .
The glut of Second World War games over the past decade are probably the best example , using the 20th century 's most brutal conflict as nothing more than window dressing for a fast - twitch action experience .
Advertisement
Which is disappointing .
Like any other medium telling a historical tale , there is always a danger that the audience , presented with a product that is claiming to be " historical " , takes the action at face value , which can colour and distort their impressions of a particular period or sequence of events .
" There is potentially great hazard in attempting to reduce the nature of conflict to a simple matter of button - bashing " says Dr Cliff Williamson .
Cliff is the senior lecturer in Modern British and American history at Bath Spa University , nestled in ( and named after the key attraction of ) the ancient Roman city .
Advertisement
Cliff is also , handily , a keen gamer .
" The most serious issue for me is the separation of the protagonists from the nature of the regime they represent " , he says .
In reducing history 's protagonists to characters and factions , Nazis are reduced to targets , crusaders to a selectable faction .
You do n't , for example , perform missions in Company of Heroes rounding up a town 's Jewish population .
You just do the " fun " stuff .
Advertisement
But while some games do a poor job , there are many others that do not .
And the ones that get it " right " , in Dr. Williamson 's opinion , may surprise you .
Because while open - ended games like Civilization – which let you completely rewrite the history books – may seem the least historically responsible , in many ways , they can be not only incredibly historical , but educational as well .
Advertisement
How ?
It 's all in their structure .
Their building blocks .
Civilization , for example , may sound ridiculous by allowing you to convert Britain to Islam and build a fleet of Zulu fighter bombers , but scratch the surface and the game design that got you to that stage in the first place has been teaching you some very important lessons about history .
" I think that the games like Civilisation and Total War series are less of a problem to historians " , Dr. Williamson believes , " as they do offer an insight into the forces that shape history via technology trees and an appreciation of the subtleties of diplomacy " .
Advertisement
So while you may not be learning the true history of Britain 's religions over the millennia , you 're learning something potentially even more valuable : an understanding of the dynamics of history ; of the forces that have shaped , and will continue to shape , human society .
While Dr. Williamson mentions Civilization and Total War , other similar games that instruct you in the " dynamics of change " are Pirates ! , Colonization ( yes , there 's a Sid Meier theme here ) , Paradox Interactive 's strategy titles ( Hearts of Iron , Europa Universalis & Victoria ) the Age of Empires series and Railroad Tycoon .
Advertisement
That 's a historian 's take on matters , then , but how do the developers of probably the year 's biggest " historical " game feel about portraying history in their games ?
And how do they reconcile the need for accuracy with the need to make a game fun ?
Advertisement
" Whilst we pride ourselves on historical accuracy in our games , we only take it as far as it's entertaining . "
Says Kieran Brigden , from Total War developers The Creative Assembly .
" We could , for instance , represent the coffee or spice trade more fully in Empire , but we chose to keep it included but not as a full market system . "
Why ?
" Because although it would have been more accurate , it would n't have been as fun for the majority of players . "
Advertisement
This challenge of balancing history with fun when developing a historical game is hard enough .
But then , developers making history games are often faced with an even tougher challenge : balancing their own take on history .
Advertisement
The field is n't science .
Outside of simple facts – there 's no disputing the Battle of Hastings took place in 1066 , for example – much of history is subjective .
How it 's told depends on who is telling it .
" History is always contentious , one man 's hero is another 's villain " , Brigden says .
" Everything down to national flags can be disputed . "
So include one nation in a game and you could insult another .
Make one nation stronger than a rival and you 'll upset customers .
Advertisement
The Creative Assembly face this challenge the same way they do the accuracy vs fun debate : fun has to come first .
" We try and treat these issues with respect , but always with an eye to entertainment as our ultimate goal " , says Brigden .
Which explains why , for example , Empire : Total
War only depicts a handful of the 18th century states that made up what we now know as Germany , while Dr. Williamson says that , if it were accurate , there should have been around 300 .
Including all of them may have been more accurate , sure , but Empire : Total War just could n't handle that many " postage stamp principalities " clogging up the map .
Advertisement
So The Creative Assembly struck a balance .
And that balance goes back to what Dr. Williamson says about the " dynamics of change " .
Yes , the final game shipped about 296 Germanic states short of 300 , but in playing the game you still get a sense that Germany as we now know it was , in the time period , fragmented and surrounded by hostile states .
Advertisement
So as far as this " balance " goes , in the end , we 're split .
For every shoddy shooter set in the Second World War or Vietnam , which outside of uniforms and gun effects has done little to really deal with the people or events underpinning the game , there has been a game like Civilization , Colonization , Total War or Railroad Tycoon ( a personal favourite of Dr. Williamson's ) able to show us how history actually works .
But as we move forward , and games grow not only more realistic - looking but are pitched at larger and more " accessible audiences " , the challenges facing developers in treating history with respect will only grow sterner .
Something that , in a surprise for an industry that in many other ways is often labelled as juvenile , Dr. Williamson reckons it might just be able to handle .
Advertisement
" There is the potential for games to mess it up as badly as the film industry has at times , because for every Das Boot made there is a U - 571 just around the corner " , he says .
" The tension is always there " .
" But I feel that the gaming industry - with young , involved and devoted developers - is still very respectful to the need to be faithful to the past . "
Space Shuttle Discovery delivered the final set of solar arrays to complete the station ’s electricity - generating system .
Prior to and following their Extra - Vehicular Activity ( EVA ) to install them , veteran Steve Swanson and first - timer Richard Arnold had their gloves swabbed and tested for microbes .
For these early trials , the LOCAD tools are only useful inside crafts , and on the ground prior to launch , or after landing , to conduct comparisons .
Tests planned over the next few years however , will include swabs designed to be used outside the spacecraft as well .
Future explorers will need to monitor any possible biological stowaways , because contamination between celestial bodies like Earth and Mars can not be taken lightly .
Such duties in airlocks of all kinds of spacecrafts will be functionally – and legally – mandatory .
Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty ( as signed by 62 nations in 1967 ) requires that " Parties to the Treaty shall pursue studies of outer space … and conduct exploration of them so as to avoid their harmful contamination and also adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from the introduction of extraterrestrial matter ... "
In other words , every care must be taken to prevent cross-contamination of microorganisms .
NASA initially quarantined Apollo astronauts upon their return to Earth , due to worries about deadly germs , but by Apollo 15 it was clear the moon was entirely lifeless .
Even then , they took great care in sealing and storing incoming rock samples .
All active space programs in the US , Asia , Europe and Russia routinely sterilize crafts prior to launch .
It is not known whether the recently discovered methane on planet Mars indicates microbial life , but the US and Russia are already planning meticulous protection practices for future visits , and ensuing samples .
Humans are constantly shedding organic molecules , which can conceivably travel on their suits , tools , airlock outflow ; vents in the spacecraft , and even on the craft surface itself .
When we project a scenario where travelers acquire geological samples from Mars , space travelers must ensure they do not taint their destination with bacterial life during their sampling activities .
They must also ensure they do n’t accidentally bring anything potentially hazardous back to Earth .

Cash payments of up to $ 900 will begin flowing to 8.7 million taxpayers on Monday following the High Court 's dismissal of a challenge to their legality by an Armidale law lecturer .
Bryan Pape , also a barrister and states - rights champion , took on the might of the Commonwealth and lost .
The court has ruled that the Tax Bonus for Working Australians Act passed by Federal Parliament in February is valid under the constitution .
The decision means that $ 7.7 billion will be transferred to consumers with the aim , in the words of the treasurer Wayne Swan to " immediately support jobs and strengthen the Australian economy during a severe global recession " .
The tax bonus was announced on February 3 as part of a $ 42 billion fiscal stimulus package .
Rick Sanchez was a bit offended by El Rushbo's remarks on Gordon Brown hanging with President Obama :
Limbaugh :
The slobbering , the slobbering , this guy folks --- I 'm telling you .
If he keeps this up throughout the G - 20 , Gordon Brown will come down with anal poisoning and may die from it .
Sanchez : Anal poisoning .
Think about what he is saying there , maybe no , better yet , do n't .
We all got the crude sex joke , Rushie .
He is a disgusting homophobe .
Why else would he make such frequent references to people having to " bend over and grab their ankles " ?
And the wonder - boy , Eric Cantor shows us once again how the GOP licks his boots on a daily basis .
Britney Cantor said that the Limbaugh National Committee has really good ideas .
OMG .
Via Greg Sargent :
Okay , I ’ve just obtained audio of GOP House leader Eric Cantor lamenting the “ overreacting ” to the crisis , which is the story of the morning .
Here ’s a transcript : “ As far as Rush , Rush has got ideas .
He ’s got following .
He believes in the conservative principles that many of us believe in –- of lower taxes , of making sure that we turn back towards a focus on entrepreneurialism in this country , to promoting innovation and not stamping that out by over - reacting , if you will , which this town often does , to crisis . ”
I guess Cantor also believes that Gordon Brown is about to get an STD from hanging with the President at the G - 20 as they try to fix the global economy .
You know they'd be singing a different song if McCain had gone there .
Or RushBo's hero , George W. Bush .
It 's killing them that President Obama is being received so well .
My best friend just Skyped me from France and he said Obama is everywhere and Europe loves him .
Of course , for these cretins , that just becomes an excuse to sneer at him .
No Joke : The Onion Wins One of Journalism ’s Biggest Awards
It ’s not layoff news , and it ’s not an April Fools prank :
The Onion has won a Peabody , one of journalism ’s most highfalutin awards .
The Peabodys , administered out of the University of Georgia , date back to 1941 , and honor “ the most outstanding achievements in electronic media , including radio , television and cable . ”
They tend to go to earnest television documentaries and the like , but they also allow for some very smart , quirky stuff .
Hence the award for the weekly ’s “ Onion News Network ” video site , which debuted two years ago but has really been hitting its stride lately ( disclosure : I ’m pals with some Onion people ) .
Per the judges : “ The satirical tabloid ’s online send - up of 24 - hour cable - TV news was hilarious , trenchant and not infrequently hard to distinguish from the real thing . ”
Other winners include the New York Times ’s ( NYT ) excellent Web site , CBS ’s ( CBS ) “ 60 Minutes ” and …
“ Lost , ” from Disney ’s ( DIS ) ABC .
But none of those are as fun to embed as Onion clips .
Here ’s the Onion ’s most recent effort :
Morning Show Host Starts Charity to Rid World of Flying Debris
And here ’s a beauty that , like some other Onion stories , got digested as bonafide news in some places :
Prague ’s Franz Kafka International Named World ’s Most Alienating Airport
And while this one is n’t technically an Onion clip , I ’ve always enjoyed its many meta qualities :
Teotihuacan , Mexico
Teotihuacan is an enormous archaeological site in the Basin of Mexico , containing some of the largest pyramidal structures built in the pre-Columbian Americas .
Apart from the pyramidal structures , the archaeological site of Teotihuacan is also known for its large residential complexes , the so - called “ street of the dead ” , and its colorful well - preserved murals .
Teotihuacan was , at its apogee in the first half of the 1st millennium CE , the largest city in the pre-Columbian Americas .
During its zenith it may have had more than 100,000 inhabitants placing it among the largest cities of the world in this period .
The civilization and cultural complex associated with the site is also referred to as Teotihuacan or Teotihuacano .
Although it is a subject of debate whether Teotihuacan was the center of an empire , its influence throughout Mesoamerica is well documented ; evidence of Teotihuacano presence , if not outright political and economic control , can be seen at numerous sites in Veracruz and the Maya region .
The ethnicity of the inhabitants of Teotihuacan is also a subject of debate and possible candidates are the Nahua , Otomi or Totonac ethnic groups .
Often it has been suggested that Teotihuacan was in fact a multiethnic state .
The city and the archaeological site was located in what is now the San Juan Teotihuacán municipality in the State of México , Mexico , approximately 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) northeast of Mexico City .
The site covers a total surface area of 83 km² and was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 , and is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico .

Let me tell you how you can live forever .
Or , at least , for a very long time .
Possibly a very , very long time , subjectively .
If it is possible for the activities of a human brain to be emulated by some other computing device , then it is possible for a human mind to be copied to a computer - " uploaded " , in current sci - fi parlance .
The computer can then run the human - mind program indefinitely .
If it runs the human - program much faster than a normal brain can , then from the point of view of the emulated brain , thousands of years could go by per real - world minute .
Which could be very good , if you 've got lots of interesting things to do in there .
Or very bad , if your immortal computerised consciousness is just clawing at the inside of a featureless white digital coffin for a trillion trillion subjective years .
There 's no evidence to suggest that a computer actually can simulate any brain more complex than an insect's , but there 's also no reason to believe , as far as I can see , that the human brain is anything other than a fiendishly complex analogue computer .
It 's already easy for digital hardware to simulate simple analogue computers and other such hardware , and you can run a neural - network simulation with more complexity than a worm brain on a Commodore 64 .
So let 's assume , for the sake of argument , that it will , one day , be possible for computers to emulate a human brain [ 1 ] , with any luck before everyone alive today has died of old age .
And , importantly , let 's also assume that we 'll come up with some way to scan a brain and upload it .
Hey presto : Something close to immortality for that brain , right ?
Well , yes .
But also no .
For all you know , a cloaked alien saucer just flew over you , scanned your brain and immediately set it running in a wonderfully stimulating simulated environment in the saucer 's on - board computer .
That may be very fascinating for the copy in the computer , but it does n't help the version of you that 's still sitting here reading this Web site .
That version will still die when it dies .
I do n't much care how many copies of me exist , or will exist in the future .
I 'm concerned about the version of me that 's sitting here typing these words .
Mathematician and physicist Frank J. Tipler has this problem all stitched up .
In the distant future , he says , " Omega Point " ultra-computers will simulate all possible minds and environments , including all of the ancestors of whatever entities built the computers .
This also means that , statistically , it 's virtually certain that we all actually already are simulated minds in an " ancestor simulation " , since there 'll be so many more simulated minds at the Omega Point than there have been in the entire previous history of the universe .
( If space - time does have a fundamental granularity , then that 's pretty much what you 'd expect to see in a simulated universe , based on something like Conway 's Life except , y'know , probably more complicated . )
And , oh , the Omega Point is quite literally God , and He loves us .
I believe it is fair to describe the Omega Point Theory 's reception among other physicists , computer scientists and philosophers as " chilly " .
So let 's go right out on a limb and assume that we are not living in an ancestor simulation running in a late - universe Matrioshka hypercomputer .
So we all are , in fact , living creatures in what we may laughingly call a real material world .
We are , therefore , still faced with the problem of uploading ourselves without just making a copy .
The problem , it seems to me , is discontinuity .
All of us are very different creatures from the ones we were when we were five years old , but we 're not concerned about the " death " of the young version of ourselves .
That version just slowly and continuously turned into the current version .
Heck , if a serious change in brain - state counts as a death , then you die every time you go to sleep .
The person that wakes up in the morning just happens to share the name , body and memories of the one who fell asleep last night , and who thus ceased to exist [ 2 ] .
Fortunately , this shatteringly horrifying ( to me , at least ) idea about the nature of the identity / consciousness relationship can be interpreted in other ways .
One can , for instance , say that pauses in the procedure - that - is - consciousness do n't matter , as long as the procedure starts up again in much the same state .
This is what happens when we wake up , recover from general anaesthesia , or are revived after drowning in a freezing lake .
No worries ; you are still you .
( Pretty much everybody , of course , holds this belief that interruptions of consciousness do not constitute death , though most people have n't explicitly spelled it out to themselves .
Only those of us who like to sit quietly in a chair and scare the living crap out of ourselves with existential musings have bothered to codify this belief , and then chase its bobbing little fluffy tail into the ontological rabbit hole .
That hole leads in a distinctively Omega - Point -y direction :
If being dead for a few minutes in cold water or on an operating table does n't matter , then by extension being dead for zillions of years does n't matter either , as long as your consciousness is then reconstituted .
I do n't think there 's any way to escape this conclusion , without insisting for no clearly - explained reason that it just does n't count unless the consciousness is recreated in the same body that it was in at the start of the interruption .
This unsettling argument does n't really matter , though , if you do n't buy the argument that all possible consciousnesses actually will be created and / or recreated in computers in the future . )
The idea that interruptions of consciousness are acceptable does not necessarily lead to the notion that uploading is OK .
But it does , in some people 's opinion , legitimise the otherwise similarly horrifying type of teleporter , which scans you , dismantles you , dumps your molecules in its bulk matter store , and transmits sufficient information to another teleporter for that other machine to construct a copy of you from its own matter store .
This procedure is depicted in convenient cartoon form here :
The scan - and - dismantle teleporter is n't a problem , if " you " are just your consciousness - process .
Why should you care whether your consciousness - process is running in your old body or in the new one that just got built ?
I 'm none too keen on that sort of teleporter myself ( me and Doctor McCoy ... ) , but I 'm unconcerned about gradual consciousness changes .
As long as I do n't stop being one thing and suddenly start being another , I think it 's fair to say that there 's no point of identity - death to actually worry about .
This could , of course , merely be because I have to think that , if I 'm not to conclude that I die every time I go to sleep .
Here 's what I , and numerous people much cleverer than me , have come up with as an alternative to the copying problem .
Presume that there is a computer augmentation that you can attach to your skull , like Lobot from The Empire Strikes Back .
When you first attach it , it grows nanotech tendrils into your brain , and uses them to read your neural activity and build up its own neural net .
Its net , strapped to the back of your head , slowly comes to mirror your own .
In the next stage , when your brain cells die or when the computer decides there 's something it can help you with , it starts to write to your brain when appropriate .
Initially only very slightly , replacing the occasional lost pathway or popping a little information into your consciousness that your own brain could n't generate , but doing more and more as time goes by .
After a while you 've got a half - organic , half - computer brain .
And eventually , the organic brain can have died off completely .
But there 's been no distinct point when " you " moved from the meat to the computer , any more than there was a distinct point when " you " stopped being a baby .
You could take the death of your last organic brain cell to be an arbitrary point of loss - of - human - ness , but only the most reductio - ad - absurdum fanatic would say that " you " resided in that one last cell .
And now , hey presto , you 're uploaded .
And , with any luck , also considerably augmented .
Please form an orderly queue for the procedure .
( It 'll help everyone out if you shave your own head while you 're waiting . )
Footnotes
( Well , foot - articles , really .
The first of these " notes " is longer than the whole main article . )
Footnote 1 :
After this column ran in Atomic magazine , I got a bit of mail from readers about it .
To quote one of them :
I have to say that , to me at least , it is a self - evident truth that no amount of mathematical complexity can lead to human consciousness and awareness .
He then recommended the eminent mathematician Roger Penrose 's 1989 book , " The Emperor 's New Mind " .
Penrose , and his followers and philosophical predecessors , say that true , " strong " , artificial intelligence is impossible .
Whether you try to build up an AI in a computer from scratch , or copy some other intelligence into it , it wo n't work , unless the computer has a special something that nobody has yet identified .
Penrose reckons that the known laws of physics are inadequate to explain consciousness , and suspects that some form of quantum physics beyond that currently understood will be necessary if we 're ever to come up with a real theory of consciousness .
And , by extension , he says that unless we manage to make computers that include this new " correct quantum gravity " , or whatever other new theory consciousness turns out to require , we 'll never be able to create real artificial intelligence .
In particular , Penrose says that all current computers are deterministic - their future state is 100 % predictable , based on their hardware , programming and inputs - and a deterministic computer can never be conscious , because determinism precludes free will .
This argument seems to me to be putting the cart before the horse .
We do n't yet have the ability to make a computer of a similar order of complexity to the human brain , so stating a priori that such computers will never exhibit intelligence strikes me as being like someone in 1850 saying that no heavier - than - air powered aircraft will ever work .
Many people had tried to make aeroplanes by 1850 , but we now know that their efforts were doomed to failure .
They did n't understand aerodynamic principles , and - more prosaically - they did n't have powerful engines that were light enough ( though a steam aeroplane did actually fly , by 1933 ! ) .
Likewise , we have over the last few decades made half - arsed attempts at making true artificial intelligence in computers , which have all been dismal failures .
I do n't think those failures are grounds for claiming that human brains operate in some mystic way beyond all current physics , though , any more than the failure of nineteenth - century pedal - powered aeroplanes to get off the ground meant that physics would never explain the flight of birds .
If it turns out that you can't just make an analogue computer of similar complexity to the human brain , or an even larger digital computer with low - level programming that gives it similar functionality to an analogue computer , and teach such a computer to act like a conscious mind , then there may be grounds for Penrose 's conclusion that some utterly new field of physics will need to be created to explain the magic of consciousness .
Until we 've actually genuinely tried , though , it strikes me as goofy to just proclaim the effort to be futile and then start rambling on about quantum gravity .
In more than one way , the grey mush in our heads greatly surpasses the biggest supercomputers we 've made so far .
The human brain has about a hundred billion neurons , each of which has on average about seven thousand connections to other neurons , with all sorts of different weightings and influences and finesses and tweaks .
We 're currently only a couple of orders of magnitude away from having a hundred billion transistors in one CPU , but CPU transistors just have an emitter , a collector and a base , and are either 100 % on or 100 % off .
They are n't really anything like a neuron .
To ( attempt to ) properly simulate a brain , we 'd need to make ( or emulate ) some sort of processor whose " transistors " have the same vast interconnectedness as neurons , and also have the analogue response of neurons .
Emulation looks like the most promising way to do this , but it will of course require an awful lot of computing power , plus further research into exactly how neurons do connect to each other , which is currently only somewhat hazily understood .
( Heck , we do n't even really know how anaesthesia works , yet . )
If we manage to make such a processor and it does n't turn out to do any brain - like things , then I think Penrose 's claims should be taken seriously .
At the moment , though , we 've barely even begun to try to make such a thing , so it strikes me as extremely premature to say that it's " self - evident " that the whole exercise would be pointless .
( It seems to me that Penrose 's ideas about consciousness are another of those cases where onlookers only seem to be impressed by that portion of the theory that does n't intersect with their own field of expertise .
It 's like Immanuel Velikovsky 's " Worlds In Collision " stuff ; astrophysicists said " Velikovsky 's astrophysics does n't make any sense at all , but what he has to say about biology is very intriguing ... " and biologists said " Velikovsky has some real insights into planetary dynamics , though he 's completely wrong about evolution , of course ... " )
Even if it turns out that brains can't be simulated by deterministic computers , I do n't think that 's much of an argument against AI .
I do n't think anybody in the last 20 years has postulated a brain - simulator that was deterministic .
Even quite simple analogue computers can be non-deterministic , and it 's piss - easy , for that matter , to add robust randomness to a straight digital computer .
Lots of very interesting research is being done in this field ; evolutionary computation , for instance , shows great promise , and has the advantage that you do n't need to go into the project with a low - level understanding of how the brains you 're making are going to work .
You just glom a ton of connections together and apply selective pressure , and things design themselves .
( The down side of this is that even quite simple evolved systems can be very resistant to analysis .
I would n't be at all surprised if , 50 years from now , robot brains are common but nobody knows how they work in any more detail than we currently know how our own brains work . )
Humans have made countless systems that do weird random stuff , and nobody 's saying that whole new logic has to be created to deal with those ( if you do n't count chaos theory , of course ) , or that their behaviour can only be explained by quantum effects .
Perhaps Penrose really does have some deep insights here , but I do n't have anything like the mathematical knowledge to be able to tell wisdom from gibberish at the nitty - gritty level where mathematical theories actually get proved .
Penrose says X , Minsky says Y ; neither of 'em 's made a brain yet , so I 'll check back in a few years , OK ?
Penrose knows an awful lot about mathematical physics and relativity and cosmology , but I am unconvinced that any of these fields - particularly the latter two - are actually relevant to AI .
Perhaps I 'm quite wrong , and they are , but I can barely figure out calculus , never mind the rest of the reasoning Penrose uses to argue that all of the people working in the AI field - which , of course , does not include Penrose himself - are wasting their time .
That said , it is unquestionable that , as I mentioned above , a brain is not just a single complex computer running a program .
It 's a whole ecosystem , if you will , of systems and sub-systems and sub-sub - systems , intersecting and interacting and cooperating and competing .
There are literally hundreds of distinctly identified brain regions , whose normal function is understood to varying degrees - but abnormal brains , lacking whole large sections , sometimes leave their owners far less handicapped than you 'd expect .
Anybody who 's cracked an Oliver Sacks book will understand the educational value of brains that do n't work like most people's .
But anybody who 's brushed up against the software - development world - heck , anybody who 's spent a reasonable amount of time just using computers - ought , I think , to also see some parallels between the bizarre derangements of malfunctioning human brains and the more mystifying kinds of computer problems .
Apparently unrelated systems that interact , emergent behaviour that seems unconnected with anything you told the system to do , problems that 're as fascinating as they are frustrating ; computers have all of these , and so do brains .
Computers do n't yet have anything like the infinite analogue flexibility of human minds , and humans of course have a much more impressive " view " of what our minds are doing than we have of what 's going on inside a computer , which we can only see via its output devices .
But it strikes me as entirely unwarranted to argue that computers and minds are clearly totally unrelated and will never meet .
The development of computers and their software is slow and stumbling enough , compared with the complexity of existent biological systems , that I do n't think it 's justified to say that computers are definitely heading toward the status of brains .
But I do n't think it 's at all out of the question .
And , as with brains , failure modes are a window into what computers are becoming .
When something goes amiss in your brain , very weird things can happen .
You can , for instance , get a bump on the head , and then become " alexic " , entirely unable to discern the meaning of written words .
And , stranger yet , you 'll be unable even to remember what written words looked like .
Try to think of the Coca - Cola logo , or the simple capital - letters TOYOTA on the back of a Hilux pickup , and all that 'll come to mind is a meaningless glyph - jumble like the Hebrew or Arabic versions of the Coke logo , for people who can't read those scripts .
There are plenty of similarly bizarre brain disorders .
Lose your right parietal cortex to a stroke and you can end up losing not only the left side of your perceptual universe ( " hemispacial neglect " ) , but the very concept of " leftness " .
Your brain is no longer able to think that anything definably " left " can possibly be of any interest at all .
And , on top of that , you may very well be " anosognosic " ; unable to understand that there is anything wrong .
You may later learn to turn your dinner - plate 180 degrees to bring into view the half of it that previously did n't exist , but that wo n't change your gut certainty that the second half of the plate might as well have been an invisible pink unicorn , for all of the reality it'd had before you turned it .
Blindness caused by brain damage can be anosognosic , as well .
Essentially , the brain seems to just expand the " painting over " feature that it normally uses to fill in your eyes ' blind spots , and to hide the vast difference in resolution between your central macular vision and the rest of your visual field .
Now , everything you see is painted by the brain , which may take cues from your other remaining senses , but really does just make it all up .
As far as an anosognosic blind person is concerned , they can see just fine .
But everything they see is internally constructed , as when dreaming .
( This 'd be a pretty neat thing to be able to turn on and off at will . )
If you happen to get a dose of frontal - lobe damage along with your vision - centre loss , you can end up not only unaware of your blindness , but no longer able to think about the concept of " seeing " at all .
The result seems to be a vague confabulation whenever " looking " or " watching " or " seeing " is mentioned ; not only do you generate what you " see " entirely internally , but you 're entirely unable to realise that other people do n't do the same .
If one of these strange maladies befalls you , then depending on how the damage was caused , you may stay alexic , or blind and anosognosic , for the rest of your life .
Or you may be fine five days later .
Brains are like that .
But , to a more than coincidental degree , software is like that too .
Failures that screw up stuff that had nothing at all to do with whatever a programmer just changed .
Systems that 're 100 % certain that nothing is wrong , when they 're clearly actually not working at all .
Seemingly irrelevant voodoo rituals that fix everything again .
Most software does n't do very exciting things , so most of these sorts of failures lack the human interest of rare delusional disorders or sudden loss of language .
But that does n't mean they 're not conceptually related , and will become more obviously so in the future .
I confidently predict that as we get closer to practical artificial intelligence , we 'll see software whose failure modes more and more resemble the " failure modes " of the human brain .
By " practical " , here , I mean AI systems that are totally useless for the Turing test , and which clearly have as much similarity to general intelligence as a hang - glider has to a seabird , but which can do things that previously required direct human control , like driving cars .
We 're already coming up with computer vision systems that can interpret normal real - world scenes - they 're essential for driverless cars .
If there does n't end up being some commonality between the way those systems figure out what 's where and the way the human brain does , and also some commonality between what fools them and what fools us , I shall purchase a hat , and then eat it .
I mean , it 's possible for a human to lose " movement vision " - the ability to perceive objects in motion as being in motion , rather than as a sort of infrequently - updated freeze - frame slide - show .
That sounds just like a less - than - perfect computer - vision system , to me .
If it turns out that we need a whole general Theory of Mind to be able to make any sort of artificial consciousness , then it may take us a long , long time to do that , if we ever do .
But we did n't have to make a bird from scratch in order to achieve heavier - than - air flight .
We still can't make a bird , but we can make an aeroplane that 's far bigger and faster than any bird .
Footnote 2 :
Even if large changes in brain - state do , in your opinion , constitute death , it 's readily arguable that sleep and several other altered states of consciousness do not .
Several of these states can fairly be said to be somewhere between normal wakefulness and normal sleep , and this fact by itself suggests that this is a continuum of fuzzily - defined states , not a collection of distinct and separate states .
Meditation , hypnotic or other trance states , the vivid hallucinations that wakefully conscious people have when they 're in a sensory deprivation tank or wearing ganzfeld gear ; the list goes on and on , and all of these states share some characteristics of wakefulness and some of sleep .
I think this concept is well summed up by this footnote - yes , this footnote of mine is citing another footnote - from page 57 of the Vintage Books edition of Oliver Sacks '
An Anthropologist on Mars :
Rodolfo Llinás and his colleagues at New York University , comparing the electrophysiological properties of the brain in waking and dreaming , postulate a single fundamental mechanism for both - a ceaseless inner talking between cerebral cortex and thalamus , a ceaseless interplay of image and feeling , irrespective of whether there is sensory input or not .
When there is sensory input , this interplay integrates it to generate waking consciousness , but in the absence of sensory input it continues a to generate brain states , those brain states we call fantasy , hallucination , or dreams .
Thus waking consciousness is dreaming - but dreaming constrained by external reality .
( Note that the above may be an excellent answer for more than one question in a special edition of Trivial Pursuit . )
So what do you get when , after thirty years of looking the other way , someone finally comes calling on the most wealthy corporations in the US to pay their taxes ?
One result is a lot of unimaginative , dishonest shills moving to protect and obscure these corporate deadbeats by engineering fake grassroots campaigns – and getting caught doing it .
On August 3rd 2008 , the Internet domain name chicagoteaparty.com was registered by right - wing Chicago asshole Zack Christenson .
Christenson is producer of “ Extension 720 ” on WGN Radio , also known as “ The Milt Rosenberg Show ” .
Zack and Milt ’s work is pure WGN : colorless cluelessness for caucasians and Cubs fans .
For reference , picture a fat white woman from Orland Park moaning into a call - in telephone about how she ’s “ worried ” ( it does n’t matter what about ) and you can safely skip tuning in to AM 720 in Chicago .
Far from being a hotbed of New Media literacy , WGN ’s signal follows the suburban , Republican - voting families who fled Chicago neighborhoods in the 1970s .
Its broadcasts range from eye - crossingly dull celebrity tut - tutting to reluctant and clumsy how - tos on ancient internet phenomena like eBay , email and eHarmony .
Ars Technica it ai n’t .
So when Christenson registered the chicagoteaparty.com domain name in August ( here ’s the domain record proving the date ) , we can be pretty certain it was n’t on his mind to launch an original website based on his own ideas .
For one thing , Zack has no ideas , as his puddle - deep personal blog clearly demonstrates .
The domain did become a focal point when , six months later , on February 19th 2009 , CNBC floor reporter Rick Santelli characterized people behind on their mortgages as “ losers ” and raved on the air “ we ’re thinking of having a Chicago Tea Party [ to protest the idea that tax money should be used to help mortgage payers facuing foreclosure in the economic crisis ] ”
Either Christenson ’s domain registration is a coincidence , or he and Santelli are two marginal media figures in a far - flung group of right - wing shills for tax - cheating mega - businesses who were caught launching a fake - grassroots campaign to whip up anti-taxing anger and raise sympathy for multi-billionaires who now face the prospect of paying taxes like everybody else does .
It ’s true that some people and businesses in the top 2 % of wealth in the US would rather pay to make people angry about taxation than just pay their taxes .
And it ’s also true that those people get help from toads like Christenson and Rosenberg on a regular basis .
But who might be writing the checks this time around ?
As it turns out , reporters Mark Ames and Yasha Levine did the research and connected the dots in the domain name and Santelli campaign to the Koch family , owners of Koch Industries , the largest private corporation in the US .
As such , it is a family desperately interested in stopping efforts to collect taxes due from its thirty - year run under the chummiest government business interests have enjoyed since the 1920s , and has funded fake - grassroots campaigns in the past through its funded organization Freedom Works .
What we discovered is that Santelli ’s “ rant ” was not at all spontaneous as his alleged fans claim , but rather it was a carefully - planned trigger for the anti-Obama campaign .
In PR terms , his February 19th call for a “ Chicago Tea Party ” was the launch event of a carefully organized and sophisticated PR campaign , one in which Santelli served as a frontman , using the CNBC airwaves for publicity , for the some of the craziest and sleaziest rightwing oligarch clans this country has ever produced .
Namely , the Koch family , the multibilllionaire owners of the largest private corporation in America , and funders of scores of rightwing thinktanks and advocacy groups , from the Cato Institute and Reason Magazine to FreedomWorks .
The scion of the Koch family , Fred Koch , was a co-founder of the notorious extremist - rightwing John Birch Society .
As you read this , Big Business is pouring tens of millions of dollars into their media machines in order to destroy just about every economic campaign promise Obama has made , as reported recently in the Wall Street Journal .
At stake is n’t the little guy ’s fight against big government , as Santelli and his bot - supporters claim , but rather the “ upper 2 percent ” ’s war to protect their wealth from the Obama Adminstration ’s economic plans .
When this Santelli “ grassroots ” campaign is peeled open , what ’s revealed is a glimpse of what is ahead and what is bound to be a hallmark of his presidency .
Let ’s go back to February 19th : Rick Santelli , live on CNBC , standing in the middle of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , launches into an attack on the just - announced $ 300 billion slated to stem rate of home foreclosures :
“ The government is promoting bad behavior !
Do we really want to subsidize the losers ’ mortgages ?!
This is America !
We ’re thinking of having a Chicago tea party in July , all you capitalists who want to come down to Lake Michigan , I ’m gonna start organizing . ”
Almost immediately , the clip and the unlikely “ Chicago tea party ” quote buried in the middle of the segment , zoomed across a well - worn path to headline fame in the Republican echo chamber , including red-alert headlines on Drudge .
Within hours of Santelli ’s rant , a website called ChicagoTeaParty.com sprang to life .
Essentially inactive until that day , it now featured a YouTube video of Santelli ’s “ tea party ” rant and billed itself as the official home of the Chicago Tea Party .
The domain was registered in August , 2008 by Zack Christenson , a dweeby Twitter Republican and producer for a popular Chicago rightwing radio host Milt Rosenberg — a familiar name to Obama campaign people .
Last August , Rosenberg , who looks like Martin Short ’s Irving Cohen character , caused an outcry when he interviewed Stanley Kurtz , the conservative writer who first “ exposed ” a personal link between Obama and former Weather Undergound leader Bill Ayers .
As a result of Rosenberg ’s radio interview , the Ayers story was given a major push through the Republican media echo chamber , culminating in Sarah Palin ’s accusation that Obama was “ palling around with terrorists . ”
That Rosenberg ’s producer owns the “ chicagoteaparty.com ” site is already weird — but what ’s even stranger is that he first bought the domain last August , right around the time of Rosenburg ’s launch of the “ Obama is a terrorist ” campaign .
It ’s as if they held this “ Chicago tea party ” campaign in reserve , like a sleeper - site .
Which is exactly what it was .

Plasma ion tweeters are an evolution of the “ singing arc ” , invented by William Duddells in the 1900 .
He basically reworked a carbon arc lamp – which were known for being fairly noisy .
Now , William found that by varying the voltage to the arc , it changed the sound that was produced .
Bingo !
Plasma Speaker
Much later a fellow by the name of Siegfried Klein got involved and tuned it by putting the arc in a small quartz tube .
Coupling this to a horn , he was able to produce a speaker and even a microphone .
I ’m really not too sure if I ’d want to tempt fate by putting my mouth too close to one of those things though .
Tweeters made out of plasma arcs have a major advantage – they have no resonance or transient problems .
Most audiophiles know that the lighter the material used in a speaker , the faster the response can be , and the better transients they produce .
Well , plasma arcs have ZERO weight .
The plasma speaker works by moving air via changing the temperature in its chamber .
Prepare to be amazed .
Here is an amazing video of an awesome DIY plasma speaker setup .
At one point in the 1970 ’s , plasma speakers started being produced by a company called Magnat – they ’re still in business , mainly producing car audio systems .
Watching the plasma speakers is pretty interesting – they start as a deep purple , and at the edges of the arc you can see them change to a deep reddish pink in the center .
When the music has a lot of high frequencies , you can see the colors change in intensity .
Very cool .
The main problem with these speakers is that they many need a continuous supply of ionizable gas , such as helium .
The plasma has a by - product which we all know : Ozone , and if left in a closed room for long periods of time , it can reach hazardous levels !
A company called Acapella is the only company that I can find that still makes plasma speakers , and they are expensive ( $ 23,000 + ) , but revered for their sound quality .
Here ’s another DIY plasma speaker at work .
These sort of remind me of the Tesla coil speaker – once again , amazing .

KABUL , March 26 ( Reuters ) - A would - be suicide bomber accidentally blew himself up on Thursday , killing six other militants as he was bidding them farewell to leave for his intended target , the Interior Ministry said .
" The terrorist was on his way to his destination and saying good - bye to his associates and then his suicide vest exploded , " a statement from the ministry said .
Taliban - led attacks in Afghanistan have escalated in the past year with suicide and roadside bombings insurgents ' weapons of choice .
The incident happened in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan where mainly British troops are struggling against a growing Taliban - led insurgency .
In a separate incident in Helmand , nine policemen were killed when Taliban insurgents attacked a police post in Nari Sarraj district , the Interior Ministry said .
Elsewhere , four Taliban insurgents were killed and seven policemen and two civilians wounded during a battle just outside Ghazni city , about 200 km ( 125 miles ) southwest of the capital Kabul , a spokesman for the provincial governor said .
On Friday , Washington is set to unveil a review of its strategy in Afghanistan , which is expected to emphasise the need to expand Afghan security forces and strengthen the country 's heavily aid - dependent economy .
( Reporting by Golnar Motevalli ; Editing by Valerie Lee )
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The State Department on Thursday sent a blunt , public message to North Korea : Do n't launch your rocket .
Activists carry paper missiles and portraits of North Korean leader Kim Jong - Il at a rally in Seoul on April 2 .
" We do n't want to see this launch go forward , " department spokesman Robert Wood said .
But at the same time , the United States is carefully avoiding any suggestion that it would try to disrupt the launch and is being vague about what Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others have said the " consequences " of the launch would be .
Behind the U.S. tightrope act is the United States ' hope of handling the situation in a way that will not endanger the six - party talks aimed at dismantling and eventually erasing North Korea 's nuclear weapons program , a senior administration official told CNN on Thursday .
The official said the North Koreans have pretty much backed themselves into a corner .
While they may have begun the process of threatening to launch a rocket to gain leverage with the United States , it is now an issue of saving face -- and they are certain to go ahead with the launch .
Watch what the repercussions of a launch would be »
They recognize there will be a strong reaction at the United Nations , but have no choice at this point , the official said .
The diplomacy involved is very delicate , the official noted .
All of the other countries involved in the six - party talks agree a launch would be bad , but Russia and China are less eager to impose sanctions while South Korea and Japan want to be much tougher .
So the United States has to stake out a middle position and be patient , the official said .
The United States wants to handle the situation so that after the launch -- and an appropriate period of criticism of North Korea -- the six - party talks will be resumed , the official said .
" We are not going to take our eye off the ball or let them distract us from the goal , which is denuclearization , " the official said .
" We really believe that is the best way to take care of the issue and we think we can get it if we keep working with the North Koreans .
At some point it is a war of attrition and we will continue to wear them down . "
The official noted that the launch " would be a provocative act .
We do n't want to dismiss it or take it lightly and it would be dealt with seriously .
But we can't take our eyes off the prize . "
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said much the same a few weeks ago -- launch or no launch , the United States wants to continue the six - party talks .
The wild card is the North Koreans , the official said .
" At some point we need some sign from them they want to play the game , " the official said .
" The level of bellicosity is really bad , even for the North Korean standards .
So at some point we need to see from the North Koreans they are done with that and are ready to talk . "
The official speculated that the North Koreans have been shying away from U.S. efforts at engagement out of fear that a better relationship with the United States and more openness to the world could put the regime at risk .
In addition , this official said , the North Koreans are keeping a close eye on what is happening between the United States and Iran .
With that behind - the - scenes maneuvering as a backdrop , Wood , at his midday State Department briefing Thursday , urged North Korean leaders to rethink their course .
" We call on the North to desist from launching any type of missile .
It would be counterproductive , it 's provocative , it further enflames tensions in the region , " he said .
" We want to see the North get back to the six - party framework and focus on denuclearization . "
Wood would not answer questions about whether the United States is poised to go to the United Nations to seek retaliatory sanctions against North Korea if it goes through with the launch .
" Let 's see if this test happens .
We certainly hope it does n't .
Again , we call on the North [ North Korea ] not to do it .
But certainly , if that test does go forward we will be having discussions with our allies , " Wood said .
" The situation right now in the region is very tense .
Everyone is on edge and we want to try to do what we can to prevent this launch from happening , " he added .
" And we are using every possible avenue that we have diplomatically to do that . "
North Korea said the the rocket will carry a satellite into orbit .
The United States and other countries fear the main purpose of the launch , regardless of the payload , is to allow North Korea to gain valuable information about improving its ballistic missile program .
Japan recently mobilized its missile defense system in response to the planned launch .
Japanese officials said the move is aimed at shooting down any debris from the launch that might fall into Japanese territory .
North Korea , in response , said it will attack the Japanese military and " major targets " if Japan shoots down the rocket , North Korea 's state - run news service , KCNA , reported Thursday .
Wednesday night , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates called his counterparts in Japan and South Korea to discuss the expected missile launch , Gates ' spokesman said .
In separate calls to Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada and South Korean Defense Minister Sang Hee Lee , Gates expressed the importance of close coordination with each country in regard to the possible launch , Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Thursday .
" All three of them agreed to approach the issue in a calm manner as it develops , " Whitman said .
He would not discuss other details of the calls and would not say if Gates offered to assist Japan in shooting down debris from the missile if it was to endanger Japan .

All About North Korea • U.S. Department of State
Relax , everybody .
Sarah Palin is never going to be president .
The reason is both fundamental and obvious :
She always takes the bait .
Recently confronted with the news that Levi Johnston , the 18 - year - old father of her grandchild , had appeared on the Tyra Banks Show chatting about having had sex with Bristol Palin under the abstinence - advocating governor 's roof , Palin basically had three options :
1 . No comment on a private family matter .
2 . “ Of course I wish Levi had n't done this , but he 's still the father of my grandchild , and we all have to work together to bring up that beautiful baby . ”
3 . Publicly trash the little cad , magnifying the story and setting her family up for long - term conflict with Levi ’s while — worst of all — making Palin seem much less eager to protect the baby than to whack his father .
Response No. 1 or No. 2 would have kept the story to a minimum and even flattered Palin through the contrast of her classy silence with Johnston 's tacky spilling .
Characteristically , she went with No. 3 . Game over .
Whatever Palin 's defenders may cry , her troubles do n’t stem from ideology , misogyny , or snobbery but from personality .
To run for national office is to have shots fired constantly at oneself and one 's family .
To win is to master the art of whether , when , and how to fire back .
If Palin can't restrain herself from attacking a teenager who is painfully well placed to attack her back , she is not getting anywhere near the White House .
And while she need n't swear off exploiting her family — what politician would ? — she does need to get a whole lot more subtle about it .
Palin is hardly the first politician to sell herself as a wonderful family person , and perhaps she is just that .
But even more than for other public figures — including other female politicians —
Palin ’s family is a mixed political blessing .
It is the key to her appeal but also a question mark .
This is not due to the headline - grabbing features of her household .
It is because , so far , it is in the context of dealing with public revelations about her private life that Palin has expressed her most troubling personal quality — the almost Pavlovian inclination to react without thinking .
Looking back , it did n't bother me that she had a Down syndrome infant and a pregnant teenage daughter .
It bothered me , a little , that she acquired both at about the same time and yet — by her own initial account , subsequently altered — she did n't think twice about adding a run for the vice presidency to her chores .
( And yes , I would have had the same feeling about a similarly situated male candidate if he were running as the ultimate dad . )
Likewise , it did n't bother me that her daughter 's pregnancy failed to reverse Palin 's views on abstinence - only education ; it bothered me that it seemed not to have occasioned the slightest flicker of doubt in her mind about those views .
( Granted , when running for governor , she did waffle on the abstinence - only question -- but that was politically expedient , not personally thoughtful . )
Even now , it does n't bother me that she wants to shred Levi Johnston for blabbing , which is an entirely normal impulse .
But it bothers me a lot that she went ahead and did it — with maximum publicity .
After all , this young man will remain a powerful presence in the life of her daughter and grandson and she only recently portrayed him as her admirable , salt - of - the - earth , son - in - law - to - be .
Politically , it could n't matter less what kind of mother Palin truly is .
But it could n't matter more what kind of mother she seems to be .
And increasingly , what she seems to be is craven .
No single such example should be a deal - breaker .
And we can debate forever whether any such examples ought to count .
But somewhere in that ill - defined yet decisive area of the gut where voters either warm up to or go cold on a candidate , they do count .
And in aggregate , they 're counting against her .
If this sounds like an attack on female ambition , it 's not .
On the contrary , I think all women , whatever their politics , should appreciate the way Palin wears her ambition — like a fabulous , flowing cape , not the usual hair shirt .
At last , we have a wife - mother - politician — better yet , a right - wing Christian wife - mother - politician — who expresses not a drop of guilt about fitting herself into her own life .
Whether by dint of her generation or her nature , Palin clearly feels no need to resort to the tiresome lament , previously required , about how dreadfully torn she feels because whenever she is at work she is n't at home and vice versa .
Hallelujah !
For that alone , women should cheer her hour upon the national stage .
Not that she 's about to make an exit .
At least through 2012 , Palin will be a fact of political life .
And if she stays true to form , she will greet each controversy , personal or political , with her trademark feistiness .
Her supporters will love it .
The media will love it .
Most of all , her political opponents will love it .
Because the more that Sarah Palin acts like a pistol , the less she looks less like a president .
The great Australian Firewall might be struggling to make political progress , but regulators are already using its blacklist to threaten local websites with fines .
Broadband discussion forum Whirlpool was threatened with an A$ 11,000 ( £ 5,148 ) a day fine by the Australian Communications and Media Authority because a commenter posted a link to an anti-abortion website which appeared on the regulator 's list of websites banned in Australia .
The takedown notice was sent to Whirlpool 's hosting service Bulletproof Networks .
Bulletproof contacted Whirlpool which agreed to remove the web link .
But the story gets murkier - ACMA added the website to its secret blacklist after receiving a complaint about one page on the site from someone in Melbourne with the user name Foad .
Foad 's intention was to highlight the stupidity of the blacklist idea by getting a site which had nothing to do with child sexual abuse added to the list .
Foad succeeded .
The blacklist is meant to be a well - guarded secret but complainants are free to make public the result of their complaints .
So the URL which Foad complained about was published in forums to highlight the lunacy of ACMA 's actions .
There 's more in the Whirlpool forums here . ®
Visit a Harmonique Domespace house and you ’ll instantly take note of its sleek , curved exterior and the wood - laden interior filled with skylights and dramatic ceilingscapes .
But here are some things you wo n’t notice , at least not right away :
• The entire house rotates !
The rotation is so smooth and gradual as to be imperceptible from both inside and outside the house ( imagine trying to see the movement of an hour hand on a watch ) .
The dome owner can direct the house to point in a particular direction by use of a remote control .
But primary purpose of the rotation is to make optimal use of the solar panels that line the roof of the Domespace and the passive solar properties of the house ’s many windows .
Which brings us to . . .
• Extreme energy efficiency .
The solar panels produces most , if not all , of the energy required to power life in a Domespace house ( during the day , at least , when the sun is shining ) .
It helps that a Domespace is more electricity efficient than a typical house .
A dome naturally has greater thermal efficiency .
And the Domespace ’s many skylights virtually eliminate the need of electric lights during the day .
• Increased safety .
The dome ’s naturally aerodynamic shape , along with Domespace ’s solid construction , allows this house to withstand winds up to 175 mph ( 281 km / h ) without sustaining significant damage .
That ’s a category 5 hurricane !
The Domespace can also withstand an earthquake up to an 8 on the Richter Scale .
How impressive is that ?
An 8 Richter Scale earthquake is equivalent to a 1 gigaton TNT bomb and would be tied for the 6th strongest ever recorded .
( We are n’t sure what would happen if the Domespace were simultaneously hit by a massive earthquake and hurricane but at that point the rapture might be nigh giving you have bigger things to worry about ) .
• Quick construction .
The Domespace ’s design incorporates many prefabricated elements allowing for relatively short built time .
The complete exterior of an average size Domespace can be built in a mere three months !
Domespace offers their Harmonique rotating dome houses in a variety of sizes ; the larger ones have two living levels .
Each Harmonique model is also available in a non-rotating Eclosion version , which is n’t as cool but does make the location of the front door more predictable .
Domespace also makes a miniature non-rotating dome called the Transit .
The one - room Transit domes are intended for guest quarters or vacation properties .
At the other end of the scale , the company constructs built - to - spec Emergence domes that are large enough to function as churches , hotels and municipal buildings .
No matter the model and size , for a cool - looking energy efficient house there truly is no place like dome .

NEW YORK / HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. electricity demand will continue to shrink in 2009 as the economic meltdown hits industrial power consumption , but a rebound could come in 2010 .
Bigger houses , a myriad of electric devices and an expanding economy have kept U.S. power use on a nearly uninterrupted climb for 25 years - until the recession put the brakes on industrial demand in 2008 .
Electricity sales to industrial customers are expected to shrink 6.4 percent this year , leading to an expected 1.7 percent drop in overall power consumption in 2009 , the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its most recent outlook .
EIA , which provides data and analysis for the U.S. Department of Energy , said in another report industrial consumers bought 11.4 percent less power in January 2009 compared with the same time last year .
“ Industrial demand will cycle deeper than residential ( use ) because industrial demand is even more sensitive to the business cycle , ” said Lawrence Makovich , vice president of the global power group at Cambridge Energy Research Associates .
EIA expects the downturn to reverse course in 2010 , with 1.2 percent growth in electric output as the economy slowly returns to life .
PJM , the biggest power grid in North America , forecast a 1.4 percent drop in peak demand this summer compared with 2008 , based on normal weather conditions .
Demand in the 13 mid-Atlantic and Midwest states that PJM serves should rebound in 2010 but not surpass levels seen in 2008 until 2011 .
INDUSTRIAL DOWNTURN
Weather is the dominant factor affecting power demand but has the biggest impact on residential and commercial use , sectors expected to remain relatively flat this year .
Examples of declining industrial demand , which makes up about a quarter of U.S. electric consumption , are easy to find .
Minnesota Power , a unit of Allete Inc of Duluth , Minnesota , expects power demand from taconite miners , its biggest customers , to fall by 40 percent this year .
Taconite miners use electricity to process iron - bearing rock into pellets used to make steel .
The demand for steel has plunged in the current economy .
In the petrochemical - dominant Houston area , nonresidential power sales fell 5.5 percent in February , according to CenterPoint Energy Inc , a power delivery company .
February marked the third month that CenterPoint showed nonresidential sales lagging the year - earlier month .
To conserve cash , power companies have deferred spending by about 10 percent , or $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion , according to an informal survey by Edison Electric Institute ( EEI ) , an association of shareholder - owned power companies .
American Electric Power Co Inc , with customers in 11 states , cut its 2009 capital budget by more than 20 percent or $ 750 million , the company said .
The financial crisis is delaying investment in energy infrastructure at the same time new environmental mandates are requiring substantial increases in generation and transmission needed to limit air emissions and boost renewable supplies .
CERA ’s Makovich expects utilities to pare overall capital spending by as much as 20 percent by the end of the year due to lower revenue and increased bad debt .
“ When we get to 20 percent or more , I start to worry about the consequences , ” said Makovich .
“ That does n’t hurt you now but can down the road when projects were supposed to be done and demand rebounds . ”
PJM projected peak demand growth would return to a more normal 1.7 percent per year over the next decade .
“ The economic downturn has delayed the need for new infrastructure , but has not eliminated it , ” PJM spokesman Ray Dotter said .
Study points to cancer 's financial malignancy HEALTH INSURANCE
Cancer survivor Christine Franklin talks with her 10 - year - old grandson Logan Spencer as she helps him with his 5th grade homework in Vacaville , Calif. , on Wednesday Feb. 4 , 2009 .
Cancer survivor Christine Franklin talks with her 10 - year - old grandson Logan Spencer as she helps him with his 5th grade homework in Vacaville , Calif. , on Wednesday Feb. 4 , 2009 .

When Christine Franklin was diagnosed with breast cancer , she spent at least $ 7,000 in out - of - pocket medical expenses , but was able to continue working as a busy sales executive .
But when the disease recurred last year , she had to quit her job because of the debilitating side effects of her new medications .
With her income greatly reduced , she was forced to sell her Vacaville home .
Franklin , who pays the monthly premium for her former employer 's health coverage along with high co-payments for drugs and care , has stopped adding up the costs .
" When you have cancer , you not only lose who you were - your body no longer looks the same - but you can lose your job , and before you know it , it 's a slow spiral , " said Franklin , 57 , who is divorced and lives on disability payments .
" You feel yourself going down , like you 're sliding down a hillside and the earth gives way and you 're just grasping to hold on . "
A report released Thursday by the American Cancer Society and the Kaiser Family Foundation found that even those cancer patients fortunate enough to have private health insurance face severe challenges paying for life - saving treatments .
Hefty out - of - pocket expenses , high cost - sharing requirements , caps on benefits and lifetime maximums on some policies are among the factors that can contribute to financial problems and lead many people to resort to bankruptcy , the study found .
" You would at least think the health care system would work for the people who are sick , " said Drew Altman , president and chief executive officer of the Kaiser Family Foundation .
" What this study shows is there are lots of gaps and holes and problems for the people who are the sickest in our society .
That 's the opposite of how health care should work . "
In 2008 , about 684,850 people under age 65 were diagnosed with cancer , according to the American Cancer Society .
The majority - estimated as high as 70 percent by at least one study - had private health insurance .
Profiles of 20 patients
Rather than compile statistics , the study profiled 20 patients whose experiences were representative of the types of problems reported to the American Cancer Society 's Health Insurance Assistance Center .
Of those profiled , nine had coverage through an employer , one paid for employer coverage , seven had individual insurance , two received coverage through a state high - risk pool , and one became uninsured .
The problems they experienced included delays in treatment as well as debt and added stress .
People who become too sick to work usually can continue their employer 's coverage for up to 18 months by paying the full premium , but the added expense of that coverage can pose a hardship because patients often are living on a reduced income .
Getting alternative coverage , even years after the diagnosis with no recurrence , can be a nonstarter .
Insurers in the individual market routinely restrict applicants with a history of cancer .
Public programs such as state high - risk pools or Medicare , which is available to those under 65 who are disabled , often have high costs and long waiting periods .
Making tough decisions
A 58 - year - old Florida woman profiled in the study reached the $ 100,000 annual limit on her policy in 2007 after her breast cancer diagnosis .
Jamie Drzewicki wound up amassing $ 75,000 in uncovered medical costs , a sum that was reduced to $ 30,000 after her hospital forgave some of the debt .
" I am a hard worker , and now I am making decisions between paying for my groceries and paying off some of my bills , " Drzewicki told the study 's researchers .
Tammy
Witt , a 40 - year - old mother of two from Ohio , initially was covered for her breast - cancer treatments with her employer 's insurance , but the company changed ownership and switched to a policy that had a meager $ 2,500 annual benefits limit .
The strain contributed to her separating from her husband and eventually forced her into bankruptcy .
Another patient , 62 - year - old Thomas Olszewski from Texas , has been cancer free for nearly 10 years after his 1999 prostate cancer diagnosis , but is grappling with high premiums .
Now retired , Olszewski said he has a tough time affording his individual policy , which costs $ 437 a month and comes with a $ 3,750 annual deductible .
He said he often delays lab work and follow - up care due to costs .
" A cancer diagnosis can threaten anyone with bankruptcy and financial ruin , no matter what your earning power is , " Peggy McGuire , executive director of the Women 's Cancer Resource Center in Oakland .
" There are many paths you take , but they lead to the same destination : loss of all resources . "
Sometimes patients who lose their jobs eventually qualify for Medi-Cal , McGuire said .
Others may be able to get help through resources like pharmaceutical patient assistance programs , which cover the costs of certain drugs .
Struggle to pay for drug
Franklin , who was not part of the study , pays $ 450 a month to remain on her former employer 's plan while she waits to qualify for Medicare due to disability rather than her age .
She is relieved to have insurance , but struggles to pay $ 658.73 each month for a cancer drug that does not have a generic equivalent and $ 600 every three months for follow - up scans .
She now has a $ 100 co-payment each time she sees her oncologist because her employer switched coverage and the doctor is not in the new physician network .
Franklin , a mother of two and grandmother of three , feels fortunate to be cancer free after a clear scan in December , but always has to steel herself for the possibility of bad news in her next round of tests .
Still , she manages to keep her sense of humor .
Franklin considered the cost of all the treatments she 's had and compared herself to the Bionic Woman : " Sometimes you sit there and think : Am I really worth this ? "

Hala , 7 , has stopped speaking since her brother 's death , and covers her head when he is mentioned
By Heather Sharp
BBC News , Gaza
Omsyat , 12 , has become nervous and aggressive , Hala , 7 , has completely stopped speaking and Sobhy , 11 , burned the toys he was brought with a candle , says their mother , Wafa Awersha .
Psychiatric nurse Rowiya Hamam nods as she sits on a thin mattress on floor of the tent in al - Atatra in northern Gaza .
In what is now their home , Mrs Awersha updates her on how the five children are coping with their brother 's death in the recent conflict .
Sobhy stares at the floor fiddling with a toy as he is asked about his loss Ibrahim , 9 , was hit by Israeli bullets on 4 January and died before his siblings ' eyes , with their injured parents barely conscious nearby , the family say .
His body lay for four days outside their house before the fighting waned enough for neighbours to take it away on a donkey cart .
Israel blames civilian casualties on militants ' practice of operating from populated areas and says Palestinian fighters fired at its forces during the daily unilateral three - hour ceasefire it instituted to allow emergency workers to reach the dead and injured .
Several hundred of the 1,300 Palestinian deaths were children and some accounts of civilian deaths have raised concerns of war crimes .
After Ibrahim 's death , Sobhy began behaving like his sibling and asking to be called Ibrahim , Ms Hamam says .
" School 's fine , " he says , when asked .
" I like maths . "
But he stares at the ground and tears soon well in his eyes .
Audio gallery : Children 's drawings
Mrs Awersha says he used to be top in his class , but he struggles to concentrate now .
Hala covers her head with a blanket whenever Ibrahim is mentioned , while Diya , 3 , beheaded the soft toys he was given , Ms Hamam says .
' For my kids '
Ms Hamam is one of a team of mental health workers in Gaza that say they have been " overwhelmed " by the scale of the needs since the conflict .
She has visited the Awersha family several times , bringing toys and games , trying to help the children express their feelings and teaching them deep breathing exercises .
Mrs Awersha smiles and teases the children as she scrapes the girls ' matted hair into pony tails and helps them put on the school smocks rescued from the rubble of their home .
The tent buzzes with fat , black flies .
Mrs Awersha exhales hard when asked how she is coping .
And then the tears flow .
Wafa says she jokes with her children , but cries when she is alone " Maybe you found me making people laugh , but honestly I 'm doing this just for my kids , " she says .
Whenever she goes back to her bulldozed home and stands in the spot where Ibrahim was killed , she weeps and weeps , she says .
Gaza 's mental health professionals have been working flat out in schools , kindergartens , clinics , homes and tents to try to help similar cases .
Hassan Zeyada , who heads the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme 's centre in Gaza City , and his colleague , psychiatrist Sami Owaida , say they are exhausted .
" Many of our colleagues lost relatives .
We have to give support , but sometimes we feel that we need support , " says Dr Oweida .
Dr Zeyada also points out the difficulty of treating " ongoing and continuous trauma " in a place where a long - term political solution remains elusive .
" Sometimes you feel you are wasting your efforts .
Another invasion , another war , another attack will happen - you feel they will demolish or destroy all your efforts , " he says .
Anxiety Ongoing trauma too plagues the residents of Israel 's southern towns , who live under the constant threat of Palestinian rocket fire , with about 8,000 rockets and mortars fired since 2001 .
At least 18 people have been killed in that time .
Children under eight have known little else but a constantly heightened state of anxiety .
Children hit hard as Gaza toll rises Sderot longs for end to rockets
And even after the recent fighting , which Israel said was aimed at reducing the rocket fire , a steady flow of rockets and mortars has continued .
But while mental health workers on both sides say at least 20 - 30 % of the population suffers symptoms of trauma , the Israeli south is clearly better equipped to tackle the problems than Gaza .
GCMHP say there are only five clinical psychiatrists in Gaza trained to international standards , and no clinical psychologists .
' Basics for life ' John Jenkins , the World Health Organization 's mental health project manager for the West Bank and Gaza , says that , as well as difficulties in getting people with the right skills into Gaza , shortages of drugs such as tranquilisers and antidepressants are a constant problem .
He says it is too early to assess the scale of the mental health needs from the recent conflict , as the impact of trauma takes time to emerge .
Living in a tent makes it harder for children to regain a sense of normality But human beings ' ability to deal with stress is " quite remarkable " , he says , and the majority of people do not need specialist treatment .
" What people really need are the basic things in life , " he says , such as reliable food supplies , a secure place to live and prospects for work .
This should " absolutely " be the priority , he says .
But as Ms Hamam traipses away past the rows of tents , while children in flip - flops clamour at her to bring them shoes , she says that for the Awersha children , the conditions will make recovery harder .
" Before the war , they had their routine - come home , watch TV , write their homework , but in the tent it 's very difficult . "
" It will take too much time for them to recover , " she says shaking her head sadly .

A Staten Island businessman was sentenced Thursday to nearly six years in prison for assisting terrorists by providing satellite television services to Hezbollah ’s television station , Al Manar .
The businessman , Javed Iqbal , 45 , said in a statement read by his lawyer in Federal District Court in Manhattan that he was “ deeply sorry ” for what he called a mistake that hurt him “ financially , emotionally and physically . ”
“ I have not harmed anyone in my whole life , ” he said in the statement to Judge Richard M. Berman , who sentenced him to 69 months .
Mr. Iqbal , who emigrated to the United States from Pakistan as a teenager , ran his business from a Brooklyn storefront and the garage of his home in Mariners Harbor , Staten Island , which had satellite dishes in the backyard .
The United States Treasury Department has designated Al Manar  “ the beacon ” in Arabic  a global terrorist entity .
Hi all ,
You might remember autojump , which is a little tool I made which is a cd command that " learns " from your usage of the CLI .
There 's been significant progress since the last post :
1 ) We now support zsh completely , including autocompletion .
I think this should please a number of people , give the number of zsh zealots in these forums
2 ) A user contributed a little applet which displays an icon in the notification area .
The icon allows you to quickly open a terminal or file browser in the most used directories .
3 ) Performance has been improved by running the prompt command in the background .
The package is not up to date yet because I do n't feel the features have been tested enough for a big release , but if you want to test and report bugs to the autojump forum ( http://n2.nabble.com/autojump-f2340094.html), that would help a lot .

Iowa .
WE WON !!!!!!!
by Jeremy Hooper
Iowa Code section 595.2 is unconstitutional because the County has
been unable to identify a constitutionally adequate justification for excluding
plaintiffs from the institution of civil marriage .
A new distinction based on
sexual orientation would be equally suspect and difficult to square with the
fundamental principles of equal protection embodied in our constitution .
This record , our independent research , and the appropriate equal protection
analysis do not suggest the existence of a justification for such a legislative
classification that substantially furthers any governmental objective .
Consequently , the language in Iowa Code section 595.2 limiting civil
marriage to a man and a woman must be stricken from the statute , and the

Iowa Code section 595.2 violates the equal protection provision of the Iowa
Constitution .

It depends on your body weight and muscle mass .
The general rule is Dr=L ( w / ms ) * 100 .
Where :
Dr = Drunkness ( measured in square feet of alcohol per liver ounce )
L = listerine ( measured in gallons )
w = body weight
ms = muscle mass
For the average twelve year old boy it should take 6.25 gallons of listerine to reach relative intoxication .
You may want to consider something a little more nutritious , like huffing paint or over indulging on cold pills .
Best of luck to you .
The closing of New York ’s historic Oscar Wilde bookstore will leave Toronto ’s Glad Day as the oldest gay and lesbian bookstore in North America and possibly the world .
The NY store , which opened in 1967 , will close on Sun , Mar 29 .
Owner Kim Brinster told the New York Times that the closure was due to economic problems and declining sales .
“ People are hemorrhaging , and we ’re no exception , ” she said .
Brinster said that the store is closing despite the fact that the rent had stayed reasonable .
Oscar Wilde paid $ 3,000 a month in rent , which she said was already below market value .
“ Even if we were rent - free , it would n’t be enough for us to cover the bills we have , ” she said .
“ This is one instance in New York where it ’s not a case of the landlord gouging the tenant .
Our landlord has always been remarkable with us . ”
Glad Day opened in 1970 and has been in its location at 598 Yonge St for 27 years .
The store has been hit by the recession , admits manager Prodan Nedev , but is still attracting regular customers .
“ We ’re having difficulties like everyone else with the latest economic thing , ” he says , “ but we ’re still confident with the number of customers we ’re getting .
We ’re not giving up . ”
Nedev says Glad Day still draws those looking for a store specializing in queer literature .
“ Even though the need for this sort of niche gay and lesbian bookstore is not quite as important as it was and we ’re not the only source for this material , people still like to come to us .
We still have a lot of selection you wo n’t find anywhere else . ”
Jearld Moldenhauer , who founded Glad Day and sold it in 1991 , says gay bookstores fill a need the chains wo n’t .
“ Their commitment is just to the dollar , ” he says .
“ Anything marginal , esoteric is not going to find a place on their shelves .
Let ’s take a book on gay Muslims , you ’re not going to find it on their shelves . ”
Nedev says Glad Day tries to compensate for the competition by selling older works through the internet and by hosting appearances by queer authors .
Nedev says the store made the right decision in not moving to Church St when This Ain’t the Rosedale Library decamped to Kensington Market last year .
“ If we had moved to Church St we would be gone by now , ” he says .
“ Rents on Church St are so expensive and the audience is so limited .
We ’re glad we stayed on Yonge St . ”
Nedev says he was sorry to hear about the closure of Oscar Wilde .
“ It ’s sad , ” he says .
“ It ’s difficult for everybody , but it would be sad not to have places like this .
It just brings more variety to the gay and lesbian community . ”
Moldenhauer says Glad Day provides a haven .
“ Our customers always consisted of a huge number of what you might call marginal people , ” he says .
“ Glad Day gave them a sense of belonging .
A bookstore should be a basic institution in a gay community . ”
For Moldenhauer Glad Day began when he realized that the new gay literature that was emerging after Stonewall in 1969 was n’t available in Canada .
“ You would n’t see the books in Candian bookstores , even the most progressive ones , many of which were owned by people I knew were gay , ” he says .
“ You had this situation where this exciting new material was coming out and it was unavailable .
I had this idea of starting a book service .
It seemed to be a useful thing to do . ”
Moldenhauer says he discovered publishers would let him set up accounts and order books without spending a lot of money .
“ I was able to order some of what I considered to be classics , ” he says .
“ I would carry them around in a backpack to the meetings . ”
Moldenhauer ’s apartment in the Annex became the home of Glad Day , also doubling as the office of The Body Politic , the groundbreaking gay paper that was Xtra ’s predecessor .
The arrangement continued when he and others moved into a house in Kensington Market .
“ There was an unheated shed in back which became Glad Day Bookshop and the Body Politic office , ” he says .
“ During the day it operated basically as a bookstore .
During the night it was the Body Politic office . ”
In 1972 Body Politic collective member Gerald Hannon — currently a board member of Pink Triangle Press , which publishes Xtra — published an article called “ Of Men and Little Boys ” in The Body Politic .
The article sparked an uproar , although the paper was n’t prosecuted until Hannon ’s 1977 article “ Men Loving Boys Loving Men . ”
But Moldenhauer says the controversy was enough to cost them their Kensington home .
“ Our gay landlords threw us out , ” he says .
“ The heat was too much . ”
Moldenhauer and others bought a home in Cabbagetown and transferred The Body Politic and Glad Day there .
After a reluctant split from The Body Politic , Moldenhauer says he decided to focus on Glad Day .
“ I did n’t see myself as a businessman , ” he says .
“ I saw myself as a radical but I made the decision to take myself seriously as a gay bookseller and to move Glad Day out of my house . ”
The bookstore moved to a location on Yonge near the Toronto Reference Library and Moldenhauer says it began attracting attention .
“ Glad Day sold books in Chinese , French , German , Spanish , Portuguese , ” he says .
“ It sold enough because it was a country of immigrants .
Quentin Crisp was there , John Gielgud was there a few times , Edward Albee dropped in . ”
Moldenhauer says that ’s also when Canada Customs started paying attention to the store ’s content , beginning an ongoing battle for Glad Day and other Canadian gay bookstores that continues to this day .
After the move to the current Yonge St location in 1981 Customs cracked down harder .
In 1986 Customs seized copies of The Joy of Gay Sex , a battle that would eventually culminate in a court victory for Glad Day .
“ They upped the ante , ” says Moldenhauer .
“ They hated us for daring to fight back . ”
Moldenhauer sold the Toronto store in 1981 , concentrating on a Glad Day Bookshop he had opened in Boston in 1979 , which closed in 2000 due to high rent .
“ In America , with the First Amendment , I was allowed to realize my potential as a bookseller , ” he says .
The role of a gay bookstore has changed over the years , says Moldenhauer .
“ The bookstores played a different role in the beginning , ” he says .
“ There were no gay community centres .
For the first 15 or 20 years the phone at Glad Day never stopped ringing and it would usually be people looking for community information .
“ Now this society does n’t value institutions like bookstores .
In North America it ’s a dog - eat - dog world . ”
Toronto should take a lesson from the European attitude toward bookstores , Moldenhauer says .
There gay bookstores flourish , he says .
“ If you go to any major European capital there ’ll be a bookstore in every neighbourhood , ” he says .
“ I believe that on the municipal level there ’s a lot of thought given to the quality of life of a neighbourhood .
“ Toronto should wake up and realize what sort of businesses would enrich the life of a neighbourhood . ”

Just about all the Village teevee bobbleheads -- especially the Foxheads -- have been trying to find ways to shuffle the blame for the economic disaster now upon us onto the man Americans hired to fix the problem : Barack Obama .
It seemed like everywhere you turned a couple of weeks ago , we were hearing about the " Obama Bear Market . "
Mind you , they were positively gleeful about it ; after all , they know their own future success hinges on Barack Obama 's failure .
And it worked for a little while : the mau - mauing over Obama 's recovery plan certainly did n't help the market .
But now that we 're at over 8,000 again ?
Crickets .
That 's all we hear .
So now they 're crying " socialism " -- or is it " fascism " ? -- and hysterically warning against One World Government .
I think we can all see the direction this is heading , and it 's not a healthy one .
The public sees it too : A Washington
Post poll reveals some unpleasant truths for the right - wing pundits who pat themselves on the backs for keeping the flock of True Believers who plump up their ratings , these masters of the media who wield the power to alter public opinion .
Because it ai n't working anymore .
The rest of the world is gradually abandoning them :
Media Matters has more :
The Washington Post / ABC News poll , released on March 31 , asked respondents who they thought " deserve[d ] " the most " blame " for " the country 's economic situation . "
Results for who deserved a " great deal " or " good amount " of blame are as follows : * 80 percent said banks and other financial institutions * 80 percent said large business corporations * 72 percent said consumers * 70 percent said the Bush administration * 26 percent said the Obama administration
They also observe :
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Private equity company Blackstone Group LP BX.N CEO Stephen Schwarzman said on Tuesday that up to 45 percent of the world 's wealth has been destroyed by the global credit crisis .
Stephen A. Schwarzman , Chairman , CEO and Co-Founder of the Blackstone Group , attends a conference on Sovereign Wealth Funds at the Asia Society in New York April 14 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton
“ Between 40 and 45 percent of the world ’s wealth has been destroyed in little less than a year and a half , ” Schwarzman told an audience at the Japan Society .
“ This is absolutely unprecedented in our lifetime . ”
But the U.S. government is committed to the preservation of financial institutions , he said , and will do whatever it takes to restart the economy .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner plans to unfreeze credit markets through a new program that will combine public and private capital in a fund that would buy bank toxic assets of up to $ 1 trillion .
“ In all likelihood , that will have the private sector buy troubled assets to clean the banks out in terms of providing leverage ... so that we can get more money back into the banking system , ” Schwarzman said .
He expects the private sector to end up making “ some good money doing that , ” but added there were complex issues on how to price toxic assets .
He put part of the blame for the financial crisis to credit rating agencies .
“ What ’s pretty clear is that , if you were looking for one culprit out of the many , many , many culprits , you have to point your finger at the rating agencies , ” he said .
Rating companies have been the focus of intense criticism for their role in granting top “ AAA ” ratings for complex bonds that later plummeted in value , resulting in subsequent rating cuts , in many cases to junk status .
“ Once you bought into ... the Triple A paper and it turned out to be paper that was in many situations going to end up defaulting , then you really had the makings of a global problem , ” he said .
Schwarzman said problems were then exacerbated by mark - to- market accounting rules .
Those rules ask banks and other financial institutions to price assets at a value related to how they would be sold in the open market .
Blackstone reported a quarterly loss in February after writing down the value of its portfolio and eliminated its fourth - quarter dividend .
Asked where was a good place to invest , Schwarzman said it made sense to buy cyclical names , which are less exposed to the economic cycles .
He said investors also may find value in debt products , including “ senior layers of certain securitizations , ” where investors can see 15 percent to 20 percent returns , he said .
Geographically , he said there were “ pockets of strength ” in China , which is committed to getting to an 8 percent growth level , and in India , where the economy is slowing but banks are in good shape .
This is a rebuttal to a recent article by DigitalBattle entitled : Top 10 reasons the PS3 is failing
While I really disdain giving this site the traffic , it ’s not a bad read if you have a good sense of humor .
For a moment I thought our beloved friends at the DigitalBattle had an issue with their RSS feed .
They did a blast - from - the - past editorial list that was using data from quite some time ago .
Evidently they have been living in a cave for the past two years and have not been updated on some of the the successes PS3 has seen in that time .
For the sake of being comprehensive I will respond to this one line item at a time .
A few of the line items were very similar so this list is really a top six and not a top ten .
10 : Too Two many confusing SKUs
At this point in time , Sony only has two standard SKUs available via most retail channels .
The 80 GB Edition and the 160GB Uncharted Edition .
I have to assume the author ca n’t count to two .
Furthermore , none of the PS3 SKUs are gimped , each one comes with at least an 80 GB hard drive and WiFi.
Xbox 360 on the other hand has three SKUs .
One of which does n’t have a hard drive , and was clearly manufactured to reach a price point and not gamer ’s expectations .
As far as the SKUs being confusing there are far more inconsistencies in the history of the Xbox 360 SKUs then there are in the history of PS3 SKUs .
Does your Xbox have HDMI , how about a hard drive ?
My PS3 does , they all do .
9 : Controller SNAFU
It is 2009 , we are still hearing about the boomerang controller from E3 2005 ?
How does a prototype controller design that never went into mass production have anything to do with the success or failure of an entire platform ?
When the PS3 was released it came packed with the more familiar shaped SixAxis .
While this did lack the rumble features , it did add motion support .
The SixAxis motion support was not as robust as a WiiMote , there are many games that use the SixAxis features lightly and they pull it off quite well .
Early PS3 games ( 2006 , early 2007 ) tried to rely to heavily on the technology for user input .
After the Immersion lawsuit was settled in 2007 , Sony released the DualShock 3 .
8 : Sony arrogance
Sony ’s arrogance pretty much ended when Ken Kutaragi left Sony in 2007 .
Love him or hate him , he is the father of PlayStation .
The same console that brought video games out of the back of CES and helped to create E3 .
Arrogance alone will not cause your products to fail .
Steve Jobs are great examples of this ; everything you do you are locked into Apple .
Although Sony has not completely opened up the PS3 , the platform does have many features that provide PS3 customers with choice outside of the Sony brand .
The Xbox 360 , by design , requires that any significant upgrades use Microsoft parts , which are limited in options .
Blu - Ray is hands down the best visual and audio experience you can have in your home .
The fact is , if you ca n’t see the difference between Blu - Ray and a DVD , then you may need to consider getting an HDTV .
Sony saw and seized the opportunity to launch a new format to satisfy both needs .
True next gen gaming requires additional storage to deliver that experience .
John Carmack at ID Software is on record with his concerns with the relatively tiny storage afforded on the Xbox 360 .
Blu - Ray was a huge risk for Sony , but they proved they had the moxie to pull it off .
What do you do with an HD - DVD attachment that goes for $ 40 on ebay ?
7 : A developer ’s bag of hurt
Most of your developer bitch fest about the PS3 was when the hardware was still very new .
The thing was a beast .
Surprisingly , most of the louder ( and fatter ) developers out there were using the Xbox 360 as their primary development platform .
Criterion , for example , started development on the PS3 then ported to 360 .
The result was a multiplatform game that looks great on both systems and no fanbait developer comments for us to chew on .
Valve is already eating crow ; Sony ’s PS3 development platform has come leaps and bounds from where it was in its infancy .
They have a huge amount of development talent that shares information on how to tame the beast .
This information often makes its way into the development platform in some form or another .
I have to categorically reject that making a platform easy to code for is some kind of shangri-la of the ultimate gaming experience .
Furthermore if it ’s true , everyone should already own a PS3 because LittleBigPlanet requires NO programming skills and you can create games with literally no budget . 😉
6 : ( Very ) Expensive manufacturing costs
Coincides with …
2 : Still the most expensive console
Cutting–edge components carry a price tag .
As a hard core gamer , I want my console of choice to include high quality cutting - edge technology .
I prefer the former strategy over the use of nearly off - the - shelf components , throwing it together in a manufacturing plant that is the lowest bidder , and dealing with any hardware issues in “ software updates ” .
The worst thing about the Xbox strategy is , in the end , the gamers pay with a beautiful red ring .
The PS1 and PS2 have proven Sony is committed to a 10 - year lifespan for each console .
The PS3 , like the PS2 , is a console that will last beyond its generation .
Is the PS3 the most expensive console or is it the best value ?
It was n’t that long ago that Blu - Ray players were more expensive then PS3s .
If you have a Hi Def television , Blu - Ray is the clear choice for your disc based movie viewing .
While streams and upscaling are convenient features it ’s often no match for the fidelity of Blu - Ray , and few selections offer true digital surround sound .
Anyone who purchases a PS3 can take it out of the box and log into the PlayStation Network completely unhindered by restrictions and free of charge .
I can use virtually any USB device with the system which also has a flash - compatible web browser to boot .
5 : Still no strong game library
Coincides with …
4 : Weak Ports
Coincides with …
3 : “ Killer - apps ” : too few , too late
Coincides with …
1 : Loss of exclusive titles
Over the past year and a half the PS3 game library has been on par , if not better , than the Xbox 360’s .
Many of the weak ports were mostly Pre-2008 and even more were pre-2007 .
Some have even received patches to correct the inadequacies .
Whatever exclusives
Sony has lost or were perceived to have lost , they have more then made up for with first party development .
In my opinion , the PS3 was a killer app out of the box .
What it lacks in number of game titles it makes up for in quality .
If you browse MetaCritic , you will find the average review score for PS3 games is higher than the average score for Xbox 360 or the dismally - scored Wii .
That includes all the so - called weak ports .
Which just goes to show how strong their first party library is .
At the end of the day , if you have a decent PC and a PS3 , there is no reason why you wo n’t be able to play 95 % of the games out there in some form or another .
I am getting ahead of myself there , as that is for another story .
Liberia , Costa Rica
Sailing down Costa Rica ’s Tempisque River on an eco -tour , I watched a crocodile devour a brown bass with one gulp .
It took only a few seconds .
The croc ’s head emerged from the muddy waters near the bank with the footlong fish writhing in its jaws .
He crunched it a couple of times with razor - sharp teeth and then , with just the slightest flip of his snout , swallowed the fish whole .
Never saw that before .
These days , visitors can still see amazing biodiversity all over Costa Rica  more than 25 percent of the country is protected area  thanks to a unique system it set up to preserve its cornucopia of plants and animals .
Many countries could learn a lot from this system .
More than any nation I ’ve ever visited , Costa Rica is insisting that economic growth and environmentalism work together .
It has created a holistic strategy to think about growth , one that demands that everything gets counted .
So if a chemical factory sells tons of fertilizer but pollutes a river  or a farm sells bananas but destroys a carbon - absorbing and species - preserving forest  this is not honest growth .
You have to pay for using nature .
It is called “ payment for environmental services ”  nobody gets to treat climate , water , coral , fish and forests as free anymore .
The process began in the 1990s when Costa Rica , which sits at the intersection of two continents and two oceans , came to fully appreciate its incredible bounty of biodiversity  and that its economic future lay in protecting it .
So it did something no country has ever done :
It put energy , environment , mines and water all under one minister .
The Beginning
I was raised in the Catholic tradition .
More specifically the Polish Catholic tradition .
That means everyone was nucking futs over Pope John Paul II .
We ate paczki ( PAUNCH - kee ) on fat Tuesday ( the last day before the start of Lent , 40 days before Easter ) .
We gave up things for Lent to make us better people .
We kicked off Lent by putting ashes on our foreheads to signify that we are sinners .
We did n’t eat meat on Fridays .
We attended midnight mass on Christmas eve and attended the Easter Vigil .
For those who are not in the know , the Easter Vigil is like 3 hours long and starts with a bonfire .
Afterwards , we would get together all 500 relatives and eat kielbasa and sauerkraut until it came out our ears while great uncle Leo would play polkas on the concertina .
The uncles would drink and play cards and the aunts would get together and gossip and get into everyones business .
This was also the time for the ‘ outsiders ’ ( our significant others ) to undergo the modern Inquisition by the Aunts .
We had a good time .
The Transition
I ended up moving from the Midwest to the Western United States with my wife for work .
I ’m an engineer by trade so I work with a bunch of highly educated professionals .
The first step on the road to atheism for me was to that of skepticism .
I have to attribute this huge turning point in my life to one man who asked me .
“ Do you believe that aliens have visited Earth ? ” Like any good geek , I answered with an enthusiastic , “ Yes ! Absolutely ” .
Then I went on to quote all the Roswell evidence that is being suppressed by the government .
He responded with , “ Yes , like so many other people that we work with .
I ’m surprised that so many people can believe without any evidence .
You know its OK to be skeptical . ”
That was it .
Just a little thing .
It ’s OK to be skeptical .
I Was Setup !
As our relationship grew we had many more discussions about the non-existent .
A lot of people believe in ghosts , but again , there is no concrete evidence for ghosts .
We also discussed religion .
He grew up in a fundamentalist Christian home , the kind where the Holy Spirit overcomes you and you shout stuff out in church .
But the stuff you shout is all in the style of the King James version of the bible .
His stance is that he is agnostic .
Which is the politically correct way of saying he leaves open the possibility of religion but has n’t seen any evidence to support it and does n’t want to offend you .
Anyway , we started talking about books he had read and he recommended The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins .
I was being setup .
We talked about ‘ The Blind Watchmaker ’ in respect to evolution and how it destroys any argument for the need for creationism .
For those not familiar with Richard Dawkins he is an evolutionary biologist , atheist , and outspoken critic of religion .
In the book about evolution Dawkins takes well placed shots at religion .
My friend was trying to convert me to agnosticism through evolution biology .
Deciding for Myself
With my newfound skepticism a few things changed .
First off , my belief in aliens that visited the Earth went away .
I firmly believe that life exists on other planets and that we will never see it because the distances are so vast .
The basement and dark places got a lot less unnerving because there is no possibility of ghosts .
By what physical mechanism would they travel through ?
The ether ?
Scary movies lost a lot of potency .
So I asked myself why am I Catholic ?
Well , that was due to brainwashing I received since I was a baby starting with my baptism .
I do n’t blame my folks , they were just doing what they thought was best for me .
Why were they religious ?
Because their parents were and raised them that way .
That tradition goes back a really long way .
Most people do not choose their religion , it chooses them through their parents .
I finally , determined that religion was just silly .
But do you how hard it is to kick off years of dogma that was taught to you as fact since before you could speak ?
Do you know what I had a hard time with ?
The Blasphemy Challenge .
I had to do it the first time in private .
It took me fives minutes to let it all go .
It seems silly and weird now , but back then it took a lot of rational thought to overcome my upbringing .
I accepted the challenge .
Coming Out
The first person I had to talk to first was my wife .
She was raised in the Polish Catholic tradition too .
She had an even larger family and they were more devout Catholics than mine were .
My wife and I had n’t missed a mass since we were married .
We attended the Catholic mass on the cruise ship on our honeymoon .
We stopped in York , Nebraska on our way moving out west to attend mass .
We parked our car full of possessions and walked inside the church a half hour late .
You get the point .
Once we started talking , it turns out my wife was very conflicted too .
I made a deal with my wife which I stick to today , I will always go to church with her if she wants to go .
I would not be doing it for god , I would be doing it for her .
We have n’t gone in a very long time now .
You know what is great ?
Sleeping in on Sunday mornings or doing something like going for a hike instead of sitting in church and wasting half your day .
I was getting pretty comfortable in my point of view of being an atheist .
But we had n’t told our family .
Then something happened .
I updated my myspace page from Catholic to Atheist .
It turns out people actually read those things .
My myspace page was listed in my e-mail signature and my mom read it .
She was pissed !
She called me up on the phone and bitched me out .
It was bad .
I stayed calm and responded to her insults and barbs .
She said I was repulsive like atheist Hitler and Stalin .
Additionally , she threatened to call the police and get them to take my children away .
Next , my brother was on the line .
At one point he was considering to be a deacon .
He is still very active in the church .
He is convinced that you cannot love without Jesus in your heart .
It turns out he is wrong .
So everyone knows now and they do not appreciate it .
They try not to talk about it , but my mom brings it up on occasion .
A few years later I was having a conversation about Infidel ( read my review ) with my mom .
I bought her the book for Christmas .
In the book Ayaan gives up her Islamic faith .
Her father writes her a very nasty letter denouncing her .
It was pretty painful to read .
My mom could not believe that a father would treat his daughter in such a way .
I was thinking , “ Do you remember calling me Atheist Hitler and threatening to take away my kids ? ”
Instead , I just said , “ Yes , I can not believe a parent would treat their child that way . ”
What is it like now
Those who are open to other points of view might ask , what is like now that you are an atheist ?
To be honest , not too much has changed .
I still love my family and am a good citizen .
I feel the same .
Life goes on .
But let me tell you a few things that have changed .
First , I enjoy life more .
I am more open to new experiences because I know this is the only life I get and variety is the spice of life .
Second , I try to take better care of myself because I want to stretch this life out as long as possible .
I ’m still overweight , but I managed to get a long bike ride in and go for a run this weekend .
Specifically , I was running when I would normally have been at church .
Next , I find it difficult to write in sympathy cards .
Instead of the generic Christian “ I ’ll pray for you ” response , you need to think of something real to say .
Finally , the biggest change is that religious people really bug me .
I attended mass while my sister - in - law was in town as a favor to my wife .
The priest sounded bat shit crazy .
All the religious texts register as pure utter nonsense .
People tend to be blissfully unaware that their over the top Jesus loves you crap is really annoying .
Parenting
I am a parent now with my daughter attending preschool where they say the pledge of allegiance .
All I can say is , fuck the Knights of Columbus and their anti communist crusade for putting me in the position that I have to teach my daughter to either abstain or not say the words under god in the pledge .
She is only 4 for Christs sake .
The pre 1951 version was just fine when we were ‘ one nation indivisible ’ .
Now 15 % of the population says we do n’t agree with you .
Wheew … I kind of went on a tangent there .
The challenges of being an atheist parent mostly revolve around the holidays .
Yes , we are still celebrating Christmas and Easter .
Want to know why ?
Because kids love to open presents and be with their parents and color eggs and eat candy .
That is good enough for me .
It is important to form your own traditions .
And no , we are not teaching that Santa Claus is real .
He is only in books and on TV .
Some traditions do die hard , I could go for some polka , paczki , and kielbasa .
Conclusion
I actually have a lot to say on this subject , but I doubt anyone has even read this far .
Do n’t waste your time praying for me , life is short , go enjoy it .
Congratulations to those folks who turned out to protest against Arab and Islamic Apartheid and for the State of Israel in Cambridge yesterday .
Oh sure , there were some deluded and unfortunate folks who had their regions mixed up .
These fascist antisemites were ... get this ... actually demonstrating on behalf of the Arab Apartheid dictatorships in favor of their war to destroy the region 's only liberal state .
In public !
They could n't actually have been from Cambridge ... Cambridge , MA ?
Cambridge is a bastion of the liberal left or so I 've heard .
They 'd never do that !
Well , maybe it was just a few cast offs from the illiberal left ( or is that ill - liberal ? ) .
There was much mixing of demonstrators and signage .
Hillel Stavis writes in :
The Islamic Republic of Harvard Square Ho hum , yet another Israel - hating Harvard Square demonstration .
But , compared with the outright anti-Semitic horrors going on in Berkeley , Florida and other places , this one was rather tame .
Central casting supplied the usual suspects : Graying Unitarians and Quakers , who 've been in the closet for 30 years finally with the opportunity to parade their Jew hatred , the odd Arab student with a bullhorn and red kheffiyeh ( gotta be red , the color of revenge ) and , of course , the legions of putative Jews sporting signs that invariably begin with " Another Jew who ( fill in the rest yourself ) : Opposes the Occupation , Deplores Israeli Atrocities ... " but of course , WE know what they really mean : " I 'm another ( born by accident ) Jew , who really wants to be a COW ( Citizen of the World ) and who has nothing to do with other Jews ( I spend all my time in UU churches or at the American Friends Service Committee ) .
The only time I identify myself as a Jew occurs when the opportunity arises to criticize Israel .
And , of course I am rewarded handsomely with new friends and tasty middle eastern cuisine from the Arab and leftist camps .
Arabs especially treasure the vitriol with which I demonize my " fellow Jews . "
The Soviet Union may have sunk beneath the waves , but I have a new messiah now -- radical Islam -- to replace my need for power and belonging . "
Take Eva Moseley , a " Holocaust survivor " ( she and all her well - heeled family escaped Vienna in 1939 ) where , according to her , she never identified herself as Jewish , but now parades her dubious heritage around whenever it 's convenient to bash Israel .
Aside from celebrating her granddaughter 's conversion to Islam ( I kid you not ) , she got caught emailing a comrade boasting of her use of " Holocaust shtick " during anti-Israel protests .
We 're glad she escaped the Nazi hordes , but we 're left to wonder how stricken she would be were the Hamas extermination agenda to take its course .
In spite of the hate - Israel crowd 's view of places like Harvard Square as their own private fiefdom , there were plenty of pro-Israel demonstrators with signs depicting -- the unmentionable -- Hamas ( none of the anti-Israel protestors ever mention Hamas ; they 'd rather parade around with staged photos of 6 year old Arabs holding their teddy bears in front of monstrous Jewish tanks ) .
You see , they say , all Palestinians are innocent , Hamas does n't exist -- except when they grudgingly admit that it won a democratic election ( you can snigger now ) , and 1300 civilians were killed in the recent Gaza action ( continue sniggering ) .
And their proof of Jewish perfidy ?
Just look at the disproportionate numbers of dead !
You see , they give Hamas points for inaccuracy !
Using their logic , the U.S. should have lost the Battle of the Bulge , Okinawa and Iwo Jima ( disproportionately more Germans and Japanese died in those crucial battles ) .
As for the Big Lie of Apartheid , there was plenty of literature documenting religious , ethnic , and gender apartheid in every Arab and Muslim country -- to the chagrin of the hate Israel crowd .
Of course , when presented with the incontrovertible evidence of murdered gays in Iran , butchered Copts in Egypt and the ethnic cleansing of Jews from every Arab country , that crowd pulls the Groucho line : " Are you going to believe me -- or your lying eyes ? "
Glancing down the line of haters , I was reminded of the bar scene from Total Recall : A community of angry mutants confined in a dead end place with dead end ideas .
Another person who was there writes :
Well , that was uninteresting experience .
There were a lot of people taking pictures ...
A number of people , mostly young , stopped to talk to us and were very supportive .
One woman said she was from South Africa and that she knows what apartheid is and these people maligning Israel are crazy .
There were a couple kids wide eyed from UConn visiting Harvard for a conference who just could not believe what they were seeing and asked us if that 's a common occurrence at Harvard Square .
Tons of people took our fliers in front of Jewish Voice for Peacers , which drove the anti-Israel protesters nuts .
They called the police on us , too ... ... I would think it was confusing to passer - bye whos signs were for what , but it really pissed off the JVPers since we had such good signs .
There was one older Russian guy passing by who started arguing with me before he realized we were on the same side .
They had a megaphone ( unfortunately our side still does not ) , but they seemed to use it half - heartedly ...
Another writes :
Just as important as numbers was the joy and confidence we displayed taking our message to the streets .
Many old and new friends showed the kind of high spirits that comes from fighting for the right .
The opposition ( mostly the usual suspects ) , in contrast , seemed genuinely disturbed that someone dared to muscle in on " their " territory ( Harvard Square ) to challenge their exclusive use ( mis-use , actually ) of " apartheid " terminology .
If you 'll forgive me being catty for a moment , the older members of the " Israel is Wrong About Everything " club are not aging particularly well .
And newer recruits ( mostly students ) seemed like deers in headlights when confronted with simple facts .
( My favorite moment came when a kid who did n't know what the term " refusenik " meant nevertheless insisted that Israel encouraged the Soviet Union to expel its Jews !
- what a yutz . )
Perhaps this is why they tried so many times to get the cops to chase us away ( unsuccessfully ) ...

Here 's a must - read piece by a guy who really knows what 's going on in Israel : Ishmael Khaldi :
Lost in the blur of slogans
For those who have n't heard , the first week in March has been designated as Israel Apartheid Week by activists who are either ill intentioned or misinformed .
On American campuses , organizing committees are planning happenings to once again castigate Israel as the lone responsible party for all that maligns the Middle East .
Last year , at UC Berkeley , I had the opportunity to " dialogue " with some of the organizers of these events .
My perspective is unique , both as the vice consul for Israel in San Francisco , and as a Bedouin and the highest - ranking Muslim representing the Israel in the United States .
I was born into a Bedouin tribe in Northern Israel , one of 11 children , and began life as shepherd living in our family tent .
I went on to serve in the Israeli border police , and later earned a master 's degree in political science from Tel Aviv University before joining the Israel Foreign Ministry .
I am a proud Israeli - along with many other non-Jewish Israelis such as Druze , Bahai , Bedouin , Christians and Muslims , who live in one of the most culturally diversified societies and the only true democracy in the Middle East .
Like America , Israeli society is far from perfect , but let us deals honestly .
By any yardstick you choose - educational opportunity , economic development , women and gay 's rights , freedom of speech and assembly , legislative representation - Israel 's minorities fare far better than any other country in the Middle East ...
Read the rest , and understand how the people who want to dismantle the Middle East 's only liberal state are not only lying , but they are pushing peace farther and farther away by supporting the region 's worst forces .

And argument for using Git ... from Debian
http://upsilon.cc/~zack/stuff/vcs-usage/
Out of Debian packages which self - identify as using a version control system , git is the most popular distributed source control system .
Caveats apply of course , but this is interesting in that that preference is somewhat organic in nature , as Debian offers its package maintainers a choice as to which vcs to use .
SVN is still the most popular overall , and that 's not surprising since the bulk of the existing packages were using svn before the dvcs options where available .
This will be an interesting graph to watch over the next 6 months or so .
I wonder if we see a similar sort of preference in our fedorahosted .org services split .
Fedorahosted offers git , bzr , hg and svn as service offerings and projects choose which service they want to use .
On a project count basis at fedorahosted is git showing up as strongly as an overall preference to other dcvs as Debian 's packaging tags are showing there ?
Update :
Here 's the fedorahosted .org breakdown from jeremy
242 git repos , 71 svn , 33 hg and 6 bzr
and 1 mtn repo according to " chops " mcgrath
So at fedorahosted where all the upstream project maintainers get to choose which dvcs they want with no penalty as to service integration ( as far as I am aware ) git is way way out in front of the other dvcs .
Fedora as a project does n't have a dog in the race as to which dcvs is better .. yet .
We will be dragged into moving to a dvcs for our distribution packaging at some point ..its pretty much unavoidable ... but not yet .
At fedorahosted , individual project leads are independently choosing which dvcs to use and most are choosing git .
I think that says something significant about the importance of making sure you have git available as a service option for your online code collaboration service business moving forward .
All arguments for or against the technical superiority for any specific dvcs technology makes for a nice discussion for project developers who need to choose a dvcs service .
But if you are a trying to build a service business around collaborative services can you ignore git in your service offerings and stay competitive ?

We see the fundamentals for solar as still somewhat unstable .
We believe module oversupply is being exacerbated by liberal lending practices among Chinese banks which continue to support many public cell and module plays with ever larger amounts of short - term debt , leading to a disincentive to rationalize industry capacity .
Conversely , in Europe , the financial institutions historically responsible for the bulk of project lending in the renewables space remain focused on fixing their own balance sheets and unable to fund significant amounts for traditional project lending time frames , apart from key projects in Germany .
The Sir Archibald Sinclair was withdrawn by British Railways in May 1966
A steam train that has taken volunteers 30 years to restore has joined the fleet of a heritage railway line in East Sussex .
The Bluebell Railway unveiled the Bulleid ' Battle of Britain ' class steam locomotive called the Sir Archibald Sinclair on Friday .
It was purchased from Woodham 's scrap yard in Barry , South Wales , in October 1979 for £ 7,250 .
The charity said a dedicated band of volunteers had brought it back to life .
The locomotive , No.34059 , was withdrawn by British Railways in May 1966 having run 877,107 miles since being built at the Brighton Works of the Southern Railway in April 1947 .
The Bluebell line was connected to the National Rail network for the first time in half a century earlier this year .
It is part of a £ 4 m project to extend the Bluebell Railway , which currently runs for nine miles from Sheffield Park to Kingscote , to East Grinstead .
Work to extend the line began last year and if fundraising goes to plan it should be completed in 2010 , with steam trains entering East Grinstead over the 10 - arch Imberhorne viaduct .
The Internal Revenue Service last month announced limits on tax penalties , hoping to coax people with secret offshore bank accounts to come in from the cold .
Yet the rules , which may still result in huge penalties , are scaring many back into the shadows .
The new penalty limits have come as the agency continues a crackdown on offshore accounts through a high - profile investigation involving thousands of people with Swiss bank accounts managed by UBS AG .
The goal is to collect taxes on U.S. securities held in the accounts .

As an astronomer , my familiarity with the details of biological evolution are about on par with that of an interested layman ( though being trained scientifically helps with that understanding , adding insight to the process of the scientific endeavor ) .
I 'm familiar with the concepts of descent with modification , genetic mutations , natural pressures for adaptations , and the like .
I 'm less familiar with other aspects , like allele frequencies , how specifically pressures can change adaptations , and what transitional fossils are in the record , but I can probably hold my own against your run -of - the - mill creationist .
That 's why I loved the book Why Evolution is True by biologist Jerry Coyne .
This is a clear , easy - to - understand work that shows you -- with no compromising and no backing down -- that evolution has occurred , the evidence is overwhelming , and that no other explanation for what we see around us makes sense .
He goes through many , many arguments about this : how we do see adaptation to changing environments , how the DNA records support the change in the genome of life with time and environment , how fossils support evolutionary change .
Moreover , he shows that the scientific theory of evolution by natural ( and in some cases , sexual ) selection makes clear predictions which are borne out by observations .
And on top of that he shows why these conclusions make no sense at all if you think there is some Creator that made us the way we are out of thin air ( or dust , I suppose ) .
I was particularly struck by the concept of geographic isolation and how that affects evolution ( perhaps because I spent more than a week last year touring the Galapagos Islands ) .
Species isolated on islands adapt genetically and morphologically ( or vice - versa ) to the environment , and you can see how there are changes in those species as they radiate out to other nearby islands .
We only see species on those islands that come from nearby land masses , as you 'd expect from natural methods of dispersion over long time periods ( but not what you 'd expect for a Creator to simply pop life into existence ) .
And all of this fits in with what geologists see by way of plate tectonics and continental drift .
Creationists love to try to pick apart evolution , looking at minor details in isolation and saying it does n't make sense .
But they 're wrong : evolution is a beautiful tapestry , a complex fabric of countless threads woven together into a grand picture of life on Earth .
And it all holds together .
I strongly recommend this book to anyone with even a passing interest in evolution , or the manufactured controversy of creationism .
Coyne 's work is complete and convincing , slamming the door firmly closed on young - Earth creationism .
If you have to deal with creationists in your life , this book is something you should keep very handy .
Bonus : my friend Joel Parker interviewed Coyne on his radio show How on Earth ( you can get the MP3 through this direct link ) , and another friend D. J. Grothe interviewed Coyne on his podcast Point of Inquiry .
And I 'll leave you with this , Coyne 's perfect summation of the situation ( from pages 222 - 223 of the book ) :
Autism is more often diagnosed in boys Scientists have produced the most compelling evidence to date that genetics play a key role in autism .
They highlighted tiny genetic changes that appear to have a strong impact on the likelihood of developing autism and related conditions .
The changes influence genes which help form and maintain connections between brain cells .
The Nature study highlighted one common genetic variant which , if corrected would cut cases of autism by 15 % .
Previously , other genetic variants have been linked to autism , but they are all relatively rare .
There are going to be many genes involved in causing autism
Dr Hakon Hakonarson
Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia Dr Raynard Kington , of the US National Institutes of Health , which funded the research , said : " These findings establish that genetic factors play a strong role in autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) .
" Detailed analysis of the genes and how they affect brain development is likely to yield better strategies for diagnosing and treating children with autism . "
People with ASD , which include autism and Asperger 's syndrome , have problems with social interaction , poor communication skills and tend to engage in repetitive behaviours .
In the latest studies researchers scanned the human genome for small differences between people who have an ASD , and those who do not .
The largest study , led by the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia , focused on more than 10,000 people .
Sticky cells
It found several genetic variants commonly associated with ASD , all of them pointing two specific genes found on chromosome 5 which control production of proteins which help cells stick to each other , and make nervous connections .
A bead chip used to analyse human DNA en masse
One variant , linked to a gene called CDH10 , was so common - present in over 65 % of cases of autism - that the researchers calculated that fixing it would cut the number of autism cases by 15 % .
They also linked ASD rather less strongly to a group of about 30 genes which produce proteins that play a key role in enabling brain cells to migrate to correct places , and to connect to neighbouring cells .
Other genetic changes pinpointed by the Pennsylvania team occurred in genes involved in a cellular waste system which probably ensures these " adhesion " proteins are kept in working order .
Lead researcher Dr Hakon Hakonarson said the genetics of ASD was likely to be complex .
He said : " Because other autism researchers have made intriguing suggestions that autism arises from abnormal connections among brain cells during early development , it is very compelling to find evidence that mutations in genes involved in brain interconnections increase a child 's risk of autism . "
But he added : " There are going to be many genes involved in causing autism .
" In most cases , it 's likely that each gene contributes a small amount of risk , and interacts with other genes and environmental factors to trigger the onset . "
Similar findings were reported in separate studies published in Annals of Human Genetics and Molecular Psychiatry .
Science ' accelerating ' Professor Simon Baron - Cohen , an autism expert at the University of Cambridge , said 133 genes had now been linked to the condition , and much work was needed to piece together how they interacted with each other and the environment .
He said : " The puzzle is slowly being pieced together , and the science of autism is accelerating in promising ways . "
The National Autistic Society said the exact causes of autism were unknown .
In a statement , the society said : " There is evidence to suggest that genetic factors are responsible for some forms of autism .
" However , the difficulty of establishing gene involvement is compounded by the interaction of genes and by their interaction with environmental factors .
" Various studies over many years have sought to identify candidate genes but so far inconclusively . "

Improved Lithium Ion Battery Technology Could Fast - charge Electric Vehicles , Boost Acceleration
" Beltway " coating on cathode eases ions ' way into crystalline tunnels
A sample of the MIT battery material that could allow quick charging of portable devices .
April 22 , 2009
Lithium iron phosphate ( LFP ) batteries , first discovered about 10 years ago , already store energy needed to run power tools , medical equipment and plug - in hybrid electric vehicles .
LFP batteries are safer , less expensive and more environmentally friendly than most other rechargeable batteries .
But they do have drawbacks , including their slow rate of energy discharge .
That means they can't provide the strong power boost needed for fast acceleration of an electric car , or the quick burst of a metal drill .
Now a new technology , developed with support from the National Science Foundation 's ( NSF ) Division of Materials Research , could speed up the discharge rate of a full LFP battery to only 10 to 20 seconds .
The research took place as part of the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center ( MRSEC ) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) .
Gerbrand Ceder , professor of materials science and engineering at MIT , did some calculations and discovered that the cathode material in LFP batteries should be much faster at charging and discharging .
Ceder enlisted MIT graduate student Byoungwoo Kang to help figure out how to " speed up " an LFP battery 's charge and discharge rate .
Their results were reported in a recent issue of the journal Nature .
Why fast discharge ?
" When you drive your car at 16 kilometers per hour ( 10 miles per hour ) to go faster , you just push the accelerator , " said Kang .
" But if the battery can't discharge power quickly , there is no acceleration .
With this new technology , you can release the power quickly for whatever you need , whether a car or any other application . "
LFP batteries use electrochemical processes to store and release energy .
The battery charges up from some energy source , such as an electrical outlet in a garage .
Then during discharge , while the battery is in use , the stored energy travels in reverse , providing voltage to run the equipment .
The total amount of energy a battery can hold is called energy density -- the higher the density , the more energy it can store .
The power density of a battery is how fast it can supply that energy to the motor or engine that it 's running .
Typically , batteries have a high energy density , but a relatively low power density .
This makes them the opposite of supercapacitors , which can store and discharge power quickly , but do n't hold as much as a battery .
That 's because supercapacitors can only absorb charge - carrying ions on their surface , while battery materials like LFP can store ions inside their bulk .
" With this experiment , we tried to combine two good things : a strong power density and high energy density , " said Kang .
" That means we could use our material as both a battery and a supercapacitor . "
Moving ions
A battery has three parts : a positive cathode , an electrolyte and a negative anode .
" Usually the limitations on the battery come from the cathode , and in this experiment we dealt with just that , " Kang said .
While an LFP battery charges , positive lithium ions flow away from the cathode , pass through the electrolyte , and collect on the anode .
Then during discharge , the ions reverse direction and flow back to the cathode , where they fit themselves into " tunnels , " or spaces inside the crystal structure .
The energy flowing to the motor from the battery ( the electrical discharge rate ) is limited by how fast the lithium ions can fit themselves back into the cathode material .
Speeding on the " beltway "
" The LFP usually moves in only one direction , like a one - way highway , " said Kang .
" The problem is that the highway is fast , but the tunnel is only wide enough for one ion at a time to get in .
So the cars have to wait at the entrance to the highway . "
To speed the ions into the tunnels , the researchers created a special coating on the LFP particles .
The coating is a thin , glassy layer - - only 5 nanometers thick -- on the surface of each particle .
This material allows the lithium ions to travel around more easily .
To create the LFP material , the researchers ground up chemicals with a specific ratio of lithium , iron and phosphorus .
For this experiment , they changed the ratio of the ions somewhat from the ideal ratio for LFP .
Next , they combined the powders and heated them to 600 degrees Celsius ( 1,112 Fahrenheit ) .
As the material cooled , a base of stable lithium iron phosphate crystals formed first , followed by the glassy layer coating their surface .
The process had the advantage that both the crystal base structure and the surface coating formed in the same step .
According to Kang , the surface layer was like adding a beltway that allowed the ions to travel more quickly inside the cathode material .
" With this new , fast lithium conductor , the cars have access from more than one direction into the tunnels , " he said .
" One entrance , one highway - - a lot of entrances , a lot of highways . "
Bringing it to market
The faster movement of the ions into the crystalline structure is reversible , Kang said , so the new technology works for both fast discharge and fast recharge .
" For the next step , we have to look at how to provide the high power you would need to recharge the battery material this fast , " he said .
A standard electrical outlet can't provide that much energy that quickly , according to Kang , so it would take a network of high - power charging stations , similar to gas stations , to make the new technology practical for plug - in electric vehicles .
Meanwhile , research continues in the lab .
" For this experiment , we used a lot of carbon in the cathode , to assure fast charging , " said Kang .
" But in a real battery , that is not practical because carbon is bulky and the battery would be too large .
We are now trying to reduce the amount of carbon in the electrode to 10 or 15 percent , while keeping the same performance . "

Raser Electric has built an extended - range electric Hummer H3 which will supposedly return 100 MPG when it hits the road .
How did they do it ?
By building a simplified Chevy Volt before GM could .
Advertisement
The vehicle is designed , first and foremost , as a pure electric vehicle , with a 268 HP electric motor hooked directly to the transmission , which is still connected to the all - wheel - drive system .
A stand - alone four - cylinder gasoline engine replaces the previous V6 or V8 and drives a generator making electricity after about 40 miles of driving when the lithium ion batteries are spent .

The Raser Tech electric Hummer H3 can be charged via 120V or 220V electricity via a plug - in port , which is of course hiding behind the fuel filler .
Where exactly you put the fuel , we do n't know .
All of this sounds pretty much like the Volt , does n't it ?
The tall claims will have to be backed by road tests but we 'll just have to wait and see if Raser Tech can out - do the General on this one .
The company plans on unveiling the finished product next weekend at the SAE World Congress in Detroit and we 'll be ready to bring you all the details .

A literary science fiction novel set in the near future in which an old woman , close to death , contemplates her life , has won this year 's Arthur C Clarke award for science fiction .
Ian R MacLeod 's Song of Time takes place near the end of the 21st century , as an aged concert violinist , about to pass into a virtual afterlife , discovers a half - drowned man on a Cornish beach .
Described by the Guardian as " a slow , sensitive first - person account of what it means to be human and vulnerable " , and as a book which " confirms MacLeod as one of the country 's very best literary SF writers " , the book was last night chosen ahead of more classic science fiction fare , from former winner Paul McAuley 's interplanetary space battle The Quiet War , to Alastair Reynolds 's hard SF space opera House of Suns and Sherri S Tepper 's tale of a human child enslaved by aliens , The Margarets .
Anathem , Neal Stephenson 's story of a religious order on a far - future , Earth - like planet , was also shortlisted , alongside Mark Wernham 's debut , Martin Martin 's On the Other Side .
" This was a very strong shortlist and it was a particularly intense and long shortlist meeting this year , " said chair of the judges Paul Billinger .
The final decision was " a very close run thing " for the panel of judges , drawn from the Science Fiction Foundation , the British Science Fiction Association and the website SF Crowsnest , said Billinger .
" What swung it in the end [ for Song of Time ] was the emotion , the feeling from it – and the characterisation . "
MacLeod wins £ 2,009 , and a commemorative engraved bookend .
" The variety and scope across this year 's submissions list shows just how complex it is to even neatly define what constitutes the best of modern science fiction , " said Tom Hunter , award administrator .
" People used to talk in terms of the SF community versus the mainstream , and how one day the geeks would inherit the Earth .
I do n't think that 's going to happen , but maybe something more interesting is , and this is where things like the Clarke award can be a useful barometer for the broader culture . "
MacLeod himself , in an interview with SF Crowsnest , disputed the categorisation of science fiction .
" Categories are for wimps and publishers .
They 're things that real writers should challenge rather than accept , " he told fellow author Stephen Hunt .
" I used to think when I first reached adulthood in the 70s and realised I really did want to be a writer that SF would become something bigger and broader than what it then was .
That writers like Ballard and Silverberg on the genre side and Fowles and Golding on the mainstream side were already producing stuff which would make the old distinctions irrelevant .
That has n't happened .
Or at least not yet .
Fact is , SF got more ghettoised rather than less .
But there do seem to be encouraging signs that the broader genre of fantastic fiction which I believe I work in is getting both more edgy and finding greater of mass appeal . "
Last year 's award was won by Richard Morgan for Black Man.
Margaret Atwood won the inaugural prize in 1987 for The Handmaid 's Tale , and other previous winners include China Miéville , Geoff Ryman and Amitav Ghosh .
Before ending a standoff with pirates by firing three fatally precise shots , U.S. Navy SEAL snipers had passed on multiple opportunities to fire .
The marksmen had moved into position after the White House expanded the authority it had given the world ’s most powerful navy against a ragtag foe holding an American hostage .
They kept their scopes trained on their Somali targets as prospects for a peaceful resolution seemed to shrivel .
But most of all , they waited as a series of seemingly insignificant moves -- from extending the pirates a rope to bringing an injured brigand on - board -- improved their odds of success .
“ Bringing them in closer gave them a smoother ride , ” said a senior U.S. military official , describing internal deliberations on condition of anonymity .
“ Also , if we had to take kinetic action -- as we did in this case -- the shot would have greater potential for success . ”

Even as details about the daring rescue were still emerging , U.S. national security officials were trying to assess whether it might lead to an escalation in violent tactics along the Somali coast , and were warning that a surge in pirate activity would be difficult to bring under control .
President Obama , in his first public remarks on the rescue , pledged Monday to mount a sustained campaign against the escalating attacks on ships off Somalia .
“ I want to be very clear that we are resolved to halt the rise of [ piracy ] in that region , ” Obama said .
“ We have to continue to be prepared to confront them when they arise .
And we have to ensure that those who commit acts of piracy are held accountable for their crimes . ”
Piracy , with the prospect of million - dollar ransoms , has spawned an industry on the Somali coast and led to the creation of specialized teams , some expert at ship assaults and others that focus on negotiation .

“ There ’s a level of organization to these pirates , ” said a senior U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue .
“ We ’ve even seen some coordination among different groups . ”
Obama was briefed on the crisis at least 18 times , including a National Security Council session on “ hostage contingencies ” just hours before the snipers fired their shots .
But the crisis seems to have crystallized for the administration on Friday , after the White House got word that Capt .
Richard Phillips had tried to escape from his captors .
The escape attempt had presented an early rescue opportunity for the military .
But the Navy had no warning that Phillips was going to attempt to flee .
Although a military special operations team had been mobilized , it had not yet arrived , and the Navy had no way to capitalize on Phillips ’ gumption .
Instead , the incident underscored the danger Phillips was in as the pirates fired their AK - 47s at him as he tried to swim away , then beat him after dragging him back aboard the boat .

Hours later , senior NSC officials met in the White House Situation Room to draft a series of options to deliver to Obama .
Later that night , Obama appears to have issued his first order authorizing the use of lethal force .
But military officials said the White House still hoped for a nonviolent end to the standoff .
“ The president wanted the opportunity to say , ‘ Have we tried everything to make this reach a peaceful conclusion ? ’ ” said the senior military official .
“ He wanted to be a check valve so that everybody was looking at all options . ”
The next morning , the authority to use lethal force was expanded for what the White House described as an “ additional set of U.S. forces , ” an apparent reference to the arrival of the SEALs off the Somali coast .

The first small contingent of SEALs parachuted into the waters around the destroyer Bainbridge at 5:10 a.m. on Saturday .
A larger contingent of SEALs arrived at 6:30 p.m .
Once there , the SEALs began to position themselves and readied small , Zodiac - style inflatable boats to maneuver near the lifeboat that held the captain and pirates .
The military official said the SEAL snipers had multiple opportunities to shoot the pirates .
But the team held off , not believing Phillips was in imminent peril and hoping they could persuade the pirates to give themselves up peacefully .
Military officials had what they thought was a breakthrough Sunday morning .
About 6:40 a.m. , a small boat carrying SEAL team members approached the lifeboat , to check on Phillips and try to talk to the pirates .

The youngest pirate asked the SEALs if he could come aboard the Bainbridge to make a phone call .
The pirate had been stabbed in the hand during the initial assault Wednesday on the Alabama , and the wound had become infected .
The military took the pirate aboard , gave him a clean set of clothes and treated his wound .
Officers hoped that if they treated that pirate well , the others would surrender .
“ Let ’s show these guys we are serious about the fact that if you give yourself up you wo n’t be harmed , ” said the military official , explaining the thinking behind the treatment of the surrendering pirate .
“ It did n’t have the effect we had hoped . ”
The pirate did speak to the others over the radio , urging them to give themselves up .
But the plea failed and military officials believe his surrender may have made the remaining pirates all the more desperate .

As Sunday dragged on , the seas grew rougher and Navy officers offered to tow the lifeboat behind the Bainbridge , telling the pirates that they would move them to calmer waters .
When the pirates initially agreed to hitch their boat to the Bainbridge on Sunday evening , they were towed from a distance of 200 feet .
But the ride was still choppy .
The Bainbridge began pulling the boat to within 75 or 80 feet , explaining to the pirates that moving the vessel toward the destroyer would stabilize their boat .
The snipers probably took positions on catwalks or the ship ’s rear - facing fantail that obscured them from the pirates ’ view .
And the Navy made the snipers ’ task easier by getting the pirates to let themselves be tethered to the ship .
“ I would n’t be surprised if they turned dead into the swells , ” the military official said , describing how the Navy is likely to have used the warship to plow through waves and draw the rescue craft closer in a relatively smooth wake .
Advertisement
“ From that range , ” he said , “ they ’ve got a fairly good margin of error . ”
Indeed , military officials said that once the lifeboat was tethered to the destroyer , the pirates grew more desperate , feeling that they had lost control of their boat and the situation .
The pirates also were probably experiencing a withdrawal from khat , a narcotic leaf chewed by many Somali men , according to the senior military official .
Withdrawal from the amphetamine - like stimulant can induce depression .
Aboard the hot and cramped lifeboat , tensions escalated .
Watching from the Bainbridge , the snipers observed an apparent argument between Phillips and one of the pirates .
Advertisement
Military officers talking with the lifeboat by radio also noticed that the pirates had become more agitated .
“ They broke off the last communication , ” said the senior military official .
“ And , again , they said , ‘ If we do n’t get what we are demanding , we will kill the captain . ’ ”
About an hour and a half after tying the lifeboat to the Bainbridge , the SEAL team observed two of the pirates move away from Phillips and stick their heads out from a hatch .
The third pirate raised his weapon at Phillips ’ back .
Convinced that Phillips was about to be shot , the SEAL commander gave the order to fire .

“ If the goal was just to kill these guys , there were opportunities where we could have shot them , ” the senior official said .
“ This was not the outcome we wanted .
We wanted those three guys to give themselves up . ”

In addition to causes like stopping malaria and promoting organ donation , Bill Gates is trying to wean the world off oil in his spare time .
Bill is listed as one of ten co-inventors of a new type of " electromagnetic engine , " in a patent application filed with the U.S. government today .
That does n't mean Bill actually invented the thing himself .
Inventors routinely list others as co-creators , and another co-filer is former Microsoft ( MSFT ) CTO Nathan Myhrvold , Techflash notes .
So just what is it ?
Well there 's diagrams , and the abstract says " a converter converts mechanical energy of a piston to and from electrical energy during each piston cycle , " followed by a lot of notes that are bewildering to this layman .
If anyone can make sense of the filing , let us know what 's what in the comments .
But " electromagnetic engine " automatically makes us think of electric cars , a burgeoning industry .
( See The Complete Guide To Electric Cars . )
The self - identified leader of the Ohio Militia , a conspiracy - minded “ Patriot ” group , released a video earlier this week calling for 1 million heavily armed antigovernment demonstrators to march on Washington , D.C. , this coming July 4 .
“ We need to do something , ” he said .
“ We need to make a dent . ”
Identifying himself as “ Pale Horse , ” apparently a reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse , and speaking through a creepy voice distorter , the Ohio militiaman detailed his brazen vision : “ A peaceful demonstration of at least a million — hey , if we can get 10 million , even better — but at least one million armed militia men marching on Washington .
A peaceful demonstration .
No shooting , no one gets hurt .
Just a demonstration .
The only difference from any typical demonstration is we will all be armed . ”
The Ohio Militia website contains apocalyptic language and imagery , along with references to various 9/11 and “ North American Union ” conspiracy theories .
Videos show men said to be Ohio Militia members engaged in small - unit , live - fire combat training .
One video is titled “ America ’s Wake Up Call : Buy Guns . ”
A different video slideshow depicts assault weapons , mushroom clouds , George Bush , Satan , Osama bin Laden and lots of men in camouflage on maneuvers .
It ’s set to “ Goofy ’s Concern , ” a song by Butthole Surfers , a psychedelic rock band from Austin , Texas , that includes these lyrics : “ I do n’t give a f--- about the FBI !
I do n’t give a f--- about the CIA !
I do n’t give a f--- about LSD !
I do n’t give a f--- about anything ! ”
That video concludes with a message to the Michigan Militia , one of the largest and oldest militia groups in the country : “ Thanks for letting us train at Camp Stasa with you guys . ”
It is n’t clear that the Ohio Militia is capable of bringing a busload of protesters to Washington , let alone a million or more .
But Pale Horse ’s call for a gathering of gun-toting militia forces in the nation ’s capital brings to mind a similar infamous call to arms issued in 1994 by Patriot movement attorney , filmmaker and conspiracy theorist Linda Thompson .
Thompson — who once told the editor of this blog about being personally and repeatedly followed by black helicopters , shot at by mysterious attackers , and having a beloved dog zapped by a secret government ray gun — was probably best known for producing the pseudo - documentary “ Waco : The Big Lie , ” which alleged a government mass murder in the 1993 standoff in Texas .
Although the video was widely circulated , its claims were soon debunked .
Proclaiming herself “ Acting Adjutant General ” of the “ Unorganized Militia of the United States , ” Thompson announced that her armed march would take place on Sept. 19 , 1994 .
She said her unorganized army would demand the repeal of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Brady Bill , a gun control measure .
U.S. senators and congressmen who refused to accede would be arrested , tried for treason and , if necessary , executed by firing squad or hanging , she said .
Thompson ’s plan was almost universally denounced by right - wing groups , including most of the militias that were then appearing all over the country , who accused her of attempting to lead them on a suicide mission .
Many in the movement suspected that Thompson was an agent provocateur working for the government .
Response to Pale Horse ’s suggestion for a more “ peaceful ” display of force remains to be seen .
Uh .

Mr Chavez 's gift of a book to Mr Obama made world headlines
The Venezuelan government has formally donated an island near Philadelphia back to the United States .
Petty Island , an uninhabited island some 528 acres ( 214 ha ) in size , is situated in the Delaware River in the state of New Jersey .
It was bought by Venezuela 's state - run energy company , PDVS , in 1990 .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced the move at a regional summit last week as part of an improvement in ties between the two nations .
At the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago , President Chavez presented Barack Obama with a gift of a book : The Open Veins of Latin America by Eduardo Galeano .
The book is widely considered the bible of the Latin American left .
But the BBC's Will Grant , in Caracas , says Mr Chavez also gave Mr Obama something much bigger : Petty Island .
The Venezuelan government has used it for fuel storage and refinement since 1990 .
Our correspondent says that in recent years the tiny island has been the subject of some controversy , with waterfront property developers pushing to construct a golf course , hotels and a casino on the site .
Environmental groups have opposed such measures , saying it has unique flora and fauna which must be conserved .
Now , as part of what the government has called a renewed spirit of co-operation between Venezuela and the US , Mr Chavez announced that the island would return to the US for environmental conservation projects .
While Mr Chavez 's gift of a book to his US counterpart may have made headlines around the world and launched the publication up the New York Times bestseller list , the return of Petty Island may prove a more lasting donation our correspondent adds .
An epidemic of a swine flu never identified before has broken out in Mexico City killing at least 16 people so far and raising fears of a pandemic .
All schools , museums , libraries and state - run theatres in the metropolitan area were closed today in an attempt to control the spread of the virus that authorities say may be linked to a further 45 deaths .
" This is a new virus that we have n't seen before , " health minister Jose Angel Córdova said in an interview with MVS radio .
" We have taken these measures because this is a virus that has the potential to become a pandemic . "
The authorities say they are investigating close to 1,000 suspicious cases of flu that they are concerned may prove to be caused by the new virus .
Most are in the metropolitan area of 20 million people , although three other Mexican states have also been affected to a lesser degree .
There have also been seven reported cases of the same virus reported in the United States , five in Southern California and two in Texas .
All those patients have recovered .
The Mexican minister said the authorities were considering extending the precautions to include shutting down workplaces as well as public buildings , but for the moment urged employers to be tolerant of absences .
He said that while the situation was " very worrying " he believed the epidemic " is controllable " .
The impact of the preventative measures on city life was felt immediately as the population woke up to news of the epidemic that was announced in a late night statement .
Radio and TV stations repeated official advice to stay away from crowded places " unless urgently necessary , " and to seek medical help at the first sign of the very high fevers and acute respiratory symptoms associated with the illness .
At Mexico City 's biggest airport , airlines began requiring passengers checking in for domestic and international flights to fill out forms to help decide who could be at risk of carrying the virus .
Anybody deemed to be so was reportedly asked not to fly .
Meanwhile , the media was flooded with questions from city dwellers concerned about everything from the dangers of eating pork to travel on the metro .
Many people heading to work in the morning wore blue surgical face masks , and chemists said their supplies were running out .
The partial shutting down of the metropolis was a dramatic reversal from the government 's previous position that minimised the unusual number of flu deaths picked up by the media , saying it was due to an extension of winter .
Córdova said the sudden change of tack happened when samples analysed in highly specialised laboratories in Canada and the US revealed that the virus causing the deaths was a completely different strain .
The Geneva - based WHO said it was concerned about the epidemic and had activated its Strategic Health Operations Centre .
The agency added that it was in daily contact with US , Canadian and Mexican authorities .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Major banks have been hit hard by bad mortgages .
Now , fears are growing that troubled financial institutions are going to have another consumer headache to deal with : credit card defaults .
There have been no shortage of warnings about the business as the economy continues to sputter .
Just last month , Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis warned lawmakers at a high - profile Congressional hearing on the government 's $ 700 billion rescue plan that he had no doubts 2009 would be an " awful year " for the credit card industry .
Unfortunately for Lewis and his peers , the nation 's leading banks dominate the credit card landscape .
Of the nearly $ 76 billion in credit card loans in 2008 , nearly $ 46 billion came from Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) and Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) alone , according to credit rating agency Moody's .
Fearing a wave of credit card - related losses , banks have been aggressively setting aside funds to help cushion the blow .
One problem , note analysts , is that banks are n't quite sure just how severe the losses will be .
Industry charge - offs , or loans a bank considers to be uncollectable , climbed to a historic high of 7.73 % in December .
Most analysts expect that figure to head higher as more and more people find themselves out of work .
Unemployment rates , widely viewed as the most reliable indicator of future credit card losses , climbed to 8.1 % in February - its highest level in 25 years
A widely used rule of thumb is that charge - offs typically climb to 1 percentage point above the unemployment rate .
And many expect the unemployment rate to keep rising throughout the year .
With that in mind , Mike Taiano , an analyst with Sandler O'Neill , said he thinks the charge - off rate could wind up peaking at a level north of 10 % .
Of course , this is not the first time that credit card issuers have had to contend with relatively high unemployment .
During the recession in the early 1980s , the jobless level peaked at 10.8 % in late 1982 .
But some experts point out that this is a much different time for the industry .
Not only did a much smaller slice of the American public own a credit or charge card , the amount of credit issued by the industry was just a fraction of what it is today .
As of January 2009 , the amount of outstanding credit in the industry totaled just under $ 1 trillion , compared to just $ 70.5 billion in 1982 .
Coping with losses
Banks have a whole other host of problems to worry about now that they did n't have to contend with in the 1980s .
Democratic lawmakers have proposed legislation that would allow so - called " mortgage cram downs , " which would let judges reduce mortgage debt for individuals who have filed for bankruptcy .
Many in the banking industry fear that passage of this bill could prompt many homeowners to file for bankruptcy and default on many of their other debts , including credit cards .
But some analysts point out that the magnitude of any future credit card problems will be mitigated by the fact that most banks ' credit card businesses are a fraction of the size of their ailing mortgage portfolios .
" You are not going to have a complete redo of the subprime mortgage mess because it is simply not the same scale , " said David Robertson , publisher of the industry trade publication Nilson Report .
What is also encouraging , notes Robertson , is that banks ' credit card operations have become much more adept at adjusting to tough economic times after years of practice , including the downturn that followed the dot - com bubble earlier this decade .
Facing additional losses , credit card issuers are doing what they can to insulate themselves from further losses , including lowering credit limits for some cardholders , closing accounts or getting out of the business altogether .
American Express ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) made headlines recently after it offered to pay some of its cardholders $ 300 if they paid off their balances and closed their accounts by the end of April .
And there has been speculation that Citigroup is looking to enter into a joint venture for its private label credit card division -- which serves retailers -- as a way of eventually getting out of the business altogether .
What many leading card - issuing banks wo n't do , said Stuart Gunn , a director at the Chicago - based management consulting firm Bridge Strategy Group , is attempt to sell off their core credit card operations .
Not only would banks have a hard time attracting any bidders in the current economic environment , but they would also lose a key component of their retail business .
Banks need credit card operations to both lure in new customers and keep existing ones , not to mention make a buck .
" If you want to be the retail bank of choice , it means you have to have CDs , debit cards , home equity loans and credit cards , " said Gunn .
" Do you really want to exit one of the major lines of business ? "
Talkback :
Do you know any heroes of the economy ?
Someone like Leonard Abess , the Miami banker who shared his $ 60 million bonus with his employees ?
Or maybe someone acting on a smaller scale to help those suffering during this recession .
Maybe you ?

The shotgun shooting of two California condors has prompted a large reward -- as well as a spat between federal wildlife investigators and a private detective hired by an environmental group .
A private detective from Culver City , Bruce Robertson , should “ stay out of my way , ” said Dan Crum , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ’s resident agent for Northern California and lead investigator into the recent shootings in Monterey County , near Big Sur .
“ We are not working together , and he is not working with us , ” Crum said Thursday .
“ When it comes to things like reading our case reports , absolutely not .
“ On the other hand , ” Crum added , “ if he digs up something good , we ’ll take what we can get . ”

Robertson was hired this week by the Center for Biological Diversity to help crack the case , which has spawned one of the largest rewards ever offered in connection with an injured endangered species .
By Thursday afternoon , the reward established by a coalition of environmental groups and wildlife advocates had grown to $ 40,500 .
In an interview in his office , Robertson , who is a member of the Center for Biological Diversity , said , “ I believe that the reward will loosen tongues in rural areas where times are tough right now . ”
Robertson declined to reveal his approach to the case on grounds it might tip off the shooter .
However , he said he plans to travel to Monterey County next week to “ begin organizing a team of investigators who will leverage their connections in the area to cast a wide net . ”

“ A lot of information connected to this case will have to be obtained at ground level , meaning feet on the street , ” he said .
“ The goal is to solve the crime .
These shootings need to stop right now .
We ca n’t wait for weeks or months .
“ I ’m not interested in getting in the way of the forensic investigation , ” he added .
“ I just want to make sure the investigation is moving along as efficiently as possible . ”
In the meantime , the wounded condors remained under care at the Los Angeles Zoo , suffering from lead poisoning and gunshot wounds .

Biologists with the Ventana Wildlife Society , based in Monterey , discovered the ailing birds -- an adult male known as condor 286 and a juvenile female , condor 375 , last month .
The birds were taken to the Los Angeles Zoo , where veterinary examinations revealed that the male had 15 buckshot pellets embedded in its muscle tissue and the female had three pellets in the left wing and thigh .
Federal biologists said the poisoning resulted from ingestion of lead ammunition fragments in game downed by hunters .
The pellets , however , were fired from shotguns .
Investigators want to find who fired the shots .
Advertisement
On Thursday , Humane Society officials said the male condor was in critical condition and being fed through a tube .
The female was in better condition , but it was unclear whether either one would be able to fly again .
They are among 81 California condors in the state , and 322 on the planet .
Condor recovery programs have made the majestic scavengers reliant on humans to provide food free of contamination from lead ammunition .
California passed a law in 2007 that prohibits hunters from using lead ammunition within the California condors ’ 2,385 - square - mile territory .
Anyone with information about the cases is asked to call the California Department of Fish and Game TIP line at ( 888 ) 334-2258 .

Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig led a team that had to overcome daunting technical obstacles to produce the draft of the Neanderthal genome .
He was assisted by the company 454 Life Sciences , which invented a new DNA decoding machine that works by analyzing millions of very small fragments of DNA in parallel .
DNA from Neanderthal bones is fragmented in just this way .
Dr. Pääbo began his project more than 10 years ago , when he succeeded in extracting the first verifiable piece of Neanderthal DNA .
Most Neanderthal bones have no recoverable DNA and those that do are heavily contaminated with modern human DNA from the many scientists and curators who handled them .
Distinguishing human and Neanderthal DNA is hard because they are so similar .
He said at a news conference in Leipzig on Thursday that he now had retrieved usable DNA from six Neanderthals and analyzed 3.7 billion units of DNA .
The Neanderthal genome , like that of modern humans , is 3.2 billion units in length .
Because many units have been analyzed several times over , and many not at all , Dr. Pääbo can now see about 63 percent of the Neanderthal genome .
He will continue to analyze it until he has accumulated the equivalent of 20 Neanderthal genomes , which will allow almost every unit to be accurately known .
An earlier analysis of Neanderthal DNA by Dr. Pääbo proved to have had 10 percent human contamination , he said , but in the new draft genome , he has taken pains to measure the degree of human contamination and finds it is below 3 percent , he said .
Archaeologists have long debated whether Neanderthals could speak , and they have eagerly awaited Dr. Pääbo ’s analysis of the Neanderthal FOXP2 , a gene essential for language .
Modern humans have two changes in FOXP2 that are not found in chimpanzees , and that presumably evolved to make speech possible .
Dr. Pääbo said Neanderthals had the same two changes in their version of the FOXP2 gene .
But many other genes are involved in language , so it is too early to say whether Neanderthals could speak .
After declining since late December , the Fed balance sheet ( Reserve Bank Credit ) expanded for the first time this year , by $ 76.9 billion to $ 1,907.3 billion in the week to February 18 .
If you look at the details , Commercial paper funding facility and Central bank liquidity swaps continued to contract as falling commercial paper and LIBOR interest rates makes
Fed funding in those areas less attractive .
Term auction credit and Securities held outright however expanded a lot more , causing total Reserve Bank Credit to expand .
The increase in " Securities held outright " was not due to increased holdings of Treasuries ( yet ) .
Instead it meant increased holdings of mortgage backed securities .
Right now , the Fed focuses on bringing down mortgage interest rates by buying such securities .
If this is not an aberration , and instead is the beginning of a trend with expanded or at least stabilized Reserve Bank Credit , this will enable money supply growth to remain high .
M2 and MZM continued to expand the latest week , and will probably continue to do so .
That in turn means that price inflation will likely pick up again soon , something which we are already seeing in the price of gold .
Other commodities that are more dependent on industrial demand will have more difficulty to rally until China and other economies pick up .
( CNN ) --
A large ice shelf is " imminently " close to breaking away from part of the Antarctic Peninsula , scientists said Friday .
Scientists are investigating whether the ice breakup is caused by global climate change .
Satellite images released by the European Space Agency on Friday show new cracks in the Wilkins Ice Shelf where it connects to Charcot Island , a piece of land considered part of the peninsula .
The cracks are quickly expanding , the ESA said .
Scientists are investigating the causes for the breakups and whether it is linked to global climate change .
The Wilkins Ice Shelf -- a large mass of floating ice -- would still be connected to Latady Island , which is also part of the peninsula , and Alexander Island , which is not , said professor David Vaughan , a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey .
The ice shelf experienced a great amount of changes last year , the ESA said .
In February 2008 , the shelf dropped 164 square miles ( 425 square kilometers ) of ice .
In May it lost a 62 - square - mile chunk .
That meant the " bridge " of ice connecting Wilkins to the islands was just 984 yards wide at its narrowest location , the ESA said .
Further rifts developed in October and November , said Angelika Humbert of the Institute of Geophysics at Germany 's Muenster University .
" During the last year the ice shelf has lost about 1800 square kilometers ( 694 square miles ) , or about 14 percent of its size , " Humbert said .
Antarctica's ice sheet was formed over thousands of years by accumulated and compacted snow .
Along the coast , the ice gradually floats on the sea , forming massive ledges known as ice shelves , the ESA says .
Several of these ice shelves , including seven in the past 20 years , have retreated and disintegrated .
The Wilkins Ice Shelf had been stable for most of the past century before it began retreating in the 1990s .
" It had been there almost unchanged since the first expeditions which mapped it back in the 1930s , so it had a very long period of real stability , and it 's only in the last decade that it 's started to retreat , " Vaughan said .
Wilkins is the size of the state of Connecticut , or about half the area of Scotland .
It is the largest ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula yet to be threatened .
If the ice shelf breaks away from the peninsula , it will not cause a rise in sea level because it is already floating , scientists say .
Some plants and animals may have to adapt to the collapse .
The Antarctic Peninsula is the piece of the continent that stretches toward South America .

De-Authorizing Pogo Games
Some Pogo games use Product Activation technology .
Product Activation is a solution to authorize your legitimate application at an online Product Activation Server .
This process ties a unique license to the machine you are using .
Usually this is only required at first launch of the application .
Deauthorization is the process of giving back a used license to the Product Activation server .
The precondition to successfully deauthorize is that the game was authorized on the PC before and the license stored in the registry is intact .
Your application has a limit of 5 simultaneous activations .
After an online activation on the Product Activation server , the application can be used on this PC and four activations are left for this serial number .
In case this active license is revoked , the application cannot be used on this PC any longer ( until a new online activation ) , leaving five activations for this authorization key to be used on different PCs .
Product Activation provides two possibilities to deauthorize your game .
- Deauthorize during uninstall :
By uninstalling your game the license is given back .
- Command line instructions ( for technical persons ) :
Call the applications executable with the parameter " / revoke " .
De-Authorizing PopCap Games
Some PopCap games use Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) technology .
DRM is a solution to activate a unique license for the application on your computer .
In most cases , your application has a limit of 5 simultaneous activations .
So , after one online activation , the application can be used on that computer , leaving four activations available for use on other computers within your household .
Please visit the PopCap Support Site for more information on de-activating your application .

Just today ( Australia time ) the Taronga Zoo unveiled their newest baby wombat .
Baby Matari will be hand - reared at the zoo .
In the wild , wombat moms are professional diggers and rarely take maternity leave .
For this reason they have backwards facing pouches ( unlike most other marsupials ) to protect their young from flying dirt and rocks .

The Foul Stench of Rotten Economic Theory
I am known throughout this galaxy as a guy who “ gets things done ” with the still - experimental Mogambo Insulting Method Of Pedantry ( MIMOP ) , whereby I instruct pupils in the subtleties of the True Mogambo Way ( TMW ) by insulting them , mostly by easily ridiculing their intelligence by merely casually noting that none of them own gold and silver when their own stupid government is acting so , so , so irresponsibly as to finance a huge , wildly - expanding , government - centric economy ( the federal budget deficit – alone ! – is 14 % of GDP , for crying out loud ! ) with vast , terrifying expansions of fiat currency , which they do to offset the bust that is busting after the boom that was booming !
I mean , it ’s so obvious that you SHOULD be buying gold , silver and commodities in general and oil in particular , that failure to do so shows either that 1 . )
You have a “ need to fail ” because you realize that you are a complete fraud and failure as a human being , probably because your own spouse and kids and family members are always yammering at you about what a failure you are as a son , brother , husband , father , neighbor , relative and some kind of “ disturbance in the Force ” , whatever in the hell that is , and then you get to work , where all of those hateful morons say the same thing , or that 2 . )
You are an idiot .
I do not like to dwell on bad news , especially the kind of bad news where the news just keeps getting worse and worse , when I could , instead , dwell on the prospect of having my every dream and far - fetched fantasy fulfilled because the good news is that gold will go dramatically up in price as the buying power of the dollar goes so dramatically down in response to the government ’s dramatic deficit - spending of the Federal Reserve ’s dramatic creation of the money and credit to pay for it all .
In fact , I was just lapsing over into that fantasy world where the coming price explosion in gold made possible my wife running off with some young guy so that she could , as she so frequently says , “ find true love just once in my whole life , instead of being married to a creep like you , which I only do to collect the life insurance when you finally die !
Hahaha ! ” which always makes me smile because I ’m pretty sure I cancelled that insurance long ago !
Hahaha !
The joke ’s on her !
But this is not about my pathetic life or any of the hateful people in it , or even about how soon gold will soar so that then I will be able to suddenly quit this boring , stupid job and say , in a Classic Mogambo Moment ( CMM ) , “ I quit !
I ’m only sorry that I was not more successful in embezzling your stupid retirement funds so that I could have left sooner than this !
So , goodbye !
And now all of you go to hell , ya morons ! ”
Instead , this about how I discovered a new way to prevent taking responsibility for my actions , which would seemingly come natural to conceited , self - absorbed incompetent coward like me , but it does n’t .
Instead , I have to use methods developed by others , which makes me excited about the new one propounded by Alan Greenspan , who was the chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1987 to 2006 and who is single - handedly the one stupid bastard who is actually responsible for the economic collapse that we , and the rest of the world , are in .
Anyway , I found this little nugget in his article “ We Need A Better Cushion Against Risk ” when it appeared in the Financial Times , another laughably desperate “ I am not responsible for anything ” essay by Alan Greenspan as he rushes to deny his obvious guilt and stupidity in applying monetary policy .
He begins with how it all began , innocently enough , in the balmy days of the 1950s , when a guy named Harry Markowitz at the University of Chicago somehow came up with what eventually became “ extraordinary risk - management discipline ” , which , as I gather , morphed into today ’s “ sophisticated mathematics and computer wizardry ” that went tragically awry because , as Mr. Greenspan has distilled down to the nub of the issue , it all “ essentially rested on one central premise . ”
Now , there are many people who are like me , who wonder what in the hell that “ one central premise ” could be !
For instance , could it be the “ premise ” is that a bunch of idiot - savant university rats came up with economic equations to seemingly quantify normally - distributed risk ( “ It works under most laboratory conditions ! ” ) , thus seemingly allowing everyone to benefit since , with such precision in quantifying risk , borrowers and the insured would pay the lowest prices for loans and insurances because the insurance carrier / creditor could charge less in premiums / interest while accepting a lower yield on investment of the invested premiums / deposits , thus hiking both corporate profits , consumer disposable income and tax revenues , which sounds Mighty , Mighty Fine ( MMF ) from a “ win/win ” perspective ?
Unfortunately , like most unhinged lunatics who get started on their hate - tinged , anti-governmental rampages of outrage , I loudly launch into how , like most things , this reliance on standard probability theory grew and metastasized into something mathematically malignant and foul , oozing with pus and clotted blood , reeking of variables turned into constants , whereupon these few cancerous equations and theory were then incorporated into other strange economic equations and theory , and then into other bizarre equations and theory , back and forth , a piece here and a piece there , all the time coming up with ( in a publish - or - perish world where university eggheads with nowhere to go in private industry are given the novelty of bigger and bigger computers ) , something new , new , new to incorporate into the model of the economy and thus attain tenure and prestige by developing huge , hideously complex , assuredly - wrong , impossible - to - verify computer models of the financial world with which to “ tweak ” economic growth that have all failed !
Hahahaha !
Hell , just thinking about it makes me laugh , so it must have been a lot of fun to seemingly violate the Laws of Economics with laughable computer tricks like coming up with these econometric models , not to mention the hedonic inflation - adjusting ( courtesy of , again , Alan Greenspan , to disguise inflation in prices ) , off - balance - sheet accounting , derivative schemes and scams of every sort .
But as angry as I am at Alan Greenspan , and as upset as I am that the economy of the world has been destroyed because of him and his pinhead neo-Keynesian econometric trash buddies , I am going to use his own words to , hopefully , save my career !
He says , “ It is clear that the levels of complexity ” in these “ new risk - management techniques and risk - product design ” had evolved to the point where they “ were too much for even the most sophisticated market players to handle . ”
That ’s it !
Wonderful !
Now , the hard part for me is that I have to keep a straight face while explaining to my boss that I was actually doing a great job , see , everything was fine , better than fine , almost perfect in fact , but that things fell apart only due to their “ complexity ! ” Hahaha !
Oops !
See what I mean about how hard it is to keep a straight face ?
Hahahaha !
Or maybe it will be harder to prevent myself from blaming the rest of the executive staff , who are all morons , for the failure , and blame the peasant workers that are always complaining instead of working , spending the day whining about something that I said , or I did , or how I forged their signatures on some papers or something .
Wish me luck !
Just days before the matter is to be taken up by California ’s Supreme Court , the state Senate today approved a resolution today calling Proposition 8 , the ban on same - sex marriage , an improper revision of the Constitution because it was not approved by the Legislature .
Sen. Mark Leno ( D - San Francisco ) said the initiative is a fundamental revision to the document , not an amendment , and therefore required deliberation by the Legislature and a two - thirds vote of both houses to put it on the ballot .
" Do we have a constitutional democracy in California , or do we have mob rule ? "
Leno asked his colleagues before the 18 - 14 vote approved the resolution .
Gosh dang this one was fun to draw .
I really wanna make some prints of it .
Speaking of fun things : DINOSAURS IN SPACE !

Republican National Chairman Michael S. Steele has launched a direct attack on President Obama in a new mass mailing , accusing the president of being part of the “ blame America first ” crowd , The Washington Times has learned .
Criticized by some in the party for not taking on the Democratic president hard enough or often enough , Mr. Steele took the gloves off in a fund - raising letter sent out Monday to 12 million party supporters .
Recipients included RNC donors as well as the mailing lists of two conservative organizations , Human Events and GOPUSA , according to RNC communications director Trevor Francis .
Mr. Steele wrote that Mr. Obama ’s comments criticizing the United States on his recent European tour showed “ an absence of wisdom . ”
Mr. Steeles letter also slammed the Democratic president for saying he was open to possible talks with Iran .
Apparently , he believes he can make peace with crackpot tyrants and heartless terrorists simply by sitting down and talking , the Steele letter said .
The RNC letter noted that Mr. Obama while in Europe had said the United States has displayed “ arrogance ” at times in its foreign policy .
But Mr. Steele said it was the former senator from Illinois who was “ arrogant ” when he “ boasted his election would be remember as the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal . ”
He said the president showed similar arrogance earlier when he “ indicated disdain for small town and working Americans who ‘ cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them . ’ ”
Only toward the end of the letter does it become evident that it is an appeal for donations to the RNC .

In the late nineteen - twenties , two companies — Kellogg and Post — dominated the market for packaged cereal .
It was still a relatively new market : ready - to - eat cereal had been around for decades , but Americans did n’t see it as a real alternative to oatmeal or cream of wheat until the twenties .
So , when the Depression hit , no one knew what would happen to consumer demand .
Post did the predictable thing : it reined in expenses and cut back on advertising .
But Kellogg doubled its ad budget , moved aggressively into radio advertising , and heavily pushed its new cereal , Rice Krispies .
( Snap , Crackle , and Pop first appeared in the thirties . )
By 1933 , even as the economy cratered , Kellogg ’s profits had risen almost thirty per cent and it had become what it remains today : the industry ’s dominant player .
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
You ’d think that everyone would want to emulate Kellogg ’s success , but , when hard times hit , most companies end up behaving more like Post .
They hunker down , cut spending , and wait for good times to return .
They make fewer acquisitions , even though prices are cheaper .
They cut advertising budgets .
And often they invest less in research and development .
They do all this to preserve what they have .
But there ’s a trade - off : numerous studies have shown that companies that keep spending on acquisition , advertising , and R. & D. during recessions do significantly better than those which make big cuts .
In 1927 , the economist Roland Vaile found that firms that kept ad spending stable or increased it during the recession of 1921 - 22 saw their sales hold up significantly better than those which did n’t .
A study of advertising during the 1981 - 82 recession found that sales at firms that increased advertising or held steady grew precipitously in the next three years , compared with only slight increases at firms that had slashed their budgets .
And a McKinsey study of the 1990 - 91 recession found that companies that remained market leaders or became serious challengers during the downturn had increased their acquisition , R. & D. , and ad budgets , while companies at the bottom of the pile had reduced them .
One way to read these studies is simply that recessions make the strong stronger and the weak weaker , since the strong can afford to keep investing while the weak have to devote all their energies to staying afloat .
But although deep pockets help in a downturn , recessions nonetheless create more opportunity for challengers , not less .
When everyone is advertising , for instance , it ’s hard to separate yourself from the pack ; when ads are scarcer , the returns on investment seem to rise .
That may be why during the 1990 - 91 recession , according to a Bain & Company study , twice as many companies leaped from the bottom of their industries to the top as did so in the years before and after .
Chrysler ’s fortunes in the Great Depression are a classic instance of this .
Chrysler had been the third player in the U.S. auto industry , behind G.M. and Ford .
But early in the downturn it gave a big push to a new brand —
Plymouth — targeted at the low end of the market , and by 1933 it had surpassed Ford to become North America ’s second - biggest automaker .
On a smaller scale , Hyundai has made huge gains in market share this year , thanks to a hefty advertising budget and a guarantee to take back cars from owners who have lost their jobs .
Those gains may turn out to be temporary , but in fact the benefits from recession investment are often surprisingly long - lived , with companies maintaining their gains in market share and sales well into economic recovery .
Why , then , are companies so quick to cut back when trouble hits ?
The answer has something to do with a famous distinction that the economist Frank Knight made between risk and uncertainty .
Risk describes a situation where you have a sense of the range and likelihood of possible outcomes .
Uncertainty describes a situation where it ’s not even clear what might happen , let alone how likely the possible outcomes are .
Uncertainty is always a part of business , but in a recession it dominates everything else : no one ’s sure how long the downturn will last , how shoppers will react , whether we ’ll go back to the way things were before or see permanent changes in consumer behavior .
So it ’s natural to focus on what you can control : minimizing losses and improving short - term results .
And cutting spending is a good way of doing this ; a major study , by the Strategic Planning Institute , of corporate behavior during the past thirty years found that reducing ad spending during recessions did improve companies ’ return on capital .
It also meant , though , that they grew less quickly in the years following recessions than more free - spending competitors did .
But for many companies recessions are a time when short - term considerations trump long - term potential .
This is not irrational .
It ’s true that the uncertainty of recessions creates an opportunity for serious profits , and the historical record is full of companies that made successful gambles in hard times : Kraft introduced Miracle
Whip in 1933 and saw it become America ’s best - selling dressing in six months ;
Texas Instruments brought out the transistor radio in the 1954 recession ; Apple launched the iPod in 2001 .
Then again , the record is also full of forgotten companies that gambled and failed .
The academics Peter Dickson and Joseph Giglierano have argued that companies have to worry about two kinds of failure : “ sinking the boat ” ( wrecking the company by making a bad bet ) or “ missing the boat ” ( letting a great opportunity pass ) .
Today , most companies are far more worried about sinking the boat than about missing it .
That ’s why the opportunity to do what Kellogg did exists .
That ’s also why it ’s so nerve - racking to try it . ♦

Over 100,000 people have already signed up for The Pirate Bay ’s new anonymity service , Ipredator , designed to hide IP addresses from the authorities , the Bay 's spokesman says .
Last Wednesday , the controversial Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive ( IPRED ) became law in Sweden .
Its main goal is to enable copyright holders to acquire data identifying people linked to illegal file sharing .
Wired.com reported last week that internet use in Sweden dipped by 30 percent when IPRED came into force on April 1 .
Some 113,000 persons have signed up and are in queue for the Ipredator service , and about 80 percent are Swede , Peter Sunde , spokesperson for The Pirate Bay , said to the Swedish news agency TT Tuesday .
The service was originally set to go live on April 1 , but the unexpected high demand delayed it .
The service will operate much the same way as other anonymity services , with one important exception :
The Pirate Bay says it will not log its data , making it more difficult to trace activity to a specific user .
Ipredator is a Virtual Private Network ( VPN ) which allows users to anonymously connect to the internet .
Their ISP - designated IP addresses remain hidden , revealing only a second IP address provided by the VPN .
Details concerning the service are scant , except that users will pay a fee of approximately $ 6 for the security of knowing that their actions will be difficult to trace .
The service is expected to start operation on April 8 .
There are already a numbers of sites online devoted to hiding user IP addresses for a monthly fee , and in the wake of the country 's new anti-file sharing measures , the demand for such anonymity services has increased across the board , according to the daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet .
One service , Dold.se , is currently informing visitors that its service is " overloaded " .
Relakks.com , another service , says on its site that it 's seen a big wave of new customers recently , and that the service might be slow as a result .

Office of the Governor
Rick Perry
April 29 , 2009 Rick PerryApril 29 , 2009
AUSTIN – Gov. Rick Perry today bolstered the state ’s precautionary measures to address the swine flu threat as a result of confirmed cases in certain parts of the state by issuing a disaster declaration for the entire state of Texas .
The disaster declaration allows the state to implement emergency protective measures and seek reimbursement under the federal Stafford Act for protective measures associated with the state ’s response to this public health threat .
“ Texans need to know there is no cause for panic and Texans can be assured that the state will take every necessary precaution to protect the lives of our citizens , ” Gov. Perry said .
“ My office , along with the Department of State Health Services and other state , local and federal partners , have a plan in place to protect Texans should there be a pandemic flu outbreak or other health emergency . ”
The governor was joined by Department of State Health Services Commissioner Dr. David Lakey and Texas Education Commissioner Robert Scott at a press conference to discuss the state ’s response to this threat .
The state of Texas continues to closely coordinate with local and federal health officials and emergency management partners by monitoring and responding to this changing threat .
[ efoods ]
Gov .
Perry also announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has approved his increased request for 25 percent ( 850,000 courses ) of the Texas allotment of antiviral medication from the CDCs Strategic National Stockpile to be prepositioned in the state .
This request augments more than 840,000 courses of antiviral medication on hand in Texas following a purchase authorized by Gov. Perry and the 80th Legislature in 2007 .
CDC ’s Strategic National Stockpile ( SNS ) has large quantities of medicine and medical supplies to protect the American public if there is a public health emergency ( terrorist attack , flu outbreak , earthquake ) .
For more information on the SNS , visit http://www.bt.cdc.gov/stockpile.
To date , the CDC has confirmed 91 human swine flu cases in the U.S. , including 16 confirmed cases and one death in Texas .
Symptoms of swine flu in people are similar to those of regular or seasonal flu and include fever , fatigue , lack of appetite and coughing .
Some with swine flu also have reported runny nose , sore throat , nausea , vomiting and diarrhea .
Health officials say everyone should follow standard precautions to reduce the spread of any respiratory illness .
• Stay home when you are sick to avoid spreading illness to others .
• Cough or sneeze into the crook of your elbow or a tissue and properly dispose of used tissues .
• Wash hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and warm water or use an alcohol - based hand sanitizer .
Individuals with these flu - like symptoms should call the state ’s swine flu call center at 888-777-5320 .
For health care providers with questions about assessing , evaluating and treating swine flu , call 877-623-6274 .
These lines are operational from 7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m .

The Liverpool manager has heard it many times before but this time the chant of " Rafa 's cracking up " must have been music to his ears .
It came from the Liverpool supporters , not the Stretford End , its irony marking a first win at Old Trafford under Benítez and another four goals to complete a momentous week .
Real Madrid may have been poor at Anfield on Tuesday but these were the champions of Europe , on their own turf , chasing a club record 12th successive league win .
Apart from a few minutes in the first half , when Manchester United led through a penalty and their fans briefly had the opportunity to remind Benítez of his alleged resemblance to a fat Spanish waiter , this was a surprisingly one - sided encounter and only one manager looked as though he was enjoying his work .
It was the other one , neatly enough , who sounded as though he might be cracking up .
" I thought we were the better team , " Sir Alex Ferguson said , making a bid for the wackiest statement of the season .
" But the score does n't reflect that . "
The table still does , though United 's lead is down to four points and their goal difference cut to five .
With a game in hand over Liverpool this may not amount to a turning point , yet results of this magnitude can boost the confidence of winners and eat away at the losers ' self - belief .
" We are in a better position now , that 's all you can say , " Benítez said .
" If we are going to win the title we are going to need three points from every game and United to drop some more .
So it might not happen , but at least we have more confidence . "
He can say that again .
Confidence oozed through Liverpool from the start , flowing directly from Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres .
The pair were conspicuously head and shoulders above every­one else on the pitch , closely involved in the important goals , and it was tempting to sympathise with Benítez when he bemoaned the fact that this was only the ninth league game of the season they have started together .
Perhaps United are not quite as outstanding as everyone has been saying , and Liverpool might be pushing them much closer but for injuries .
With due respect to Ferguson , that was the way it looked here .
Nemanja Vidic has been touted as a contender for player of the season but reacted to Torres in the manner of Superman exposed to green kryptonite .
The defender was comprehensively beaten for the first Liverpool goal , when he made the mistake of allowing Martin Skrtel 's long clearance to bounce and completely underestimated Torres 's pace and determination .
He almost gave away a penalty on the same player minutes later and completed a miserable afternoon by seeing red for a professional foul on ­Gerrard 15 minutes from time .
Everything looked fairly straightforward for United when they were awarded a penalty after 22 minutes , exactly the sort of thing Benítez might note in his next dossier , though while Park Ji-sung was not exactly carrying the ball goalwards there was no doubt Pepe Reina made ­contact to bring him down .
Cristiano Ronaldo stuck away the spot - kick to give United the lead , then promptly returned to ineffective obscurity along with Carlos Tevez and Anderson .
Wayne Rooney spent most of the first half gesticulating furiously at his colleagues , though in reality he was not much better .
Though always hungry for the ball he rarely used it well and , with the experience of Paul Scholes , Ryan Giggs and Dimitar Berbatov all kept in reserve until the 72nd minute , United found themselves outfought in midfield .
For all that Liverpool 's equaliser came out of nothing , Torres taking advantage of momentary United indecision as only he can , significantly he turned provider just before the interval when his measured pass for Gerrard tempted Patrice Evra to take the player instead of the ball and concede a rare home penalty .
Gerrard scored it and planted a kiss on a cameraman 's lens by way of celebration , clearly not expecting his afternoon to get even better .
All Liverpool needed do was hang on to their lead .
The closest United came to scoring in the second half was through a couple of Reina handling mistakes .
Yet the home side were so ragged in midfield and nervous in defence they virtually invited their opponents to push for more , and once Vidic had been dismissed for hauling down Gerrard they needed no further asking .
Ferguson had just sent on all his three substitutes together but watched powerlessly with them as Fábio Aurélio scored direct from the free - kick .
Before Andrea Dossena wrapped things up in the final minute by chipping Edwin van der Sar straight from a Reina clearance , Gerrard missed the easiest chance of the afternoon when he skied into the Stretford End .
It could easily have been five or even six , and if the comprehensiveness of the rout escaped Ferguson , the home fans who left the stadium barely half full by the end seemed to have got the message loud and clear .
Those that remained attempted to taunt Liverpool with chants that they would finish the season empty - handed , though that can no longer be taken for granted .
While the league remains a big ask , Liverpool will feed off this famous win should the sides ' paths cross again in Europe .
Sonar has been implicated in some strandings of whales and dolphins , but the mechanism by which acoustic pings might cause disorientation is uncertain .
Researchers at the University of Hawaii tested one possibility : that sonar can deafen marine mammals .
T. Aran Mooney , now at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , and colleagues exposed a bottlenose dolphin to naval sonar signals and then determined whether its hearing was affected .
The pings , about a half - second long and about one second apart , were recorded in Puget Sound , Washington , just before a stranding in 2005 .
As reported in Biology Letters , the dolphin suffered hearing loss for up to 40 minutes .
But the effect was seen only with repeated exposure to the sonar pings at very high sound levels .
The researchers calculated that a dolphin or other marine mammal would have to be within about 45 yards of a sonar source , and stay within that range for several minutes , for temporary deafness to occur .
It seems unlikely that an animal would stay so close to the source of a sound that was causing it discomfort , so sonar - induced deafness may not be much of a factor in strandings .
But the researchers suggested that under certain conditions  multiple sonar sources , for example , or undersea features that reflect signals  an animal may not be able to avoid intense exposure .

A woman friend of mine recently commented about her guy : “ He ’s such a boy .
His towels are stinky .
And he does n’t seem to notice ! ”
Well , maybe he can’t smell the stinkyness .
According to recent research from the Monell Chemical Senses Center , women have much sharper noses .
Scientists collected microdroplets of perspiration , and had men and women sniff the vials .
According to both , the odors were equally rich .
Subjects were then asked to rate odor strength when sniffing the sweat mixed one by one with 32 different fragrances .
Only two of the fragrances stopped women from smelling the sweat .
But 19 fragrances successfully blocked it from male noses .
Body odor is special — the authors note that in previous studies men’s and women ’s scent detection did not differ when it came to other aromas .
The researchers also concluded that men’s odor is harder to mask than women ’s , regardless of who sniffs .
Only a fifth of the fragrances could cover up male odor .
But half of the scents masked female odor .
The researchers suggest that for women there may be important biological information contained in male sweat .
So maybe do n’t wash those towels just yet .

Afghan narcotics officials Sunday destroyed 6.5 tons of drugs and precursor chemicals in a raging bonfire they said symbolized recent successes in their fight against opium poppies and heroin .
The drugs , burned in a large pile on a sloping mountainside on the outskirts of Kabul , were confiscated over the last three to four months , said Gen. Khodaidad Khodaidad , the country ’s counter - narcotics minister .
“ This is a big success against terrorism , against people who are producing poppies , ” said Khodaidad .
“ Poppy mainly supports the insurgency in Afghanistan . ”
The Taliban and other warlords may have earned almost half a billion dollars in 2008 from the opium trade , the head of the U.N. 's Office on Drugs and Crime has said .
Afghan officials have also been implicated in the trade .

Khodaidad acknowledged that the 6.5 - ton stockpile of heroin , opium , hashish and chemicals used to turn opium into heroin amounted to only a drop in the bucket .
A U.N. report last year said Afghan farmers produced 7,700 tons of opium in 2008 with an export value estimated at $ 3.4 billion .
Gen . Dawood Dawood , the top counter - narcotics officer in the Interior Ministry , said officials hoped to increase the number of poppy - free provinces from 18 last year to 26 this year .
Khodaidad , perhaps providing a more realistic assessment , said he hoped the number increases to 22 or 23 this year .
Dawood said Sunday ’s bonfire was a “ big achievement ” for the country ’s counter - narcotics police .
“ If we do not burn the drugs , thousands of others will become drug addicts , ” he said .
“ By burning this amount of opium and narcotics , we show the people we are committed to the fight against drugs . ”
Canadians take a keen interest in what Ottawa is doing to protect the nation from spies , terrorists and other threats , judging from the 6.5 million hits the Canadian Security Intelligence Service ( CSIS ) recorded on its website last year .
But CSIS seems uninterested in telling Canadians much about itself , notwithstanding outgoing Director Jim Judd 's assertion that the agency " remains committed to a policy of public accountability . "
How many terror suspects was CSIS keeping a watchful eye on last year ?
What threats did the agency uncover ?
Which countries are spying on us ?
In what countries were CSIS personnel busiest , vetting would - be immigrants , visitors and refugees ?
When CSIS swaps information , who are its partners ?
And just how proficient are its 2,500 employees in foreign languages ?
These are all questions that CSIS should be able to handle without throwing national security into the dumpster .
But sadly , none of them is answered in the CSIS annual report for 2007 - 2008 , made public this month .
The report is embarrassingly thin .
Whoever replaces Judd should supply more content in next year 's effort .
At the most basic level , CSIS should let us know how big the domestic threat is .
In Britain , Prime Minister Gordon Brown spells it out : last year MI5 tracked 2,000 terror suspects in 200 networks with 30 active plots .
And former CSIS director Ward Elcock said in 2002 that he was tracking 50 groups and 300 people .
Last year CSIS and its partners passed 348 " threat assessments " on to various agencies , but the report does n't say what sort of threats .
Who 's behind the foreign spying in Canada ?
Again , CSIS does n't say .
It just warns that " foreign espionage ... is in fact growing . "
Overseas , CSIS vetted nearly 400,000 people last year who wanted to come to Canada .
But the agency does n't say which were the countries of greatest concern .
And CSIS seems proud of the 276 information - swapping deals it has with 147 countries , but does n't say which ones .
How language - proficient are CSIS agents ?
Well , CSIS says 42 per cent of its intelligence officers speak a foreign language .
But we do n't know what languages they speak .
Compare that to the Federal Bureau of Investigation , which reported proudly that it had more than 200 Arabic - speakers , 120 Chinese , 100 Russian , 50 Farsi and so on .
This is n't good enough , and CSIS was told as much more than two years ago by consultants who found Canada was " lagging behind " other countries in reporting .
The consultants specifically noted some of the concerns raised in this editorial .
And they warned that the agency 's credibility and reputation might suffer .
CSIS hailed the advice as constructive and said future reports would reflect it .
We can only hope that Judd 's successor does better .
The ACLU has obtained thousands of unredacted documents regarding the military 's internal investigations into charges of detainee abuse as a result of our ongoing FOIA litigation .
The uncensored documents are from the Church Report and five separate CID investigations of deaths and abuse in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay .
The unredacted pages from the Church report were previously classified .
Describing investigations of deaths at Bagram in 2002 , the report refers to alleged behavior of military personnel as " clearly abusive , and clearly not in keeping with any approved interrogation policy or guidance . "
The report notes that " In both instances , the deaths followed interrogation sessions in which unauthorized techniques were allegedly employed , but in both cases , these sessions were followed by further alleged abusive behavior outside of the interrogation booth . "
The ACLU also obtained reports of investigations into deaths that took place in Afganistan and Iraq – as well as Abu Ghraib abuses .
Although several have been reported on already , this is the first time the military investigations have been released in full .
They include :
Investigation of two deaths at Bagram .
Both detainees were determined to have been killed by pulmonary embolism caused as a result of standing chained in place , sleep depravation and dozens of beatings by guards and possibly interrogators .
( Also reveals the use of torture at Gitmo and American - Afghani prisons in Kabul )
Investigation into the homicide or involuntary manslaughter of detainee Dilar Dababa by U.S. forces in 2003 in Iraq .
Investigation launched after allegations that an Iraqi prisoner was subjected to torture and abuse at " The Disco " ( located in the Special Operations Force Compound in Mosul Airfield , Mosul , Iraq ) .
The abuse consisted of filling his jumpsuit with ice , then hosing him down and making him stand for long periods of time , sometimes in front of an air conditioner ; forcing him to lay down and drink water until he gagged , vomited or choked , having his head banged against a hot steel plate while hooded and interrogated ; being forced to do leg lifts with bags of ice placed on his ankles , and being kicked when he could not do more .
Investigation of allegations of torture and abuse that took place in 2003 at Abu Ghraib .
Investigation that established probable cause to believe that U.S. forces committed homicide in 2003 when they participated in the binding of detainee Abed Mowhoush in a sleeping bag during an interrogation , causing him to die of asphyxiation .

She was n’t invited to the opening of the White House garden , and she understands why the Obamas would want “ to keep a kind of distance from me and from that whole celebrity chef ” aura .
Barack Obama got upset during the campaign that he was painted as a finicky elitist after he complained about the price of arugula at Whole Foods .
She ’s well aware of the criticism leveled at her in blogs for condescension and food snobbery .
In a post on Friday called “ Alice in Wonderland , ” National Review stirred the pot against her : “ The truth is , organic food is an expensive luxury item , something bought by those who have the resources . ”
She says wryly : “ I ’m just put into that arugulance place .
I own a fancy restaurant .
I own an expensive restaurant .
I never thought of it as fancy .
People do n’t know we ’re supporting 85 farms and ranches and all of that .
“ And so my first thing I say , it ’s going to cost more and I want to pay for my food .
I go to the farmers ’ market ; it makes me feel like I ’m making a donation . ”
Since the Obamas have n’t taken her up on her offer of a “ kitchen cabinet , ” she wants to do her first TV show called “ The Green Kitchen . ”
She can do a soliloquy on the “ discernment ” of choosing the most ambrosial orange .
But she also says that a recession is a time when people need to learn the basics  “ a kind of everyday cooking , in a really tasty way .
We ’re really trying to take the ‘ ie ’ out of foodie . ”
She says she ’s sick of hearing about diets and obesity in America , and believes neither would be so prevalent if her European - style “ delicious revolution ” succeeded .
Waters is a visionary .
She imagines a “ peace garden ” on the Gaza Strip that would employ people “ from all sides . ”
She imagines a high school where the kids could run the whole cafeteria themselves , learning math , nutrition , art and food .
She imagines starting gardens at Monticello and Mount Vernon that would “ become the source of all food in the White House . ”
She imagines food being covered on the front page and the business page  not the food page , or on TV by “ lesser ” reporters like “ the weatherman . ”
Her most ambitious vision involves President Obama , who did n’t want beets in his garden .
“ I would just like to serve him some golden beets sometime that were roasted in the oven , that were not overcooked , that were dressed with a lovely little vinaigrette , maybe even diced in a salad , ” she says in her seductive way .
“ Squeeze ‘em with a little lime .
It ’s fantastically nutritious . ”
Save the Mile Houses !
Save the Mile Houses ! is a grassroots movement to campaign against the metrification of the historic Mile Houses of Highway 97 in central British Columbia , Canada .
The Canadian Federal Government , under pressure from the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne , Switzerland and VANOC in Vancouver , has recently passed legislation to ensure that the names " conform to the internationally accepted metric system " before the Winter Olympics in February 2010 .
Hate to be one of those ' Engadget had it first jerks ' ... but Gawker had this up and is attributing it to a different source , which can only mean ...
One of you is clearly plagiarizing !
You can only hope the original author died and had one of those stickers .
( See , I was going somewhere with this )
After the suggestion in one of this site ’s comments stating that it required more faith to be an atheist than a theist , because the non-existence of a deity can never be proven , I thought it would be fun to see if we can logically disprove the existence of “ God ” .
I picked the Christian God because I am more familiar with the Christian faith than any other , I ’ve read the bible and have previously lived with devout Christians .
I feel qualified .
So let ’s see where this goes …
For this to work , we have to agree on the following two statements , and accept that Christians believe them to the true : –
God is infallible
The Bible is the true word of God
These are n’t outrageous statements , and in fact , have been echoed on this very blog numerous times in the comments .
The two statements above are clearly interdependent .
The Bible tells Christians that God is infallible , and Christians believe the Bible because they believe it was written by an infallible deity .
Almost a self - fulfilling prophecy , almost .
So the start of our logical deduction must be the Bible , so let ’s concentrate on that .
Let ’s take the Christian God ’s greatest act , creating the world and all who live on it ( indirectly ) .
The start of all this , on God ’s own words : “ For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth , the sea and all that is in them , and rested on the seventh day ” .
Using genealogy , we can roughly estimate the age of the earth , as stated by the Bible , to be 6500 years .
The very top estimate would be close to 10,000 years , but that ’s a stretch .
Science has proven that the earth is closer to 4.5 billion years old .
Radiometric dating has shown us this , and has remained consistent with lunar and terrestrial samples .
In other words , we have n’t just tested this once in one situation , it ’s been extensively tested .
This is n’t a guess , or a hunch , there ’s a substantial amount of evidence to back this up .
And that ’s the geological age of the earth .
What about the creatures on the earth ?
We , as human beings , were created 6500 years ago , according to the Bible , starting with Adam and then Eve .
The oldest discovered human fossil is approximately 1,300,000 ( 1.3 million ) years old .
That would have meant that humans lived on earth before God created either humans or the earth .
In fact , depending on how much evidence you consider to be acceptable , and how you define us as a species , you could place humans at between 1.8 million and 130,000 years old .
No one could sensibly claim that humans are less than 130,000 years old .
There is simply too much evidence available for our inspection .
Either way , much older than the Bible ’s claims .
Let ’s take another example .
God decided that the earth needed cleansing , so he instructed Noah to gather up two of ever species to save .
Everything other than Noah , his family ( or part of his family ) and the animals he chose to save would be killed .
There are around 10 MILLION known species of animal on our planet .
Male and female , that would be 20 million animals Noah saved .
I ’ve never seen a boat that big , even with modern engineering techniques .
Noah also would have had to travel to different parts of the earth to collect the various animals .
You rarely see a penguin and a scorpion living in the same location ( zoos do n’t count ) .
He then , after the waters had receded , would have had to return them to their original locations .
You also have to question to environment on board Noah ’s Ark , an environment that could sustain animals that require intense heat and animals that require intense cold , as well as Noah and his family that required a more moderate climate .
Impossible .
Just so we ’re clear , I ’m establishing that that the Bible is inaccurate .
Not just inaccurate , but massively inaccurate .
There are more examples of course , some which make it clear that the author of the Bible thinks the world is flat , some which make it clear that the author thought the world did not move and then there are more considered examples , such as the value of pi being unknown at the time ( surely God would have known it !?! ) .
So this is my statement , logically derived from the above .
“ The Bible is inaccurate – therefore God is fallible – therefore the definition of God is incorrect – therefore God does not exist . ”
To add a touch of justification to this , let ’s break it down .
We know the Bible is inaccurate , in fact the Bible is contradictory within its own pages .
The Bible is the only place that defines God , and God is defined as being infallible .
The Bible is also stated as being of God ’s word ( albeit written by man , see below ) .
Seeing as we know the only source that defines the Christian God is inaccurate , and at least part of the definition is inaccurate ( infallible ) , we can not trust the remainder of the definition .
Therefore the definition of God in invalid and God does not exist .
There will come arguments from Christians that while God is infallible , and the Bible is the true word of God , the Bible was in fact written by man , who is fallible .
This does not hold up when you examine the scale and volume of inaccuracies held within the Bible .
I can understand man rounding down the value of pi , for example , but to get the entire creation story wrong is a bit of a stretch .
Likewise , given that God is all powerful , he surely would not have left an obviously inaccurate account of his greatest work go to press , or was that just another sign of his fallibility ?
I think I ’ve made a stronger argument , based on Christian beliefs , for the non existence of God than there ever has been for the existence of such a deity .
My own definition of mindfulness is very simple :
Mindfulness is the gentle effort to be continuously present with experience .
But I like Jon Kabat - Zinn ’s definition of mindfulness :
“ Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way ;
On purpose ,
in the present moment , and
nonjudgmentally . ”
Kabat - Zinn , if you have n’t heard of him , is a famous teacher of mindfulness meditation and the founder of the Mindfulness - Based Stress Reduction program at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center .
Paying attention “ on purpose ”
First of all , mindfulness involves paying attention “ on purpose ” .
Mindfulness involves a conscious direction of our awareness .
We sometimes ( me included ) talk about “ mindfulness ” and “ awareness ” as if they were interchangeable terms , but that ’s not a good habit to get into .
I may be aware I ’m irritable , but that would n’t mean I was being mindful of my irritability .
In order to be mindful I have to be purposefully aware of myself , not just vaguely and habitually aware .
Knowing that you are eating is not the same as eating mindfully .
Let ’s take that example of eating and look at it a bit further .
When we are purposefully aware of eating , we are consciously being aware of the process of eating .
We ’re deliberately noticing the sensations and our responses to those sensations .
We ’re noticing the mind wandering , and when it does wander we purposefully bring our attention back .
When we ’re eating unmindfully we may in theory be aware of what we ’re doing , but we ’re probably thinking about a hundred and one other things at the same time , and we may also be watching TV , talking , or reading — or even all three !
So a very small part of our awareness is absorbed with eating , and we may be only barely aware of the physical sensations and even less aware of our thoughts and emotions .
Because we ’re only dimly aware of our thoughts , they wander in an unrestricted way .
There ’s no conscious attempt to bring our attention back to our eating .
There ’s no purposefulness .
This purposefulness is a very important part of mindfulness .
Having the purpose of staying with our experience , whether that ’s the breath , or a particular emotion , or something as simple as eating , means that we are actively shaping the mind .
Paying attention “ in the present moment ”
Left to itself the mind wanders through all kinds of thoughts — including thoughts expressing anger , craving , depression , revenge , self - pity , etc .
As we indulge in these kinds of thoughts we reinforce those emotions in our hearts and cause ourselves to suffer .
Mostly these thoughts are about the past or future .
The past no longer exists .
The future is just a fantasy until it happens .
The one moment we actually can experience — the present moment — is the one we seem most to avoid .
So in mindfulness we ’re concerned with noticing what ’s going on right now .
That does n’t mean we can no longer think about the past or future , but when we do so we do so mindfully , so that we ’re aware that right now we ’re thinking about the past or future .
However in meditation , we are concerned with what ’s arising in the present moment .
When thoughts about the past or future take us away from our present moment experience and we “ space out ” we try to notice this and just come back to now .
By purposefully directing our awareness away from such thoughts and towards the “ anchor ” or our present moment experience , we decrease their effect on our lives and we create instead a space of freedom where calmness and contentment can grow .
Paying attention “ non-judgmentally ”
Mindfulness is an emotionally non-reactive state .
We do n’t judge that this experience is good and that one is bad .
Or if we do make those judgements we simply notice them and let go of them .
We do n’t get upset because we ’re experiencing something we do n’t want to be experiencing or because we ’re not experiencing what we would rather be experiencing .
We simply accept whatever arises .
We observe it mindfully .
We notice it arising , passing through us , and ceasing to exist .
Whether it ’s a pleasant experience or a painful experience we treat it the same way .
Cognitively , mindfulness is aware that certain experiences are pleasant and some are unpleasant , but on an emotional level we simply do n’t react .
We call this “ equanimity ” — stillness and balance of mind .
yeah i probably pissed off iSevenx when i said that , but he can suck it too .

20 Different Areas to Think About for a Cheaper Auto Insurance Policy
Last week , I saved $ 100 off my auto insurance policy .
It ’s really pretty easy and there ’s probably nothing you do n’t already know .
All I did was take action .
Call , comparison shop , and keep calling .
While I was looking through different options and telling my insurance agent again that his price was too high , I made a list of what could save us more money on auto insurance .
May you find more savings than I do by calling your agent today .
The Details
No Accidents – Everyone knows that having no accidents on record for three years ( some companies want five years , others want ten years ) lowers your rate but have you tried to find out recently ?
No Violations ( Tickets ) – Read point # 1 again please .
Experience – Young drivers are much more likely to get into car accidents so the premiums are high .
It could be worthwhile to buy an old beater for your children while they gain experience .
I ’m sure they are happier since they have access to their own car as well .
The Car – How come no one really thinks about insurance when they need to buy a car ?
Some of us are are finally starting to worry about gas mileages but insurance can be a major car expensive .
Calling ( or easier yet , getting a free online insurance quote ) before you buy the car can literally save you thousands of dollars for the few years that you own that car .
Has Air Bags , Alarm , Anti-lock brakes , Daytime Running lights – Getting an alarm installed is always safer but it may also make financial sense because it could lower your premiums .
Muted Colors –
Ever noticed that bright colored cars are pulled over just a little more often ?
They are easier to spot in a sea of over - speeding maniacs on the road and the insurance companies know this too .
Good Student –
Do you go to school and get good grades ?
Fax them your report car and get an automatic discount .
Seldom Drive the Car – Remember to calculate the mileage correctly when you get your policy .
The less you drive your vehicle , the lower the premium should be .
Are Part of a Professional Association – Every insurance company partners with many professional associations , and it ’s easier to find out if you can benefit by doing it online since they show the full list .
Decisions
More Deductible – Most of the time , you will find that raising the deductible will drastically lower your premium .
If you average out the chances of accidents , it probably makes sense .
With these statistics , the more cars your family owns and the longer the period that you are thinking about , the more reducing your deductible works in your favor .
Reduce Coverage – I know some friends that have older cars who get the least coverage they can get by for their car because it ’s not worth the premium at all .
Unless you have an expensive and new car , think about how much fixes could be and whether paying money every month is worth it .
Do n’t Double Your Medical Coverage – Our medical insurance at work may already cover what our car insurance covers .
Take some time and look it over to see whether we are double paying .
Ask Your Family to Help –
It may not make sense for you to venture out on your own if you do n’t have at least 10 years of driving experience .
You are allowed to be on the same policy as long as you live under the same roof .
Ask for help .
Take Action
Keep at It – Just keep calling every year .
As you gain more experience on the road , age and also become married and have kids , your premium slowly goes down .
Let those insurance agents know that you are on top of your policy and will always try to get the lowest price possible .
Ask for Discounts –
When I called my insurance agent , he did n’t tell me about a new policy discount until I threatened to switch to someone else .
Just because they are lazy does n’t mean there is no ways to save .
Comparison Shop –
That ’s why it ’s so important to comparison shop .
When you have another quote in your hands with a lower price , everyone all of a sudden becomes attentive and willing .
Having Other Insurance with the Same Company – Always run the numbers , but most insurance companies give discounts if you insure different assets with them ( house , car , boat and even life insurance etc )
Stay with the Same Insurance Company – I actually do n’t think this is really worth the discount as competitive is almost always the best driver for a lower premium .
Take a Driver Improve Course for Elders – Those courses are BORING but if it means saving a few bucks , why not ?
Pay Up Front Instead of Monthly – Some companies charge you less if you can prepay for six ( or twelve ) months .
Every little cent counts .
Call now and save yourself some money .
About a year ago , a book came out in England that made a fascinating prediction : at some point in the future , the author wrote , six top officials in the Bush Administration would get a tap on the shoulder announcing that they were being arrested on international charges of torture .
Philippe Sands Illustration by Tom Bachtell
If the prediction seemed improbable , the background of the book ’s author was even more so .
Philippe Sands is neither a journalist nor an American but a law professor and a certified Queen ’s Counsel ( the kind of barrister who on occasion wears a powdered horsehair wig ) who works at the same law practice as Cherie Blair .
Sands ’s book , “ Torture Team , ” offers a scathing critique of officials in the Bush Administration , accusing them of complicity in acts of torture .
When the book appeared , some scoffed .
Douglas Feith , a former Pentagon official , dismissed Sands as “ a British lawyer ” who “ wrote an extremely dishonest book . ”
Last week , Sands ’s accusations suddenly did not seem so outlandish .
A Spanish court took the first steps toward starting a criminal investigation of the same six former Bush Administration officials he had named , weighing charges that they had enabled and abetted torture by justifying the abuse of terrorism suspects .
Among those whom the court singled out was Feith , the former Under - Secretary of Defense for Policy , along with former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ; John Yoo , a former Justice Department lawyer ; and David Addington , the chief of staff and the principal legal adviser to Vice - President Dick Cheney .
In Washington the other night , over a cup of camomile tea , Sands described the behind - the - scenes role he played in spurring the Spanish court to action .
He paced his hotel room , seeming by turns proud and stunned at what he had done .
“ This is the end of these people ’s professional reputations ! ” he said .
“ This is no joke .
We ’re talking about the serious potential deprivation of liberty . ”
Sands said that he had “ no personal vendetta ” against the Bush Administration , but he does see a link between his family history and his chosen profession .
His mother and her parents were Viennese Jews who barely survived the Holocaust ; his mother spent the first seven years of her life in hiding , away from her family .
“ It inculcated a burning sense of being aggrieved at wrongdoing , and at the failure of people to take responsibility for their actions , ” Sands said .
Sands got his first chance to demonstrate his convictions professionally in 1998 .
He was in Paris , for the unveiling of his grandfather ’s gravestone , when he received a call asking him to represent Augusto Pinochet , the former Chilean dictator .
He told his wife , Natalia Schiffrin , about the offer .
“ Philippe , if you do , ” Sands recalls her saying , “ I will divorce you ! ”
( She is American , and the daughter of the book publisher André Schiffrin , a founder of Students for a Democratic Society . )
Sands declined the case .
Instead , he signed on to represent the other side , and helped pursue Pinochet for violations of international law .
The case became a turning point in international law , establishing the principle that there is no immunity even for the highest - ranking former government officials when they are accused of torture .
Pinochet spent some sixteen months under house arrest .
A decade later , the same Spanish judge who initiated the legal proceedings against Pinochet , Baltasar Garzón , has been assigned to the case against the Bush Administration officials .
The current torture case began in the spring of 2004 , when photographs of abused prisoners at Abu Ghraib surfaced .
Sands said that he read the protestations of innocence from Bush Administration officials , who blamed a few “ bad apples ” for the incidents , with the eye of a barrister .
He recalled , “ I could spot right away that they were speaking as advocates of a cause .
So I decided to find out what really happened . ”
While keeping up his busy law practice , he travelled to America to interview the key players in what he described as “ a writing project I am engaged in on international law and the war on terror . ”
Many Bush officials , including Feith and William J. Haynes II , the former Pentagon general counsel , who was also named in the Spanish lawsuit , agreed to meet with Sands , perhaps expecting a friendly chat .
“ I spent two years trekking around the country , finding out that they were manifestly untruthful , ” Sands said .
“ I ’ve got a particular bugbear about lawyers , ” he added .
“ If not for lawyers , none of these abuses would have ever occurred . ”
As Sands went about his research , he conferred with human - rights experts all over Europe on his findings .
Word spread that he had the makings of a high - level war - crimes case .
Sands wo n’t reveal exactly which human - rights authorities he consulted .
But , in recent months , one of them was Gonzalo Boye , the Chilean - born Spanish lawyer who last week filed the criminal complaint against the Bush officials , on behalf of five former prisoners who were , they allege , tortured in the U.S. military prison at Guantánamo Bay .
Boye said last week of Sands , “ Let me just say that he played a very big role in my thinking .
His book showed me who the targets were . ”
Feith , reached on the phone , called Sands ’s book “ wildly inaccurate . ”
He said , “ It ’s not a happy thing for the Spanish Court to think of prosecuting Americans for advice they gave to the President of the United States ! ”
It is hard to predict what will happen next , but , if arrest warrants are issued , the Obama Administration may be forced either to extradite the former officials or to start its own investigation .
Sands , who admires Obama , said , “ I regret that I have added to his in - box when he has so much else to sort out .
But I hope he does the right thing .
There ’s not much dispute anymore : torture happened , and the law is clear — torture must be punished . ”
Meanwhile , Sands reiterated a warning that he made in his book .
“ If I were they , ” he said , referring to the former officials in question , “ I would think carefully before setting foot outside the United States .
They are now , and forever in the future , at risk of arrest .
Until this is sorted out , they are in their own legal black hole . ” ♦
At first sight , it seems strange that the Government should rank influenza as the biggest threat facing the country .
After all , flu is a familiar foe .
It turns up every winter .
And though it does kill some people – very old , very young , or already infirm – the worst that most of us needs to fear is a few unpleasant days in bed .
In an age which has defeated smallpox , and is even steadily beating back cancer , it would not seem to present much of a problem .
Wealthier and healthier than ever , we have come to assume that we left the threat of devastating plagues behind way back in history .
In comparison with the much - publicised terrorist threat , it seems small beer indeed .
And yet , ministers are right .
The danger of a pandemic – which they reckon could kill 750,000 people in Britain alone – is all too real , for every so often , the disease goes though an evolutionary leap .
Normally an existing flu virus undergoes a slight mutation , which enables it to infect some people who have built up immunity from previous bouts of the disease .
But some three or four times a century , a completely new one arrives , apparently from nowhere .
No one has any immunity against it so – if it is vicious enough , and once it has learned to spread from person to person – it is free to commit mass slaughter .

That is what happened in 1918 - 19 , when a new strain of flu tore through the war - weary world , carrying off 50 million people , including 250,000 Britons .
More died from it in their beds than perished on all the battlefields of the murderous Great War itself .
And , like all the nastiest pandemic viruses , it targeted the young and healthy , rather than the old and frail , treacherously provoking robust immune systems to overreact so that they kill their owners rather than the virus .
Since then , there have been two much milder pandemics , in 1957 and 1968 .
Experts agree that another is long overdue , and have been warning that we are unlikely to get off lightly a third time in a row .
But until yesterday , they were concentrating on the avian flu that has spread out of Asia to infect birds around the world .
H5N1 , , is truly scary ; 250 people have been killed by it , more than half those known to have been infected .
But it has not yet become infectious between people .
Scientist worried that it might do so by infecting a pig already harbouring a different , human flu virus , since the animals are susceptible to both : the two could then mix their DNA , creating a deadly new strain that could pass from person to person .
But even at the height of concern about H5N1 four years ago , some experts were warning that the new pandemic might emerge from elsewhere .
And this could be what has just happened .
The latest virus , A / H1N1 , that is rapidly spreading through North America is new and contains a mixture of bird , pig and human strains .
Early reports suggest that it takes most of its victims among healthy 25 to 45 year olds .
The World Health Organisation says it has " pandemic potential " , but nobody yet knows whether it will indeed sweep through the world and , if it does , how deadly it will be .
The bad news is that it is related to the H1N1 strain that caused the 1918 - 19 plague .
But there is good news in that too , for the remnants of that virus hung around into the 1950s , which may give the over 50s some protection .
If it does decide to spread , it will do so quickly .
In 1918 - 19 , flu chugged across the world at the speed of steam , taking five or six months to become universal .
Now , like a jet plane , flu can circle the world in little more than a day .
And once out , as it is now , nothing can stop a determined virus .
Checking airports for infected passengers , as Japan is doing , is a waste of time : victims are infectious for several days before they show any symptoms .
But again , there is ground for hope .
Flu , experts say , normally tends not to spread in the summer ; it prefers autumn and winter weather , passing between children as they return to school .
Partly because of a vigorous campaign by this newspaper over bird flu , ministers tardily decided to follow other developed countries by amassing big stocks of Tamiflu and Relenza , two drugs that seem to work against the new strain .
And even if it does spread , we might , conceivably , get lucky for a third time , should it turn out to be a mild strain ; because two pandemic viruses never seem to rage at the same time , it might keep H5N1 at bay .
Despite the financial crisis and the looming threat from Iran , the War and Peace Index , published on Israel 's 61st Independence Day , found that the majority of the Israeli public is positive , optimistic and satisfied with the state of the nation .
The War and Peace Index is conducted by the Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research .
Published monthly since 1994 , it is run by Prof. Ephraim Yaar and Prof. Tamar Hermann and is compiled of a monthly telephone survey of 600 Israeli citizens representing the various sectors in Israeli society .

The survey found that 80 % of the Jews polled defined their personal status as " very good " or " good , " 90 % said they think Israel is doing " very well " as a nation ; and 81 % said they were " very optimistic " or " optimistic " as to the nation 's future .
Some 81 % also said that given their choice of countries to live in , they would prefer to stay in Israel .
Among the Israeli Arabs polled , 51 % said their personal status was " very good , " as opposed to 36 % that described it as " bad " or " very bad . "
Two - thirds said that the nation 's achievements are " good " or " fairly good , " and a similar percentage expressed optimism as to the nation 's future .
An overwhelming majority – 94 % – said they want to keep living in Israel .
Optimistic , yet realistic
Eighty - one percent of the Israelis surveyed said the State faired best in the fields of military and security , defining its accomplishments in those avenues as " very good . "
The War and Peace Index also found that 71 % of Israelis think that people are not as patriotic as they use to be in the past .
Other figures indicated that 59 % think that Israel has been able to create a stable , modern economy and 53 % think it has become a successful democracy .
Still , only 46 % of those polled said they thought the State has been able to infuse a sense of national unity in the public , only 38 % said that Israel has made significant achievements in the fields of science and technology ; as little as 28 % said the country has been successful in giving equal rights to its Arab citizens and just 27 % said they thought Israel has been able make actual progress for peace .
The most disconcerting data revealed that the Israeli public 's faith in state systems is dwindling :
While 91 % said they had every faith in the Israeli Defense Forces , only 57 % said they trusted the Supreme Court , only 43 % lent credibility to the media , 39 % said they trusted the police , only a third of the public has faith in the government and the Knesset ( 34 % and 30 % respectively ) , and only 21 % believe in the political parties .
Among Israeli Arabs , 67 % believe in the Supreme Court , 55 % have faith in the media , 40 % trust the Knesset , 33 % trust the police , and 31 % believe in the government and the political parties ; however , only 22 % trust the IDF .
Stephen Wolfram says his new search engine will be ' a paradigm for the web '
A web tool that " could be as important as Google " , according to some experts , has been shown off to the public .
Wolfram Alpha is the brainchild of British - born physicist Stephen Wolfram .
The free program aims to answer questions directly , rather than display web pages in response to a query like a search engine .
The " computational knowledge engine " , as the technology is known , will be available to the public from the middle of May this year .
" Our goal is to make expert knowledge accessible to anyone , anywhere , anytime , " said Dr Wolfram at the demonstration at Harvard University 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society .
The tool computes many of the answers " on the fly " by grabbing raw data from public and licensed databases , along with live feeds such as share prices and weather information .
People can use the system to look up simple facts - such as the height of Mount Everest - or crunch several data sets together to produce new results , such as a country 's GDP .
Other functions solve complex mathematical equations , plot scientific figures or chart natural events .
" Like interacting with an expert , it will understand what you 're talking about , do the computation , and then present you with the results , " said Dr Wolfram .
As a result , much of the data is scientific , although there is also limited cultural information about pop stars and films .
Dr Wolfram said the " trillions of pieces of data " were chosen and managed by a team of " experts " at Wolfram Research , who also massage the information to make sure it can be read and displayed by the system .
Nova Spivak , founder of the web tool Twine , has described Alpha as having the potential to be as important to the web as Google .
Developers say Wolfram Alpha can simplify language to remove ' linguistic fluff '
" Wolfram Alpha is like plugging into a vast electronic brain , " he wrote earlier this year .
" It computes answers - it does n't merely look them up in a big database . "
Learning language
The new tool uses a technique known as natural language processing to return answers .
This allows users to ask questions of the tool using normal , spoken language rather than specific search terms .
For example , a relatively simple search , such as " who was the president of Brazil in 1923 ? " , will return the answer " Artur da Silva Bernardes " .
This technique has long been the holy grail of computer scientists who aim to allow people to interact with computers in an instinctive way .
Dr Wolfram said that Alpha has solved many of the problems of interpreting people 's questions .
" We thought there would be a huge amount of ambiguity in search terms , but it turns out not to be the case , " he said .
In addition , he said , the system had got " pretty good at removing linguistic fluff " , the kinds of words that are not necessary for the system to find and compute the relevant data .
Searching for ' Blair Bush ' could give a different result ...
Simple text However , he said , most users tend to stop using structured sentences fairly quickly .
" Pretty soon they get lazy , and they say ' I do n't need all those extra words ' . "
Instead they tended to use " concepts " similar to how most people use search engines today .
But Dr Boris Katz of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , a natural language expert , said he was " disappointed " by Dr Wolfram 's " dismissal of English syntax as ' fluff ' ' ' .
For example , he said , suppose someone asks '' When did Barack Obama visit Nicolas Sarkozy ? "
" Here , understanding the sentence structure is important if you want to be able to distinguish cases where it was Barack Obama who visited Nicolas from cases where it was Nicolas Sarkozy who visited Barack Obama , " he said .
... than searching for ' Bush Blair ' " I believe he is misguided in treating language as a nuisance instead of trying to understand the way it organises concepts into structures that require understanding and harnessing . "
Dr Katz is the head of the Start project , a natural language processing tool that claims to be " the world 's first web - based question answering system " .
It has been on the web since December 1993 .
Like Alpha , the system searches a series of organised databases to return relevant answers to search queries .
However , it only uses public databases and runs on a much smaller scale than Alpha .
Dr Katz said it answers " millions of questions from hundreds of thousands of users from around the world " on topics as diverse as places , movies , people and dictionary definitions .
It is also able to compute answers from several sources in a similar way to Alpha .
Web companies have also harnessed natural language processing .
For example , Powerset uses technology developed at the Palo Alto Research Center , the former research laboratories of Xerox .
The company is attempting to build a similar search engine " that reads and understands every sentence on the Web " .
In May 2008 , the company released a tool that allowed people to search parts of Wikipedia .
Two months later , it was acquired by Microsoft .
Dr Wolfram said he has been working on Alpha for several years .
However , he imagines that it will continue to evolve .
" In a sense we are at the beginning , " he said .

In this posting I take break from the testing PHP session as I had some urgent work to do on a web application I have written 4 years ago .
In this article I explain how to setup a small stand - alone web server written in Perl to test a web application .
I am also busy writing the Perl 6 Tricks and Treats
This entry was first sent out as part of the Test Automation Tips .

Testing a Web application without a lot of setup I wrote CPAN :: Forum a web forum more than 4 years ago and have not worked on it for a long time .
Recently a bunch of spammers decided to post their stupid ads and the forum does not have a way to fight it .
So after long period of not touching the code this will be a good reason to start working on it again .
At a minimum I 'll have to add a way to remove posts using the web interface and then give such right to some of the users .
Unfortunately the test suite is broken and probably covers only a small fraction of the code .
I know this for sure .
The TODO file had " Write Tests " three times on the top row .
So first , before I can work on the new feature I have to add a reasonable test suite .
As I do n't want to configure Apache every time the tests run I wanted to have a way to run them in stand - alone mode .
Here is where HTTP :: Server : : Simple comes in the picture .
Using HTTP :: Server :: Simple for test setup
Simple web server Just in a few lines it allows me to write a simple web server : I need two things .
One of them is a module that I called MyServer.pm which is a subclass of HTTP :: Server : : Simple : : CGI and contains the following code : package MyServer ; use strict ; use warnings ; use base qw( HTTP :: Server : : Simple : : CGI ) ; sub handle_request { my ( $ self , $ cgi ) = @_ ; print " Hello World " ; return ; } 1 ;
The handle_request method is the actual implementation of my " application " .
It has access to the CGI . pm object and whatever it prints to STDOUT will go back to your browser .
Theoretically you should send both the HTTP response and the HTTP headers but for simple cases such as above it will work without anything .
The second thing needed is a script which I called server.pl that - for the sake of simplicity - I placed in the same directory where the module is : use strict ; use warnings ; use FindBin ; use lib " $ FindBin : : Bin " ; use MyServer ; my $ server = MyServer - > new ; $ server - > run ; The FindBin part helps perl to find the module even if you are not running it from the directory where the script is .
Now if I run server.pl it will launch a web server on port 8080 and print the following message to the console : HTTP :: Server : : Simple :
You can connect to your server at http://localhost:8080/
So that 's what I did and it displayed " Hello World " in the browser .
A more complex server Now I can be really happy that I have been using CGI : Application for most of my web development lately as in that framework almost all the code goes into modules and the main script ( or mod_perl handler ) is just a few lines of code .
I can put those few lines in the MyServer.pm and I wo n't need to touch any other part of the application .
So the server.pl script remained the same and the MyServer.pm changed to the following code : package MyServer ; use strict ; use warnings ; use base qw( HTTP :: Server : : Simple :: CGI ) ; use CPAN :: Forum ; sub handle_request { my ( $ self , $ cgi ) = @_ ; print " HTTP / 1.0 200 OK\r
" ; my $ app = CPAN :: Forum -> new ( TMPL_PATH => " $ ENV{CPANFORUM_ROOT}/templates " , PARAMS => { ROOT => $ ENV{CPANFORUM_ROOT} , DB_CONNECT => " dbi: SQLite : $ENV{CPANFORUM_ROOT}/db/forum.db " , } , ) ; $ app - > run ; return ; } 1 ;
Here we load the CPAN :: Forum module , print the " 200 ok " HTTP response header and then the rest is a copy of the main script of CPAN :: Forum .
It just creates the CPAN :: Forum object with some parameters and then runs it .
Now if I run the server.pl script I can browse to the http://localhost:8080/
address and use it exactly as it was on the real server .
So I 'll be able to write test using this small server .
Static pages
There is one issue remaining .
I know CPAN :: Forum does not have a nice visual effect but even that was slightly broken when running off the simple server .
The reason is that normally the static files are handled by the web server and not the application and in our case nothing dealt with them .
So no css style sheet and no images were shown .
Javascript files would have had the same fate but no Javascript was used on this site .
In order to fix that I had to add some more code to MyServer.pm after some searching on CPAN I found HTTP :: Server : : Simple : : Static that was created exactly for this problem .
It is a mixin , adding a new method to the subclass I created :
Here is what I had to add to MyServer . pm use HTTP :: Server : : Simple : : Static ; Obviously , loading the module .
Then , just after the printing of the HTTP response I fetch the path_info from the CGI object which is the path in the requested URL .
If this indicates one of the static files then I hand it over to the serve_static method giving it the CGI object and the path to the root of the web server .
print " HTTP /1.0 200 OK\r
" ; my $ path = $ cgi -> path_info ; if ( $ path =~ m{^ / img / } or $ path eq '/ style.css ' ) { return $ self ->serve_static ( $ cgi , " $ENV{CPANFORUM_ROOT}/www " ) ; } #warn $ path ; my $ app = CPAN :: Forum -> new ( ...
The warn which commented out was used to find other requests that might need static handling .
That 's it for now .
In one of the coming issues I should report on how testing CPAN :: Forum progresses .

President Barack Obama nominated on Tuesday Julius Genachowski - a lawyer , techie and former venture capitalist - to head the Federal Communications Commission .
The nomination of Genachowski as chairman was widely anticipated and quickly applauded by proponents of net neutrality , who hope an Obama FCC will move decisively to limit what telecoms can and cannot do with internet traffic on their networks .
Genachowski , a former Harvard law classmate of Obama's , served as Obama 's top tech campaign advisor and helped shape the campaign 's embrace of having the government create and enforce net neutrality rules .
Gigi Sohn , president of net neutrality - backing organization Public Knowledge , applauded the announcement with a statement showing she 's already on a first name basis with Genachowski .
" Julius is an outstanding choice for FCC Chairman , " Sohn said .
" As the architect of President - elect Obama ’s Technology and Innovation Plan , it is clear that he understands the importance of open networks and a regulatory environment that promotes innovation and competition to a robust democracy and a health economy . "
Genachowski worked twice previously at the FCC , clerked for Supreme Court Justice David Souter , co-founded a venture capital firm .
He also worked for 8 years as an executive for IAC / IAC / InterActiveCorp .
While the FCC has not laid down any strict Net Neutrality rules , the commission ordered Comcast in August not to throttle peer - to - peer traffic .
The company is appealing that decision in federal court .
Genachowski , needs to be confirmed by the Senate , replaces Bush 's FCC chair Kevin Martin , who House Democrats accused of being heavy - handed .

After giving a straight answer to your question , I 'd like to also dispute the premise ; whenever a group of programmers characterizes the users of another language in this way , the odds are that they are telling you more about themselves than about the community they are describing .
You could , for example , accuse c programmers of being too obsessed with low level details , or haskell programmers with being blinded by their desire for functional purity ; perl mongers for brevity , etc .
But you would , IMHO , by getting the causality backwards when you do so .
When I want to write a program that is best expressed in a certain style , I try to choose a language that supports that style .
Sometimes you want a tool that lets you do unusual things , and for such a task having a language such as ruby is as valuable as having mathematica for math or javascript for browser manipulation in your toolkit .
If I want to play with typography I hop into postscript because that 's what it 's best at .
It 's like saying " Have you ever noticed that people who use power drills are always poking holes in things ? "
It 's true , but it kind of misses the point .
Instead of speaking out against Rush Limbaugh and acting like a real leader of the Republican party , John Cornyn is circulating this petition :
Bob Cesca :
Senator John Cornyn -- " Big John " -- is circulating a petition demanding that the Obama administration come clean about its " conspiracy " to smear Rush Limbaugh .
Seriously .
President Obama owes the American people an explanation .
His staff should apologize to the American people for supporting these tactics and diverting attention to the hard work that needs to be done to get America ’s economy back on track .
Please join me in signing this petition and calling on the Obama White House to come clean on this matter .
Yep .
A prominent Republican senator is circulating a petition in support of Rush Limbaugh .
While he's at it , Cornyn might as well fly down to Palm Beach in his cowboy drag to offer Limbaugh an luxurious sponge bath .
Cornyn's play is essentially trying to shift the blame from his own party 's failures that led this country headlong into a crater .
Talk about trying to shift the focus .
Why ca n't Big John just admit the truth and say that Rush is head of the Limbaugh National Committee .
Michael Steele proved that point when he groveled at the feet of Rush .
From this we may gather that Cornyn is among those that hopes President Obama will fail too .
And Cornyn wonders why America is solidly behind President Obama .
The Ford and Honda hybrids due out this month are among dozens planned for the coming years as automakers try to meet new fuel - efficiency standards and please politicians overseeing the industry ’s multibillion - dollar bailout .
Unfortunately for the automakers , hybrids are a tough sell these days .
Americans have cut back on buying vehicles of all types as the economy continues its slide .
But the slowdown has been particularly brutal for hybrids , which use electricity and gasoline as power sources .
They were the industry ’s darling just last summer , but sales have collapsed as consumers refuse to pay a premium for a fuel - efficient vehicle now that the average price of a gallon of gasoline nationally has slipped below $ 2 .
“ When gas prices came down , the priority of buying a hybrid fell off quite quickly , ” said Wes Brown , a partner at Los Angeles - based market research firm Iceology .
“ Yet even as consumer interest declined , the manufacturers have continued to pump them out . ”
Last month , only 15,144 hybrids sold nationwide , down almost two - thirds from April , when the segment ’s sales peaked and gas averaged $ 3.57 a gallon .
That ’s far larger than the drop in industry sales for the period and scarcely a better showing than January , when hybrid sales were at their lowest since early 2005 .
In July , U.S. Toyota dealers did n’t have enough Prius models in stock to last two days , and many were charging thousands of dollars above sticker price for the few they had .
Today there are about 80 days ’ worth on hand , and dealers are working much harder -- even with the help of $ 500 factory rebates -- to move the egg - shaped gas - savers off lots from Santa Monica to Miami .
This month , Honda is offering $ 2,000 in cash , financing and leasing incentives to buyers of the formerly sold - out Civic hybrid , while a dealer in northern Michigan is dangling $ 6,000 cash back to those willing to buy a hulking Chevy Tahoe hybrid .
Yet automakers believe they have little choice but to make more hybrids .
Though car buyers are losing interest , politicians are pushing them as key to reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil and limiting the global - warming gases that cars emit into the atmosphere .
In January , President Obama called on the industry to “ thrive by building the cars of tomorrow ” and prepare for federal and state regulations that could push average fuel economy above 40 miles per gallon by 2020 .
“ The automakers are in the situation of needing to pacify politicians that are in the position to bail them out with expensive fuel - efficient cars , ” said Rebecca Lindland , auto analyst with IHS Global Insight .
“ But should n’t it be more about satisfying the needs of the American consumer ? ”
Dubbed the Prius - fighter because of its similar looks and performance , the new Honda Insight hybrid is set to arrive on dealer lots in the next few weeks .
Next year , the Japanese automaker will make a sporty hybrid coupe .
Hyundai and Audi will deliver their first hybrids in 2010 , and Toyota has a redesigned Prius and a new Lexus hybrid coming this spring .
Toyota said Friday that it would make a subcompact hybrid priced below $ 20,000 in 2011 .
The biggest push is coming from Detroit .
Ford plans to follow its new 41 - mile - per - gallon Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids with a battery - powered van in 2010 and a “ family ” of hybrids by 2012 .
And last month , in their request to the Obama administration for $ 21.6 billion in additional bailout cash , both General Motors and Chrysler announced a hybrid onslaught .
Chrysler promised eight new hybrids or electric vehicles by 2015 , and GM , which already sells eight hybrids , said 26 of the 33 cars it sells in 2015 wo n’t run on gas alone , including the Chevrolet Volt , a plug - in hybrid due out next year .
The hybrid flood marks a lasting commitment to a powertrain technology that currently represents only about 2 % of U.S. vehicle sales and , by most accounts , is deeply unprofitable .
Toyota said last year that it was finally making money on the Prius after nearly a decade producing it , but executives at other automakers acknowledge that they lose money on every hybrid sold .
“ If we were making money on the Civic hybrid , we were n’t making a lot , ” Honda spokesman Chris Martin said .
That may help explain why fewer than 2 of every 100 Chevy Malibus sold last month had the hybrid powertrain and why Ford priced its new hybrid Fusion , which dealers expect to start receiving this month , $ 8,000 above the gasoline - only version .
Ford expects to produce about 20,000 Fusion and Milan hybrids this year , or about 1 % of its total production .
“ It ’s a tough time to bring out almost any product right now , ” said George Pipas , the company ’s chief sales analyst .
“ But getting hybrids out right now is as much about image as anything else . ”
In November , months before Honda even announced the price of its new Insight , Jim Johnson of Eagan , Minn. , plunked down a $ 500 deposit for one .
“ I asked to be on the waiting list , and the salesman said he did n’t have one , ” said Johnson , who works in investments .
“ So I said , ‘ OK , I want you to start a waiting list . ’ ”
As evident on the streets of cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco , hybrids have an almost cult - like following , but getting the masses to buy them with any consistency is another matter .
In their zeal to meet what seemed an insatiable appetite for hybrids in the middle of last year , carmakers may have gone too far , said IHS Global Insight ’s Lindland .
At the end of June , AutoNation , the country ’s largest chain of new - car dealerships , had only a two - day supply of Honda Civic hybrids and a 14 - day supply of the non-hybrid Civic .
By year ’s end , the picture had flipped , with AutoNation holding 107 days ’ worth of regular Civics , compared with 148 days ’ stock of the hybrid version .
In December , Toyota terminated plans to build the Prius in a $ 1.3 - billion plant it had built in Mississippi , and Chrysler closed its only hybrid - producing factory .
“ The price of gasoline dictates what people buy , ” AutoNation Chief Executive Mike Jackson said .
“ Gas fell to $ 2 , and now my lots are filled up with fuel - efficient cars that are n’t moving . ”
Consumers who do buy these days tend to focus more on present - day arithmetic than long - term commodity speculation .
Three weeks ago , Jerome Haig , a lawyer in Torrance , put down a $ 500 deposit on a Fusion hybrid , even though he has n’t even test - driven one because they have yet to hit lots .
“ I do like the idea of getting a hybrid , ” Haig said .
But he concedes that he might not have considered the car had it not been for a $ 3,400 tax credit on Ford hybrids and a deduction on new - car sales tax .
The latter was part of the $ 787 - billion federal stimulus package .
“ The tax advantages are a pretty big incentive . ”
A sales - tax deduction does little to move vehicles like the $ 74,085 Cadillac Escalade hybrid or the Lexus LS600h , which starts at $ 105,885 .
Neither gets better than 21 mpg , and buyers pay a premium over similar gasoline - only vehicles that would take decades for owners to equal in fuel savings even if gas hit $ 5 a gallon .
So far this year , only 415 of the pair have sold nationwide .
Still , some consumers see the depressed hybrid market as a buying opportunity .
Chad Gallagher , a lawyer in Berkeley , took advantage of a Presidents Day promotion , plus a healthy measure of dealer desperation , to buy a fully loaded Prius last month for $ 5,000 under sticker price .
“ We got the touring package , leather seats , navigation , Bluetooth , everything , ” Gallagher said .
“ I think they were just happy to sell the thing . ”

Crewmembers of the American container ship Maersk Alabama speak to the media at the Kenyan coastal sea port of Mombasa , 500 kilometres from the capital Nairobi , on Monday after the release of Capt .
Richard Phillips .
( ( Antony Njuguna / Reuters ) )
Three U.S. naval snipers each fired a single shot to kill a trio of pirates holding an American cargo ship captain hostage on a lifeboat in the Indian Ocean , the head of the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said Monday .
In an interview with NBC's Today show , Vice - Admiral William Gortney said " extremely , extremely well - trained " Navy SEAL snipers were able to make the shot from the stern of the nearby USS Bainbridge at night in rolling waters .
Officials made the decision to shoot after military spotters on the Bainbridge saw one of the pirates holding an AK - 47 rifle close to the head of Capt .
Richard Phillips on Sunday .
The U.S. navy released a photo of Maersk Alabama Capt .
Richard Phillips on the USS Bainbridge after being rescued by navy SEALS off the coast of Somalia .
(( Associated Press / U.S. navy ) )
Phillips was taken hostage last week when Somalian pirates attacked the U.S. - flagged Maersk Alabama off the Horn of Africa in the Indian Ocean .
It was delivering a cargo of food aid to Somalia and Uganda .
Four pirates escaped on a lifeboat with Phillips as a hostage .
The SEALS arrived on the scene by parachuting from an aircraft into the sea and were picked up by the Bainbridge , which was patrolling the waters near the lifeboat , a senior U.S. official said .
Gortney said the snipers fired simultaneously when the heads and shoulders of the pirates were all exposed at the same time .
The fourth pirate , who is reportedly about 16 to 20 years old , surrendered and is in American custody .
Phillips ' wife said her husband praised the military for rescuing him and called them the " real heroes " of this ordeal .
Obama proud of military
U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday he was proud of the military for rescuing Phillips .
The president , who approved the deadly sniper shots , said the captain 's safety was his administration 's main concern throughout the crisis .
" I want to be very clear that we are resolved to halt the rise of piracy in that region and to achieve that goal , we 're going to have to continue to work with our partners to prevent future attacks , " he said .
" We have to continue to be prepared to confront them when they arise , and we have to ensure that those who commit acts of piracy are held accountable for their crimes . "
Somalian pirates have vowed retaliation for the killings , raising fears for the safety of about 230 foreign sailors still held hostage in more than a dozen ships anchored off the coast of lawless Somalia .
In Mogadishu on Monday , mortars were fired toward the city 's airport as a plane carrying a visiting U.S. congressman lifted off .
Officials at the airport said New Jersey Democrat Donald Payne was not injured and that none of the six mortar shells landed in the airport .
Payne , who is chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa , met with Somalia 's president and prime minister during his one - day visit to discuss piracy , security and co-operation .
Lucky to be alive , says crew
Shane Murphy and other crew members of the Maersk Alabama wave to reporters during their press briefing Monday .
( ( Karel Prinsloo / Associated Press ) )
Earlier Monday , the crew of the Maersk Alabama called on Obama to use American resources to end the Somalian pirate " scourge . "
" At sea , it 's a global community .
We live together , we look out for each other .
America has to be at the forefront of this .
It 's a crisis , wake up , " said the ship 's chief officer , Shane Murphy , during a brief news conference in Mombasa , Kenya .
" This crew was lucky to be out of this with every one of us alive .
We 're not going to be that lucky again . "
Murphy , who commanded the ship after Phillips was taken , said they spoke with the captain by phone .
" It was an extremely emotional experience for all of us .
He 's absolutely elated .
He was proud of us for doing what he trained us to do , " he said .
" Everybody here today has Capt .
Phillips to thank for their lives and freedom . "
Murphy would n't give any details about the attempted hijacking , but said all crewmembers are working with FBI and coast guard investigators .
" We wo n't describe what happened .
There are ships right now under attack .
These men have valuable knowledge that can save lives , " he said .
" We ask you not to press us for details about things like that . "
Crew looking forward to U.S. return
When they reached Mombasa on Saturday , crewmembers said Phillips told them to lock themselves in a cabin while he surrendered himself .
The crew said they are looking forward to returning to the U.S. and reuniting with friends and family .
A dozen warships from countries including Britain , France , Germany , Iran and the United States now dot the notorious waters in the gulf in an attempt to deter pirate attacks .
But late Friday afternoon , the Obama DOJ filed the government 's first response to EFF 's lawsuit , the first of its kind to seek damages against government officials under FISA , the Wiretap Act and other statutes , arising out of Bush 's NSA program .
But the Obama DOJ demanded dismissal of the entire lawsuit based on ( 1 ) its Bush - mimicking claim that the " state secrets " privilege bars any lawsuits against the Bush administration for illegal spying , and ( 2 ) a brand new " sovereign immunity " claim of breathtaking scope -- never before advanced even by the Bush administration -- that the Patriot Act bars any lawsuits of any kind for illegal government surveillance unless there is " willful disclosure " of the illegally intercepted communications .
I never thought I would see it , but this move led Keith Olbermann to excoriate Obama on television .
You may remember that , after Obama 's complete flip flop on FISA , Olbermann , who had previously likened the proposed FISA law immunizing the telecoms to " the bureaucrats of the Third Reich " , softened his tone dramatically to accommodate the then Democratic candidate for president .
There were no such accommodations tonight :
The president has not , however , backed down from his promise to end out involvement in Iraq , not yet anyway .
He was there today unexpectedly re-emphasizing that it was time to turn this over to Iraqis .
But given what was done today here , in his name , defending invasion of privacy and domestic spying , he will have to forgive us if we invest less in his assurances and listen less closely to his words and instead attend more closely to the possible sound of other shoes dropping .
That 's Keith Olbermann , basically saying that Obama has lost much , if not all of his credibility now .
He also had on Jonathan Turley to discuss just how utterly mind boggling , and harmful to our constitutional rights this position by Obama is if it survives the courts .
And of course , he chastised Obama for flip flopping .
Olbermann has been an exceedingly loyal supporter of president Obama .
This marks a dramatic turn of events as the first time , that I 'm aware of , that Olbermann has directed his biting commentary towards the new president .
Is it time to go after Olbermann ?
Expose him for the Obama hater he secretly must be ?
Forgive my sarcasm , but I guarantee you he got some hostile mail tonight .
And to those Youtube challenged , here 's the look on Olbermann 's face as he closed his remarks ( " shoes dropping " ) .
That 's Olbermann 's worst person in the world face - directed at Barack Obama .
Ouch .
Baby P died after suffering months of abuse
A social worker and three managers have been sacked for failings in the care of Baby P , Haringey Council has said .
The sackings follow the dismissal of Sharon Shoesmith as head of the London authority 's children 's services unit .
The 56 - year - old was sacked without compensation in December after a critical Ofsted report .
Baby P was 17 months old when he died with more than 50 injuries in August 2007 , despite being on the north London authority 's child protection register .
' Loss of trust '
He suffered a catalogue of injuries including broken ribs and a broken back .
Haringey Council said Cecilia Hitchen , the deputy director of children and families , had been dismissed for " loss of trust and confidence " following the damning Ofsted report in December last year .
A council spokesman said social worker Maria Ward , team manager Gillie Christou and head of safeguarding services Clive Preece were sacked for gross misconduct .
A fifth employee , social worker Sylvia Henry , had no action taken against her because there was no case to answer , the council found .
The General Social Care Council also currently has interim suspension orders against Miss Ward and Miss Christou .
Baby P's mother , 27 , who cannot be named , pleaded guilty to causing or allowing the toddler 's death .
Her boyfriend , 32 , who also cannot be named , and Jason Owen , 36 , from Bromley , Kent , were found guilty of the same offence .
All three are awaiting sentence .
Following the Baby P case the government asked Lord Laming to carry out a nationwide review of child welfare services .
He reported back in March , attacking public bodies for failing to put recommendations made six years earlier into practice .
( CNN ) -- A Swiss court Friday blocked Switzerland 's largest bank from turning over account information to the U.S. government under an agreement reached earlier this week in which the bank , UBS , admitted it had helped U.S. taxpayers hide money from U.S. tax authorities .
Attorney Andreas Rued filed suit earlier Friday seeking an injunction to prevent the data transfer , he told CNN , and received the Swiss Federal Administration Court 's decision within hours .
" The customer data may not be given out , " he said , " to protect the interests of the customers . "
The Swiss financial oversight authority , Finma , had asked UBS to transfer the data , according to Rued , and now Finma has until Tuesday to submit a written opinion challenging the court 's decision .
The court will read the opinion and then decide on whether to leave the restraining order intact , he said .
The U.S. Justice Department announced Wednesday that UBS had agreed to pay $ 780 million in fines and restitution and to turn over the account information .
The agreement was approved by a federal court in Fort Lauderdale , Fla .
The department cited a ruling by Swiss authorities that forced the bank to make the " unprecedented " disclosure of names of account holders , and it promised to drop a criminal charge against the bank if it complied with all terms of the agreement .
UBS Wednesday issued a statement in which Chairman Peter Kurer said , " We are firmly committed to the terms of the settlement agreements we have reached " with both the Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
However , it appears only a small number of accounts may have been included in that agreement .
On Thursday , the government filed suit against the bank to force it to give the Internal Revenue Service secret account information on thousands of accounts believed to be worth nearly $ 15 billion .
The lawsuit filed Thursday in Miami says that as many as 52,000 U.S. customers had secret UBS accounts to allegedly hide holdings from the IRS .
About 32,000 of the accounts contained cash and 20,000 contained securities , it said .
After the lawsuit seeking additional names was filed Thursday , UBS ( UBS ) issued a statement saying that it will " vigorously contest " enforcement of the IRS summons in the suit , and that contesting the summons is permitted under the agreement announced Wednesday .
" The IRS 's ' John Doe ' summons seeks information regarding a substantial number of undisclosed accounts maintained by U.S. persons at UBS in Switzerland , whose information is protected from disclosure by Swiss financial privacy laws , " said the new UBS statement .
The IRS on Wednesday issued a statement warning the U.S. customers of the bank that they would be pursued if they did not step forward and pay what they owed .
1. Tonto , the Lone Ranger movies
The Lone Ranger 's faithful Indian companion debuted in the 1930s , an age not known for its enlightened attitudes toward minorities .
And writers like Sherman Alexie have pointed out Tonto 's more problematic aspects , like his stereotypical broken English .
But from the beginning , Tonto was depicted as a heroic figure in his own right , and not so much the Lone Ranger 's assistant as his friend .
Tonto was saddled with pidgin dialogue , but he was n't dumb , and could track bandits and right wrongs with a skill equal to the masked man's .
Also worth noting :
The similar character dynamic in the Lone Ranger spin- off The Green Hornet , between the Hornet and his Asian sidekick Kato , led to Bruce Lee 's American breakthrough role on the short - lived 1966 TV series .
And few people , sidekicks or not , are cooler than Bruce Lee .

2. Hobbes , Calvin & Hobbes
Yes , 6 - year - old Calvin had the better imagination , and his best friend Hobbes , the stuffed tiger who was only alive when nobody else was looking , did n't have the drive or the creative chaos to sustain a strip by himself .
But he was the one with the brains , the experience , the knowledge , the conscience , and the ability to foresee the outcome of the wacky stunts they planned .
And yet he still generally went along with them anyway , trusting that the fun would outweigh the pain .
How cool is that ?
Besides , as he would no doubt be the first to explain , tigers are just plain cooler than people .

3. R2D2 , Star Wars
He 's shaped like a trash can on wheels and communicates entirely in digital bloops and squeals , yet the little astromech droid R2D2 is in many ways the heart and soul of the Star Wars movies .
Robot or not , he 's one of its most human characters , and he expresses a greater range of emotion than some of the flesh - and - blood actors .
Though small and fragile , Artoo is also plucky , resourceful , and reliable enough to earn the trust of the Jedis and pilots who outrank him .
Indeed , the first third of A New Hope hinges on Artoo 's top- secret mission to deliver the Death Star plans to the Rebellion .
True , his underdog heroics in the original trilogy were ballooned into cartoonish super - competence in the prequels .
But it 's a testament to the character that his slide into late - period Lucasian mediocrity was n't as sharp a decline as that of the newly petulant Darth Vader .
When even the new Star Wars movies can't make a character completely uncool , that 's a sign of endurance .

4. Willow , Buffy The Vampire Slayer
Either one of the two charter members of " The Scooby Gang " — Alyson Hannigan 's Willow or Nicholas Brendon 's Xander — made for better company than Buffy herself .
Part of the reason is the hero 's burden :
While Buffy always had to grapple with the cosmic responsibility of keeping the Hellmouth under wraps , the sidekicks were freed up to joke around , develop their loveable idiosyncrasies , and go on little side adventures .
But Willow was truly special , an adorable bookworm who brightened Sunnydale 's perpetual darkness with sparkling wit and optimism while still breaking viewers ' hearts on a semi-regular basis .
Willow 's sheepishness , brought out by Hannigan 's halting rhythms of speech , also masked surprising courage and even a little brassiness on occasion , like when she discovered her leather - clad , badass doppelgänger in Season Three .
It should also be said that her sexual reawakening never seemed forced , but more of a natural outgrowth of her curiosity and her deep connection to other people .
Even when her Wiccan experiments got the best of her , the forces of evil ultimately could n't smother her irrepressible Willowness .

5. Samwise Gamgee , The Lord Of The Rings
Here 's the hero complex again .
Frodo was brave and true … and kinda bland , honestly .
Especially in Peter Jackson 's films , in which his primary purpose was to have the biggest , saddest , most soulful , most suffering eyes in the film .
Meanwhile , his buddy Sam made the exact same exhausting cross-Middle - Earth trip on less food and water , with less complaint , and with nothing in mind but love and loyalty .
And he managed to not get his lame hobbit ass captured by orcs .
Clearly , he wins .

6. Nobody , Dead Man
Johnny Depp is one of cinema 's most reliably eccentric actors , but in Jim Jarmusch 's 1995 existential Western , he played it pretty straight as lead character William Blake , a meek accountant who gets in way over his head when he travels to a lawless mining town for a job that does n't actually exist , kills a man in self - defense , and ends up on the run from a bounty hunter , while slowly dying of a bullet wound .
Instead , the movie really belongs to Gary Farmer 's terrific performance as Nobody , the eccentric Indian who takes Depp under his wing and serves as his guide from the mining town to the coast , and from this world to the great beyond .
Nobody approaches the world in an easygoing combination of lyrical mysticism and touching naïveté , believing Depp 's character to be the English poet of the same name , and wondering why he does n't remember having written any of his poems .
In a movie that 's essentially a long , slow , murky meditation on the inexorability of death , Nobody brings in a spark of life .
It 's hard to imagine the film being even half as watchable without him .

7. Arthur , The Tick
Sure , The Tick is stronger , sillier , and more quotable .
That 's why he 's the hero .
But in all iterations —
Ben Edlund 's original comic , the animated Saturday - morning spin-off , and the live - action version — Arthur is the soul of the show .
Pudgy , meek , awkward , and in fact a bit cowardly , Arthur is the one who 's not only smart enough to know that he 's living out a dream by becoming a superhero , but also that he has to make a conscious effort to fulfill that dream every day by overcoming his weaknesses .
He 's also the one with all the backstory and all the personality .
He is n't cooler in a fight than The Tick is , but he 's always more nuanced and more interesting .

8. Inigo Montoya , The Princess Bride
One quote that stands out among the many memorable lines in The Princess Bride : Inigo Montoya 's much - practiced declaration of revenge to the six - fingered man .
" Hello .
My name is Inigo Montoya .
You killed my father .
Prepare to die ! "
What does it matter that his story is just a sidelight to that of the dashing pirate Westley , who accomplishes great feats of daring to rescue his one true love from the evil prince ?
Inigo 's quest for vengeance is by far the most compelling subplot in the story , and especially so in William Goldman 's novel , because Goldman so succinctly captures the boundless grief that drives the Spaniard to train obsessively for 20 years in hopes of becoming good enough to beat the deadliest swordsman in the known world .
It helps , too , that Inigo also doubles as comic relief , along with his rhyme - trading friend , the affable giant Fezzik .

9. Dr. Pretorius , Bride Of Frankenstein
It 's so hard to find good help these days , as Dr. Henry Frankenstein found out .
In the original movie , his lab assistant steals the wrong brain .
In the sequel , Bride Of Frankenstein , his old teacher shows up and nearly steals the entire film .
Though Henry is nominally the lead scientist in their partnership , Dr. Septimus Pretorius wins hands down in the " mad scientist " department , swanning through the movie with such gleefully macabre abandon that he makes the wet - blanket Henry instantly forgettable .
Where Frankenstein is plagued by his wishy - washy conscience , Pretorius revels in his blackmails and grave robberies , and even goes tomb - looting with a sense of style , sticking around after the corpse is dragged away , and having a light supper and a smoke inside a mausoleum .

10 . Rocky , Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends
The Rocky and Bullwinkle series went through so many name changes ( The Bullwinkle Show , Rocky And His Friends , Adventures Of Bullwinkle And Rocky ) that it 's a little hard to tell who the sidekick was , but Rocky was more likely to provide the straight lines and to stand by while Bullwinkle wandered off and got into trouble .
Also , Bullwinkle was taller , and how many other sidekicks get to be significantly bigger than their heroes ?
Anyway , assuming Rocky was the sidekick , he was still the smart one , the talented one , and the one who generally saved the day .

11 . Marvin , The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy
Douglas Adams ' science - fiction satire contains no shortage of characters who'd be fun to get drunk with .
And even terminally bewildered protagonist Arthur Dent seems like a nice enough guy .
But no character captured the hearts of Adams ' fans as much as the gloomy Marvin , the Paranoid Android .
Though Marvin 's constant melancholy was a source of irritation to his shipmates on the Heart Of Gold , it was easy to sympathize with the slump - shouldered robot .
Marvin may have exaggerated and obsessed over his many burdens — pain in all the diodes on his left side , or being forced to park cars for millions of years while his friends went to a fancy restaurant .
But in Douglas Adams ' mixed - up and often terrifyingly random universe , Marvin 's weary resignation was one of the only sane responses to life .
Besides , Marvin was more than a piece of miserable machinery , he was also the series ' stoic hero figure — often the only character smart enough to know what was actually going on , he repeatedly saved the lives of his ( usually ungrateful ) friends at great peril to himself .
Whether it meant facing down an intelligent battle tank unarmed or staying behind on a doomed starship while the others teleported to safety , Marvin was always willing ( though never eager ) to put himself in harm 's way .
Perhaps Marvin's popularity also owed something to Adams ' own identification with the character — though it was inspired by a fellow writer named Andrew Marshall , Marvin 's disconsolate pessimism also came from Adams ' own bouts with depression .

12 . Raymond " Mouse " Alexander , the " Easy " Rawlins series
Ezekiel " Easy " Rawlins , the hero of Walter Mosley 's detective series , is one of the most well - rounded protagonists in the mystery genre , growing and revealing new aspects of his character over the course of eight novels and assorted short stories .
A black man in mid-century Los Angeles whose crime - solving job is just one way up the economic ladder , Easy is at times a drunk , a devoted father , a socially conscious fighter for justice , and a miser secretive to the point of paranoia .
But every time his friend Mouse Alexander enters the story , all eyes go to the sidekick .
Mouse is Easy 's loyal , lifelong friend , and the guy Easy goes to for muscle .
But he 's also amoral and violent to the point of being a psychopath , and so unpredictably and implacably dangerous that even his friends fear him .
He 's almost a force of nature , and he shrugs off criticism of his temper with lines like " If you did n't want me to kill him , why did you leave me alone with him ? "
And like Sherlock Holmes , Mouse is one of those literary characters who can even survive the author 's attempt to kill him off ; he proved too important to the series to stay dead after being shot in A Little Yellow Dog.
Don Cheadle captured Mouse to perfection in the 1995 movie version of Devil In A Blue Dress .

13 . Sideshow Bob , The Simpsons
He 's smarter than his old employer , Krusty The Klown .
He 's more sophisticated , more refined , more ambitious , and generally less pathetically dragged down by greed and mind - altering chemicals .
If only he did n't have that damn fixation on Bart , he could rule the world while Krusty was still out negotiating a contract to put his face on yet another shoddy product .
He 's the ultimate in sidekicks who are cooler than the heroes they go with .
Problem is , he knows it , and he 's out to take the hero slot himself .

A surprising thing happens to people in their forties .
After working hard , buying a house , and starting a family , they suddenly realize that they 'd better start being responsible with their money .
They begin reading financial books and trying to learn how to set up a nest egg for themselves and their families .
It 's a natural part of growing older .
If you ask these people in their forties what their biggest life worry , the answer often is , quite simply , “ money ” .
They want to learn to manage their money better , and they 'll tell you how important financial stability is to them .
Yet the evidence shows something very different .
In the table below , researchers followed employees at companies that offered financial - education seminars .
Despite the obvious need to learn about their finances , only 17 % of company employees attended .
This is a common phenomenon .
As Laura Levine of the Jump$tart Coalition told me — and I paraphrase — “ Bob does n't want to attend his 401 ( k ) seminar because he 's afraid he 'll see his neighbor there …and that would be equivalent to admitting he did n't know about money for all those years . ”
They also do n't like to attend personal - finance events because they do n't like to feel bad about themselves .
But of those who did attend the employer event , something even more surprising happens .
Of the people who did not have a 401 ( k ) , 100 % planned to enroll in their company 's 401 ( k ) offering after the seminar .
Yet only 14 % actually did .
Of those who already had a 401 ( k ) , 28 % planned to increase their participation rate .
47 % planned to change their fund selection ( most likely because they learned they had picked the default money - market plan , which was earning them virtually nothing ) .
But less than half of people actually made the change .
This is the kind of data that drives economists and engineers crazy , because it clearly shows that people are not rational .
Yes , we should max out our 401 ( k ) employer match , but billions of dollars are left on the table each year because we do n't .
Yes , we should start eating healthy and exercising more , but we do n't .
Why not ?
Why would n't we do something that 's objectively good for us ?
Barriers are one of the implicit reasons you can't achieve your goals .
These barriers can be psychological or profoundly physical , like something as simple as not having a pen when you need to fill out a form .
But the underlying factor is that they are breathtakingly simple — and if I pointed them out to you about someone else , you would be sickened by how seemingly obvious they are to overcome .
It 's easy to dismiss these barriers are trivial , and say , “ Oh , that 's so dumb ! ” when you realize that not having an envelope nearby could cost someone over $ 3,000 .
But it 's true .
And by the end of this article , you 'll be able to identify at least three barriers in your own life — whether you want to or not .
Why People Don't Participate in Their 401( k ) s
If you 're like me , whenever you hear that one of your co-workers does n't participate in their 401 ( k ) — especially if there 's an employer match — you scratch your head in confusion .
Even though this is free money , many people still do n't participate .
Journalists will cite intangibles like laziness and personal responsibility , suggesting that people are getting less responsible with their money over time .
Hardly .
It turns out that getting people to enroll in their 401 ( k ) is just plain hard .
Using simple psychological techniques , however , we can dramatically increase the number of people who participate in their company 's retirement plan .
One technique , automatic enrollment , automatically establishes a retirement plan and contribution .
You can opt out at any time , but you 're enrolled by default .
Here 's how it affects 401 ( k ) enrollment .
( “ AE ” = automatic enrollment . )
From 40 % participation to nearly 100 % in one example .
Astonishing .
Today , J.D. has given me the opportunity to talk about one of the ways to drive behavioral change when it comes to your money .
I call them barriers .
While I do this , I 'm going to ask you for a favor .
You 'll see examples of people who lost thousands of dollars because they would n't spend one hour reading a form .
It 's easy to call these people “ lazy ” — and there 's certainly an element of that — but disdainfully calling someone lazy does n't explain the whole story .
Getting people to change their behavior is extraordinarily hard — even if it will save them thousands of dollars or save their lives .
If it were easy , you would have a perfect financial situation :
You'd have no debt , your asset allocation would be ideal and rebalanced annually , and you 'd have a long - term outlook without worrying about the current economic crisis .
You'd be at your college weight , with washboard abs and tight legs .
You 'd have a clean garage .
But you do n't .
None of us are perfect .
That 's why understanding barriers is so important to changing your own behavior .
“ Just Spend Less Than You Earn ! ”
There 's something especially annoying about comments on personal - finance blogs .
On nearly every major blog post I ever made , someone left a comment that goes like this : “ Ugh , not another money tip .
All you need to know is : spend less than you earn . ”
Actually , it 's not that simple .
If that were the case , as I pointed out above , nobody would be in debt , overweight , or have relationship problems of any kind .
Simply knowing a high - level fact does n't make it useful .
I studied persuasion and social influence in college and grad school , for example , but I still get persuaded all of the time .
These commenters make the common mistake of assuming that people are rational actors , meaning they behave as a computer model would predict .
We know this is simply untrue : Books like Freakonomics and Judgment in Managerial Decision Making are great places to get an overview of our cognitive biases and psychological motivations .
For example , we say we want to be in shape , but we do n't really want to go to the gym .
( J.D. is a prime example of this , and he 'll be the first to admit it . )
We believe we 're not affected by advertising , but we 're driving a Mercedes or using Tupperware or wearing Calvin Klein jeans .
There are dramatic differences in what we say versus what we do .
Often , the reason is so simple that we can't believe it would affect us .
I call these barriers , and I 've written about them before :
Last weekend , I went home to visit my family .
While I was there , I asked my mom if she would make me some food , so like any Indian mom would , she cooked me two weeks ' worth .
I came back home skipping like a little girl .
Now here 's where it gets interesting .
When I got back to my place , I took the food out of the brown grocery bag and put the clear plastic bags on the counter .
I was about to put the bags in the fridge but I realized something astonishing : … if I got hungry , I 'd probably go to the fridge , see the plastic bags , and realize that I 'd have to ( 1 ) open them up and then I 'd have to ( 2 ) open the Tupperware to ( 3 ) finally get to the food .
And the truth was , I just would n't do it .
The clear plastic bags were enough of a barrier to ignore the fresh - cooked Indian food for some crackers !!
Obviously , once I realized this , I tore the bags apart like a voracious wolf and have provided myself delicious sustenance for the past week .
I think the source of 95 % + of barriers to success is …ourselves .
It 's not our lack of resources ( money , education , etc ) .
It 's not our competition .
It 's usually just what 's in our own heads .
Barriers are more than just excuses — they 're the things that make us not get anything done .
And not only do we allow them to exist around us , we encourage them .
There are active barriers and passive barriers , but the result is still the same :
We do n't achieve what we want to .
I believe there are two kinds of barriers .
Active barriers are physical things like the plastic wrap on my food , or someone telling me that it 'll never work , etc .
These are hard to identify , but easy to fix .
I usually just make them go away .
Passive barriers are things that do n't exist , so they make your job harder .
A trivial example is not having a stapler at your desk ; imagine how many times a day that gets frustrating .
For me , these are harder to identify and also harder to fix .
I might rearrange my room to be more productive , or get myself a better pen to write with .
Today , I want to focus on passive barriers : what they are and how to overcome them .
How to Destroy Passive Barriers
Psychologists have been studying college students for decades to understand how to reduce unprotected sex .
Among the most interesting findings , they pointed out that it would be rational for women to carry condoms with them , since often the sexual experiences they had were unplanned and these women can control the use of contraceptives .
Except for one thing .
When they asked college women why they did n't carry condoms with them , one young woman typified the responses : “ I could n't do that …I 'd seem slutty . ”
As a result , she and others often ended up having unprotected sex because of the lack of a condom .
Yes , technically they should carry condoms , just as both partners should stop , calmly go to the corner liquor store , and get protection .
But often they do n't .
In this case , the condom was the passive barrier : Because they did n't have it nearby and conveniently available , they violated their own rule to have safe sex .
Passive barriers exist everywhere .
Let 's look at some examples .
Passive Barriers in E-mail
I get emails like this all the time :
“ Hey Ramit , what do you think of that article I sent last week ?
Any suggested changes ? ”
My reaction ?
“ Ugh , what is he talking about ?
Oh yeah , that article on savings accounts … I have to dig that up and reply to him .
Where is that ?
I 'll search for it later .
Marks email as unread “
Note :
You can yell at me for not just taking the 30 seconds to find his email right then , but that 's exactly the point :
By not including the article in this followup email , he triggered a passive barrier of me needing to think about what he was talking about , search for it , and then decide what to reply to .
The lack of the attached article is the passive barrier , and our most common response to barriers is to do nothing .
Passive Barriers on Your Desk
A friend of mine lost over $ 3000 because he did n't cash a check from his workplace , which went bankrupt a few months later .
When I asked him why he did n't cash the check immediately , he looked at me and said , “ I did n't have an envelope handy . ”
What other things do you delay because it 's not convenient ?
Passive Barriers to Exercise
I think back to when I 've failed to hit my workout goals , and it's often the simplest of reasons .
One of the most obvious barriers was my workout clothes .
I had one pair of running pants , and after each workout , I would throw it in my laundry basket .
When I woke up the next morning , the first thing I would think is : “ Oh god , I have to get up , claw through my dirty clothes , and wear those sweaty pants again . ”
Once I identified this , I bought a second pair of workout clothes and left them by my door each day .
When I woke up , I knew I could walk out of my room , find the fully prepared workout bag and clothes , and get going .
Passive Barriers to Healthy Eating
Too many people create passive barriers to healthy eating .
You 're sitting at your desk at work and you get hungry .
Rather than reach for a healthy snack ( because you do n't have one with you — a passive barrier ) , you go to the vending machine for a bag of Cheetos .
Here 's a real - life example of passive barriers preventing J.D. from eating healthy .
We were in Denver together in 2013 for a conference .
During a long day with no breaks , he did n't have a healthy snack with him .
But he did have Hostess Sno -Balls .
Bad J.D.
That 's not even food .
If you find yourself snacking on Cheetos ( or Sno - Balls ) all day at work , try this :
Do n’t take any spare change in your pockets for the vending machine .
Even if you leave quarters in your car , that walk to the parking lot is barrier enough not to do it .
Give yourself an alternative .
Carry a healthy snack with you , like apple slices .
Remove the passive barrier to eating healthy .
Applying Passive Barrier Theory to Your Own Life
As we 've seen , the lack of having something nearby can have profound influences on your behavior .
Imagine seeing a complicated mortgage form with interest rates and calculations on over 100 pages .
Sure , you should calculate all of it , but if you do n't have a calculator handy , the chances of your actually doing it go down dramatically .
Now , we 're going to dig into areas where passive barriers are preventing you from making behavioral change — sometimes without you even knowing it .
Fundamentally , there are two ways to address a passive barrier .
You 're missing something , so you add it to achieve your goals .
For example , cutting up your fruit as soon as you bring it home from the grocery store , packing your lunches all at once , or re-adding the attachment to a followup email so the recipient does n't have to look for it again .
Causing an intentional passive barrier by deliberately removing something .
You put your credit card in a block of ice in the freezer to prevent overspending .
( That 's not addressing the cause , but it 's immediately stopping the symptom . )
Or you put your unhealthiest food on the other side of the house , so you have to walk to them .
Or you install software like Freedom to force yourself not to browse Reddit three hours a day .
Personally , here are a few passive barriers I 've identified ( and removed ) for myself : I keep my checkbook by my desk , because for the few bills I receive in the mail , I tend to never mail them in .
I keep a gym bag of clothes ready to work out .
And I cut up my fruit when I bring it home from the store , because I know I 'll get lazy later .
Now let 's see how this can work for you .
Here 's an exercise I 'd like you to do :
Get a piece of paper and a pen — or open the note - taking app on your phone .
Identify ten things you would do if you were perfect .
Do n't censor .
Just write what comes to mind .
And focus on actions , not outcomes .
Examples : “ I 'd work out four times per week , clean my garage by this Sunday , play with my daughter for 30 minutes each day , and check my spending once per week . ”
Now , play the “ Five Whys ” game :
Why are n't you doing each of these things ?
Let 's play out the last step with the example of exercising regularly .
Let 's assume I say that I want to exercise three times per week , but I only go twice per month .
Let 's do the Five Whys :
Why do I excercise only twice per month ?
Because I 'm tired when I get home from work .
Why ?
Because I get home from work at 6 p.m .
Why ?
Because I leave late for work , so I have to put in eight hours .
Why ?
Because I do n't wake up in time for my alarm clock .
Why ?
Hmm…Because when I get in bed , I watch Netflix for a couple of hours .
Here 's a possible solution :
Put the computer in the kitchen before you go to sleep ?
sleep earlier ?
come home from work at an earlier time ?
feel more rested ?
work out regularly .
That 's a gross oversimplification , but you see what I mean .
Homework : Pick ten areas of your life that you want to improve .
Force yourself to understand why you have n't done so already .
Do n't let yourself cop out : “ I just do n't want to ” is n't the real reason .
And once you find out the real reasons you have n't been able to check your spending , or cook dinner , or call your mom , you might be embarrassed at how simple it really was .
Do n't let that stop you .
Passive barriers are valued in their usefulness , not in how difficult they are to identify .
The Bottom Line
Passive barriers are subtle factors that prevent you from changing your behavior .
Unlike “ active ” barriers , passive barriers describe the lack of something , making them more challenging to identify .
But once you do , you can immediately take action to change your behavior .
You can apply barriers to prevent yourself from spending money , cook and eat healthier , exercise more , stay in touch with your friends and family , and virtually any other behavior .
You can do this with small changes or big ones .
The important factor is to take action today .
A caveat : Sometimes people take this advice to mean , “ The reason I have n't been sticking to my workout regimen is that I do n't have the best running shoes .
I should really go buy those $ 150 shoes I 've been eyeing … that will help me change my behavior . ”
Resolving passive barriers is not a silver bullet :
Although they help , you 'll be ultimately responsible for changing your own behavior .
Instead of buying better shoes immediately , I 'd recommend setting a concrete goal — “ Once I run consistently for 20 days in a row , I 'll buy those shoes for myself ” — before spending on barriers .
Most changes can be done with a minimum of expense .
Japan has debuted a giant robot baby that can mimic infantile behavior without being told what to do , and the video will send chills up your spine .
I had two gut reactions while watching this video about Japan 's new Child - robot with a Biomimetic Body ( CB2 ) .
First I thought ,
No way could that be real — that 's a tiny disturbed man in a suit .
Followed by ,
We must kill this now , before it tries to eat the children of the world .
Frankly this is the creepiest robot video I 've ever seen .

According to the report :
The robot can record emotional expressions using eye - cameras , then memorise and match them with physical sensations , and cluster them on its circuit boards .
The professor , also a member of the Japanese Society of Baby Science , said his team has made progress on other fronts since first presenting CB2 to the world in 2007 .
In the two years since then , he said , CB2 has taught itself how to walk with the aid of a human and can now move its body through a room quite smoothly , using 51 " muscles " driven by air pressure .
In coming decades , Asada expects science will come up with a " robo species " that has learning abilities somewhere between those of a human and other primate species such as the chimpanzee .

Yeah , until it kills us all .
Good luck with your giant robot baby I 'm not getting anywhere near that , because I think we all know where this will end :

Wirtland [ ' v¡rtlənd ] claims to be the world ’s first internet - based sovereign country .
Wirtland is an experiment into legitimacy and self - sustainability of a country without its own soil .
A “ virtual land ” that will soon offer it ’s own real gold coin .
The term “ Wirtland ” obviously comes from “ virtual land ” .
It means literally that the country ’s land ( soil ) is virtual .
That is the correct understanding of Wirtland – a real country with real people , with the only thing virtual – the soil .
It is not correct to interpret Wirtland as an imaginary virtual world .
Wirtland was founded on August 14 , 2008 as a public initiative .
It is represented through its official website .
Currently Wirtland is governed by Chancellor , and aims to become a parliamentary democracy .
Population consists of citizens of Wirtland ( Witizens ) and tourists .
Everyone can apply for becoming a citizen .
A letter of interest with self - introduction to web ( at ) wirtland.com is required to issue a residence permit or a passport .
Wirtland offers equal democratic rights and does not discriminate on the basis of national origin , age , religion , race , gender .
Wirtland aims to become economically self - sustaining .
Wirtland is building communities , which will offer political and economic benefits , generate new employment opportunities and income , provide new sources of artistic creativity and independent opinion - sharing .
At times of world economic crisis Wirtland wants to offer useful economic instruments to citizens , addressing the problem of personal savings ’ safety .
It is central in most countries today , when the future of national currencies – even those which used to be the most stable yesterday – is unclear and shaky .
There are just a few options how to preserve savings , and even fewer in case your sum is not very large .
One of logical solutions is purchasing gold .
It ’s not surprising that , according to Reuters , “ Mints around the world say demand for gold coins has risen sharply as interest in the precious metal soars on the back of financial instability and concerns over the inflation outlook …
The chairman of the French Mint , Christophe Beaux , said sales roughly doubled last year in value terms and are expected to rise by another 50 percent this year .
The 2009 catalog the mint had produced was almost entirely pre-sold , he said . ”
Wirtland found an interesting solution within the limited choice of options it possesses being an unrecognized cybercountry .
Wirtland plans to mint its own gold coin .
The quality and weight of gold will be guaranteed , so the new coin will meet the demands of people , who will be able to use it as an investment tool .
Formally , Wirtland ’s coin will have status similar to collectible or commemorative coins and medals .
Wirtland has an agreement with a private producer of such objects , who is ready to mint the coins according to Wirtland ’s design and requirements , and sell them online .
Wirtland opened contests for the best design and name of the coin , and a poll to define optimal weight / price of the coin .
Once the price is established , Wirtland will start accepting advance orders for the new coin .

Early in this recession - blighted year , says Weekly Playboy ( Apr 6 ) , 10,000 - odd executives of electronic appliance maker Panasonic received an official notice from headquarters asking them -- or was it an order ? -- to purchase at least 100,000 yen worth of company products by July .
( For top executives , the amount indicated was 200,000 yen . )
At Fujitsu , it was much the same story -- an email from the president went out to 100,000 employees “ appealing ” to them to purchase company products .
Ditto , more or less , for NEC .
Neither specified target amounts , but at a Sanyo Group subsidiary the “ request ” was bureaucratically precise : department heads were asked to spend at least 300,000 yen , section heads at least 200,000 yen .
Rank and file employees also received notices urging them to do their part , without figures being mentioned .
Such is the dismal state of Japan ’s once - proud electronics giants .
Battered by slumping exports and stagnant domestic demand , they feel compelled to panhandle from their own employees -- with this difference : panhandlers generally , if not always graciously , take no for an answer .
Your employer may not .
In a sense , Weekly Playboy observes , it ’s an old story .
In businesses with strict sales quotas -- insurance , for example -- the tacit understanding has always been that sales people falling short would make good the difference out of their own pockets .
The manufacturing industry brought similar pressure to bear on its sales staff -- what you failed to sell , you bought .
But the spread of the practice to all sectors of the economy .
and to all employees within a given company , is “ very exceptional , ” says the magazine .
There is nothing in these notices and “ requests ” that implicitly make compliance compulsory .
On the other hand , “ we are asked to present the receipts from our purchases , ” Weekly Playboy hears from an employee of a mid-size electronic maker .
“ It could come up in our next performance assessment .
When you consider that the ongoing recession might lead to layoffs down the road , it just does n’t do not to go along .
Some people even make a show of buying more than their colleagues . "
A certain “ Mr Yasuda , ” 35 , is by no means so gung - ho ; all the same , he ended up owning no fewer than seven liquid - crystal TV sets .
He works for a mid-size panel maker .
“ If liquid - crystal TVs do n’t sell , ” he says , “ it ’s not just our company that ’ll go belly - up , it ’s the whole town .
So what can you do ?
In January , we started hearing rumors of domestic factories shutting down , so the company started a campaign , under the slogan ‘ Protect the company and the factories , ’ to get employees buying . ”
No sooner had Yasuda dutifully ordered a set than the campaign escalated .
Appeals to “ company spirit ” were followed by pleas to “ protect domestic manufacturing . ”
Next came a drive to revive sagging company stock prices .
Then the local neighborhood association kicked in with a plea to keep the local economy afloat .
“ You had the feeling that if you did n’t buy you ’d be ostracized , ” explains Yasuda .
He bought and bought .
What can be worse than ostracism ?
“ I figured I ’d unload the merchandize on Internet auctions , ” he tells Weekly Playboy .
Good idea , bad timing .
“ My colleagues got in ahead of me .
The market was already saturated .
Bidding started at 1 yen .
That , ” he says , “ is when the tears came … ”

Introduction
And education bosses have been ordered to pay the student banned from wearing the Sikh Kara bangle damages believed to be at least five figures .
Aberdare Girls ’ School , in Aberdare , Wales , is reeling from the bill , which includes an invoice from human rights group Liberty , who brought the case on behalf of Sarika Watkins - Singh , 15 .
The school ’s own legal fees top £ 76,000 .
Early last year , Ms Watkins - Singh was excluded from school for refusing to stop wearing the bangle , which she claimed was fundamental to her religious belief .
The school denied any racial discrimination and Ms Watkins - Singh spent nine weeks being taught in isolation because the bangle was against its uniform policy .
The school was originally given legal help from the local authority , Rhondda Cynon Taf Council , but when it refused to back down and instead opted to fight the case in the High Court , the free advice was withdrawn .
If I have anything to say about it , the story of a Baptist pastor impersonating atheists on various blogs in a desperate attempt to confirm bigoted stereotypes will sweep the atheist blogosphere and perhaps extend beyond our little niche .
This is an intriguing tale that deserves to be widely read .
I only wish I could take credit for writing it , but credit goes to Daniel Florien of Unreasonable Faith for breaking this one wide open .
Daniel 's post , " Pastor Gets Caught Lying for Jesus , " contains a number of important lessons for Christians and atheists alike .
I simply cannot resist highlighting one here .
Contrary to popular stereotypes , it appears that atheists are such decent people that someone trying to demonize them has to resort to lies and deceit to do so .
Pastor Chris Fox of Kendalls Baptist Church in New London , NC , was caught impersonating atheists in comments he left on Unreasonable Faith .
Here is an example of one of his comments , and you can see for yourself what he was hoping to accomplish :
What ’s wrong with killing babies ?
I see no problem with it .
I have enough mouths to feed .
I do n’t get the argument and I am an atheist .
Since I do n’t believe in God , I do n’t believe in anything characterized as good , bad / right , wrong .
So , what ’s the big deal ?
My guess is that Pastor Fox was hoping for one of two things here .
Either someone would agree with him , confirming his stereotypes and allowing him to run back to his superstitious flock and loudly proclaim they were all true , or nobody would take the bait in which case he could still return to his flock in victory by claiming that someone other than himself had left the comments he wrote .
So Daniel and some of his readers became suspicious , and Daniel did a bit of detective work .
He soon discovered that Pastor Fox had been doing this under a variety of handles , giving the impression that multiple atheists held these views .
What Pastor Fox probably did not count on was that Daniel was able to learn his identity and reveal it to all .
Best of all , Pastor Fox apologized for Daniel 's reaction but not for his own behavior .
Well , at least he's had many excellent role models in the non-apology apology !
It seems fairly clear that Pastor Fox is confused .
After he was caught lying , he insisted ,
I am in no way a fundie or extremist .
Like you I believe in thinking , searching , asking questions , and hearing others from outside my box .
I thank you for your allowing various opinions and sides to share .
Well , Pastor , you may call yourself whatever you like , but this does not change what you tried to pull .
That you do not seem to find anything particularly wrong with your behavior speaks volumes about your character .
I 'm not even going to say that you reflect badly on Christianity because most Christians I 've had the pleasure of knowing would never dream of stooping so low .
You should be ashamed .
Why is Rafael Benitez so popular with Liverpool fans ?
Is it the European Cup on his CV ?
The fact Liverpool are in with a real shout for this season 's title ( albeit accidentally , given the manager 's habit of playing eight holding midfielders at home against the likes of Wigan ) ?
His highly amusing ability to get under the skin of Alex Ferguson ?
Or because he looks so damned good on banners ?
It 's because he looks so damned good on banners , is n't it .
Why Rafael Benitez looks so damned good on banners :
This is a result of being unencumbered with a busy face .
Arsene Wenger 's boat , for example , is covered in tightly - packed lines and furrows , like a relief map of the Peak District .
Ferguson 's coupon , meanwhile , takes in most of the warmer colours of the visible spectrum , similar to a plasma screen someone 's just put their boot through .
But Rafa 's face is reasonably feature - free , and therefore comes up nicely when rendered white - on - red .
( It also helps that he 's blessed with a distinguished and handsome look , reminiscent of a high - ranking official in a tinpot military dictatorship , but that 's another story altogether . )
Anyway , kick off is at : 4 pm .
Liverpool , who can close to within a point of leaders Manchester United this afternoon - scrub that , have to close to within a point of leaders Manchester United this afternoon - are going for broke with pretty much their first XI : Reina , Arbeloa , Carragher , Skrtel , Aurelio , Mascherano , Alonso , Gerrard , Kuyt , Riera , Torres .
Subs : Cavalieri ,
The £ 7 m bundle of goalscoring fun that is Andrea Dossena , Hyypia , Agger , Lucas , Ngog , El Zhar .
Aston Villa , who have one point from the last 12 and will be looking to keep their Champions League hopes alive , will be pumping it up to the big boys : Friedel , Reo-Coker , Cuellar , Davies , Luke Young , Milner , Petrov , Barry , Ashley Young , Heskey , Carew .
Subs : Guzan , Agbonlahor , Delfouneso , Knight , Salifou , Shorey , Gardner .
Referee : Martin Atkinson ( W Yorkshire )
A minute 's silence : The Liverpool club secretary Bryce Morrison , who had been at Anfield since 1992 , died suddenly this morning .
Anfield pays its respects .
And we 're off !
Villa set the ball rolling , kicking towards the Kop in the first half .
Liverpool soon steal the ball , stroke it around for a bit , then win a corner after 48 seconds , Gerrard nearly racing free down the left .
From it .
Skrtel gets his head to the ball , but only to waft it towards the top - left corner for Friedel to claim with ease .
3 min : Heskey latches onto a long ball and should really bomb clear on goal .
However with great indecision - something Anfield may be reasonably familiar with - he turns back , laying the ball off to Milner , whose weak shot is deflected wide .
The corner is useless .
5 min : Torres sends Gerrard bombing clear down the inside - right channel .
There 's a chance of a shot , but the Liverpool skipper decides to cut inside Cuellar .
He overhits the ball and Friedel is able to come out and claim .
This is a bright , open start to the game .
7 min : GOAL !!!
Liverpool 1 - 0 Aston Villa .
Reina hoofs a long ball upfield .
Reo-Coker , chasing towards his own area down the inside - left channel , hesitates , allows Riera to toe - poke it away , and upends his challenger .
That 's a free kick , just outside the box to the left of goal .
Gerrard whips it in towards the far post , Alonso flicks a header onto the crossbar - and Kuyt hammers in the rebound with a perfectly steered low volley .
Shades of Torres v Vidic last weekend there ; naughty Reo-Coker .
9 min :
Wow this is a wild , open start to this match .
From a well - directed Alonso header , Gerrard has a half - chance just to the left of goal but can only poke wide left .
Then up the other end , Barry guides a difficult volley over the bar from 12 yards .
And then , Alonso nearly slips Gerrard free on goal down the right with a tasty reverse pass , but there 's too much on the ball and the chance evaporates .
12 min : Mascherano nearly breaks clear after a crunching tackle on Barry - but Cuellar is over quickly to cover .
Villa are really rocking here .
15 min : Riera zips down the left .
His cross is deflected by Reo-Coker and spins up then down towards the far post .
Gerrard contorts his body in an attempt to guide a volley into the right - hand side of the Villa net , but can't quite get over the spooning ball and slices it wide right .
18 min : Liverpool stream forward yet again , but with Liverpool five - on - three at the back , Kuyt fannies his pass out wide right to Arbeloa and the chance is gone .
" Are you sure you can hammer and steer the ball at the same time ? " asks Mac Millings .
Oh I do n't know .
I get confused , you should know that by now .
" I 'm pretty certain Kuyt can 't .
Now Dossena , on the other hand - are you sure it was n't him ? "
20 min : A little chink of light for Villa : Ashley Young screams down the right and dispatches a low , hard cross into the six - yard box .
Reina claims confidently , but Carew was n't too far from sliding in on that .
21 min : Petrov and Milner work the ball well down the left .
The ball 's clipped to the near post .
Carew steers the ball with the side of his foot towards the top - left corner from close range ; Reina palms instinctively over the bar .
Villa have come right back into this .
23 min : Gerrard is booked for flipping Davies into the air with a desperate lunge for the ball down the Liverpool right .
24 min : Arbeloa wins a block tackle down the right wing and scampers free .
He 's only got Torres up with him , and though he finds the striker with a pass to the edge of the area , the resulting effort is weak and easily claimed by Friedel .
25 min :
This is a really open , exciting match .
A long ball is pumped into the Liverpool box .
Standing on the penalty spot , Carew outmuscles Skrtel and sends a header zooming towards the top - right corner .
Reina dives at full length and palms the ball wide .
After a terrible start , Villa are the better side now .
28 min : Torres can't make the ball stick up front at all .
After a really impressive start , Liverpool have blown themselves out a bit .
No Real Madrid , Villa .
" Success has many fathers but failure is a complete bastard , " opines Neil Clough , epigrammatic wizard and Oscar Wilde de nos jours .
30 min : Carew wins yet another long ball , brings it down , and juggles it awhile .
Nothing comes of the cameo .
Liverpool have completely lost their way .
32 min : Riera attempts to get something going for the home side by twisting and turning down the left .
He manages to confuse Reo-Coker , but then confuses himself , and Gerrard in the centre , by pinging a terrible cross high into the stand behind the goal .
33 min : GOAL !!!
Liverpool 2 - 0 Aston Villa .
Reina set Dossena up last week , now he does the same thing for Riera .
The build - up - if I may describe a punt and chase like that - is a carbon copy of Dossena 's United - bothering , but the finish here is even more spectacular : a crashing shot past Friedel into the top left , and the roof of the net .
35 min : Gerrard takes down another long ball , 30 yards out , checks inside from the left and whips a low shot just wide left of goal .
36 min : Villa have fallen apart again .
Friedel attempts to pass the ball out left to Luke Young , but only succeeds in rolling it to Arbeloa .
The right back should score , but opts to pull the ball back for the inrushing Torres .
The pass is misplaced and Cuellar slides in to clear .
What a chance !
39 min : GOAL !!!
Liverpool 3 - 0 Aston Villa .
Oh , naughty Nigel Reo-Coker !
From the right , Kuyt sprays a long crossfield pass to Reira , who tears into the box and is immediately clumsily upended by Reo-Coker .
That 's a nailed - on penalty - and one Gerrard hammers into the right - hand side of the net .
40 min : Luke Young is booked for a lunge on Mascherano .
Barry is booked for prattling at the ref .
" I 'm sorry , but Rafa being distinguished and handsome ? " splutters Roland Dehousse .
" Does his new contract contain a special secret clause on plastic surgery benefits and liposuction ?
I love the guy , but ... and as far as being reminiscent of a high - ranking official in a dictatorship ?!?
Well , you must have been thinking about Juande Ramos , who has all the features you mention , but I do n't recall him being very popular on banners around White Hart Lane . "
42 min : Gerrard swings a long free kick into the area from the left .
Torres - who has done bugger all , still Liverpool are three goals to the good !
- tries to get a toe on it , but gets nowhere near .
45 min : Riera wallops a crossfield pass , left to right , towards Kuyt , who brings it down and wins a corner .
Gerrard pulls it back to the edge of the area for Aurelio , but the volley 's sliced well wide left .
HALF TIME : Liverpool 3 - 0 Aston Villa .
A strange half in some respects - Villa were the better team for the middle portion of those 45 minutes - but Liverpool were determined , clinical and , occasionally , swashbuckling .
Anyway , that banner .
" In light of the top echelons of global finance , success has many bastards , " quips Lorcan Mullen .
" It 's further from Wilde but definitely de nos jours . "
And we 're off again !
Anfield is fairly subdued as the players begin to stroke it around .
A quiet satisfaction .
" I wonder what the criteria were for inclusion on that banner ? " wonders Gary Naylor .
" While Souness can have few complaints about his absence and Houllier might have a case , Roy Evans deserves a spot after all his years in the boot room , does n't he ? "
48 min : LIVERPOOL SCORE FOUR FOR THE THIRD GAME IN A ROW !!!
Liverpool 4 - 0 Aston Villa .
Kuyt puts his head down and runs - admittedly not with any great velocity - towards the Villa box .
Cuellar hacks him down right on the edge of the area , just to the left of the D .
That 's a free kick .
Alonso prods it an inch to the right , allowing Gerrard to sidefoot powerfully into the bottom - right corner .
What a free kick .
As things stand , Liverpool now have a better goal difference than Manchester United .
51 min : Villa can't get hold of the ball at all .
Carew is doing his best to hold up the occasional Villa punt , but can't find a man .
" If failure 's a complete bastard , and many - fathered success needs a paternity test , then I 'm quite happy to sit in my state of utter mediocrity , " writes Mac Millings .
" I know who my dad is , and am merely a bit of a wanker . "
54 min : Heskey gets his head on a deep right - wing cross , but eight yards out can only cushion it forward to Reina .
" Juande Ramos is really more of a flamboyant cavalry officer , " suggests Lorcan Mullen , poo-pooing claims the former Spurs manager is a fine specimen of junta chic .
If this is n't getting homoerotic enough for you , here 's Oskar Kostecki : " I must report that Ronald has an extremely poor eye for anything beautiful , and feel it is my duty to defend rafa from any such uneducated criticism .
I have no doubt that Rubens would be delighted to the point of ecstasy if only presented with such a magnificent specimen as Benitez . "
57 min : Kuyt scampers down the right and slips Alonso into the box .
Alonso swivels and wallops a low , hard shot right across the face of goal and well wide left .
" Did n't I tell you that Aston Villa playing 4 - 4 - 2 would be a disaster ? " asks George Templeton .
And it 's true .
He did send me an email before kick off saying exactly this .
I did n't publish it because it seemed too rabid .
But I 'm a mass of contradictions made flesh , so here 's his frothing - at - the - mouth follow - up : " How many times does Martin O'Neill need to make this mistake before changing ?
Aston Villa have to play 4 - 5 - 1 against teams that will attack them or they get overrun in midfield like today .
And one more message to Martin O'Neill .
STOP PLAYING MIDFIELDERS AT RIGHT BACK AND RIGHT BACKS AT LEFT BACK FOR GOD SAKES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
58 min :
Yet another terrible day at the Anfield office for Heskey : he 's replaced by Agbonlahor .
60 min : Where 's Andrea Dossena ?
The nation demands Andrea Dossena .
63 min : POOR VILLA .
PENALTY FOR LIVERPOOL AND RED CARD FOR FRIEDEL .
Torres scampers down the inside - left channel and into the area .
He should score , but taps the ball forward a tad too far , allowing Friedel to come out .
Torres finds another 1 mph , however , and somehow toepokes the ball past the keeper and rounds him .
Friedel shoulders
Torres to the ground - and while that 's a clear penalty , the keeper unluckily sees red as Reo-Coker is right up with play .
In fact , that 's a terrible decision by the referee .
They 're four down , for Christ 's sake !
65 min : GOAL !!!
Liverpool 5 - 0 Aston Villa .
Friedel goes off to warm applause from his former fans .
Guzan comes on for Reo Coker - and his first act in Premier League football is to pick the ball from the right - hand side of his net .
For that 's where Gerrard puts the spot kick , securing his first - ever league hat - trick .
This is a rout .
67 min : Lucas comes on for Alonso .
" We 're gonna win 6 - 5 , " sing the Villa fans .
69 min : Lucas drags a low shot wide right of goal .
The Villa players look utterly stunned , they can't get hold of the ball at all .
71 min : Anfield is bouncing .
Lucas sprays a majestic pass wide to Reira , who races down the left and wins a corner .
From it , the ball falls to Skrtel at the far post .
His shot is skewed across the face of goal , where Lucas tries to poke home but fails .
" Success has many fathers ?
What the hell does that even mean ? " wonders Richard Whittall .
" And what does the flipside say ?
Apologies for the Obstructed View ?
The guy in the red coat on the top right is giving the long - haired Metallica fan banner - holder death eyes . "
73 min : Mascherano switches feet on the edge of the box and fizzes in a shot that Guzan claims with confidence .
That really would have put the tin lid on it for Villa ; the Argentina captain is many things , but a goal machine he is not .
76 min : Liverpool are stroking it around the back .
A lot .
Agger comes on for Arbeloa .
78 min : Liverpool are now trying everything to set up Torres .
First Lucas selflessly tees him up on the edge of the box , then Gerrard tries to flick him free - but with no success .
80 min : Gerrard is replaced by Ngog .
" That banner is bothering a lot of people , " writes Julian Menz .
" Why is Rodney Trotter in the bottom left , and where is Souness ?
Surely Liverpool would n't be where they are now without his managerial brilliance ? "
82 min : Torres toe - pokes the ball into the air past Davies , but Guzan comes out to claim .
It 's just not going to be the Liverpool striker 's day .
84 min : Attempts from first Ngog , then Agger , to set Torres up .
They both fail .
This is getting ridiculous , especially as both men had chances to keep driving forward themselves .
86 min : Ashley Young skidaddles down the left .
For a second , it looks like either Carragher or Skrtel will upend him in the box , but the winger evades the challenges - only to shank his cross into the stands .
89 min : Carew is replaced by Gardner .
It does n't really qualify as a last roll of the dice , does it ?
" Liverpool banners are a a study in banal pseudo - profundities , " argues David O'Connor .
" I love them but you should n't think about them too much .
They never make sense . "
90 min :
There will be three more minutes of this .
The Villa support - who have done their job today , despite it all - cheers .
90 min +2 : Gardner is yellow carded for a high - studs challenge on Agger .
FULL TIME : Liverpool 5 - 0 Aston Villa .
The home side ping it around awhile ... and that 's that .
What a performance against the fifth - placed team in the league .
This weekend could n't have turned out any better for Liverpool - although for their fans , there 's always going to be that nagging regret at all those silly points dropped , is n't there .
Unless Manchester
United keep imploding , that is .
Author visits Somerset town to unveil roads which take their names from his fantasy series

If you go down to Wincanton in Somerset today you can wander down Peach Pie Street and Treacle Mine Road , named after Sir Terry Pratchett 's fantasy series Discworld .
Pratchett visited the town today to unveil the road names at a new housing estate , and was greeted by hundreds of fans – many dressed in costume .
Wincanton was twinned with the city of Ankh - Morpork from the novels in 2002 , becoming the first UK town to link with a fictional place .
The builder of the Kingwell Rise development , George Wimpey , asked locals to vote for their favourite road name from a shortlist of 14 suggested by Pratchett .
Pratchett said : " I think it 's a lovely idea , even though it makes my head spin to think of the books becoming a little closer to reality .
" And they are nice names , even though I say it myself .
" Personally , I 'd pay good money to live somewhere called Treacle Mine Road . "
Colin Winder , former mayor of Wincanton , said : " The association with Discworld works extremely well for our town , helping to boost the local economy .
" I even know of three families who moved to Wincanton because of this quirky connection .
" It is wonderful that the roads at Kingwell Rise have been named in this way and it certainly beats the dedications to local dignitaries and village worthies that we usually see . "
Pratchett announced in December 2007 that he had been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer 's disease and has since campaigned to raise awareness of the condition .
He has sold more than 55 million books worldwide and has had his works translated into 33 languages .
Richard Goad , regional sales and marketing director for George Wimpey , said : " With Wincanton 's well - established links with Ankh - Morpork it seemed fitting to name the roads at Kingwell Rise after places in Discworld . "

Friday will be popular gaming pundit N'Gai Croal 's last day at Newsweek .
The well - known game journalist took a buyout from the magazine publisher and plans to move more toward the development side of gaming .

Today , Croal posted his final update on Newsweek 's Level Up .
I had a chance to speak with Croal recently about why he decided to leave Newsweek after 14 years at the magazine .

" The simple answer is that Newsweek had buyouts last year in may and then in the fall they reopened the buyouts , " Croal said .
" I did n't consider the first one , but the second one , I was like , ‘ You know I 'm 36 years old …
I studied film making in college and I directed plays and short films and stuff like that , so I 've always had a pretty pronounced creative side . "
" I always thought I was going to do end up in movies or something else , but I kind of got sidetracked into journalism .
It 's one of the most amazing things that 's happened to me .
But when the buyout came around again , I said to myself if I do n't do this now when am I going to do it ? "
" That 's really what it came down to .
My editors never said to me do n't cover games . "
There are changes being made at Newsweek , a redesign and a shift in tone , but Croal says that did n't mean that there was n't a space for video games .

While Croal has n't cemented his future , he plans on shifting more of his time away from covering games and toward helping developers .
" I want to do something more creative than when you are on the journalism side of things , " he said .
" I think it 's going to be a combination of things , I 'm still in the process of figuring that out .
There is some interest in me consulting on games , that 's something I 'm interested in as well .

Croal says that he believes there is a stratification that 's going on in the video games industry .
That developers concentrate too much on an audience of 12 to 24 year olds who have plenty of time on their hands to play , but forget that the older audience has less time to play .
That 's something he thinks he can help with .
" As a journalist you sort of get a broad perspective across multiple genres , " he said .
" I 've covered things here ranging from pop music to movies and other things .
To be able to bring a bit of a broader perspective , I think that might be useful at a time like this for certain developers who want to expand their audience . "

That does n't mean Croal will give up writing about games entirely .
He will continue his column in Edge and says that there are other outlets interested in having him write about games for them .
" I wont be doing pre-release coverage of games the way I was for Level Up and Newsweek because that can be a conflict of interest , " he said .

Instead his writing will be more akin to commentary , he said .
Let 's hope that he continues stirring the pot as he did so famously with Resident Evil 5 .
( CNN ) -- Nothing about Melissa Huckaby , a Sunday school teacher at her grandfather 's California church , would indicate she 's capable of killing her daughter 's 8 - year - old friend as police allege , relatives say .
Melissa Huckaby faces charges of kidnapping and murder in the death of 8 - year - old Sandra Cantu .
Huckaby , expected to be arraigned Tuesday in the death of Sandra Cantu , is a wonderful mother who is at ease with other children , relatives say .
Cantu 's body was found last week in a suitcase submerged in a pond .
But they acknowledge her life was less than tranquil before moving into her grandparents '
Tracy , California , home last year .
They say she 's had difficulties dealing with a divorce , and she 's had legal problems , including bankruptcy and a theft conviction .
" She is a good , church - going girl , but she has had her challenges , " California resident Cynthia Browning , Huckaby 's great - aunt , told the San Francisco Chronicle .
Huckaby , 28 , was arrested on charges of murder and kidnapping late Friday , four days after the suitcase with Cantu 's body was found at a dairy farm 's pond in Tracy , not far from the church run by Huckaby 's grandfather .
Cantu was last seen alive March 27 in the Tracy mobile home park where she lived .
It 's the same park where Huckaby lives with her 5 - year - old daughter and grandparents .
The two children were close friends and played frequently , Tracy police said .
Investigators believe the suitcase is Huckaby 's and that she lied about it being missing , police said .
Police Sgt. Tony Sheneman told reporters over the weekend that he did n't know the motive in the slaying , and he declined to say whether Huckaby confessed but said " she revealed enough information that we had probable cause to arrest her . "
On Sunday , Huckaby 's relatives told reporters in Tracy they were shocked by the allegations against her .
" The information we 've been given regarding the charges against [ her ] are completely out of character for her , " said one man , who identified himself only as a relative .
Another relative , also declining to give her name , said Huckaby " is a fantastic mother , very loving . "
Huckaby , who grew up in Orange County , California , moved in with her grandparents about eight months ago , according to the Contra Costa Times .
She did so in part so that she'd have more time " to take better care of her daughter , who ... gets sick a lot , " Browning told the Chronicle .
Huckaby divorced a few years ago and has had a hard time coping , her father , Brian Lawless of Orange County , told the Chronicle .
She has fought depression , her relatives said , according to the newspaper .
She also has faced legal difficulties .
Citing court records , the Tracy Press reported she pleaded no contest January 9 to a felony charge of second - degree commercial burglary and a misdemeanor charge of property theft .
A criminal complaint says she was jailed in Los Angeles County on a property theft conviction in 2006 and that she tried to steal from a store in November 2008 .
According to the complaint , she was on probation in San Joaquin County and was due back in court Friday .
And she filed for bankruptcy in 2003 , reporting credit card and medical debt , according to CNN affiliate KCRA - TV .
Relatives said her only current job was the Sunday school teaching , according to the Chronicle .
The allegations stunned a friend of Huckaby 's from high school , Emily Glyer Fontes , according to the Orange County Register .
Fontes said she recalled that Huckaby " was almost like a mother " to a baby girl that Huckaby 's parents adopted while she was in high school .
" That 's why this is so overwhelming to me , " Fontes , who said she and Huckaby were on the school 's dance team , told the Register .
" She was so wonderful with kids -- absolutely amazing .
I feel so completely confused and so devastated about this .
Everything I knew has been turned upside down . "
Police have not said how Cantu died .
The day she was last seen , she came home from school , kissed her mother and left to play with a friend who lives nearby , a family spokeswoman has said .
Before her arrest , Huckaby told the Tracy Press that Cantu came by her home to see whether she could play with Huckaby 's daughter , but Huckaby would not let her daughter play because she wanted her daughter to pick up her toys .
Cantu left for another friend 's house , Huckaby told the newspaper .
Huckaby also told the Tracy Press that she owned the suitcase in which the child 's body was found , but said she reported it missing the day before the body 's discovery .
She said it disappeared about the same time the child did .
Sheneman told reporters after Huckaby 's arrest that " inconsistencies " between that interview and statements Huckaby had made to police were one reason police re-interviewed her Friday night .

Plaxico Burress , released Friday by the Giants amid an ongoing gun-possession case in New York , cursed out a police officer in Florida during a recent traffic stop , telling the cop he was going to be in trouble because Burress knew the sheriff " personally , " the New York Post has reported .
Burress , who faces a possible 3½ - year prison sentence on the gun charge , replied to each of the officer 's questions and commands with an " [ expletive ] you " during the stop , the newspaper reported , citing police .
Broward County Deputy Sheriff Donald Harris pulled Burress over around 10:30 a.m. on March 18 for speeding on Interstate 95 near Fort Lauderdale , the Post reported .
Harris opened the door of Burress ' black 2008 Toyota Sequoia when the officer could n't see inside the player 's SUV .
" [ Expletive ] you , " Burress said , according to the Post .
" You ca n't open my [ expletive ] door . "
Burress , who the police report said was driving like " he was going to kill somebody , " was issued a $ 150 speeding citation , his fifth traffic ticket in Florida in the past month , the report said .
According to the police , a " violent and aggressive " Burress , 31 , was asked to get out of his car to be checked for weapons .
" You 're going to hear about this by the end of your shift , " said Burress , who has a house in South Florida , as he returned to his car , according to the newspaper report .
Burress also received tickets for going 60 mph in a 45 mph zone , improper tags , improper lane change and improper window tinting on March 1 , the Post reported .
His gun-possession case was adjourned last Tuesday until June 15 .

Yes , I am aware Rep .
Frank is gay .
I guess I am slow on the uptake then , cuz I still do n't get the correlation .
I have never heard the term WEP before , much less it referring to someone who is gay .
Could you enlighten me , please ?

Barney Frank does actually speak with a lisp .
NOT such a bad thing .
The childishly inept and foolishly arrogant FOX viewer and / or " journalist " probably gets a giggle out of it though .
Pompous asses that they are !
Might I add blithering , primitive , inbred chumps ?
Well , that is an appropriate description .
I could go on .

You know , I think this has become a good thing .
The hard core homophobes will laugh , and other Fox viewers will gradually get disgusted and move on .
Sad as it is , there 's going to be a certain percentage of citizens that will never mature beyond a mean - spirited twelve year old .
Let them expose themselves .

What the Fox ! " News " will go on taking cheap shots at gay liberals - and everyone else they dislike - until the economics of the situation cause the plug to be mercifully pulled .

Alright 99 , I get what you are saying now .
Yes , sometimes you have to be that clear with someone like me .
I hope there is no real need to feel like insulting me or someone else because they can't lower themselves to think like the 3rd graders that run the Faux Propaganda Channel. 99 , why the hostility ?
I asked a legitimate question because I did n't understand .
I did n't say the heading was wrong , I only asked why .
You left a rather vague answer that prompted me to ask for a more detailed answer .
You ultimately did answer my question , but then felt the need to offer a backhanded insult because I and others are not knowledgeable in every gay bashing phrase or technique .

I 'm sorry , Billman , I lost patience with everybody saying they did n't get it ... calling it a typo .
Do n't mind me .
I 'd just watched " Milk " the night before and was feeling hostile because of that .
This shit about gays has been going on for my whole life , and I lived through all that stuff in that movie .
[ Penn deserved ten Oscars for that performance , but the documentary about Milk from years ago was a much better film . ]
Lived in Marin and worked in San Francisco .
Even lived in San Francisco for the few months I could stand city life .
Endured the annual giddy perv-fest at Halloween , even .
Participated in them to show my solidarity , even as gays pissed me off as much as made me happy .
They were people I loved and liked and avoided and despised ... like everyone else .
Their sexual practices creep me out --- for me --- but that 's none of my business for them , and none of theirs for me .
No matter what I feel about that part , it 's completely apparent to me that they are humans , with all the loves and needs and suffering of the rest of us , and I can't think for the life of me what would entitle us to hurt and oppress them , or what would entitle them to special treatment either .
I still agonize over the loss of Milk and Moscone .
They were great guys , trying to do great things , and the puniness of humanity snuffed them out .
Dianne Feinstein could not be making her fascist votes where she is today if White had n't murdered them .
We did n't like or trust her , and we were right not to .
Harvey Milk might very well be where she 's sitting right now , he was that great ... aside from the gay stuff ... completely aside from the gay stuff he was a great man .
I 'm sick to fucking death of this whole filthy wedge issue and I hate every scrap that brings it up ... from both sides .
I want to tear every hair out of my head when our side starts yammering about this filth , playing right into the hands of the pigs that use this wedge to get megabucks for their " churches " and for campaign contributions .
I completely understand the fears of parents , even though unenlightened , and only time and living as equals ever fixes that , but the rest of it is too old , kept alive solely to manipulate us for cash and politically golden outrage .
It 's time to stop it .
And the place to stop it is IN COURT , now , not in the public square anymore .
The law of the land prohibits the abuse of and the restriction of rights for gays .
Drive that home .
Stamp it on their foreheads , and everyone , please , stop filling up the coffers of the maniacs and politicians laughing all the way to the bank over this agony .
Gay rights is not an issue , because human rights is not an issue .
It 's the law .
Period .
Full stop .
End of story .
Pft .

I almost hate to get embroiled in this but I took it as a childish reference to his lisp .
I was offended ( though that 's a strong word for a response that anticipates little more than sophomoric reaction on a personal level passed off as fact or comment from FOX ) based on the speech impediment thing .
What childish D**** bags .
I remember that stuff from , like , a 10 year old .
On some other level it may be indicative of homophobia but that presumes a couple of things : the lisping gay is still the stereotype ( might be ) and that the folks at FOX are creative enough to come up ( deliberately ) with a multi- leveled play on words that denigrates Rep .
Frank for both a speech impediment and his sexual orientation .
I do n't give them that much credit .
In fact , I do n't give the segement of the population that understands the ' deep code ' ( and that FOX plays to ) that much intellectual credit .
They are ignorent by chouce .
Have I mentioned that they FOX , and by extension their avid fans ) strike me as no more than childish D**** bags ?
If they have it together intellectually to use deliberate typo's to launch multi- level attacks then it should be a good sign that normal , rationale people ( like the ones that generally visit here ) need to ask questions about the ' deep ' symbolism , if it exists .
I saw " Milk " some weeks ago , great movie , great man .
Twinkie defense indeed .
HE should 'a got the chair .
I say " HE " because I do n't recall the name of the shooter at the moment and will try to keep it that way .
I try not to keep the names of such people in mind because it honors them too much to be remembered on a personal basis ; better to remember the names of the fallen hero's .

I agree with you about not remembering their names , but I like to remember White 's because it is my shorthand for the razor wire wool of flesh eating sheep that kills beauty and courage .
There are legions of Dan Whites in the world , and they kill real worth , and real humans .
I have a different take on the level of " art " at work at FOX .
They may be a network for those flesh - eating sheep , but some heavy brainpower went into the nuances of that production .
Do n't make the mistake of thinking they 're all dumb bunnies .
They know precisely how this kind of lowbrow " humor " works to their advantage , and how our sputtering over it also works to their advantage .

Paper company Crane & Co. has launched a new swatchbook , Crane Paper , 100 % Cotton : The Definitive Collection .
This is the world ’s greenest paper .
No trees or wood fiber go into it because is entirely made of cotton .
The swatchbook itself is made from cotton paper as well , and was designed by a C&G Partners team led by Partner Emanuela Frigerio .
UPDATE : This post was originally titled “ The World ’s Greenest Paper ” , hence all the comments below .
A title I copied directly from C&G ’s blog .
This was obviously a misleading / false statement , my apologies .
Exclusive Carbon quango
The Energy Saving Trust has come up with a new reason for Britons to save energy in the home .
Our power stations will soon close , and you 'll need to do your bit .
That 's what one Reg reader discovered , after enquiring about the Trust 's calculations on the effectiveness of new low - energy bulbs .
" A reduction in electricity consumption will be essential over the coming decade as a large number of power stations are being withdrawn from service , and as a result there is a gap looming between supply and demand , " Graham Crocker was told .
" More efficient lighting ( which accounts for nearly 20 per cent of domestic electricity consumption ) will go some way to alleviating these demand pressures . "
The answer came from Alex Stuart , assistant manager of services of development at the quango .
" This is the first time anybody has acknowledged that new power capacity will not be delivered on time to replace existing capacity , " Peter Lilley MP told us .
There 's no doubt that Britain faces a looming energy crisis .
CapGemini estimates that a quarter of the UK 's energy plant capacity will close by 2015 .
The nation will also see declining oil and gas output from the North Sea .
But new , replacement power generation will not arrive in time .
The capacity crisis is largely a consequence of EU environmental directives .
The Large Combustion Plant Directive ( LCPD ) , which affects coal and oil power stations generating 50MW or more , obliges plant operators to adapt their stations by the end of 2015 , or close them down .
E.ON has decided that three of its four stations which fall under the directive will shut .
But the directive was introduced in 2001 , leaving the state plenty of time to plan ahead .
" There is a gap looming because of New Labour 's incompetence , " James Woudhuysen , Professor of Forecasting at De Montfort University , and co-author of Energise ! told us .
In 2003 , then PM Tony Blair had blocked plans for new nuclear power stations , he pointed out .
" Today 's government is now planning nuclear operations to resume in 2018 , but more likely 2025 , " says Woudhuysen .
But should the public turn out the lights because of years because of the failure of political leadership ?
In June of 2006 , nationally syndicated radio host Rush Limbaugh on his way back from the Dominican Republic , was caught with a prescription bottle ( not in his name ) filled with the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra .
By fall , 2006 Details Magazine pronounced that ” ˜Limbaugh ’ was the new slang for the drug .
As in , “ I just popped a Limbaugh .
Now what do I do ? ”
So is n’t it now fitting that Limbaugh has become the de facto voice for an increasingly impotent Republican Party ?
Like Viagra , Limbaugh gets a temporary surge of controversy – a boost in rhetoric .
Side effects include dizziness , irrational hatred of liberals and erratic knee jerks .
Here ’s the thing , we ’re in real trouble .
As far as our economy goes ” ” it ’s bad .
All the eggheads tell us so .
Plus you can drive down the street and take stock of all the going out of business and foreclosure signs to draw your own independent conclusions .
We just endured eight years of Bush economics ; cut taxes , dissolve regulation and increase spending to record levels .
On January 30 , 2009 Bloomberg News reported that the top 400 wealthiest people in the US paid a quarter less taxes than before and their wealth doubled under the Bush presidency .
There ’s supply - side economics .
That ’s trickle down .
It ’s also simple physics ” ” when things are too top heavy they topple .
Just as they did the last year of the Bush Administration .
But to hear it from Bush ’s perspective it was all baddies on Wall Street that buckled the economy .
“ The SEC is also requiring certain investors to disclose their short selling , and has launched rigorous enforcement actions to detect fraud and manipulation in the market .
Anyone engaging in illegal financial transactions will be caught and persecuted ( sic ) . ” Bush said at the White House last September .
This is not surprising because with Bush it was always rogue individuals at fault ( Scooter Libby ) and never those in charge ( Karl Rove ) .
Those vilified Wall Street people may have pillaged the world economy but it was mostly legal .
Buccaneers had a note from the King ” ” it did n’t make them any less of pirates .
Their legality meant the King was palling around with ” well Wall Street types .
Remember this is the manifestation of conservative ideals : free market capitalism .
The free market ” ” it sounds so liberated from those horrible killjoy laws and regulations .
Free at last !
Conservatives got their way and now we can see its aftermath all around us .
And Limbaugh wants to see President Obama fail ?
The guy that touted all of Bush ’s policies and ” ˜ideas ’ unequivocally for eight years ?
How many times do you let someone sell you a lemon before you stop buying from him ?
( author ’s note : I was going to say ” ˜sell you bunk Oxycodone ’ , too cheap ? )
Look , we already saw President Bush fail .
His sweeping , unchecked , unprecedented follies have come to fruition .
The only idea that Republicans can come up with in this unparalleled crisis is to call for more tax cuts .
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson ( R - Texas ) on Meet the Press last Sunday declared she opposed the recovery plan that passed in the House because of the massive stimulative spending .
“ On the other hand , on tax cuts , I think tax cuts should be strong , I think they should be a lot and I think they should be something that will have an impact . ”
Offered Senator Hutchinson .
Impact ?
Eep .
More tax cuts ?!
To ” ˜trickle down ’ ?
To supply side ?
Really ?
We just got plundered by privateers and the only answer the Republicans can come up with is putting faith back into the private sector ?!
We lost 2.6 million jobs in this country last year and that ’s all they can offer ?
The original is a now tested , previously unimagined flop ” ” how will the sequel be better ?
Speaking of lame movie references , Limbaugh is the Benjamin Buttons of radio talk show hosts ” ” the older he gets the more childish his ideas become .
Now he just does n’t want someone else to win .
Next he ’ll start picking on more Parkinson patients .
I do n’t want the Democrats to be the only voice in the government .
Right now that ’s up to Republicans .
Limbaugh will get a rise out of the GOP faithful ( if it last longer than 4 hours ” call your doctor ) .
Then he wears off and leaves the party ” well ” deflated .

“ The Adam Carolla Podcast ” is on a tear .
A few weeks ago we reported that Carolla ’s podcast became the # 1 most popular podcast on iTunes in just one day , and that apparently was just the beginning .
Late this week , podcasting guru and TWIT host Leo Laporte was a guest on “ The Adam Carolla Podcast ” .
While the two were talking about Carolla ’s podcasting success , Laporte noted that the record for the most downloaded podcast in history belongs to funnyman and ‘ The Office ’ creator Ricky Gervais when in 2006 , a podcast of his was downloaded over 400,000 times .
Adam Carolla , however , said that a podcast he recently did with ESPN sports radio host and Steelers fanatic Dave Damashek was downloaded over 550,000 times .
Check and mate .
Just two weeks into the podcasting world , and the Aceman ( as Carolla is known ) has already set a podcasting download record .
You can check out Carolla ’s podcasts over here , and for all you TWIT fans out there , you might enjoy hearing Leo drop a few f - bombs along the way .

US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said American International Group Inc. operated like a hedge fund and having to rescue the insurer made him ``more angry '' than any other episode during the financial crisis .
`` If there is a single episode in this entire 18 months that has made me more angry , I can't think of one other than AIG , '' Bernanke told lawmakers today .
``AIG exploited a huge gap in the regulatory system , there was no oversight of the financial - products division , this was a hedge fund basically that was attached to a large and stable insurance company . ''
Bernanke 's comments foreshadow tougher oversight of systemically important financial firms , and come as President Barack Obama seeks legislative proposals within weeks for a regulatory overhaul .
The US government has had to deepen its commitment to prevent AIG 's collapse three times since September as the company accumulated the worst losses of any US company .
AIG is getting as much as $ US30 billion ( $ 47 billion ) in new government capital and relaxed terms on its bailout announced yesterday .
The company ``made huge numbers of irresponsible bets , took huge losses , there was no regulatory oversight because there was a gap in the system , '' Bernanke said .
At the same time , officials ``had no choice but to try and stabilize the system ' ' by aiding the firm .
Unalienable rights !
We hold these truths to be self - evident !
All are created equal !
The Creator endowed us with the rights of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness !
The Declaration of Independence ’s motivating expressions stirred colonists to demand their God - given freedom .
They claimed their entitlement to “ dissolve the political bands ” justified to the world “ the causes which impel them to the separation . ”
The impetus — unalienable rights — still stirs the American soul .
“ Unalienable ” means that which is not capable of being transferred to another ’s ownership .
It is doubtful that Jefferson ’s cherished words would have been canonized in profundity had he qualified these unalienable rights of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness by adding “ within reason . ”
But can unalienable rights be taken to an extreme ?
Understanding the document ’s original intent , legal scholar Robert H. Bork raised awareness to the danger :
The ringing phrases are hardly useful , indeed may be pernicious , if taken , as they commonly are , as a guide to action , governmental or private .
Then the words press eventually towards extremes of liberty and the pursuit of happiness that courts personal license and social disorder .
The necessary qualifications assumed by Jefferson and the signers of the Declaration were not expressed in the document ( 1996 , 57 ) .
Popular culture ’s gross perversion of unalienable rights has gone so far that the creature believes he has disenfranchised the Creator who imparted these rights .
In the minds of many , God has been voted out .
He no longer has the right to make moral demands .
Israel ’s Founding Document
Another nation ’s signature document was carved in stone .
Its preamble and first article were :
“ I am the LORD your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of slavery .
You shall have no other gods before me ” ( Ex. 20:2 - 3 , ESV ) .
The apostle Paul illustrated God ’s sovereignty over mankind when he asked , “ Has the potter no right over the clay ? ” ( Rom. 9:21 ) .
The modern secular mind responds , “ Absolutely not ! ”
Our generation is living to see that the god of radical individualism is preeminent .
Twenty - first century Americans , though , hardly have the market cornered .
The problem is ancient and universal , as evidenced by the first of the Ten Commandments .
An Age - old Problem
Unquestionably , encroachment on God ’s authority is an age - old problem .
Humanity has needs that only God can fulfill .
But when the Creator is banished from all consideration , many seek to fulfill their own needs on our their terms .
If we ever learn better , our education may come the hard way .
Then , perhaps , the words of Jeremiah sink home .
“ I know , O LORD , that the way of man is not in himself , that it is not in man who walks to direct his steps ” ( Jer. 10:23 ) .
But men wo n’t starve themselves .
They have desires that they seek to satisfy .
When out of balance or distorted , unmet longings of humanity may contribute to choosing illusory alternatives , including various addictions .
Addictions , whatever the form , are patently destructive — to self , family , church , and country .
Some addictions involve illegal activity ( e.g. , use of illegal drugs ) .
Other obsessions are legalized in some states , but without a doubt are wholly injurious ( e.g. , gambling and prostitution in Nevada ) .
Some addictions are legal in all states if you are of legal age ( e.g. , use of alcohol and pornography ) .
Addicted to Me
Another compulsion , however , is legal everywhere .
There is no legal age .
You wo n’t find it in an encyclopedia of psychological disorders unless you think its only manifestation is NPD ( i.e. , Narcissistic Personality Disorder ) .
What I am talking about is not manifestly self - destructive .
It ’s a slow - growing kind of malady that eats away at a family .
Fathers and mothers rot on the inside .
It afflicts members of the church .
Yet , it ’s helpful to the economy and protected by the state .
That ’s right .
Many have bought into the idea , rampant in American culture , of radical individualism .
Affluence tempts in many ways .
We have time and money and plenty of choices for spending both .
Sacrifice and selflessness are out in popular culture , and indulgence and self - centeredness are hot commodities .
In this environment , even wholesome activities become wrong when , for example , the family ’s welfare is sacrificed because of the “ needs ” of one of its members .
Moms feel unfulfilled .
Dads need downtime .
Individuals are finding all sorts of ways to distract and please the self while others in their nest go without .
We ’re a nation of TV addicts , weekend warriors , golf addicts , fishing addicts , hunting addicts , fitness fanatics , sports nuts , and workaholics — every kind of distraction imaginable .
Do n’t miss the point .
There ’s nothing intrinsically wrong with these things .
But evaluate the time and money many people spend in their private pursuit of happiness .
Or consider how they look to their careers for personal fulfillment to the detriment of their families and their own spiritual welfare .
Their right to do these things whenever they want , to the extent they want to paraphrase Robert Bork , courts personal license and familial disorder .
When leisure becomes a license for excessive indulgence , we are nothing more than addicted to me and the moment .
Out of balance , spiritual substance and lasting rewards are exchanged for disproportionate fun and sun — and even work , when it becomes an end in itself .
Remember Esau ?
The Hebrews writer appealed to the case of Esau to warn Christians about a kind of spiritual apathy he calls “ profane ” — a disregard for religious and holy things by someone who is familiar with them .
Consider the writer ’s argument .
Esau made a choice .
His choice set in motion a series of consequences .
Later , he desired to inherit the blessing , but he could not .
The situation was irrevocable .
How is this passage intended to educate Christians ?
We must remember that the inheritance was not a light thing in Isaac ’s house .
Even Esau himself “ sought it diligently with tears ” after he had forfeited it .
But he had developed a profane state of mind .
At the moment , he did not consider his inheritance as valuable as he should have .
Esau was like many people are today .
He had a mediocre level of interest in the patriarchal promises .
When it comes to spirituality , mediocrity is another way of saying “ on the way to spiritual bankruptcy . ”
Get a church softball team together , and some will act adolescent again .
But when a non-titillating spiritual work arises calling for sacrifice and selflessness , some of those sports enthusiasts are hard to come by .
Although Esau knew the seriousness of the inheritance , he traded instant gratification for the patriarchal birthright , and he subsequently lost the blessing .
It was not a split - second , off - the - cuff , weak - moment mistake .
He was a profane man , the Hebrews writer says , and lived with a low view of the sacred promises — ripe for the temptation to sell his birthright .
When the blessing was bestowed on his brother , in patriarchal fashion , it was unalterable .
Here is the point for the Christian .
If we live only for the moment , with a little appreciation for the Christian inheritance and the blood that bought it , we too can suffer a terrible loss .
There will be no use for tears and no chance for repentance after death and judgment ( Heb. 9:27 ) .
Like the foolish virgins who were unprepared at the bridegroom ’s arrival , it will be too late to cry , “ Open to us ” ( Mt. 25:1 -13 ) .
Like the rich man who was sorry once he was in torment , it was too late for him to repent and warn his brothers ( Luke 16:19 - 31 ) .
This kind of regret will do no good .
The message is as relevant today as it was in the first century .
If you live with little regard for spiritual things , you will regret it eventually .
Now is the time for our attention .
I ’ve spoken with a number of individuals who must cope with serious regret .
They lament the preoccupation with self , especially when their kids were at home .
They were consumed with careers , recreation , or just sitting in the recliner “ out of touch , ” while little kids begged for attention .
It ’s only then that people may realize the “ addiction to self ” may be the most insidious addiction of all .
Just listen to the market , right ?
It ’ll tell you what goods and services are needed .
In 1974 , the market was speaking when it placed Harry Chapin ’s hit on the top of the chart .
Read the lyrics : Cat ’s in the Cradle lyrics .
It is a poetic , accurate description of far too many families — even in the church .
The answer ?
Listen to Jesus Christ :.
Then Jesus told his disciples , “ If anyone would come after me , let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me .
For whoever would save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it ” ( Mt. 16:24-25 ) .
The addicted - to - me syndrome results in mediocre Christianity .
Self - denial and following Jesus will truly satisfy the soul and point the way of salvation for those we love .

THE rays are diffuse , but the specks of light are unmistakable .
Share prices are up sharply .
Even after slipping early this week , two - thirds of the 42 stockmarkets that The Economist tracks have risen in the past six weeks by more than 20 % .
Different economic indicators from different parts of the world have brightened .
China 's economy is picking up .
The slump in global manufacturing seems to be easing .
Property markets in America and Britain are showing signs of life , as mortgage rates fall and homes become more affordable .
Confidence is growing .
A widely tracked index of investor sentiment in Germany has turned positive for the first time in almost two years .
All this is welcome — not least because the slump has been made so much worse by panic and despair .
When the financial system was on the brink of collapse in September , investors shunned all but the safest assets , consumers stopped spending and firms shut down .
That plunge into the depths could be succeeded by a virtuous cycle , where the wheels of finance turn again , cheerier consumers open their wallets and ambitious firms turn from hoarding cash to pursuing profits .
But , welcome as it is , optimism contains two traps , one obvious , the other more subtle .
The obvious trap is that confidence proves misplaced — that the glimmers of hope are misinterpreted as the beginnings of a strong recovery when all they really show is that the rate of decline is slowing .
The subtler trap , particularly for politicians , is that confidence and better news create ruinous complacency .
Optimism is one thing , but hubris that the world economy is returning to normal could hinder recovery and block policies to protect against a further plunge into the depths .
Luminous indicators
Begin with those glimmers .
It is easy to read too much into the gain in share prices .
Stockmarkets usually rally before economies improve , because investors spy the promise of fatter profits before the statisticians document a turnaround .
But plenty of rallies fizzle into nothing .
Between 1929 and 1932 , the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared by more than 20 % four times , only to fall back below its previous lows .
Today 's crisis has seen five separate rallies in which share prices rose more than 10 % only to subside again .
The economic statistics are hard to interpret , too .
The past six months have seen several slumps , each with a different trajectory .
The plunge in manufacturing is in part the result of a huge global inventory adjustment .
With unsold goods piling up and finance hard to come by , firms around the world have slashed production even faster than demand has fallen .
Once firms have run down their stocks they will start making things again and the manufacturing recession will be past its worst .
Even if that moment is at hand , two other slumps are likely to poison the economy for much longer .
The most important is the banking crisis and the purge of debt in the bubble economies , especially America and Britain .
Demand has plummeted as tighter credit and sinking asset prices have exposed consumers ' excessive borrowing and scared them into saving more .
History suggests that such balance - sheet recessions are long and that the recoveries which eventually follow them are feeble .
The second slump is in the emerging world , where many economies have been hit by the sudden fall in private cross - border capital flows .
Emerging economies , which imported capital worth 5 % of their GDP in 2007 , now face a world where cautious investors keep their money at home .
According to the IMF , banks , firms and governments in the emerging world have some $ 1.8 trillion - worth of borrowing to roll over this year , much of that in central and eastern Europe .
Even if emerging markets escape a full - blown debt crisis , investors ' confidence is unlikely to recover for years .
These crises sent the world economy into a decline that , on several measures , has been steeper than the onset of the Depression .
The IMF 's latest World Economic Outlook expects global output to shrink by 1.3 % this year , its first fall in 60 years .
But the collapse has been countered by the most ambitious policy response in history .
Central banks have pumped out trillions of dollars of liquidity and , in rising numbers , have resorted to an increasingly exotic arsenal of “ unconventional ” firepower to ease credit markets and loosen monetary conditions even as policy rates approach zero .
Governments have battled to prop up their banks , committing trillions of dollars in the process .
The IMF has new money .
Every big rich country has bolstered demand with fiscal stimulus ( and so have many emerging ones ) .
The rich world 's budget deficits will , on average , reach almost 9 % of GDP , six times higher than before the crisis hit .
The Depression showed how damaging it can be if governments do n't step in when the rest of the economy seizes up .
Yet action on the current scale has never been tried before and nobody knows when it will have an effect — let alone how much difference it will make .
Whatever the impact , it would be a mistake to confuse the twitches of an economy on life - support with a lasting recovery .
A real recovery depends on government demand being supplanted by sustainable sources of private spending .
And here the news is almost uniformly grim .
Searching for new demand
Take the country many are pinning their hopes on : America .
The adjustment in the housing market began earlier there than anywhere else .
Prices peaked almost three years ago , and are now down by 30 % .
Manufacturing production has been falling at an annualised rate of more than 20 % for the past three months .
And the government 's offsetting policy offensive has been the rich world 's boldest .
As the inventory adjustment ends and the stimuli kick in , America 's slump is sure to ease .
Cushioned by the government , the economy may even begin to grow again before too long .
But it is hard to see the ingredients for a recovery that is robust enough to stop unemployment rising .
Weakness abroad will crimp exports .
America 's banks are propped up with public capital , but their balance - sheets are clogged with toxic assets .
Consumer spending and firms ' investment will be dragged lower by the need to pay back debt and restore savings .
This will be a long slog .
Private - sector leverage , which rose by 70 % of GDP between 2000 and 2008 , has barely begun to unwind .
At 4 % , the household savings rate has jumped sharply from its low of near zero , but it is still far below its post - war average of 7 % .
Higher unemployment and rising bankruptcies could easily cause a vicious new downward lurch .
In Britain , given the size of its finance industry , housing boom and consumer debt , the balance - sheet adjustment will , if anything , be greater .
The weaker pound will buoy exports , but fragile public finances suggest that Britain has much less scope to use government spending to cushion the private sector than America does — as this week 's flawed budget made painfully clear ( see article ) .
The outlook should in theory be brighter for Germany and Japan .
Both have seen output slump faster than in other rich countries because of the collapse in trade and manufacturing , but neither has the huge private borrowing of the sort that haunts the Anglo - Saxon world .
Once inventories have adjusted , recovery should come quickly .
In practice , though , that seems unlikely , especially in Germany .
As the output slump sends Germany 's jobless rate towards double - digits , it is hard to see consumers going on a spending spree .
Nor has the government shown much appetite for boosting demand .
Germany 's fiscal stimulus , although large by European standards , falls well short of what it could afford .
Worse , the country 's banks are still in trouble .
Germans did not behave recklessly , but their banks did — along with many others in continental Europe .
New figures from the IMF suggest that European banks face some $ 1.1 trillion in losses , hardly any of which have yet been recognised ( see article ) .
This week 's German plan to set up several bad banks was no more than a down payment on the restructuring ahead .
Japan has acted more boldly .
Its latest package of tax cuts and government spending , unveiled in early April , will provide the biggest fiscal boost , relative to GDP , of any rich country this year .
Its economy is likely to perk up , temporarily at least .
But its public - debt stock is approaching 200 % of GDP , so Japan has scant room for more fiscal stimulus .
With export markets weak , demand will soon need to be privately generated at home .
But the past two decades offer little evidence that Japan can make that shift .
For the time being , the brightest light glows in China , where a huge inventory adjustment has exaggerated the impact of falling foreign demand , and where the government has the cash and determination to prop up domestic spending .
China 's stimulus is already bearing fruit .
Loans are soaring and infrastructure investment is growing smartly .
The IMF 's latest forecast , that China 's economy will grow by 6.5 % this year , may prove conservative .
Yet even China has its difficulties .
Perhaps three - quarters of the growth will come from government demand , particularly infrastructure spending .
Not much to glow about
Add all this up and the case for optimism fades quickly .
The worst is over only in the narrowest sense that the pace of global decline has peaked .
Thanks to massive — and unsustainable — fiscal and monetary transfusions , output will eventually stabilise .
But in many ways , darker days lie ahead .
Despite the scale of the slump , no conventional recovery is in sight .
Growth , when it comes , will be too feeble to stop unemployment rising and idle capacity swelling .
And for years most of the world 's economies will depend on their governments .
Consider what that means .
Much of the rich world will see jobless rates that reach double - digits , and then stay there .
Deflation — a devastating disease in debt - laden economies — could set in as record economic slack pushes down prices and wages , particularly since headline inflation has already plunged thanks to sinking fuel costs .
Public debt will soar because of weak growth , prolonged stimulus spending and the growing costs of cleaning up the financial mess .
The OECD 's member countries began the crisis with debt stocks , on average , at 75 % of GDP ; by 2010 they will reach 100 % .
One analysis suggests persistent weakness could push the biggest economies ' debt ratios to 140 % by 2014 .
Continuing joblessness , years of weak investment and higher public - debt burdens , in turn , will dent economies ' underlying potential .
Although there is no sign that the world economy will return to its trend rate of growth any time soon , it is already clear that this speed limit will be lower than before the crisis hit .
Start preparing for the next decade
Welcome to an era of diminished expectations and continuing dangers ; a world where policymakers must steer between the imminent threat of deflation while countering investors ' ( reasonable ) fears that swelling public debts and massive monetary easing could eventually lead to high inflation ; an uncharted world where government borrowing reaches a scale not seen since the second world war , when capital controls ensured that savings stayed at home .
How to cope with these dangers ?
Certainly not by clutching at scraps of better news .
That risks leading to less action right now .
Warding off deflation , for instance , will demand more unconventional steps from more central banks for longer than many now seem to foresee .
Laggards , such as the European Central Bank , do themselves and the world no favours by holding back .
Nor should governments immediately seek to take back the fiscal stimulus .
Prolonged economic weakness does far greater damage to public finances than temporary fiscal activism .
Remember how Japan snuffed out its recovery in the 1990s by rushing to raise taxes .
Japan also put off bank reform .
Countries facing big balance - sheet adjustments should heed that lesson and nudge reform along , in particular by doing more to clean up and restructure the banks .
Countries with surpluses must encourage private spending at home more vigorously .
China 's leaders are still doing too little to boost private citizens ' income and their spending by fostering reforms , from widening health - care coverage to forcing state - owned firms to pay higher dividends .
At the same time policymakers must give themselves room to change course in the future .
Central banks need to lay out the rules that will govern their exit from exotic forms of policy easing ( see article ) .
That may require new tools : the Federal Reserve would gain from being able to issue bonds that could mop up liquidity .
All governments , especially those with the ropiest public finances , should think boldly about how to lower their debt ratios in the medium term — in ways that do not choke off nascent private demand .
Rather than pushing up tax rates , they should think about raising retirement ages , reining in health costs and broadening the tax base .
This weekend many of the world 's finance ministers and central bankers will meet in Washington , DC , for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank .
Amid rising confidence , they will be tempted to pat themselves on the back .
There is no time for that .
The worst global slump since the Depression is far from finished .
There is work to do .
The Alaska wildlife tales just keep coming !
Smoke has yet to settle from the feud between Levi Johnston – the former fiancé of Bristol Palin , who will appear on The Tyra Banks Show April 6 to discuss his sex life with the Alaska governor ’s 18 - year - old daughter – and Sarah Palin , who issued a blistering statement condemning Johnston ’s decision to talk dirty on TV .
( Johnston , 18 , and Bristol Palin welcomed son Tripp last December and split earlier this year . )
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
And now comes a new source of embarrassment for the former GOP vice - presidential contender : police in Sarah Palin ’s hometown of Wasilla have arrested the half - sister of her husband , Todd , for allegedly breaking into a house in a robbery attempt .
According to the Anchorage Daily News , police say Diana Palin , 35 , entered the home Thursday morning and made straight for a bedroom cabinet where cash was stowed .
The house had already been burgled twice in recent weeks .
This time the owner , carrying a gun , was waiting in a bathroom after seeing an unfamiliar car pull up outside .
The owner , Theodore Turcott , reportedly confronted the intruder and detained her until police arrived .
In a further twist in the case , Diana Palin ’s 4 - year - old daughter was apparently waiting in the car outside , but entered the house before police arrived , a prosecutor said during a Palmer District Court hearing Friday .
The little girl reportedly told police she had been in the house before .
Do n't build a new ship out of old wood , says a Chinese proverb .
In China , as in many nations that set their sails to the winds of exports , this global recession comes with a warning flag :
Do n't rebuild your economy on an export - led model .
" New wood " lies in more freedom for domestic consumers and more reliance on home markets .
Unless export - heavy countries such as China , Japan , and Germany shift their policies away from favoring such producers and limiting consumption , the danger remains of perpetuating the root cause of the sharpest decline in the global economy since World War II .
An excess of US dollars earned from these countries ' exports was a big contributor to the global financial crisis .
Those dollars flooded the US , allowing credit to flow to Americans who bought homes they could ill afford .
An agreement to prevent a repeat of this imbalance would be the best outcome at the April summit of G - 20 nations , which represent 85 percent of the world economy .
The last G - 20 summit in November warned of " unsustainable global macroeconomic outcomes " behind the current crisis .
Clearly , artificially pumping up exports is now seen as having left the world askew .
In much of East Asia , exports have accounted for one - third to more than half of the national economies .
That development path required subsidies to exporters and government meddling in currency rates .
And often , workers ' wages were kept purposely low .
It was a model perfected by Japan after World War II and encouraged by the US during the cold war to help friendly nations , making them dependent on the US market .
When China followed Japan 's lead and became an export juggernaut , the distortions in global finance really magnified .
China then led the way by investing its dollars in US securities , such as bundled mortgages , and helped create the housing bubble .
After that bubble burst and US consumers cut spending drastically , export - first nations saw a steep drop in economic growth .
Rather then simply wait for the good times to roll again and throw money at their economies , these nations need a basic change .
Japan , for instance , needs more help for entrepreneurs while Germany needs to end policies that dampen consumption .
And just as Americans must learn to save more and spend less , the Chinese wo n't reduce their instinct to save until they have a better social safety net ; once their future is more secure , they will spend more at home .
Exports will always be vital to any economy , especially those with few natural resources or large populations .
But the competitive race by many nations to quickly build up manufacturing industries with a heavy government hand does have negative consequences for these countries and the world .
There are hopeful signs of a shift .
Monitor reporter Peter Ford in Beijing writes of Chinese exporters turning toward the domestic market .
Toyota talks of making cars in each country with no imports or exports – only locally made and only sold in those countries .
Making such basic changes during a slowdown wo n't be easy .
But unless they are made , using the old wood of an overreliance on exports wo n't make for a very seaworthy ship for the world economy .
WASHINGTON , DC – The Obama administration will fight for the movie industry and work to aggressively enforce its intellectual property protections both at home and abroad , United States Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said here Tuesday .
Locke offered almost unabashed support for the industry , which , according to a report released Tuesday [ pdf ] by the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) , created 2.5 million American jobs in 2007 , paid an average production worker US $ 74,700 a year in salary , paid out $ 41.1 billion in salaries to American workers , paid $ 13 billion in income and sales tax and was responsible for $ 13.6 billion in trade surplus .
Those participating in an MPAA event here stressed that because the movie industry gives back to the economy and movies are such a large American export , it is vital – now more than ever in this tumultuous economic climate – that its intellectual property be protected here and overseas .
“ I see yours as an industry worth fighting for , ” said Locke , adding that 95 percent of the world ’s consumers live outside of the United States , and there ’s a strong international market for that product .
“ It ’s my priority to continue that growth . ”
Locke , who is in his fourth week on the job at Commerce , said trade is the cornerstone of the Obama administration ’s economic strategy , and trade agreements that adhere to safety and human rights standards , among other requirements , will be pursued , as will strong intellectual property protections .
He specifically cited China as one country where counterfeiting is rampant , and the latest “ X - Men ” blockbuster as a prime example of how more enforcement is needed .
Earlier this month , movie production company 20th Century Fox and the MPAA were stunned when a rough and unfinished copy of “ X - Men Origins : Wolverine ” appeared online – a full month before its scheduled release .
“ Our ability to trade in a rules - based system around the world is critical to your success and our economic success as a nation , ” Locke said , stressing that the United States will employ “ full and impartial ” enforcement of intellectual property policies .
The Obama administration is ‘ well aware ’ of the impact of piracy and counterfeiting on the movie industry and , ‘ we ’re working hard to combat it , ’ he added .
Commerce has placed IP attachés around world , including in China , India and Brazil .
Commerce offers a website with links to executive branch intellectual property rights programs , ways to file IP rights complaints , and patent and trademark experts working a hotline to help businesses secure and enforce their IP rights .
Locke said government and industry needs to build international coalitions with “ like - minded foreign governments ” and industries to combat global internet piracy .
“ We can do it and we must , ” he added .
President Obama has been vocal about his support for intellectual property protections and the need for increased enforcement .
His vice president , former Senator Joseph Biden , a Democrat from Delaware , has in the past been an ardent supporter of content providers , even sponsoring copyright industry - friendly legislation .
In fact , Biden was the guest speaker at the MPAA dinner Tuesday evening .
Fred von Lohmann of the Electronic Frontier Foundation downplayed Locke ’s strong enforcement message .
“ We all agree that commercial piracy and counterfeiting are a bad thing and ought to be the subject of enforcement , ” he said .
“ Rather , it ’s other aspects of the MPAA agenda , often misleadingly cloaked in ‘ piracy ’ rhetoric , that have given the public interest community reason for concern . ”
Von Lohmann gave an example of pressuring internet service providers to terminate consumers for noncommercial downloading , which he said raises very different issues from enforcement efforts against commercial DVD counterfeiters .
Similarly , the secret negotiations around ACTA may harm global access to knowledge , an issue that is only tangentially related to the fate of Hollywood blockbusters , he said .
As globalisation increases and intellectual property is exported to more corners of the globe , the copyright industry is hoping for protection from both ends of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
A total of 41 organisations , including the MPAA , Copyright Alliance , Association of American Publishers , Business Software Alliance , Entertainment Software Association , Magazine Publishers of America , and the Recording Industry Association of America on Monday sent a letter to Obama [ pdf ] , stressing that the livelihood of millions of Americans depends on stronger enforcement .
“ Enforcement of copyrights and patents and protecting the freedom to create and be compensated for it are essential components of promoting the progress of sciences and arts , as articulated so clearly by our Founding Fathers in the US Constitution , ” the letter said .
“ Similarly , enforcement of trademarks protects consumers while providing incentives to create better products . ”
This letter was in response to a 2 April letter [ pdf ] from 19 groups like Public Knowledge , the American Library Association , Consumer Electronics Association , Center for Democracy and Technology , Computer and Communications Industry Association , and Electronic Frontier Foundation , that called on Obama to appoint people to intellectual property posts at the Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) , State Department , Office of the US Trade Representative , and elsewhere , that “ reflect the diversity of stakeholders affected by IP policy ” and to create posts that encourage freedom of expression and innovation .
The group lamented that several people named to formulate IP policy thus far , including two at the Justice Department , have come from the copyright industry .
The new letter from the content creators ’ corner argues that it is not a choice “ between safeguarding IP protection on the one hand and promoting innovation no the other . ”
“ The hallmarks of your administration ’s appointees have been competence , substantive expertise , and a commitment to your administration ’s agenda , ” it continued .
Indeed , many eyes in the United States and across the globe are watching the Obama administration to see who the new president selects to head up the USPTO , and who he selects for the new position of IP enforcement “ tsar . ”
Some names that have been floated around industry circles in recent months are music industry lobbyist and former Time Warner and Copyright Office official Shira Perlmutter ; Victoria Espinel , former chief policy advisor to the USTR on intellectual property and trade issues ; Tom Rubin , Microsoft chief IP counsel ; and Jay Monahan , former eBay vice president for IP , former vice president for worldwide piracy for Disney , now general counsel at a startup called Vuze .
Other corners say the list is still fluid .
Paul R. Michel , chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington , DC , told Intellectual Property Watch that it ’s “ critical ” this IP enforcement tsar have international experience , and should be somebody “ who ’s equally strong and reputable on enforcement within the US but equally strong and effective on the world scene . ”
Matthew Bryan , director of the Patent Cooperation Treaty legal division at the World Intellectual Property Organization told Intellectual Property Watch Tuesday that the international community also is watching this appointment with great interest , but many questions remain on what exactly he or she will focus on .
“ We ’re very intrigued at that position .
We do n’t know much about it , ” Bryan said .
It is not expected that the appointment of IP tsar take place immediately , however .
It ’s said that the White House needs to determine how the position will fit within the policy structure there ( IPW , US Policy , 27 January 2009 ) .
A USPTO director should be named much sooner , possibly even this month .
The administration is said to be in the final vetting stages for four USPTO candidates , including American Intellectual Property Law Association Executive Director Q. Todd Dickinson and former AIPLA executive director , Mike Kirk .
Other PTO prospects are said to include IBM Vice President David Kappos , and James Pooley , partner at Morrison Foerster law firm .
“ Any of them we would love to work with … we think all of them are exceptionally well - qualified , ” WIPO ’s Bryan said of the prospective USPTO candidates .
“ We look forward to working with anyone the administration has on IP . ”
It takes a certain chutzpah for the cable industry to tell Congress that deep packet inspection ( DPI ) gear is " pro-consumer " because it can block viruses and spam on the network , help ISPs plan their capacity upgrades , and help law enforcement wiretaps — all while avoiding mention of Comcast 's " TCP reset packet " blocking of BitTorrent connections or Cox 's plan to decide what priority its users ' traffic should have .
But that 's just what National Cable & Telecommunications Association ( NCTA ) head Kyle McSlarrow told Congress at a hearing yesterday , despite the hearing 's focus on consumer issues arising from DPI technology .
Perhaps he did n't need to say much about these far more controversial uses of DPI , since Free Press policy director Ben Scott was also testifying at the hearing .
Scott made sure to point out the examples of both Cox and Comcast , and threw in a few more ( like NebuAd ) to bolster his case that Congress might like to take a closer look at how the technology is being used .
The amazing thing about the hearing was n't the fact that McSlarrow and Scott could sit only feet from one another without canceling each other out in some kind of matter / antimatter reaction ; it was that Congress now cares about topics like DPI at all .
Congress has been taking an unusual interest in the Internet , due in large part to groups like Free Press and to grassroots uprisings like the one that occurred last week in response to Time Warner Cable 's data cap plans .
Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) helped to end the TWC program , and Representatives like Ed Markey ( D - MA ) have used their committee positions to investigate companies like NebuAd and to discuss issues like net neutrality .
DPI , the technology used in many throttling / blocking schemes ( and deployed at all the major Canadian ISPs ) has now captured Congress ' fickle attention .
Predictable metaphors
Since Congress does n't tend to understand such issues all that well , just about everyone in attendance trotted out the dreaded " postal system " analogy .
Traditional routers look only at a packet 's " envelope , " while DPI gear opens up the packet and reads the " letter " inside .
( Read our DPI primer for extensive background on the technology . )
The witnesses also stressed that it was n't DPI itself that is evil , only the uses to which it might be put that could be bad .
Scott said that " the technology itself is not necessarily problematic , " while a network engineer said that " technologies are neither good nor bad , it 's the uses we put them to use that matter . "
McSlarrow laid down a harmony track : " any technology can be used for either benign or nefarious purposes . "
Consensus !
Well , almost .
Leslie Harris of the Center for Democracy & Technology ( CDT ) sounded a strong dissenting note , saying at the start of her remarks , " it is important to stress at the outset that all applications of DPI raise serious privacy concerns because all applications of DPI begin with the interception and analysis of Internet traffic . "
Harris went on to make the case that Congress should jump directly into the debate , collecting information on DPI practices at the major ISPs , developing tech - neutral Internet privacy legislation , and passing network neutrality rules .
Who needs rules when you can hold hearings ?
While Congress is unlikely to mull any sort of DPI - specific rules , general data privacy and protection legislation may be coming later this year .
Rep. Rick Boucher ( D - VA ) chairs the Subcommittee on Communications , Technology , and the Internet .
In remarks opening the hearing , he announced his " intention for the Subcommittee this year to develop legislation extending to Internet users that assurance that their online experience is more secure . "
But even the mere fact of Congressional attention causes companies to take action and change policies .
Last year 's NebuAd hearings helped push the company into a new line of work , for instance .
The Congressional emphasis on DPI , coupled with the FCC's own ruling against Comcast last year , are both likely to constrain certain uses of the technology even without new laws or regulations .

Submission by Republic of Bolivia to the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long - term Cooperative Action under the [ UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ] ( AWG - LCA )
April 25 , 2009 --
We call on developed countries to commit to deep emission reductions in order to advance the objective of avoiding dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system and its consequences , to reflect their historical responsibility for the causes of climate change , and to respect the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities in accordance with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) .
The causes and consequence of climate change
Since 1750 the emission of greenhouse gases has increased significantly as the result of human activities .
These emissions have accumulated in the atmosphere leading to current atmospheric concentrations , which now far exceed levels dating back hundreds of thousands of years .
These concentrations , in turn , are warming the Earth with significant and catastrophic effects .
Current levels of warming are already damaging forest , mountain and other ecosystems , melting snow and glaciers , thinning ice sheets , causing the oceans to rise and acidify , threatening coral reefs and intensifying droughts and floods , fires and extreme weather events .
These adverse effects threaten to worsen the damages already produced by the current global warming on the Earth ’s systems .
The countries most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change are developing countries .
Climate - induced disasters , water stress , adverse impacts on agriculture , threats to coastlines , ecosystems and infrastructure , and altered disease vectors are already imposing substantial and rising costs , damages and setbacks in development - – undermining developing countries ’ rights and aspirations to development .
The historical cumulative emissions debt of developed countries
Responsibility for the majority of the historical emissions contributing to current atmospheric concentrations and to current and committed future warming lies with developed countries .
Developed countries with less than 20 % of the world ’s population are responsible for around three quarters of historical emissions .
Their current per person emissions continue to exceed those of developing countries by a factor of four .
Their accumulated historic emissions on a per person basis exceed those of developing countries by a factor of eleven .
Developed countries -– which have contributed disproportionately to the causes of climate change –- now seek to appropriate a disproportionate share of the Earth ’s remaining environmental space .
By basing their future emission allowances on their past excessive level of emissions , they seek an entitlement to continue emitting at 70 % or more of their 1990 levels through until 2020 ( i.e. consistent with reductions of 30 % or less ) .
At the same time , they propose limiting developing countries –- which most need environmental space in the course of their development –- to much lower levels of per person emissions .
The excessive past , current and proposed future emissions of developed countries are depriving and will further deprive developing countries of an equitable share of the much diminished environmental space they require for their development and to which they have a right .
By overconsuming the Earth ’s limited capacity to absorb greenhouse gases , developed countries have run up an “ emissions debt ” which must be repaid to developing countries by compensating them for lost environmental space , stabilising temperature and by freeing up space for the growth required by developing countries in the future .
Quantifying developed countries ’ mitigation commitments
Developed countries ’ commitments to reduce emissions should be sufficient to address their historical emission debt , minimise their contribution to further adverse impacts on the climate and developing countries , provide sufficient environmental space for developing countries to develop , and conform with the ultimate objective of the Convention .
The scale and timing of these commitments should reflect the latest scientific information and be rooted in the objective , principles and provisions of the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol .
They should be quantified on the basis of a clear and objective methodology that reflects , among other factors :
The historic responsibility of developed countries for current atmospheric concentrations ;
The historic and current per-capita emissions of developed countries ; and
The share of global emissions required by developing countries in order to meet their first overriding priorities which are the economic and social development and poverty eradication .
The establishment of assigned amounts of emissions for developed countries is a question of policy as well as science and must address issues of equity as well as effectiveness .
The level of their assigned amounts also bears a close relationship to the extent of their obligations to provide compensation for the effects of climate change .
Bearing in mind these considerations , the Annex to this document offers some possible elements of a methodology for evaluating developed countries ’ emission debt and associated further mitigation commitments .
Emissions and adaptation debts are components of climate and ecological debt
Despite not being responsible for the problem of global warming , developing countries are among the worst affected its adverse impacts .
The historical emissions of developed countries , as well as denying developing countries the atmospheric space they need for development , are harming poor countries and people who live daily with rising costs , damages and lost opportunities for development .
These impacts are the direct result of current atmospheric concentrations , which have been caused predominantly by emissions from developed countries .
Developed countries are thus responsible for compensating developing countries for their contribution to the adverse effects of climate change as part of an “ adaptation debt ” owed by developed countries to developing countries .
Developed countries “ climate debt ” -– the sum of their emissions debt and adaptation debt –- are part of a broader ecological debt reflecting their heavy environmental footprint , excessive consumption of resources , materials and energy and contribution to declining biodiversity and ecosystem services .
Repaying their climate debt
The climate debt of developed countries must be repaid , and this payment must begin with the outcomes to be agreed in Copenhagen .
Developing countries are not seeking economic handouts to solve a problem we did not cause .
What we call for is full payment of the debt owed to us by developed countries for threatening the integrity of the Earth ’s climate system , for over - consuming a shared resource that belongs fairly and equally to all people , and for maintaining lifestyles that continue to threaten the lives and livelihoods of the poor majority of the planet ’s population .
This debt must be repaid by freeing up environmental space for developing countries and particular the poorest communities .
There is no viable solution to climate change that is effective without being equitable .
Deep emission reductions by developed countries are a necessary condition for stabilising the Earth ’s climate .
So too are profoundly larger transfers of technologies and financial resources than so far considered , if emissions are to be curbed in developing countries and they are also to realise their right to development and achieve their overriding priorities of poverty eradication and economic and social development .
Any solution that does not ensure an equitable distribution of the Earth ’s limited capacity to absorb greenhouse gases , as well as the costs of mitigating and adapting to climate change , is destined to fail .
Developed countries must therefore fulfill their responsibilities through deeper domestic emission reduction commitments than so far considered in the current negotiations , and through all available means to generate the opportunities required for developing countries to achieve their development .
Developing countries are willing to play their part in addressing this common challenge .
But any such participation can and must be based on the provisions of the Convention , on a clear understanding of the causes of climate change and its consequences , and on an equitable approach to stabilising the Earth ’s climate system and to ensuring a sustainable future .

As unfathomable as it is , there are those who voluntarily choose to not eat meat .
Yes , it ’s practically an abomination that they willingly deny themselves this succulent food group but it ’s certainly no surprise to fellow carnivores that even the strictest of vegans still crave a rasher of bacon .

Raisin’ Bacon

So you want to raise your own bacon ?
It makes sense .
Everyone wants the freshest , juiciest , most succulent bacon at their disposal and what better way than to raise your own swine ?
First off , you need a pig .
A baby pig can cost you anywhere from $ 20 – $ 65 and they take about 5 – 6 months to reach their most edible weight of 200 – 225 lbs .
Now 200 lbs sounds like a lot of pig but think about it like this .
One 200 lb pig will produce approximately :
24 lbs of ham
20 lbs of bacon
17 lbs of pork roast
18 lbs of picnic shoulder
7 lbs of pork chops
8 lbs of sausage
7 lbs of “ miscellaneous ” cuts
6 lbs of salt pork
31 lbs of lard
Mmmmm … porky goodness .
I can hear you salivating already .
But if 200 lbs is good then 400 lbs must be better right ?
Well , not really .
Once a pig reaches approximately 225 lbs , they start “ making pigs of themselves ” by eating more food and putting on less weight .
Plus they start to get fatty , and since you are going to the trouble of growing yourself some healthy bacon , you might as well do it right .
Tips on buying your piglet :
Purchase your baby pig in the spring when it is about 6 – 8 weeks old .
Get your piglet inoculated and wormed before purchase .
( You may need to continue to de-worm your pig every 4 – 6 wks . )
Buy your pig from a reputable breeder or a farmer with clean , disease - free stock .
Do NOT buy a cute , little runt .
Choose a long pig – fat pigs produce lots of fat ( there ’s a big surprise ) .
Pick a young sow or a castrated male pig ( a barrow ) .
The breed does n’t matter – all breeds have been developed to produce yummy , meaty deliciousness .
How to feed your pig :
Your pig is not a picky eater .
It will be happy eating grain , wheat , grass , corn - on - the - cob , table scraps , leftover garden veggies and even garbage .
But , do NOT feed old garbage to your pig , pigs like fresh garbage .
Pigs reared on fresh greens and plenty of exercise will produce lean , healthy and , ( most importantly ) juicy pork .
Your pig should gain about 1 pound / day .
You can use a trough for your pig ’s food .
However , make sure that you secure the trough so your pig does not tip it over .
Observe your pig ’s eating habits so that you can make sure your pig is getting enough food and still keep waste to a minimum .
Use a wall - mounted water bucket .
This will keep your pigs dirty hooves out of the water and reduce spillage .
A growing pig can guzzle 3 gallons of water a day so make sure your pig has a fresh supply at all times .
Your pig is a simple creature and only needs a simple house .
But make sure it ’s sturdy because pigs like to push and prod and could knock their home down .
( And do n’t forget about the big , bad wolf , his huffing and puffing is sure to knock down any shoddily built house . )
All your pig needs is a 3 - sided shed , approximately 8 x 6 feet , 5 feet high in front , 3 feet high in the rear , with a tar - paper roof .
Leave the front open ( to let the smell out ) and build it in a shaded area to keep your piggy cool in the summer .
Pigs love to roam and forage and keep their snout to the ground .
They are also known to be expert escape artists .
This means that any fence will need to be well - constructed at ground level to keep your sneaky pig in otherwise your neighbor may be the one dining on free - range pork .
Once your pig is big enough to eat , it is probably easiest to get a professional to slaughter your pig for you .
Your feed dealer will know someone who can dress your pigs , smoke the hams , bacon , make sausage , hog ’s head cheese , liverwurst , mmmm … .
Or if you are feeling adventurous you can do your own curing and smoking once the pig has been slaughtered and dressed .
( Refer back toMakin’ Bacon )
It is also an option to slaughter your own pig but make sure to do it when the weather is cool .
You do n’t want the pig to freeze so 40 – 50 degrees is the perfect temperature for pig killing .
Then hang the carcass for at least 24 hours to ensure all of the pig ’s body heat has dissipated .
The final thing to remember is that your pig is not your pet ; you are raising it for food .
Pigs can be fun and entertaining but do n’t get too attached to it or you ’ll never be able to enjoy the fresh bacon that you worked so hard to raise .
Cookin’ Bacon

Most people prefer to cook bacon in a cast iron skillet ( or at least a frying pan ) on low heat .
But people have also been known to bake bacon , grill bacon and microwave bacon .
And since there are so many ways to cook bacon , guess what ?
There are also all kinds of special bacon- cooking equipment available for your bacon - cooking needs .
Frying Pan
The 2 most important things to remember when cooking bacon in a frying pan are to use a cold skillet and to keep the temperature on low to medium while cooking .
Starting with a cold skillet will keep the bacon curling to a minimum and the low temperature will prevent burning , both of which are pretty important when you are trying to show off your bacon prowess .
Here ’s some tips on how to keep your bacon from shrinking when cooking it in the frying pan .
Of course there are some gadgets to help out when you need that extra flat bacon like the Bacon Press .
This pig - shaped cast - iron press flattens your bacon strips for fast , even cooking with minimal shrinkage .
Fits most 10 ″ skillets .
Can also be used on an open grill .
Grill
Grilling your bacon does n’t take any special skill .
Simply preheat your grill .
Place your slab o’ bacon on the grill ( you do n’t even have to separate the slices ) , grill for 3 – 4 minutes then open the grill and turn the bacon .
Close the grill and continue cooking until desired bacon -y crispness .
Oven
Bacon is yummy when baked in the oven and the oven produces flat slices ( perfect for bacon - o- licious BLTs ) .
To bake your bacon :
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F .
Place a rack inside a baking sheet .
Lay out your bacon-y slices of goodness and bake for 10 to 15 minutes , depending on desired doneness .
You can also use a broiler , but the splatters make a huge mess and can also cause fires !
However , if you are a risk taker and would prefer to use a broiler , watch Rachel Ray and she ’ll tell you how .
Microwave
Some people actually prefer their bacon cooked in the microwave .
( I ’m not sure who these people are but apparently they have reasons ) .
The # 1 reason for cooking bacon in the microwave is that it cooks the bacon with out making a huge , greasy mess and still produces nice crispy strips .
People also say that their bacon is healthier this way , but come on , it ’s bacon …
There are several fancy contraptions to help you cook your bacon in the microwave but as long as you have a glass dish and some paper towel you are ready to get cooking .
Follow these simple steps from StartCooking.com to make perfect microwave bacon every time .
Lay 2 paper towels on the plate .
Spread the bacon out in a single layer not overlapping on the dish .
Now lay another paper towel over the top .
Depending on your microwave , this amount of bacon should take about 4 - 6 minutes to get nice and crispy .
Using pot holders , very carefully remove the dish from the microwave .
Be careful !
The dish itself will be very hot .
The paper towels will have absorbed all the bacon fat .
With some tongs , put the bacon on a serving dish .
Now just throw away the paper towels and enjoy .
However , if you are interested in some special microwave bacon cooking equipment – we have some for your perusal .

The Different Sides of Bacon
Back To Top
The most common kind of bacon is made from cured or smoked ( or both ) pork but it can be made from other meat such as beef , lamb , turkey , chicken , goat , and duck .
Bacon is generally cut from the belly or loin of the pig which produces the most common kinds of bacon : streaky and back .
However , certain types of bacon can come from other areas of the pig such as collar bacon ( from the shoulder area ) and gammon ( from the hind legs . )
Cuts
Streaky Bacon comes from the belly of the pig and is the most common kind of bacon in the US .
It is generally very fatty with long veins .

The Case of The Missing Bacon
Bacon Boy SuperHero
Austin Winters created Bacon Boy at the age of 10 while he was being treated for leukemia in Portland ’s Doernbecher Children ’s Hospital .
He was inspired by painter Frank Etxaniz who encouraged him to come up with a character to draw .
What started as a simple drawing , morphed into a superhero of Baconic proportions .
Bacon Boy was born , along with his friend Sgt Sausage , who together fought off the evil Fry Guy and his minions , Knife and Fork .
Fry Guy ’s main goal is to cook his enemies but he has n’t gotten Bacon Boy yet .
Bacon Boy has a hat , cape and multiple delicious superpowers to fight his enemies .
SuperPowers :
Being able to shoot bacon bits from one hand and grease from the other .
“ Meat Vision ” that lets Bacon Boy propel sausages and corn dogs out of his eye sockets .
Powerful suction to upload various things , such as , water and grease .
Bacon
Boy was entered into a children ’s art contest and after winning , became transformed into a glass version for a permanent collection of kids ’ art in the Tacoma Museum of Glass .
Austin made drawings of his characters , created iron - on images , t- shirts , did animation and shaped Bacon Boy in clay .
Austin lost his battle with cancer on September 18 , 2008 .
Buying one of Bacon Boy ’s t-shirts will support the Austin Winters Fund and the Children ’s Healing Art Project .
If there ’s Bacon Boy , then there must be Bacon Man !

Bacon Grease Biofuel
“ You can make biodiesel out of any triglycerides ( fats and vegetable oils )
If you eat bacon , save the grease in a jar .
After you get a jar or two full , take one out of the fridge and put it in a pan of hot water to melt it .
The water and solids will go to the bottom .
Pour off about 500ml of the bacon grease , titrate , heat , and mix with the methoxide as you would with veg oil .
I tried this about a year ago and the oil titrated at 3.25 and made the prettiest light yellow biodiesel you ever saw .
And it does n’t go back solid at room temp like bacon grease would .
Biodiesel out of 100 % pig fat . ”

SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - Computer users ’ growing fear of worms and viruses could be behind a recent spike in attacks on PCs via bogus security software , according to a Microsoft Corp report published on Wednesday .
As the Conficker worm and other malicious software -- known as malware -- have grabbed headlines , more computer users have been looking for security programs online , some of which turn out to be agents for viruses themselves .
Out of hundreds of millions of PCs monitored by the world ’s largest software maker for its twice yearly Security Intelligence Report , seven of the 25 top security threats came in the form of fake security programs .
In the last six months of 2008 , Microsoft said it cleared 4.4 million PCs of the most successful bogus security program , which goes under the name of Win32 / Renos .
That is a 67 percent increase over the first half of 2008 , said George Stathakopoulos , head of product security at Microsoft ’s Trustworthy Computing Group .
Fear of Conficker “ could be a part of it , ” said Stathakopoulos , explaining the sudden jump in attacks from what Microsoft calls “ rogue ” security software , or “ scareware ” .
According to the report , more security - conscious consumers are being tricked by insistent or alarming pop-up warnings into paying for protection which , unknown to them , is actually malware designed to steal personal information .
The phenomenon of “ scareware ” is a headache for bona fide security software makers such as Symantec Corp , McAfee Inc and Trend Micro Inc .
But these companies in turn have played a role in raising fears about malware such as Conficker , and have reaped a windfall from worried computer users buying their products .
Conficker , a program that works its way into a PC and allows it to be controlled remotely , is believed to have infected millions of PCs , but no significant disruption has yet occurred .
Overall , Microsoft ’s report shows that instances of software security problems -- what it calls “ unique vulnerability disclosures ” -- actually fell 3 percent in the second half of last year from the first half .
But the number defined as “ high severity ” rose 4 percent .
The report only reflects PCs using Microsoft systems , and does not include Linux operating systems or Apple Inc computers .
The report , and guidance on how to avoid viruses , is available at www.microsoft.com/sir.
Why is it that the juiciest shorts are all but un-shortable ?
The shares of Goldman Sachs , for instance .
We predicted here a while back that the stock would eventually trade below $ 30 , a 67 percent plunge from its then price of around $ 90 .
We were so sure of this that we promised to don a grass skirt and dance the hula in Times Square in the middle of winter if we were wrong .
We ’re still sure of it : Goldman shares are headed for disaaster .
So why not simply short the stock in size , forget about it , then come back in two years to collect the huge profit that would be sitting in our trading account ?
The answer lies in the chart below .
If you consider it as a whole , it ’s plain to see that Goldman , like so many other financial stocks , has been devastated by the bear market begun eighteen months ago .
It has dropped 81 percent so far from high to low .
But look at how the decline has played out .
If you had had steel - trap nerves and the genius to short a thousand shares when the stock spiked to an all - time of $ 250 in October 2007 , you ’d undoubtedly have been giddy over the $ 50,000 profit you ’d earned when GS subsequently fell to $ 200 over the next six trading days .
But four days later , 80 percent of your gains would have been wiped out when Goldman shot up to $ 240 .
Leveraging the Death Dive
The roller - coaster ride continued until last February , when the stock took its steepest plunge so far , a 33 percent drop between February 1 and March 17 .
To have caught this death dive , however , especially the wickedly rewarding first two days when GS fell from $ 209 to $ 189 , you ’d need to have survived impalement by the short - squeeze that had preceded it — a nine - day thrust that saw the stock shoot up 20 percent in a little more than a week .
And did we mention that you had only a few hours to cover at the death dive ’s $ 140 low , since that was a “ key reversal day ” that saw the stock trampoline back up to $ 185 in mere days ?
We have all heard stories about traders who made their fortunes by riding a bull or bear market all the way .
But as this chart implies , it can only be done if you are willing to ignore huge swings against you the whole way up or down .
Study the chart and you will see that for each $ 10 you might have made holding a short position from one peak down to the next , you would have weathered swings against you that averaged around $ 40 .
And even if you had been so stupid as to allow that to occur , and quite a few times , the gains would not have come pleasurably , to put it mildly , since the stock ’s big down days were as rare as four - leaf clovers .
So beware of the trader who brags that he made a killing surfing a big wave , since he could only have done so by taking inordinate risks .
You could lay odds that sooner or later , unless he has retired or found another game , he ’s going to drown .

Los Angeles school district officials moved forward Tuesday with plans to lay off more than 5,000 teachers , counselors , custodians , clerks and other employees , but the battle over funding will rage on for weeks -- affecting who goes , who stays and what schools and classrooms will look like for students next year .
The Board of Education ’s 4 - 3 vote , after more than four hours of pleading and debate , closed most of a $ 596.1 - million deficit for next year in the nation ’s second - largest school system .
“ Anger is appropriate and outrage is appropriate , ” said school board President Monica Garcia , who voted with the majority .
“ Nobody wants to do these layoffs . ”
No one expects every employee with a layoff notice in the Los Angeles Unified School District to be out of work , and most observers believe the current budget plan will evolve , perhaps considerably .
Advertisement
The board action affects about 3,500 newer teachers who have yet to earn tenure protections as well as administrators , nursing staff , library aides , computer programmers and others .
The teachers will lose positions as a result of larger classes , which could rise from 20 to 24 students in the early grades .
Sixth - grade classes would rise to 35 students .
The average high school class would be larger still .
Much of the contention centers on how much money will be available from the federal stimulus package and how that money could and should be used .
Opponents of the cuts have added up federal dollars and come up with figures that surpass the current deficit .
District officials insist that their math is wishful thinking .
Advertisement
But there ’s also a strategic disagreement .
Supt. Ramon C. Cortines has decided to spread the federal money over the next two budget years .
Even with the cuts , the district faces an additional deficit in 2010 - 11 .
Using most of the federal money now , Cortines said , would create an untenable funding cliff when the dollars ran out .
His top advisors have also yet to factor in some additional funding that they fear could be poached by other government agencies .
And some of the money has restrictions that limit the district ’s flexibility in saving jobs and programs .
Initially , the budget proposal deadlocked on the seven - member board at 3 to 3 , with Richard Vladovic suddenly becoming the swing vote .
He missed the first roll call , explaining when he returned that recent food poisoning had forced him to leave for several minutes .
He then asked for a legal opinion on whether the district could spend more restricted money to save jobs .
The district ’s top lawyer warned against it , and Vladovic tipped the scale for the Cortines plan .
Advertisement
Vladovic had recused himself from some recent budget votes because his son , a teacher , had received a layoff notice .
But that conflict evaporated earlier Tuesday when Cortines recommended rescinding notices of possible layoff that had been sent to nearly 2,000 tenured teachers , including Vladovic ’s son .
Those still at risk include all teachers without tenure : 1,605 at the elementary level and 1,872 at middle and high schools .
The notices also went to 498 other employees with teaching credentials and to 2,875 administrators .
Most of those administrators will keep their jobs , but some small campuses will lose a full - time principal .
At one point , a group of Spanish - speaking parents cited security fears and other concerns should their children ’s campus lack a principal at all times .
Some principals are likely to be replaced by administrators with more seniority .
Advertisement
The “ bumping ” process , officials acknowledged , could become a nightmare , because more than 1,200 positions will be cut from central and regional offices .
These cuts are not just to save money , but also about decentralizing operations , which is a key Cortines goal and a longtime demand of the teachers union .
In the short run , at least , this approach could bump teachers out of their jobs .
Some campuses could be especially hard hit , among them Del Olmo Elementary in Koreatown , where test scores surged in 2008 .
At Del Olmo , nearly two - thirds of teachers received notice that they could be laid off .
About half of these , however , were spared when permanent teachers got their reprieve .
Advertisement
“ I ’m glad to hear some teachers ’ jobs will be saved , ” Del Olmo second - grade teacher Regina Ramos said , “ but it ’s not enough .
. . .
What type of reform is it if quality teachers are being let go ? ”
There was little solace for middle schools and high schools , especially those with less - experienced teachers .
Marla Mattenson , 38 , who teaches at Bernstein High in Hollywood , changed careers to become one of the district ’s new and badly needed math teachers .
“ But I got a little letter in the mail , ” she said referring to her layoff notice .
Board member Tamar Galatzan lined up with the budget plan skeptics and financial optimists , as did most of the parents who spoke before the board .
Advertisement
“ I do n’t think the stimulus money should be saved for a rainy day , ” Galatzan said .
“ I think we should look outside and see a storm brewing . ”
Several district officials , including some board members , have alluded to “ shared sacrifice , ” the same words used by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa on Monday when he discussed the district ’s budget crisis .
The term has become de facto code for the idea that employee unions need to accept lower wages to save jobs .
The United Teachers Los Angeles leadership has maintained that there is no need to lay off teachers or reduce their pay .
Other unions have signaled a willingness to discuss unpaid furlough days .
The board vote could put additional pressure on the unions to discuss furloughs or other wage concessions that the mayor and Cortines have suggested .
Advertisement
The superintendent ’s push to decentralize includes millions of dollars for schools to “ buy back ” some lost staff .
That process will unfold in the coming weeks , as will the debate over the federal money .
Cortines insisted that he would entertain all options .
“ We should continue the conversation , ” he said .
“ We need to exhaust every avenue . ”

Enteric Nervous System - Understanding How The ' Second Brain ' Works
Researchers from the Hotchkiss Brain Institute ( HBI ) in the Faculty of Medicine at University of Calgary have uncovered the first evidence that neurons talk to ‘ glial ’ cells in the digestive tract : a discovery that could help find a way to regulate and restore balance in the gut for the one in 10 Canadians suffering from irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) and the more than 200,000 Canadians suffering from inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .
Sometimes referred to as the “ second brain ” , the enteric nervous system controls function of the digestive tract .
Similar to neurons found in the brain , neurons in the enteric nervous system , are surrounded by cells that insulate and protect nerves .
The cells , known as “ glial cells , ” were typically thought not to influence gut function .
While interactions between nerves and glia are becoming increasingly researched and well characterized in the brain , no one has been able to definitively show that enteric neurons can communicate with glial cells in the digestive tract — until now .
“ This is an exciting discovery , because if we can understand how these cells respond to signaling mechanisms , and how their reactions change between a healthy digestive tract and in diseases such as IBD and IBS , it may lead to new or better treatment of gastrointestinal disorders , ” said Keith Sharkey , PhD .
“ Neuron - glial signaling will also help us understand how the brain influences the gut and vice versa . ”
In a study published this month in the journal Gastroenterology , HBI researchers were able to demonstrate that while neurons are “ talking ” to each other , glial cells are “ listening in ” on the conversation and responding to the molecules that the neurons are releasing .
“ We knew that peripheral glial cells had the potential to receive signals , but this is the first evidence that glia may play a larger role in gut function than previously thought , ” explained Brian Gulbransen , PhD , a postdoctoral fellow working in the laboratory with Sharkey .
“ Thankfully , we ’re in a wonderful collaborative research environment here at the HBI that allows us to fully explore those links , ” said Sharkey .
Last year in collaboration with fellow HBI researchers , Sharkey showed that beyond the immediate damage caused by IBD , chronic inflammation in the digestive tract also increases neuronal excitability in the hippocampus , highlighting the critical link between the digestive tract and the brain .
Keith Sharkey is Professor of Physiology & Pharmacology in the Faculty of Medicine , the Crohn ’s and Colitis Foundation of Canada Chair in IBD Research and an Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research Scientist .
He is a member of the HBI and the Calvin , Phoebe and Joan Snyder Institute of Infection , Immunity and inflammation .
Apple updated its iTunes music jukebox and device - management software to version 8.1 on Wednesday , adding support for the new line of iPod shuffles released earlier in the day , and adding several other new features , most notably adding Genius Sidebar support for movies and television shows .
Apple first introduced Genius in September 2008 as a way for users to create playlists and find new music based on what they are already listening to .
Now that functionality is available for movies and TV shows as well , according to Apple .
The Genius Sidebar will find relevant videos much the same way it finds music .
When you click on a movie , iTunes will recommend new content that you may like from the iTunes Store .
( We were unable to verify this feature for ourselves , though it 's possible this feature will be enabled via a server - based Genius update at a later time . )
In iTunes 8.1 , the Party Shuffle feature introduced in April 2004 has been rechristened iTunes DJ .
While this feature has been around for some time , Apple added some new functionality specifically designed for iPod touch and iPhone users .
With iTunes DJ , iPhone users that have Apple ’s Remote application installed can request songs to be played .
Users can also vote to control when songs are played .
The DJ feature even has its own preferences , so you can send a welcome message to users and control whether voting is turned on or off .
You can also require users to type in a password to access iTunes DJ ’s features .
Parents can now restrict access to the iTunes Store , while allowing access for iTunes U , Apple ’s iTunes - based learning center .
CDs can also be set to automatically be imported at the same sound quality as iTunes Plus .
Apple said the update offers several other improvements to iTunes , including many accessibility improvements and better performance when downloading iTunes Plus songs .
Other improvements involve working with large libraries , browsing the iTunes Store , preparing to sync with iPod or iPhone , and optimizing photos for syncing .
i Tunes 8.1 is available as a free download from Apple ’s Web site .
Off Site Encrypted Backups using Rsync and AES
Why ?
Well , it is always a good idea to keep backup copies of data .
Anyone that has ever used a floppy disk knows that data can disappear unexpectantly .
Hard drives are susceptible to data corruption and loss as well .
If you do n’t have good backups it is only a matter of time until loss occurs .
But is backing up to another hard drive good enough ?
NO !
This month an entire block in my home town caught fire .
What your laptop and it gets stolen ?
Hurricane / flood damage ?
How about backing up with a paid service or Amazon S3 ?
Well there are paid services out there that you can backup to that are fairly cheap .
One that comes to mind is mozy .
The problem is they use a special backup program and do n’t support Linux .
Amazon S3 seems a bit on the expensive side for large amounts of data storage for simple backups , but definitely worth it if you can afford it .
In this article I am going to show you how to leverage an existing FTP server or a friends computer to do daily encrypted incremental backups .
Requirements
Encryption - I trust my friend , but I do n’t trust what other people do on his / her computer .
My data needs to stay MY data .
Rsync -
Since data will be traveling across the Internet I need to minimize bandwidth usage by doing smart incremental syncing .
Jailed container - Since I am going to be swaping my data for a friends .
I need to limit my friend to be able to read / write only to his location and nowhere else .
Disk space quota - I ca n’t have my friend mess up rsync and accidentally fill my hard drive !
Completely automated - I do n’t want to think about it , I just want my data securely transfered weekly
Rsync + Encryption
Rsync by default only syncs data that has changed ..
The way rsync limits bandwidth usage is by transferring only the absolutely necessary bits of data .
The “ problem ” with encryption is that it by its very nature changes almost EVERY bit in a file when even a small change is made as it is trying to randomize the data .
This basically defeats the whole purpose of rsync causing massive amounts of bandwidth to be exchanged each time changes are made .
With encryption the smallest file change can alter all the other bits in a file .
There were a few options to overcome the encryption syncing problem .
The first one I tried was to mount an SSH connection with sshfs and then use encfs to make an encrypted folder on the remote machine .
This turned out to work alright but had a few bugs and permission issues .
The main problem however was jailing someone in SSH .
It is a tedious process and sshfs / encfs does n’t handle interruptions very well .
I even tried curlftpfs / encfs as an alternative .
Another option was to use a program called duplicity that would upload via ftp , ssh , scp , rsync , WebDAV , or even S3 .
This was the perfect solution .
The reason I ended up going with this method is because of the ability to use FTP .
This allows me to Jail my friend to his own directory much easier .
Setting it all up
Setting up an FTP server
We will want to have some sort of server setup on the remote machine waiting to accept files .
For the reasons stated above and the ease of jailing we are going to use an FTP server called vsftpd .
On Ubuntu / Debian machines you can install this by clicking this link .
Or use the following command :
sudo apt - get install vsftpd
You can have your friend install this on his computer in the same way .
Or , if you are just going to backup to an existing FTP server you can go ahead and skip this step .
You will then want to edit the config file of the FTP server :
sudo vim /etc/vsftpd.conf
Change :
anonymous_enable=NO
uncomment local_enable=YES
uncomment write_enable=YES
uncomment ftpd_banner =Welcome to blah FTP service ( this will hide the version number just incase )
uncomment chroot_local_user=YES
Once the changes are made save the file and restart the FTP server with :
sudo /etc/init.d/ vsftpd restart
Install and Configure vsftpd
Go ahead and test logging into the FTP with your current username .
If it works we can proceed to setting up disk quotas .
Adding a User
vsftpd makes things simple by using user logins that are already in place .
This means if the person has a Linux username on your computer they will be allowed to login through vsftpd .
To add a Linux user you can use this command :
sudo useradd
At this point they have their own login .
If you have an SSH server or physical access they can login to your system and execute commands at the user privilege level .
As a backup only user I do n’t want this user to be able to do any of those things .
The first thing I am going to do is disable SSH access ( if you have an ssh server ) :
sudo vim /etc/ssh/ sshd_config
and add , “ AllowUsers backupusername ” This will DENY all other users but backupusername .
For added security it is also good go disable the user ’s shell in case the backup user ever does gain ssh access .
You can do this by executing :
usermod -s / bin / false backupusername
Change user ’s home dir to the backup hard drive .
sudo usermod -d /media/drobo/.backupusername/ backupusername
Setting a Disk Quota
I do n’t want my friend / backupuser to accidentally fill up my hard drive or use more than our predetermined amount .
For this reason we implement disk quotas .
The first thing we will need to do to enable disk quotas is download a quota manager :
sudo apt - get install quota
After that is installed we need to edit fstab and enable quotas on the backup drive .
We will be adding the usrquota , grpquota options .
After that is in place go ahead and restart your computer .
The quota program will be issued on boot and will go through the hard drive and check the current user usage data .
To change the quota limits you can use the edquota command .
Replace sdf1 with the quoted drive .
You can find this in fstab or by issuing sudo fdisk -l .
sudo edquota backupuser / dev/sdf1
In this file you will have :
blocks , soft , hard
inodes , soft , hard
The blocks section represent the disk space alloted in KB .
The inodes section represent the number of files that are allowed .
A zero ( 0 ) in any of these columns will mean no limit !
Hard vs Soft Limits
Once the Soft limit is reached it will email the user and alert him / her to remove files within grace period ( default 7 days ) .
The hard limit , once reached , will completely cut off all write operations for that user .
In this situation I alloted the backupuser 100 gb and unlimited file creation .
Backing it up !
Download Duplicity
Debian Ubuntu /users can click here to install duplicity or use this command :
sudo apt - get install duplicity
Once duplicity is installed we can sync a folder by issuing this command :
FTP_PASSWORD =password duplicity -v 9 /home / mark / yourpath / ftp://user@host/remote/path
Replacing password with your actual FTP password .
Automating with Cron
One of the requirements for this project is to be able to backup without user intervention .
If a backup solution is n’t automated it is n’t a backup solution .
Start by creating a bash script with your favorite text editor :
vim backup.sh
The first line should be : #!/bin/bash
Then add the duplicity line like the one above for each directory you want to back up .
Note : Subdirectories will be included you do n’t need a separate line for them .
You will also have to specify the passphrase for your encryption .
Do n’t worry this wont be transmitted .
If you want to do this wihout the passphrase you can setup a GPG key with the ‘ –encrypt - key ’ option .
It should look something like :
FTP_PASSWORD =password PASSPHRASE=mysecret duplicity /home / username ftp://user@host/Home
Then you will want to make the shell script executable by doing :
chmod +x
Then open up cron with :
crontab -e
and set the job with something like this :
3 * * * /home/username/script.sh
This would automatically run our script every night at 3am
Restoring
To restore just reverse the source and destination , duplicity is smart enough to realize this and start the restore process .
Bonus
Drobo/RAID
You should also keep redundant copies of data with a hardware device .
Drobo is a configuration free way to do this but it is a bit pricey .
The other option is to build a RAID array of hard drives .
The downside to this is that you will have to purchase identical hard drives to make it worth it .
Viewing Quota Logs
To quickly get a report on how much bandwidth is being used by all of your backup users you can use this command :
sudo repquota -as
To turn quota off you can use , ‘ quota - q ’ , to turn it back on , ‘ quota ’ .
Testing Quotas
Create a file of any size instantly .
just change the count to the size of file you want in KB .
dd if=/dev/zero of=9 mb- file bs=1024 count=9216
Check the size of the file you created
du 9mb- file
sudo usermod -d /media/drobo/.jaderobbins / jaderobbins

HPong
----------------------------------
With the release of the Haskell Platform it is now trivial to start making OpenGL programs with Haskell .
HPong is a very simple OpenGL game that was made both to experiment with OpenGL and as a starting point for more complex games , since there seem to be fairly few examples of GLFW programs in Haskell .
Controls :
Up arrow moves your paddle up .
Down arrow moves your paddle down .
Esc quits the game .
HPong is based on GLFW instead of GLUT for the simple reason that GLUT does not provide a working window close callback .
All roads lead to Rome in this season 's Champions League , for the final will be staged in the Italian capital in two months ' time , but the hosts will not be around to welcome visitors , nor any other Italian club after Arsenal and Manchester United dispatched Roma and Internazionale respectively last night .
With Chelsea having defeated Juventus on Tuesday night English clubs completed a clean sweep against their Italian counterparts , ending Serie A's interest in the competition .
With Liverpool also progressing , the quarter - final draw will feature four Premier League teams .
While Manchester United won in normal time , goals from Nemanja Vidic and Cristiano Ronaldo completing a 2 - 0 aggregate victory over Inter , Arsenal had to endure the agony of penalties .
Juan had levelled their tie after nine minutes but a further 111 minutes play produced no further score .
Eduardo missed the opening penalty of the shoot - out but Manuel Almunia saved the fourth , from Mirko Vucinic .
The next 11 penalties were all scored , then Max Tonnetto shot the 16th kick of the routine over , leaving Udinese , in the Uefa Cup , Italy 's last European representatives .
" I am delighted and proud , " said Arsene Wenger .
" We did something special and showed great mental strength .
England can be very proud but we must not be fooled , the matches against the Italian teams were very close .
It looks like Italy is coming back . "

But not yet and , after his team failed to stop United in their campaign to defend the Champions League they won last season , Jose Mourinho last night said that Sir Alex Ferguson 's team could win the three remaining competitions they are in to put alongside the Club World Cup and Carling Cup that are already at Old Trafford .
Mourinho said : " They have basically the same team as the one that won the European Cup last season , there 's only [ Dimitar ]
Berbatov who they 've added , but they have worked together for four or five years now .
They started as a young side and at this moment their average age is 26 to 27 if you forget [ Ryan ] Giggs and [ Paul ] Scholes .
" They are at the right moment to be at the top of their careers and reach the maximum level , they have experience and quality , great fitness condition and intensity in their game , and the Champions League is all about that .
I think , yes , they can do it . "
The Inter manager said that he would have a meeting with club president Massimo Moratti " so I can explain why we got knocked out " .
He added : " He 's the person I 'm responsible to and who I need to be talking . "
Rejecting suggestions that he had taken
Inter no further than previous seasons , Mourinho said that his team had been unlucky at crucial moments in the game .
" All I can say is that my players did absolutely everything I asked them to do , " he said .
" They should n't be criticised , there should be no doubts about them or questions asked .
We played to our full potential and sometimes you have to look at the opposition . "
Ferguson said that his team had allowed Inter off the hook after Vidic 's goal on four minutes .
Their second goal came from a Ronaldo header four minutes into the second half .
The United manager said : " It was one of those long European nights when you 're wondering if you 're watching a game of football or watching a game of suicide .
I thought we started well and after scoring the first goal I thought we could go on and kill them .
Once we started putting the icing on the cake we opened the door for Inter and I thought we were lucky to be ahead at half - time .
We changed the system and sort of shut the door and we were better in the second half . "
The best league in the world is back .

Police have been criticised for some of their handling of the G20 protests Home Office minister Lord West has defended G20 police saying : " I think we should be extremely proud of them . "
He said he did not want to " excuse " any " criminal acts " under investigation .
But in general UK police tactics were better than " water cannon , baton rounds or shooting people - all of which seem to occur in some other countries " .
He spoke after the actions of some G20 officers were branded " unacceptable " by the incoming Chief Inspector of Constabulary Denis O'Connor .
Lord West , speaking in the House of Lords , said " thousands of officers acted absolutely professionally and proportionately , thousands were actually able to demonstrate peacefully on our streets , criminal activity in the rest of the metropolis was kept to an absolute minimum and the police also maintained high levels of security .
" And I think we should be extremely proud of them .
This does not excuse acts which are criminal and there are now investigations taking place for those particulars . "
He also defended British police tactics of confronting protesters face - to - face , arguing alternative crowd control methods were worse .
He told peers : " I have to say I do not like the thought of water cannon , baton rounds or shooting people all of which seem to occur in some other countries and I am jolly glad I live in this country .
But all of those things will be looked at . "
' Noble cause '
Any changes in guidance to police would apply to the whole of the UK , he added .
Mr O'Connor , a former senior officer in the Metropolitan Police , is conducting an inquiry into police public order tactics in the wake of the G20 protests .
He told the home affairs committee he was concerned about footage of apparent police brutality .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" My concern was obviously about the individual incidents where officers , on the face of it , appeared to break with their colleagues and assault people .
" We in this country expect the very best from our police , quite properly , and police officers who give their lives - as Gary Toms did , sadly , very recently ( PC Toms died last week after trying to stop a fleeing vehicle ) - they do it for a very noble cause .
" So when you see something that does not square with that noble cause , it is disappointing and hugely concerning . "
He added : " What I saw was unacceptable . " ' Snapshots '
He also told the committee it was " unacceptable " for officers to hide their identifying badges from the public , as some are alleged to have done .
He said police officers had to be " accountable " to the public at all times and there could be no excuses for not showing their badge numbers .
He was investigating reports some officers had removed their numbers or even refused to give them when asked by members of the public " when it 's the last thing you would expect to occur , particularly in those particularly circumstances " .
And he said his probe would look at whether all officers should be forced to wear name badges , which are currently not compulsory .
Constables and sergeants are currently meant to display their numbers but senior ranks are not .
' British way '
Mr O'Connor will also look at the widely differing tactics used by police forces in dealing with public order situations , from the " kettling " - or holding people in a confined area - seen at the G20 to the lighter touch used during the Tamils protest in Parliament Square .
He said there had been no advance intelligence on violent protests ahead of the Tamil demonstration .
On the G20 protest , he said the incident in which an officer slapped Nicola Fisher and hit her with his baton was " unacceptable " adding : " What I saw did not impress me that it's the British way . "
Mr O'Connor is Home Secretary Jacqui Smith 's preferred candidate to be the next Chief Inspector of Constabulary , although his appointment has to be confirmed by the home affairs committee .
His interim report is due by end of June , with the final report to be published in September .
Nick Hardwick , chairman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission IPCC , told the committee he had received 185 complaints from G20 protests , including more than 50 complaints from members of the public who say they were assaulted or witnessed an assault .
Mr Hardwick , who was accused later on Tuesday by the Police Federation of running a " witch - hunt " against G20 officers , said the IPCC received twice as many complaints from the 2001 Countryside Alliance protests .
' Ugly ' scenes
But he said the severity of the G20 complaints and injuries alleged is greater - although the difference may be accounted for by the presence of " citizen journalists " with mobile phone cameras at the G20 protest .
" One of the consequences of this exposure through citizen journalism is that we will all see much more clearly what it is - and sometimes it looks ugly - what we expect the police to do , " he told MPs .
Later the IPCC said it had received 185 complaints about the G20 protests , more than 40 of which were not eligible , more than 50 were about police tactics and more than 80 of which were from people claiming to have seen or experienced excessive force by police officers .
Mr Hardwick said there was a need for police to explain better so - called " distraction " techniques they are trained to use in violent confrontations , which he said was a " euphemism " for " kicking , hitting , punching " .
It " looks ugly " on the television - but police are trained to use these techniques as long as the force used is reasonable and proportionate and they should not " wash their hands " of this fact .
Mr Hardwick said he made the decision to do a " rigorous , hands - on " assessment of Mr Tomlinson 's death to see if he came into contact with the police before he collapsed .
The evidence initially was that there was not any contact , so at first the IPCC decided not to conduct an independent investigation .
He said the police should not have rushed out a statement under media pressure to say there had been no contact with Mr Tomlinson but he was not surprised they did as " they have done it before " .
He also owned up to a " mistake " , after misunderstanding a briefing , when he said there was no CCTV in the area where Mr Tomlinson collapsed .
A policeman has been interviewed under caution on suspicion of manslaughter after new tests overturned the initial post - mortem into the cause of Mr Tomlinson 's death .
Mr Tomlinson , 47 , was filmed being struck and pushed over by a police officer .
A fresh post - mortem examination found he died of abdominal bleeding , not a heart attack , as first thought .

The recent warming trend in the Atlantic Ocean is largely due to reductions in airborne dust and volcanic emissions during the past 30 years , according to a new study .
Since 1980 , the tropical North Atlantic has been warming by an average of a quarter - degree Celsius ( a half - degree Fahrenheit ) per decade .
Though this number sounds small , it can translate to big impacts on hurricanes , which thrive on warmer water , says Amato Evan , a researcher with the University of Wisconsin - Madison 's Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies and lead author of the new study .
For example , the ocean temperature difference between 1994 , a quiet hurricane year , and 2005 's record - breaking year of storms , was just one degree Fahrenheit .
More than two - thirds of this upward trend in recent decades can be attributed to changes in African dust storm and tropical volcano activity during that time , report Evan and his colleagues at UW - Madison and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in a new paper .
Their findings will appear in an upcoming issue of the journal Science and publish online March 26 .
Evan and his colleagues have previously shown that African dust and other airborne particles can suppress hurricane activity by reducing how much sunlight reaches the ocean and keeping the sea surface cool .
Dusty years predict mild hurricane seasons , while years with low dust activity — including 2004 and 2005 — have been linked to stronger and more frequent storms .
In the new study , they combined satellite data of dust and other particles with existing climate models to evaluate the effect on ocean temperature .
They calculated how much of the Atlantic warming observed during the last 26 years can be accounted for by concurrent changes in African dust storms and tropical volcanic activity , primarily the eruptions of El Chichón in Mexico in 1982 and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 .
In fact , it is a surprisingly large amount , Evan says .
" A lot of this upward trend in the long - term pattern can be explained just by dust storms and volcanoes , " he says .
" About 70 percent of it is just being forced by the combination of dust and volcanoes , and about a quarter of it is just from the dust storms themselves . "
The result suggests that only about 30 percent of the observed Atlantic temperature increases are due to other factors , such as a warming climate .
While not discounting the importance of global warming , Evan says this adjustment brings the estimate of global warming impact on Atlantic more into line with the smaller degree of ocean warming seen elsewhere , such as the Pacific .

" This makes sense , because we do n't really expect global warming to make the ocean [ temperature ] increase that fast , " he says .
Volcanoes are naturally unpredictable and thus difficult to include in climate models , Evan says , but newer climate models will need to include dust storms as a factor to accurately predict how ocean temperatures will change .
" We do n't really understand how dust is going to change in these climate projections , and changes in dust could have a really good effect or a really bad effect , " he says .
Satellite research of dust - storm activity is relatively young , and no one yet understands what drives dust variability from year to year .
However , the fundamental role of the temperature of the tropical North Atlantic in hurricane formation and intensity means that this element will be critical to developing a better understanding of how the climate and storm patterns may change .
" Volcanoes and dust storms are really important if you want to understand changes over long periods of time , " Evan says .
" If they have a huge effect on ocean temperature , they 're likely going to have a huge effect on hurricane variability as well . "
The new paper is coauthored by Ralf Bennartz and Daniel Vimont of UW - Madison and Andrew Heidinger and James Kossin of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and UW - Madison .

Note that there 's also a video on the site - it's in Norwegian but the meeting between the two and the interview afterward was conducted in English so it 's easy enough to follow along .
Utviklingsminister Erik Solheim ( SV ) er den første vestlige ministeren som fikk møte den omstridte presidenten på sju år .
Norge er klar til å gjenoppta bistanden , sier Solheim .
Development Minister Erik Solheim is the first western minister to have met with the controversial president in seven years .
Norway is ready to resume the aid , said Solheim .
– Men det forutsetter at landet holder orden i eget hus .
Jeg har sagt til Mugabe at han må innfri kravene om ytringsfrihet og større frihet for mediene , noe dette møte åpner for , og at han må løslate politiske fanger , fortsatte Solheim .
- But this is under the assumption that the country is keeping order in its own house .
I have said to Mugabe that he must fulfill the requirements on freedom of expression and greater freedom for the media , something that this meeting was held for , and that he must release political prisoners , continued Solheim .
Men da ristet Mugabe synlig irritert på hodet .
But then Mugabe shook his head , visibly irritated .
Mugabe og hans parti ZANU - PF nekter for at det det er eller noen gang har vært politiske fanger i Zimbabwe .
Mugabe and his party ( ZANU - PF ) deny that there are or ever have been political prisoners in Zimbabwe .
- Vi har pressefrihet .
Men det må jo være noen regler også .
Vi kan ikke bare åpne opp for enhver som vil skrive skandaløse ting .
Så hva skal vi med mediereformer ?
sier presidenten .
- We have press freedom .
But there must be some rules there as well .
We can't just open up for anyone who wants to write scandalous things .
So what will we do with media reform ? said the president .
- Dersom Vesten ikke aksepterer at vi er en suveren stat , vil vi ikke ha noe med dem å gjøre .
De kan bare henge seg , sier han .
- If the West does n't accept that we are a sovereign state , then we wo n't have anything to do with them .
They can hang themselves , he said .
And then in English in the article :
« If they do n't accept it , yes of course , they can go hang .
If they have n't hung since then .
Tell them I still want them to hang . »
Microsoft 's Kumo search engine images leaked when the company asked for internal feedback .
I do n't care if the release was a surprise or a sly attempt to build media attention ; I 'm hoping the tool creates a new era of visual searching .
As is , Google searches are indispensable for work and home research .
You can find a local pizza , phone number for a distant business , or seemingly answer any question .
The web 's growth owes a lot to text searches .
I even rely on internal PC searches as a main file - browsing tool .
But computers have n't been able to reliably search images .
Some have speculated that Kumo could visually search pictures , returning similar hits based on what it sees .
Whether Kumo is the first mass market tool that does this or not , the ability could be coming soon -- within years , not decades .
Right now , tools can read text from photos better than ever .
A favorite , Evernote , can even read handwriting , making that text searchable .
Apple 's iLife 09 can be trained to recognize family and friends with decent success .
It 'll even spot pets , although that 's not a supported use .
Yet , it 's hard to even imagine how computing would change with a useful , universal visual search tool .
You'd be able to find pictures of certain people , landmarks , or just specific objects .
Or you could find a photo of Bill Clinton with Barack Obama and not George Bush .
Google approaches these results by reading file names and text near images .
But could Kumo actually spot a white wolf in an image without any help from text ?
If so , you 'd get even more -- and better - - hits than text searches .
And those results would make any searches smarter and better .
It 's a huge undertaking , but I think developers are approaching this level of visual searching .
Here 's hoping that Kumo will retrieve files in a wink with just a glance .

Bonds beat stocks
This Bloomberg story gets the headline ( “ Bonds beat stocks in earth - shattering reversal ” ) right . , but the lead ( or lede ) wrong .
The intro “ Buying 30 - year Treasuries is returning more than stocks for the first time since Jimmy Carter was president . ” is wrong – bonds have beaten stocks in quite a few years since then .
The finding in the chart is much more dramatic , to the point that “ earth - shattering ” is justifiable hyperbole .
What it shows is that , over the entire period since 1979 , a strategy of buying 30 - bonds ( trading so that the portfolio always holds the most recently issued bond ) has outperformed the strategy of buying stocks and reinvesting the dividends .
This is earth - shattering ( or , at least , potentially finance - sector - shattering ) because it refutes one of the central assumptions of nearly all investment advice : that , provided you are in for the long haul , stocks always beat bonds .
Robert Shiller in Irrational Exuberance pointed out that this was historically true for the US ( for periods over 20 years ) but not for some other markets .
Now it ’s no longer true for the US .
Over longer periods , there is still a substantial equity premium ; that is , the return to holding stocks exceeds that for bonds .
But so there should be .
Returns to stocks are much more variable than those to bonds , and , as the latest evidence shows , you ca n’t eliminate that variability by holding stocks for ten or twenty years .
The big puzzle is , why are stocks so volatile .
They are more volatile than profits which , in turn , are much more volatile than aggregate consumption ( unless the current stock markets are accurately forecasting a new Great Depression ) .

Ray Allen elbows Anderson Varejao in the groin …
… and I do n’t blame him .
You can see that Varejao locked Allen ’s elbow and would n’t let go , throwing him to the floor .
Everybody focuses on the elbow to the groin , but what Varejao did was just as bad .
Why is he locking Allen ’s arm up on the free throw ?
Is he trying to injure him ?

The UN Security Council has unanimously condemned the launch by North Korea of a long - range rocket .
In a compromise statement , the 15 - member council said it would tighten sanctions against Pyongyang in the wake of the 5 April launch .
The council adopted a statement calling on North Korea to comply with a 2006 resolution banning missile tests .
Pyongyang says its rocket carried a satellite , but several nations viewed it as cover for a missile test .
" The Security Council condemns the 5 April 2009 launch by the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , which is in contravention of Security Council resolution 1718 of 2006 , " said Claude Heller , the Mexican president of the Security Council .
The statement also ordered the UN Sanctions Committee to begin enforcing both financial sanctions and an existing arms embargo against North Korea .
UN Secretary Ban Ki-moon has welcomed the council 's move , saying it sent " a unified message " .
But the BBC's Matthew Price at the UN says it remains to be seen how far member states will go to enforce the sanctions .
' Strong and positive ' Japan 's ambassador to the UN described the North Korean launch as a " provocative act " and said there was " no doubt " it breached the terms of resolution 1718 .
Tokyo had sought quick action from the Security Council , and pushed for an official resolution declaring North Korea in breach of the 2006 resolution - but this was opposed by China and Russia .
The US is very pleased that the council has today issued a strong , unanimous statement
Susan Rice
US ambassador to the UN However , both Japan and the US backed the compromise agreed statement , which our correspondent says is not legally binding in the same way as a resolution .
And the Japanese envoy hailed the clear language of the unanimous resolution , saying there could be " no stronger message " than the quick and timely action of the Security Council .
Susan Rice , the US envoy to the UN , said the statement was a " strong and , we believe , positive outcome " .
" The US is very pleased that the council has today issued a strong , unanimous statement , " she said .
The agreement " clearly demonstrates that there can be no future such launches " , Ms Rice added .
China 's ambassador warned that the statement came at a " sensitive " time , and urged restraint from all sides involved .
Stalled talks
Mr Ban said the council 's " unified response " could pave the way for further progress in resolving " all outstanding issues " on the Korean peninsula .
Satellite view of nuclear site
This could include " the early resumption of the six - party talks and the inter- Korean dialogue " , he said .
Those talks - involving the US , China , Japan , Russia and the two Koreas - have stalled over the failure of Pyongyang to verify the shutdown of the Yongbyon nuclear plant .
Pyongyang agreed to dismantle the facility as part of an aid - for - disarmament deal and in response , the US removed North Korea from its terrorism blacklist .
The BBC's Paul Reynolds says it remains unclear what Pyongyang 's intentions were in launching the rocket .
The country may be attempting to develop a useable nuclear weapon and the means to carry it , or it may just be seeking to hold the world 's attention , making concessions which can easily be withdrawn , says our correspondent .

The Catholic Church never condemned Darwin
The Vatican is sponsoring a five day conference to mark the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin 's Origin of Species .
The subject is the compatibility of evolution and creation .
It is one of two separate international academic conferences being sponsored by the Vatican this year .
They aim to re-examine the work of scientific thinkers whose revolutionary ideas challenged religious belief : Galileo and Charles Darwin .
Scientists , philosophers and theologians from around the world are gathering at the prestigious Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome to discuss the compatibility of Darwin 's theory of evolution and Catholic teaching .
Christian churches were long hostile to Darwin because his theory conflicted with the literal biblical account of creation .
But the Catholic Church never condemned Darwin , as it condemned and silenced Galileo .
Pope John Paul II said that evolution was " more than a hypothesis " .
The design of organisms is not what would be expected from an intelligent engineer
Prof Francisco Ayala
Yet as recently as 2006 a leading Catholic Cardinal , Christoff Schoenborn , of Vienna , a former student and friend of Pope Benedict XVI caused controversy by saying that Darwin 's theory of natural selection was incompatible with Christian belief .
A leading American scholar of biology , Prof Francisco Ayala , plans to tell the conference that the so - called theory of intelligent design , proposed by Creationists , is flawed .
" The design of organisms is not what would be expected from an intelligent engineer , but imperfect and worse , " he said .
" Defects , dysfunctions , oddities , waste and cruelty pervade the living world " .
BELLEVUE , WA – Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on April 7 acknowledged that gun registration is on her agenda , days after Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters in Mexico that the Second Amendment would not “ stand in the way ” of administration plans to crack down on alleged gun trafficking to Mexico .
“ These are alarming remarks from Speaker Pelosi and Attorney General Holder , ” said Second Amendment Foundation founder Alan Gottlieb .
“ It appears that the Obama administration and Capitol Hill anti-gunners have dropped all pretences about their plans for gun owners ’ rights , and it looks like the gloves are coming off . ”
Pelosi ’s revelation came during an interview on ABC ’s Good Morning , America .
While insisting that Congress “ never denied ” the gun rights of American Citizens , Pelosi told Roberts , “ We want them registered .
We do n’t want them crossing state lines … ” Gottlieb noted that citizens ’ rights do not stop at state lines .
“ But that does n’t really matter , ” he observed .
“ History has shown that around the world , registration has always led to confiscation . ”
In Mexico , according to the Wall Street Journal , Holder was asked if the administration might encounter constitutional issues as it tries to crack down on alleged gun trafficking .
His response : “ I do n’t think our Second Amendment will stand in the way of efforts we have begun and will expand upon . ”
“ These comments belie administration promises and Democrat rhetoric that party leaders respect the rights of law - abiding Americans to own the firearm of their choice , ” Gottlieb said .
“ They imposed registration of semi-autos in Pelosi ’s California and it led to a ban , but it certainly did n’t disarm criminals , like the convicted felon who killed four Oakland police officers last month .
We know from Holder that the Obama administration wants to renew the nationwide ban on such firearms , but that wo n’t prevent crime , either .
“ The administration and Congressional anti-gunners have declared war on gun rights , ” Gottlieb said .
“ The press seems deliberately blind to the statements from Pelosi and Holder , who blame our gun rights for their incompetence in dealing with crime .
More than 90 million gun owners have n’t hurt anybody , and they are tired of being treated like criminals . ”
The first sea creatures to venture onto land may have been temporary visitors who protected themselves on the dangerous trip with borrowed armor , according to a new study .
Fossil
tracks discovered on an ancient Cambrian - period beachhead suggest an intrepid group of aquatic scorpion - like creatures commandeered empty mollusk shells , much like modern day hermit crabs .
Researchers think they used the shells as protection against the harsh dry air , and stole ashore under cover of darkness to graze on mats of algae exposed during low tide [ Discovery News ] .
Much scientific attention has focused on the water - to - land transition that vertebrates made between 385 million and 376 million years ago ....
But by that era , another group of creatures — arthropods , the group that today includes crustaceans , scorpions and insects — had been strolling around on land for more than 115 million years [ Science News ] ,
notes lead researcher James Hagadorn .
The tracks he studied , which date from about 500 million years ago , appear to have been made by a many - legged arthropod distantly related to scorpions and horseshoe crabs .
In the new study , published in the journal Geology , Hagadorn and a colleague came to the conclusion that the early arthropod borrowed a shell based on the tracks it left in the primordial sand .
Some
of the tracks show odd markings along their left side , as if the animals had bent tails that dragged to one side .
[ The researchers ] now report that these tracks are very similar to the distinctive ones left by a hermit crab carrying a coiled shell [ New Scientist ] .
Carrying a shell onto land could have kept the adventurous arthropod from drying out , as trapped seawater inside the shell would have kept its gills moist .
It would have also shielded the critter from temperature fluctuations and ultraviolet light .
Hagadorn admits the notion of innovative hermit arthropods crawling in the open 500 million years ago is speculative .
And all he and [ his colleague Adolf ]
Seilacher have to go on right now are a series of tracks -- no body fossils have been discovered .
" I am confident the animal that made these tracks was an arthropod .
I am not at all confident it was a hermit arthropod , " Hagadorn said .
" It 's the best idea we 've got , though .
It 's kind of like solving a crime without the murder weapon or DNA evidence " [ Discovery News ] .

FRIDAY UPDATE !!!
Here ’s another way you can let the White House know what you think .
The Drug Czar ’s blog , Pushing Back , is asking for the public ’s feedback regarding Thursday ’s Town Hall Meeting .
You already know what they think ; let them know what you think here .
UPDATE !!!
UPDATE !!!
UPDATE !!!
Since many of you are writing President Obama on your own , NORML would like to assist the process by providing you with a link for contacting the White House directly .
Please log on and send your e-mails by going here .
Also , please check The Hill.com ( Read and comment here ) and HuffingtonPost.com ( Read and comment here ) on Friday for updated versions of this commentary , and please post your feedback to those forums as well .
Speaking live moments ago President Barack Obama pledged “ to open up the White House to the American people . ”
Well , to some of the American people that is .
As for those tens of millions of you who believe that cannabis should be legally regulated like alcohol — and the tens of thousands of you who voted to make this subject the most popular question in today ’s online Presidential Town Hall — well , your voice does n’t really matter .
Asked this morning whether he “ would … support the bill currently going through the California legislation to legalize and tax marijuana , boosting the economy and reducing drug cartel related violence , ” the President responded with derision .
“ There was one question that was voted on that ranked fairly high and that was whether legalizing marijuana would improve the economy and job creation , and I do n’t know what this says about the online audience , ” he laughed .
“ The answer is no , I do n’t think that [ is ] a good strategy . ”
Obama ’s cynical rebuff was short - sighted and disrespectful to a large percentage of his supporters .
After all , was it not this very same “ online audience ” that donated heavily to Obama ’s Presidential campaign and ultimately carried him to the White House ?
Second , as I ’ve written previously in The Hill and elsewhere , the overwhelming popularity of the marijuana law reform issue — as manifested in this and in similar forums — illustrates that there is a significant , vocal , and identifiable segment of our society that wants to see an end to America ’s archaic and overly punitive marijuana laws .
The Obama administration should be embracing this constituency , not mocking it .
Third , will somebody please ask the President : “ What is it that you think is so funny about the subject of marijuana law reform ? ”
Since 1965 , police have arrested over 20 million Americans for violating marijuana laws , yet nearly 90 percent of teenagers say that pot is “ very easy ” or “ fairly easy ” to obtain .
That ’s funny ?
According to this very administration , there is an unprecedented level of violence occurring at the Mexico / US border — much of which is allegedly caused by the trafficking of marijuana to the United States by drug cartels .
America ’s stringent enforcement of pot prohibition , which artificially inflates black market pot prices and ensures that only criminal enterprises will be involved in the production and sale of this commodity , is helping to fuel this violence .
Wow , funny stuff !
Finally , two recent polls indicate that a strong majority of regional voters support ending marijuana prohibition and treating the drug ’s sale , use , and distribution like alcohol .
A February 2009
Zogby telephone poll reported that nearly six out of ten of voters on the west coast think that cannabis should be “ taxed and legally regulated like alcohol and cigarettes . ”
A just - released California Field Poll reports similar results , finding that 58 percent of statewide voters believe that regulations for cannabis should be the same or less strict than those for alcohol .
Does the President really think that all of these voters are worthy of his ridicule ?
Let the White House laugh for now , but the public knows that this issue is no laughing matter .
This week alone , legislators in Illinois , Minnesota , and New Hampshire voted to legalize the use of marijuana for authorized individuals .
Politicians in three additional states heard testimony this week in favor of eliminating criminal penalties for all adults who possess and use cannabis .
And lawmakers in Massachusetts and California are now debating legally regulating marijuana outright .
The American public is ready and willing to engage in a serious and objective political debate regarding the merits of legalizing the use of cannabis by adults .
And all over this nation , whether Capitol Hill wants to acknowledge it or not , they are engaging in this debate as we speak .
Sorry Obama , this time the joke ’s on you .

All About Aries
The Personality of an Aries , Explained
When these rams are angry , it 's best to stay out of their way .
If Denver 's marijuana enthusiasts are serious about decriminalizing their favorite narcotic , they sure did n't show much enthusiasm for it on Thursday night .
Or maybe they just got stoned and forgot .
Either way , I was surprised by how few people showed up for the Official 420 Rally Fundraiser , held at Pure nightclub on Welton Street ( in the old Roxy ) on April 9 .
The purpose of the event , according to the group 's press release , was to raise money for porta-potties and dumpsters for the upcoming 420 rally at Civic Center Park , which it claimed the city provided for free last year but is refusing to do again .
( For the record , the city says it did not provide free services for last year 's April 20 rally , and insists it 's just sticking to its standard rules for events held in city parks ) .
The real porta - pottie story may forever be clouded in a dopey haze , but the dozens of folks who did show up on Thursday seemed unfazed by any bureaucratic roadblocks standing in their way .
In fact , Miguel Lopez , the executive director of Denver 's 420 Rally , says he believes the city is on the cusp of what could be a historic national revolution when it comes to the legalization of marijuana .
I gladly joined the rebellion , donating five bucks toward the cause .
My money went toward a raffle featuring assorted prizes ranging from glass pipes to free dental exams ( ? ) .
But when I asked Lopez how I would claim my prize if I won , since I likely would n't be there for the 1 a.m drawing , he drew a blank .
" Umm ... ha ... I did n't really think of that kind of scenario , " he said , reaffirming every preexisting stereotype I had bestowed on him .
" You know , sometimes you do n't think about things until they happen . "
I suggested writing my name and number on the back of the stub .
He thought that was a pretty good idea .
But other than these minor logistical difficulties , Lopez was an intelligent , agreeable guy , and he seemed legitimately focused on his mission : to tack on another freedom to the long , lovely list of them here in the U.S. of A .
With a lineup of diverse local bands , comedians and a few felicitous vendors -- namely a smoking - accessories shop and a hemp ice cream sandwich man -- the rally had all the necessary ingredients ... except enough people .
It 's hard to pinpoint the reason for this : weak publicity , curious location , slow night .
Who knows ?
What mattered was that it was happening , and at least some people were showing up to support the cause .
Right ?
Well ... sort of .
When I asked Lopez how much more money they needed to raise for the porta-potties and trash receptacles , he proudly informed me they had already raised enough for those , plus all of their security needs .
Confused , I produced the event 's official press release , and noted that the purpose of that night 's event seemed focused on raising money for those exact things .
Lopez , caught slightly off - guard ( again ) , eventually informed me that the money collected would be used for " extra barricades " and " sound equipment . "
Seems legitimate enough , though I wonder how many people there would have willingly forked over their precious legal greens for extra fences and speakers .
Clearly , you can't hold a large public event without bathrooms and garbage cans , but imagining my five bucks going toward just another sub - woofer pumping out " Hits From the Bong " and " Burn One Down " was n't as satisfying .
Oh , well .
Maybe I 'll win a free dental exam .

OTTAWA --
A group of nurses who work for the federal government say they never would have achieved a pay - equity settlement if the government 's legislation barring the human rights commission from getting involved had already been in effect .
The nurses -- designated medical adjudicators by the government -- decide on Canada Pension Plan disability claims .
Although they have for years done virtually identical work as a small group of doctors who work in the same department , the nurses are not recognized as health professionals , are paid about half as much as the doctors and receive substantially different benefits and training allowances .
One of the nurses , who spoke to the Free Press only on condition of anonymity , fearing retribution , said that in their fight for fair compensation , the nurses were first ignored by the government , then their union , and then were turned down by the Public Service Labour Relations Board .
So the group -- about 430 nurses in all , 95 per cent of whom are women -- hired a lawyer and filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission .
In December 2007 , the commission found in their favour , determining the nurses had been unfairly classified and discriminated against .
The nurses will receive compensation going back to 1978 , the year the Canadian Human Rights
Act took effect .
No exact settlement figure has been reached yet .
These nurses say they won their fight , but fear if the new Public Sector Equitable Compensation
Act makes it through Parliament , anyone else in their situation will be stuck .
" I do n't think ( the legislation ) will affect our situation , " the nurse said , " but for all those people who are coming behind us we are speaking up . "
The legislation , introduced by Manitoba MP and Treasury Board President Vic Toews , requires pay - equity complaints to be addressed by unions and the government during the bargaining process .
He has said repeatedly his government wants to stop the lengthy process that has dragged some pay - equity cases through the courts for more than 20 years .
If the employees do n't feel the bargained pay - equity settlement is fair , they can appeal to the labour relations board .
But they can no longer take pay - equity complaints to the Human Rights Commission .

HONG KONG  China ’s cabinet released on Monday what it called a human rights action plan , a lengthy document promising to improve the protection of civil liberties , which are often neglected and sometimes systematically violated in China .
Under the two - year plan , China promised to protect the rights to a fair trial , to participate in government decisions and to learn about and question policies .
It calls for measures to discourage torture , like requiring interrogation rooms to be designed to physically separate interrogators from the accused .
The civil liberties mentioned in the action plan are already guaranteed by Chinese laws or the Constitution .
Human rights groups say many are nonetheless ignored or suppressed by the authorities at their own discretion , without any practicable grounds for appeal through the Communist Party - controlled judiciary .
The document does not propose any fundamental reforms of the country ’s one - party system , like making the courts independent of party control or allowing other parties or political groups to hold power .
Instead , it focuses on trying to advance respect for human rights within the existing bureaucracies .

“ The truth is near . ”
Religious faith : reasonable or ridiculous ?
In the mind of Bill Maher , the title for his movie says it all , “ Religulous . ”
To Maher , nobody really knows anything about God ; so to say anything with certitude is simply to express unfounded faith in the ridiculous .
He goes so far as to caricaturize faith as something “ that makes a virtue out of not thinking . ”
To his credit , there are entirely too many Christians that do not know why they believe what they believe , and those Christians were all too available for Maher ’s interviews .
Why do people believe in God ?
Answers from interviewees ranged from seemingly mild coincidences interpreted as personal miracles , to no reason at all — they just believed … because .
When people have no idea why they believe in God , it would seem that their faith is without foundation , and that has never been the faith of Scripture .
If Christians define faith as just something they believe blindly , then why would n’t the pagan who believes in magical unicorns have as much claim to the truth as we ?
The fact is that God has not left us without evidences , good reason , and eyewitness accounts , but Maher would hardly know that from the champions of our faith with which he had the opportunity to dialogue .
How can we know there ’s a God ?
Answer
What if the cosmos is all that there is ?
Answer If God made everything , who made God ?
Answer
The film is reminiscent of another documentary recently released titled , “ EXPELLED : No Intelligence Allowed . ”
In that faith - affirming film , the host runs all over the world getting input about Intelligent Design , and splices in humorous clips from other movies to enrich points or to lighten the mood .
“ Religulous ” follows this same format , and there are some very funny bits for which only the dourest among us will be able to remain untickled .
Unfortunately , these come with the unhappy realization that Maher is laughing at us , not with us , and that is what makes it all the worse , because some of it is pathetically deserved .
Have we forgotten what it was like before Christ saved any of us ?
How did Christians appear to us then ?
Perhaps this is a reminder .
Bill Maher traveled the globe asking his questions , often with a smugness that left people speechless ( and in several occasions , irate ) .
He was ejected from churches and their property , and people walked out on him when they sensed they were being sucked into God-bashing sessions .
Many tried to answer him with simple responses , not realizing that they were dealing with no mere seeker , but a hostile inquisitor .
This was not unlike some of what occurred in the movie “ Borat , ” another film by “ Religulous ” director , Larry Charles , in which people were lulled into situations that would end with the star making fools of them .
While Maher questions all religious belief , it is the Bible which irks him most of all , and that because he was raised a nominal Catholic .
He recalls hating church and viewing it as boring and irrelevant .
This , if anything , should be instructive to us about how important it is to positively engage kids in their Sunday school classrooms , if we ever hope to have them value and retain their faith into adulthood .
Maher ’s family abandoned churchgoing and spiritual things when he was very young , and as he sat and interviewed his own mother and another family member , it became obvious that that the apple had n’t fallen far from the tree .
The language in this movie is rough .
It ’s typical , worldly , conversational speech that is punctuated by profanity throughout .
It ’s not as though the use of such verbiage is there to deliberately shock anyone , it ’s simply the way people who do n’t abide any divine parameters express themselves , and Bill Maher is one of those .
It would be pointless to number the times any particular offensive word was uttered since everything that could be said , was .
There is also one movie clip inserted to illustrate a perverse point , and it involved a sexual situation with a topless nun .
The scene is brief , but it does add an element of lewdness to the film which was probably responsible for gaining the R-rating .
Other clips were included that display angry people wielding guns , but there is no real violence to speak of .
If scenes of smoking bother particular viewers , then they ’ll be bothered a tad more that Maher is shown smoking marijuana with some cult leader of a stoner religion in the Netherlands .
This is another of the things that helps muck up the truth about God in “ Religulous , ” as well as in the mind that conceived it , since every cult , pagan religion , and oddball spiritist gets thrown into Maher ’s supernatural blender and poured out as examples of religion ’s idiocy .
Editor ’s Note : Individuals featured in “ Religulous ” also include : a Raelist ( a UFO religion begun in France ) , Polygamists , Satanists , Recreational users of cannabis , Hasidic scholars , Jesus impersonators , Messianic Jews , Muslims , Creationists , and a US senator who believes in the Rapture .
Answers for skeptics
How do we know the Bible is true ?
Answer
When we say that the Bible is the Word of God , does that imply that it is completely accurate , or does it contain insignificant inaccuracies in details of history and science ?
Answer
How can the Bible be infallible if it is written by fallible humans ?
Answer Answers to supposed Bible “ contradictions ” and puzzles
If Maher would focus in on biblical scholarship and seriously be open to answers regarding Christian faith , he might actually find himself believing what he now denies .
Of note was one eureka moment when someone explained the Trinity to him , using the single - substance water analogy of liquid , solid and vapor .
Christians debate the usefulness of such poor models for God , but it had a measure of resonance for Maher , briefly , before he laughed it off as stupid .
If that example provided even a drop of reasonableness to his faithless mind , imagine if more and better things could be shared with him and those of similar ilk .
Trinity — How can one God be three persons ?
Answer
Maher vehemently denounces what he deems arrogance on the part of people who speak with any certainty about spiritual matters , but that causes me to ask why Maher ’s certainty of everyone else ’s ignorance should be preferred .
He is certain that nobody else knows anything for certain , but only their certainty is arrogant ?
Maher has not thought all of his logic through , nor has he done enough homework to get beyond the atheistic canards of the past .
He takes swipes at the life and existence of Christ , claiming the biblical account to be a mere retelling of earlier myths about resurrected Greek gods .
No unbiased scholar today believes this , of course , and the evidence shows that the making of parallels between Jesus ’ life and the ancient mystery religions developed after the first century , not before .
In other words , the Christian story was co-opted by the cults , not the other way around .
Maher judges religion to be a “ neurological disorder ”
But his gripes should remind us how important it is for every generation to be prepared to revisit the old questions and to have good answers for them .
Maher is also certain enough about his own position that he judges religion to be a “ neurological disorder , ” and he is betting his life that no Hell awaits him on a non-existent judgment day .
I ’m betting my life that he ’s wrong .
The movie ends rather sadly when Maher asks his mother if there is a Heaven , and she replies with little concern , “ who knows ? ” Everyone laughs .
After this , a screen inscription informs the audience that she is now dead .
Christians will think , “ She now knows the truth with a bit more vested interest . ”
My advice for thinking Christians is to see the movie .
If anything , it will put your faith into high gear as you seek to answer Bill Maher ’s challenges .
Children cannot see the film due to its rating , but they would n’t like it anyway , and I would n’t take your sainted grandmother to see it lest she go apoplectic .
But for the rest of us , if we ca n’t countenance the language and challenge of the movie , then perhaps we are n’t engaging unbelievers very much in our Christian walk and witness .
Some will disagree with me , citing Psalm 101:3 that I should “ set before my eyes no vile thing ” ( NIV ) , but I think this is a different sort of vile thing .
This is not a vulgar film to be enjoyed as rank entertainment , it ’s the world ’s playbook , opened for our understanding and subsequent response .
Had God not seen our sin , Christ would not have come , but our need necessitated His action , and we are His ambassadors to engage sinners on account of the Gospel .
Here ’s our opportunity .

It 's Day 5 at The Pirate Bay trial .
Will colorful site spokesman Peter Sunde stand up to the pressure ?
There seems little doubt of that , but the Prosecution are trying to make it as difficult as possible by introducing yet more uncleared evidence .
Peter demands of the Prosecution , " Is this a political trial ? "
Friday , the fifth day of the trial and Peter Sunde , aka brokep , is being questioned by the Prosecution .
Håkan Roswall started off by asking Peter if he ever had dealings with The Pirate Bay ’s ( TPB ) computer systems – Peter said he did , but in a limited fashion .
Roswall then inquired about Peter ’s involvement in TPB ’s advertising deals , in particular one with ad company Random Media which Peter signed up to as a ‘ Founder ’ of the site .
Peter said that this was connected with new website project which would draw funds from TPB ’s adverttising revenue .
Roswall then brought up Piratbyran – the Swedish Bureau of Piracy – and asked Peter if this organization is critical of copyright .
“ Not critical directly , ” Peter replied .
“ There are many differing views . ”
Roswall then turned to Peter ’s stance toward copyright .
“ This is a difficult question to answer , ” Peter said .
“ I like things that are not protected by copyright , this is a non-issue . ”
Peter was asked if he knew of TPB ’s “ legal ” page .
He said he was aware of it .
Roswall , presumably trying to speak the same ‘ language ’ as the somewhat techie defendants , got tied up a little ;
“ When did you meet [ Gottfrid ] for the first time IRL ? ” asked the Prosecutor .
“ We do not use the expression IRL , ” said Peter , “ We use AFK . ” “ IRL ? ” questioned the judge .
“ In Real Life , ” the Prosecutor explained to the judge .
“ We do not use that expression , ” Peter noted .
“ Everything is in real life .
We use AFK – Away From Keyboard . ”
“ Well , ” said Roswall .
“ It seems I am a little bit out of date . ”
One of the themes so far is how the Prosecutor is struggling to come to terms with the somewhat chaotic structure of the TPB ’s operations .
Trying to pin down
Peter ’s role , he asked about his position as TPB spokesman – Peter said he took the unofficial position since no - one else in the team wanted to do it .
A request from a journalist or someone else for a comment on something came in , said Peter , and he simply took it in hand .
Then the attention turned to Peter ’s relationship with advertiser Oded Daniel and whether or not Peter has handled money from him .
“ Have you never wondered why you got these earnings reports ?
Is n’t this type of thing a little beyond your role of spokesman ? ” asked Roswall .
“ I think it is his [ Oded Daniel ’s ] way of trying to motivate people .
He sends so much weird email , I do n’t read half of it .
He could have been using me to get more contact with Fredrik and Gottfrid , ” said Peter .
The Prosecutor continued to struggle with the apparent lack of a formal decision - making structure at TPB , continually referring to TPB as a “ company ” .
It was revealed that Peter and Gottfrid met Oded Daniel in 2005 / 2006 .
Carl Lundström and Peter Sunde met just a handful of times .
“ Is it true you went to Israel to meet Oded in 2006 ? ” said Roswall .
“ Yes , ” responded Peter .
“ Why did you go to meet him ? ” questioned Roswall .
“ Because he asked me to go there as his guest , ” said Peter .
“ Did you not go there to go to the beach ? ” “ Yes , I did , very often . ”
Roswall then questioned Peter on many emails back and forth from Oded Daniel to TPB , many centered on the proposed TPB YouTube - like side - project for streaming video called VideoBay .
Referring to development of the search capability on TPB , the Prosecutor appeared to be suggesting that Peter worked on TPB on technical issues in a response to mails from Oded Daniel , but Peter said that others carried out the work .
At one stage Peter said he came up with the idea of selling statistics from TPB , believing people would be interested to read them in newspapers etc .
When Roswall asked Peter if he ever expected to receive money from TPB , the answer was “ no ” .
After the break , it was IFPI ’s Peter Danowsky turn to start questioning Peter , beginning with his education .
Peter says he dropped out of school but later learned English and computer programming from the Internet .
Danowsky then turned his attention to ad - company Random Media , again referring to emails from TPB .
Then , in a repeat of yesterday ’s performance , the Prosecution started again to introduce more evidence that had not been cleared pre-trial .
Danowsky continued to present new evidence in the form of some newspaper articles to try to contradict what Peter had said .
According to multiple reports , not only was the defense annoyed at the Prosecution ’s unacceptable actions , but the judge was too .
The judge reprimanded Danowsky and the defense told him to cut out this American - style trial strategy .
The Court then adjourned for 10 minutes to discuss the situation .
Upon restart , the judge said the decision is that any new material the Prosecution is planning to bring up needs to be submitted before the questioning has started , as is proper .
The Prosecution then claimed to hand over all their surprise material they were holding and the Court took another break so that Peter could read through everything .
This was later confirmed to be 9 new documents .
After the break Danowsky ’s questioning of Peter resumed .
“ Did you hold a lecture called “ How to dismantle a billion dollar industry ? ” “ Yes I did , ” replied Peter .
Danowsky started to quote some of Peter ’s comments from his blog at Brokep.com .
Peter says that everything he writes on his blog is n’t about TPB even if prosecutors would like it to be the case .
Pressed further on his opinions on copyright , Peter asked Danowsky , “ That is a political issue .
Is this a political trial or a legal trial ? ”
Danowsky continued , ignoring the question but Peter pulled him back .
“ I want an answer from the lawyer Danowsky .
Is this a political trial ?
Can I get a reply ? ”
“ How can copyright law be a political issue ? ” said Danowsky , but had no follow up questions .
Peter was surprised , “ No follow - ups ?
Ok , let me elaborate … ” and he went on at length about the context of Danowsky ’s various questions .
Danowsky asked Peter about a time when he said that rights holders had acted illegally .
Peter said this was a reference to Warner Brothers that had attacked file - sharing sites with hacking , aka anti-p2p activity .
Danowsky asked Peter what the purpose of TPB was .
“ It is to enable users to share their material with others , ” said Peter .
“ Even though it is copyrighted ? ” questioned Danowsky .
“ That can sometimes be the sad consequences , ” Peter replied .
After a brief appearance by movie company lawyer Wadsted , the court stopped for lunch .
On return , Peter Altin questioned his client , Peter Sunde .
He asked him if he was responsible for TPB or if he felt responsible due to his comments for the site .
On both , the reply was negative .
Altin put it to Peter that he could ’ve made lots of money from TPB .
“ No , I do n’t have a million sitting around somewhere .
That would be nice , though . ”
When Altin asked about the amount of copyright material tracked by TPB , Peter explained that he carried out a survey of a random 1000 torrents from the tracker and 80 % of the content linked by the site was not copyrighted , noting that there is much more illegal material on YouTube .
Then Altin ’s interview with Carl Lundström began .
He told the court how he met Fredrik at an event called Dreamhack in Jönköping , Sweden during 2004 .
The Court heard that Lundström always believed that TPB operated within the law but they needed resources .
This situation led to him signing an agreement with Fredrik that they could have two computers at Rix Telecom in Gothenburg , along with him being a technician there .
The deal would allow TPB to develop with a little financial support from Lundström , and then when the site grew and became a success , TPB would stay with Rix and pay their way as a regular customer .
Next it was Roswall ’s turn to interview Lundström .
Lundström admitted that he knew that there was piracy connected with TPB , and that he understood that TPB is a “ file - sharing site , a torrent site ” .
Speaking of the advertising he took responsibility for the plan believing it was a way the site could pay for itself in the future .
He went on to say that he had no idea of any political motivations of the site and what interested him was the desire of the other defendants to make the biggest BitTorrent site in the world .
“ And I liked that , ” he said .
“ I can understand that , ” replied Roswall .
Then followed discussion about the equipment given to TPB by Lundström .
The cost of the equipment was 18,000 kronor and the bill was paid by Lundström .
Lundström made clear that he did n’t want to become a partner , but that he did continue to be interested in the project , and that he gave some advise to the TPB team a few times .
After a short break Lundström was further questioned by the prosecution .
They asked him about his contact with Oded Daniel , who handles advertisement on TPB .
Lundström admitted to know Oded very well .
When movie industry lawyer Wadsted asked Lundström why an 48 year old businessman hangs out with people from TPB his lawyer jumped in and told his client not to respond .
At 3 o’clock in the afternoon the hearings ended , after discussing next week ’s schedule .
This is a developing story , check back for updates
Greetings .
The now notorious Jim Cramer Stock Manipulation video that I recently noted ( apparently taped in late 2006 , and on YouTube since last year ) has suddenly been pulled from YouTube due to copyright claims by TheStreet.com .
Fascinating that this occurred only after it received so much negative attention on everything from my blog , to CNN , to Jon Stewart , ... to just about everywhere else .
This is n't to say that TheStreet.com should n't be able to assert a copyright claim if they so choose -- even if doing so will likely bring about exactly the reverse of what they presumably intend .
It 's a hopeless attempt at damage control .
Does anybody really believe that removing the video from YouTube at this point will do anything but extend the controversy , or that interested parties do n't routinely archive videos that have a high probability of being suddenly blocked on YouTube ?
Trying to wall people off from that video now only makes it that much more of a " must see " attraction !
Remembering my maxim that , " It 's impossible to successfully censor the Internet by trying to remove materials that have attracted attention after being posted publicly " -- it 's certain that plenty of copies are around for diligent searchers to locate with comparative ease .
And even if the Lords of Censorship begin attempting legal actions to try censor search engines themselves on a large scale ( a not necessarily unlikely scenario given some popular sensibilities ) , Jim Cramer 's " how to " video on stock manipulation will still likely take its place in the pantheon of Internet video wonders that will never die .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
ELLISON SUES STAR TREK
Harlan Ellison , multiple award - winning writer of the famed teleplay for the original Star Trek episode , City on the Edge of Forever , sued Paramount on March 13 , 2009 for failing to account to , or pay , Mr. Ellison for the merchandising , publishing , or any other exploitations , of the famous teleplay , from inception to date .
The suit also names the Writers Guild of America and alleges the WGA failed to act on Ellison ’s behalf after numerous requests .
Ellison ’s City on the Edge of Forever ( the memorable episode starring Joan Collins as salvation sister Edith Keeler , the woman Kirk loved and watched die ; remember ? ) continues , 35 years after its original NBC airing , to receive critical accolades , and has become legendary as one of the all - time money - making commercial favorites : it won the coveted Writers Guild award for year ’s best teleplay ; it won the “ Hugo ” award of the World Science Fiction Convention ; it was ranked as one of the “ 100 Greatest Television Episodes of All Time ” by TV Guide in 1997 as part of its 50 year survey ; it was “ One of the 100 Most Memorable Moments in Television History ” in the 29 June 1996 nationwide survey ; and as recently as its 20 - 26 April 2002 issue , TV Guide celebrated Star Trek ’s 35th anniversary featuring , of the hundreds of episodes since its debut , its 35 Greatest Moments !
Harlan Ellison ’s City on the Edge of Forever was # 2 .
Mr. Ellison ’s attorney , John H. Carmichael , points out that the 1960 collective bargaining agreement between the WGA and the Producers , as amended in 1966 , assures to the writers of individual teleplays “ a piece of the pie . ”
Specifically , Mr. Carmichael states , “ Writers under that WGA agreement are supposed to get 25 % of the revenue from the licensing of publication rights .
From Dollar One .
Here , Paramount licensed its sister - corporation Simon & Schuster , through its Pocket Books division , the right to publish a knock - off trilogy of paperbacks – the ‘ Crucible ’ series – novels based on City , using Ellison ’s unique elements : plot , specific non-Trek characters , prominently including The Guardian of Forever , singular conceptual uses of time travel , the sense of tragedy that propels the story , the mood and venue of the story in the 1930s Great Depression , and at the stories ’ heart , pivotally , whether Edith Keeler lives or dies .
Not merely minor points or window dressing or name - changes .
No , they are the body , heart , and guts of Mr. Ellison ’s original creation – the best story Star Trek ever told .
“ But even as flagrant in evidence as is this case , Paramount has gone tabula rasa .
Paramount will not respond to any alleged Guild requests for an accounting .
Not just for the books , but for much City - related merchandise , such as a Hallmark Christmas ornament of the “ talking ” Guardian of Forever actually using lines Ellison wrote for his script – obvious re-uses of Ellison ’s singular creation , for which he should be compensated .
Paramount will not send statements ;
Paramount will not admit anyone is owed anything ; and even when the WGA requests an accounting , they are blown off with – ‘ we ’ll get back to you , ’ which they do n’t .
And the WGA seems routinely to accept such cavalier non-responsiveness without a fight .
Paramount will not permit examination , and will not open the books ; perhaps for fear of loosing a Super - Accountant / Pandora on them , who will open holes in their duplicity .
But the WGA is clearly unwilling to take action on Mr. Ellison ’s behalf , and so we must seek intervention of the Federal Courts to ensure that the principles of the collective bargaining agreement are upheld .
Mr. Ellison is singularly reluctant to sue his own labor union , of which he has been a 47 - year member , a valued public spokesman , and where he has twice served on its Board of Directors .
In this fractious matter , Mr. Ellison is only asking for one U.S. Dollar from his Guild .
But he wants a judicial determination as to whether the WGA is doing what its stated purpose has been since day - one !
To fight and negotiate for him and other writers .
To obtain misappropriated , withheld , hidden earnings , no matter how minuscule or difficult to retrieve – but HIS , nonetheless .
These are intended , true , benefits from earlier WGA bargaining agreements .
But after waiting patiently either for the Guild to move against dismissive Paramount , or for Paramount to have a brain - flare of honesty or integrity , these huge sums due continue to be dumped into the studio ’s ever - hungry maw .
Mr. Ellison wants every penny of his long ago agreed - upon share of the revenue from Paramount ’s relentless
Trek exploitations , which have been unbelievably , financially remunerative in demonstrable measure as a result of Mr. Ellison ’s significant contribution to the original Star Trek series . ”
Carmichael highlights : LA Times , 28 July 2007 : “ Paramount DVD sampler collects favorite episodes from all five Star Trek TV series . ”
The one starring Captain Kirk , Wm. Shatner ’s pick as his favorite , is Ellison ’s City on the Edge of Forever .
( And see Ellison ’s “ Pay the Writer ” – 299,000 hits during the recent strike . )
Says Mr. Ellison of the suit : “ To quote Gandhi : ‘ First they ignore you , then they ridicule you , then they fight you , then you win . ’
“ And please make sure to remember , at the moment some Studio mouthpiece calls me a mooch , and says I ’m only pursuing this legal retribution to get into their ‘ deep pockets , ’ tell ’m Ellison snarled back , ‘ F- – – - in ’ - A damn skippy ! ’
I ’m no hypocrite .
It ai n’t about the ‘ principle , ’ friend , its about the MONEY !
Pay Me !
Am I doing this for other writers , for Mom ( still dead ) , and apple pie ?
Hell no !
I ’m doing it for the 35 - year - long disrespect and the money !
“ The arrogance , the pompous dismissive imperial manner of those who ‘ have more important things to worry about , ’ who ’ll have their assistant get back to you , who do n’t actually read or create , who merely ‘ take ’ meetings , and shuffle papers – much of which is paper money denied to those who actually did the manual labor of creating those dreams – they refuse even to notice … until you jam a Federal lawsuit in their eye .
To hell with all that obfuscation and phony flag - waving : they got my money .
Pay me and pay off all the other writers from whom you ’ve made hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars … from OUR labors … just so you can float your fat asses in warm Bahamian waters .
“ The Trek fans who know my City screenplay understand just exactly why I ’m bare - fangs - of - Adamantium about this . ”
When Mr. Ellison calmed down , he continued , soberly , “ They maintain fortresses staffed and insulated with corporate and legal Black Legions whose ability to speak fluent bullshit is the ramadoola of gyrating , gibbering numbers via which they cling to every dollar .
And when you are n’t getting paid for the marvels you helped bring forth — fine , hard , careful artifacts that are making others pig-rich — at some point any sane person knows he has three , and only three choices : the first is to sit around dinner parties and ceaselessly whine over your sushi about how they screwed you , boo hoo , but you ca n’t beef about it Out There in the World or they ’ll blacklist you ; the second is to pick up an Uzi somewhere , crash your SUV through a Studio gate , and just run amok ; and the third , last , choice is this one – to act like an adult , to take ‘ em on in Federal Court and to make the greedy , amoral bastards blink blood out of their eyes .
What they do is tantamount to common street - thug robbery … just add the pig-rich Madoff - style smoothyguts attorneys .
“ And I learned today that the Actors Guild is having to fight , right now , just to maintain the very concept of residuals as part of their agreement with the Producers .
So I am happy as a centipede - with - track - shoes that this infamous behavior , arrogantly ignored for too damned long , is timed to call attention to the degree to which the creative cadres in this business are getting parboiled and served up in a dog - dish !
The part of this imbroglio that truly dismays me , is that my once - tough , beloved Guild – my UNION – that got massively screwed when it let the Alliance scare the slacker - gen dolts into thinking not losing a job meant ‘ just bend over and grin , ’ – if one ’s own damn Guild wo n’t help you , – when you ’ve entreated them for months – then hell , you ’ve got no choice but to raise the skull and crossbones , hone the edge of your demon attorney , and just start cutting off noggins and nuts .
“ Cowardice is like parrot fever in this town ; I think there are writers and other artists who revel in being bitch - slapped , in being pilfered on a regular basis , as if they were artistic trailer - trash !
And if the WGAw is n’t going to watch my back – and I ’ve been their loyal hit - man , pit bull , and go - to guy for 47 years – I dread the possibility that the timorous Guild wo n’t raise the bloody axe for other artists , writers , actors … saner and less pissed - off than I .
So you can tell ’em I ’m coming ! ”
There were flecks of blood on Mr. Ellison ’s otherwise charming face .

Google ( GOOG ) CEO Eric Schmidt gave his hotly anticipated keynote at the Newspaper Association of America ’s annual convention this afternoon , and he was n't booed as some feared he might be -- or at least the WSJ did n't report it if he was .
But Eric 's comments will probably do little calm fears by content producers that Google is rolling right over them .
( See the dust - up between the Associated Press and Google that broke out yesterday . )
Eric basically told newspapers they need a new business model and that Google will be a part of it .
" Try to figure out what your consumer wants , " Mr. Schmidt said during a keynote speech at the Newspaper Association of America 's annual convention in San Diego .
" If you [ upset ] enough of them , you will not have any of them . "
The speech Tuesday marked Mr. Schmidt 's first appearance before a gathering of top newspaper executives , many of whom have expressed growing concern that their content has become a source of revenue for Google , even as their industry 's business model continues to crumble as readers gravitate to online news .
Mr. Schmidt called on the industry to join with Google to create products that would entice readers to go beyond headlines listed on search engine pages .
He said Google envisions a layered approach to information that is personalized , in order to draw in readers .
" We think we can build a business with you , " he said .
" That is the only solution we can see . "
There 's room on the Internet for subscription models and micropayments , Eric told the crowd , but to reach the largest audience advertising will remain king .
It remains to be seen how seriously the audience takes Eric 's speech .
Newspapers can't seem to accept the fact that aggregators like Google News drive them thousands upon thousands of readers they 'd never otherwise never have .
Instead , they seem determined to treat Google like a " tapeworm , " as Robert Thomson of the WSJ put it a few days ago .
Here 's more of Eric 's talk , via Techflash :
I think you 're going to end up with all three [ business models - - ads and subscriptions ] .
An analogy I would offer is television .
There 's free television , over - the - air television , there 's cable television and there 's pay television .
And they have smaller markets as you go from free to more highly paid .
And that structure looks to us like roughly the structure of all of these businesses ...
The reality is that in this new model , the vast majority of people will only deal with the free model .
So you 'll be forced , whether we like it or not , to have a significant advertising component , as well as a micropayment and an additional payment system .
The technology around micropayments is getting to be possible now .
The transaction costs were so high before , you could n't do the 1 cent , 3 cent kind of a model , but it looks like the new technologies around aggregation will allow that at the payment level
The building blocks of life may be more than merely common in the cosmos .
Humans and aliens could share a common genetic foundation .
That 's the tantalizing implication of a pattern found in the formation of amino acids in meteorites , deep - sea hydrothermal vents , and simulations of primordial Earth .
The pattern appears to follow basic thermodynamic laws , applicable throughout the known universe .
" This may implicate a universal structure of the first genetic codes anywhere , " said astrophysicist Ralph Pudritz of McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario .
There are exactly 20 standard amino acids — complex molecules that combine to form proteins , which carry out instructions specified by RNA and DNA , its double - stranded and self - replicating descendant .
Ten were synthesized in the famous 1953 Miller - Urey experiments , which modeled conditions believed to exist in Earth 's early atmosphere and volcano - heated pools .
Those 10 amino acids have also been found in meteorites , prompting debate over their role in sparking life on Earth and , perhaps , elsewhere .
Pudritz 's analysis , co-authored with McMaster University biophysicist Paul Higgs and published Monday on arXiv , does n't settle the former debate , but it does suggest that basic amino acids are even more common than thought , requiring little more than a relatively warm meteorite of sufficient size to form .
And that 's just the start .
If the observed patterns of amino acid formation — simple acids require low levels of energy to coalesce , and complex acids need more energy — indeed follow thermodynamic laws , then the basic narrative of life 's emergence could be universal .
" Thermodynamics is fundamental , " said Pudritz .
" It must hold through all points of the universe .
If you can show there are certain frequencies that fall in a natural way like this , there is an implied universality .
It has to be tested , but it seems to make a lot of sense . "
Pudritz and Higgs tabulated the types and frequencies of amino acids found in primordial Earth experiments , then correlated the results on a graph of temperature versus atmospheric pressure at which the acids likely formed .
The 10 amino acids synthesized in primordial Earth experiments tended to arise at relatively low temperatures and pressures , and are chemically simple .
Other , more complex acids formed less frequently , and require more temperature and pressure .
Their distribution follows a clear , possibly thermodynamic , curve .
" The most frequent amino acid that forms is the one that 's least - demanding , energetically .
There 's less and less amino acids that require more energy to form .
That 's very sensible , from a thermodynamic point of view , " said Pudritz .
Internal conditions of meteorites are unknown , but some scientists believe that certain large meteorites are both warm and hydrated , making them roughly analogous to the relatively temperate environment of Earth 's youth .
" There 's a theory , " said Pudritz , " that they could be made in the warm interiors of large - enough meteorites . "
This is necessarily speculative , but it would explain why the 10
amino acids most common in primordial Earth experiments are also the most common acids found in meteorites .
Pudritz and Higgs speculate that these 10 common amino acids met the needs of the earliest replicating molecules , with other , rarer acids used by the nascent genetic code as they formed or arrived — a process called " stepwise evolution , " culminating in the genes that gathered 3.6 billion years ago in a common ancestor of all complex life .
If simulations of interactions between these 10 acids indeed support molecules that can copy themselves , said Pudritz , then it 's possible that they could support an ur-genetic code on Earth and elsewhere .
" There 's a possible universality , " he said , " for any code that would use amino acids . "
Harvard University systems biologist Irene Chen , who specializes in the evolution of molecules , called the work
" interesting , " but noted that " in the absence of some experimental backup , it 's generally difficult to know if this kind of analysis is a
Panglossian argument . "
The ultimate experimental backup , of course , is finding aliens .
In the meantime , the ending of Battlestar Galactica seems a bit less implausible .

The Obama administration said Friday that it would abandon the Bush administration ’s term “ enemy combatant ” as it argues in court for the continued detention of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , in a move that seemed intended to symbolically separate the new administration from Bush detention policies .
[ efoods ]
But in a much anticipated court filing , the Justice Department argued that the president has the authority to detain terrorism suspects there without criminal charges , much as the Bush administration had asserted .
It provided a broad definition of those who can be held , which was not significantly different from the one used by the Bush administration .
The filing signaled that , as long as Guantánamo remains open , the new administration will aggressively defend its ability to hold some detainees there .
“ The president has the authority to detain persons ” who planned or aided the 2001 terrorist attacks as well as those “ who were part of , or substantially supported , Taliban or Al Qaeda forces , ” administration lawyers wrote .
The Obama administration said it was relying on existing principles of the international law of war .
A public statement indicated that the government was moving away from claims of expansive executive power often used by the Bush administration to justify Guantánamo .

This giant disk floating in space is n't a UFO .
It 's a power generator , harvesting energy from the Sun for a variety of uses back on Earth .
Such space - based solar power generators have many applications , not just on Earth , but also in space .
Solar power beamed down from space will generate electricity for California homes as soon as 2016 , under a new plan by a utility company to ramp up renewable energy technology far beyond solar panels on roofs .
PG&E would buy 200 megawatts of space solar power from Solaren Corp. over 15 years under a power purchase agreement , enough to power tens of thousands of homes .
The utility company has begun seeking approval for the deal from California state regulators .
Solaren would use solar panels on satellites in orbit to capture the sun 's power , and then convert it into radio frequency energy that could beam down to a receiving station .
The energy would then undergo a conversion to electricity and feed into PG&E 's power grid .
Having solar panels in orbit could provide a clean , reliable source of solar power that avoids the interruptions of cloudy days and bad weather on Earth .
That tempting prospect has led NASA and the U.S. Defense Department to investigate possibilities for space solar power , despite the hefty cost of launching solar panels into orbit .
A former NASA scientist went so far as to demonstrate the radio wave transmission technology that would carry energy from space to Earth .
He and his team transmitted solar power over a distance of 92 miles between two Hawaiian islands , during a four - month experiment in 2008 .
{{ video = " SP080912_solar - satellite " title= " Beaming Solar Power from Space " caption = " Mafic Studios depicts how solar power satellites could beam energy to Earth from orbit in this animation .
Credit : Mafic Studios , Inc . "
}}
No one has built a system with equivalent size and scale to what Solaren envisions .
But the transmission technology is " very mature " and based on what communications satellites use today , said Gary Spirnak , Solaren CEO .
" For over 45 years , satellites have collected solar energy in Earth orbit via solar cells , and converted it to radio frequency energy for transmissions to Earth receive stations , " Spirnak noted .
The pilot power satellites designed by Solaren would make use of existing launch capabilities , meaning that the plan does not require new types of rockets .
The ground receiving station would also sit close to existing power transmission lines , somewhere in Fresno County , Calif .
More details about Solaren 's pilot project for its power satellites are expected this summer .
Goldman Sachs ’ tax rate dropped to 1 % in 2008 .
That ’s down from 34 % in 2007 , according to Bloomberg News .
Goldman attributed this drop to “ geographical changes ” and tax credits .
I ’m not a CPA , but that screams “ tax haven ! ” to me .
If they are using offshore corporations to dodge taxes , the testicular fortitude on these guys is impressive .
They ’re taking taxpayer dollars via the bailouts , shifting profits overseas to avoid paying any taxes , then awarding themselves generous bonuses .
This type of creative tax - accounting is common among big banks .
See the CBS story which I link to below for more .
Just to be clear , I do not have any evidence or proof of legal wrongdoing by Goldman Sachs , or any other investment bank traditional bank .
But it just does n’t smell right .
There is some hope .
Today Timothy Geithner announced the Obama administration ’s support for legislation which aims to eliminate offshore tax havens :
Let me just start by saying that we fully support the legislation you referred to championed by your colleagues on offshore tax centers , and we look forward to working with you as part of the broader effort to address international tax evasion and close the tax gap .
source
Most large banks who received taxpayer - bailouts have significant oversea tax havens .
But the sheer number of tax - haven subsidiaries owned by the banks in the Cayman Islands alone is staggering :
Goldman Sachs has 15 subsidiaries there .
Bank of America : 59 .
Citigroup : 90 .
But Morgan Stanley beats them all with at least 158 subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands – seven times the number of hotels .
source
Goldman Sachs stock was down 4.5 % today .
Given their miraculous 4 q tax - rate , I ’d say there ’s a good chance that these events are related .
Post was updated for clarity and legal - compliance 5/24/09 .
Minor edits made again 8/11/09 ( sloppy writing , slowly getting better I hope ) .
It is interesting to note that absolutely nothing has been done to shut down these tax - havens , despite Geithner and Obama ’s promises .

WASHINGTON  Efforts to overhaul the health care system have moved ahead rapidly , with the insurance industry making several major concessions and the chairmen of five Congressional committees reaching a consensus on the main ingredients of legislation .
The chairmen , all Democrats , agree that everyone must carry insurance and that employers should be required to help pay for it .
They also agree that the government should offer a public health insurance plan as an alternative to private insurance .
But members of Congress are just now turning to the most explosive issues , which could delay or derail the process .
They have yet to tackle the question of how to pay for coverage of the uninsured .
They have not wrestled with vehement Republican objections to the idea of a new government - run insurance plan , competing directly with private insurers .
Radical terraforming programs come from elite Internationalists
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Thursday , April 9 , 2009
The Obama administration ’s announcement that it is to consider radical planetary “ geo-engineering ” , such as “ shooting pollution particles into the upper atmosphere to reflect the sun ’s rays ” , exactly mirrors recent publications penned by the elite Council On Foreign Relations .
Yesterday the Associated Press reported that the Obama administration has held discussions regarding the possibility of “ geo-engineering ” the earth ’s climate to counter global warming .
The AP report states that Obama ’s science advisor John Holdren is pushing for radical terra forming programs to be explored such as creating an “ artificial volcano ” .
Despite Holdren ’s admission that such measures could have “ grave side effects , ” he added that , “ we might get desperate enough to want to use it . ”
Such ideas exactly mirror those put forth by the CFR in previous years .
In briefing notes ( PDF ) published in May 2008 from the CFR ’s Geoengineering : Workshop on Unilateral Planetary Scale Geoengineering , the elite internationalist group lays out the exact same radical ideas now being touted by the Obama administration .
The following excerpts are taken from the document :
Geoengineering Strategies Among all geoengineering schemes , those currently considered most feasible involve increasing the planetary albedo , that is , reflecting more sunlight back into space before it can be absorbed .
There are a number of different methods that could be used to increase the planet ’s reflectivity : 1 . Add more small reflecting particles in the upper part of the atmosphere ( the stratosphere which is located between 15 and 50 kilometers above the Earth ’s surface ) .
2 . Add more clouds in the lower part of the atmosphere ( the troposphere ) 3 .
Place various kinds of reflecting objects in space either near the earth or at a stable location between the earth and the sun .
4 . Change large portions of the planet ’s land cover from things that are dark ( absorbing ) such as trees to things that are light ( reflecting ) such as open snowcover or grasses . [ … ]
Stratospheric Aerosols that might be engineered to migrate to particular regions ( e.g. over the arctic ) or to rise above the stratospher ( so as not to interfere in stratospheric chemistry ) .
Adding more of the right kind of fine particles to the stratosphere can increase the amount of sunlight that is reflected back into space .
Applied to geoengineering , various technologies could be used to loft particles into the stratosphere , such as naval guns , rockets , hot air balloons or blimps , or a fleet of highflying aircraft .
Potential types of particles for injection include sulfur dioxide , aluminum oxide dust or even designer self - levitating aerosols .
The CFR ’s geo-engineering research program is directed by David G. Victor a Professor at Stanford Law School and an Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations .
Also involved are M. Granger Morgan , head of Carnegie Mellon University ’s Department of Engineering , Jay Apt , Professor of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University , and John Steinbruner , Professor of Public Policy and Director of the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland .
In an article entitled The Geoengineering Option : A Last Resort Against Global Warming ?
published in this month ’s Foreign Affairs , the CFR ’s monthly magazine , the directors once again lay out their ideas for planetary terraforming , calling for a worldwide 60 - 80 percent cut in carbon emissions .
Obama ’s push toward a so called “ cap and trade ” carbon taxation program is also a direct descendant of Victor et al ’s CFR policy formation .
A CFR geo-engineering meeting summary document from 1999 ( PDF pages 12,13,14 ) also categorically states that the ultimate goal under “ A technology strategy for global warming ” is the implementation of a global Carbon Tax .
The memo also pedantically explains how the perceived fear of global warming can be used to sell to Americans what is essentially a tax on air :
“ While taxing tea pales in comparison to taxing air as a perceived government affront , the clear benefits of a taxation policy to combat global warming might convince even the descendents of our tax - resistant Founding Fathers . ”
( Article continues below )
The tentative announcement by the Obama administration of the existence of geoengineering research programs is a first step toward introducing the idea to the wider public .
However , as we highlighted in our master article yesterday , geo- engineering is undoubtedly already being conducted by government - affiliated universities , government agencies , and on a mass scale through chemtrail spraying .
Such programs merely scratch the surface of what is likely to be a gargantuan and overarching black - budget funded project to terraform the planet , with little or no care for the unknown environmental consequences this could engender .

Two associates of the self - proclaimed “ Prince of Pot ” Marc Emery pleaded guilty Friday in federal court in Seattle to conspiracy to manufacture marijuana .
Michelle Rainey , 38 , and Gregory Keith Williams , 54 , both from Vancouver , B.C. , made the pleas .
Both worked at Emery Seeds and were indicted in 2005 .
Under a plea deal , prosecutors will recommend a sentence for both of two years probation .
Sentencing will be July 17 .
The lead defendant in that 2005 indictment , Marc Emery , is still in Canada and is fighting extradition .
He is supposed to have an extradition hearing in Canada on June 1 .
He is a supporter of decriminalizing marijuana and his indictment has stirred passions in Canada — against both the wisdom of U.S. drug laws and their use against Emery and his employees .
According to court documents , Rainey worked for Emery — the Prince of Pot who says his business has sold more than 4 million marijuana seeds — from 1998 to 2005 .
She helped Emery ’s business of sending marijuana seeds through the mail by filling orders .
Emery told her to send seeds and growing instructions to customers , court documents say .
Three out of four customers were in the U.S .
Williams handled phone orders for the business , according to court documents .
He also sold seeds to walk - in customers .
Williams confirmed in court documents claims on the Emery website of the business ’ taking in more than $ 3 million in year by selling marijuana seeds .

Vancouver ‘ Prince of Pot ’ pals plead guilty in U.S. to marijuana charges
SEATTLE , WA . —
Two former employees of Vancouver ’s self - proclaimed Prince of Pot have pleaded guilty in a Seattle court to conspiracy to manufacture marijuana .
The United States Attorney ’s Office says Michelle Rainey and Gregory Keith Williams , both of Vancouver , have pleaded guilty in a Seattle court to conspiracy to manufacture marijuana .
Thirty - eight - year - old Rainey and 54 - year - old Williams were charged along with pot advocate Marc Emery in 2005 for selling seeds over the Internet .
Emery is scheduled for an extradition hearing in Vancouver on June 1 .
The U.S. Attorney says that under the terms of the plea agreement , they ’ll recommend sentences of two years ’ probation at a sentencing hearing on July 17 .
The office says that between 2003 and 2005 , Rainey mailed marijuana seeds and growing instructions to customers – 75 per cent of whom live in the United States .
U.S. officials say Williams handled phone orders and sold seeds to customers coming into Emery ’s store in Vancouver and on several occasions in 2004 , sold some to a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration undercover agent .

Computers are poor at correctly orientating images like this one , but were the problem to be built into website security , spammers would soon start working hard to solve it ( Image : Tatters / http://www.flickr.com/photos/tgerus/)
Innovation is our new column that highlights the latest emerging technological ideas and where they may lead .
CAPTCHAs – scrambled letters that separate real online users from software bots – protect online services from being overwhelmed by spam by posing problems only humans can solve .
But they may also offer a way to coerce spammers into solving some important problems in artificial intelligence .
Spammers have already written software able to match humans at some CAPTCHAs .
But when CAPTCHAs finally fail , their co-creator Luis von Ahn at Carnegie Mellon University says there will be reason for celebration as well as concern .

Software that can solve any text - based CAPTCHA will be as much a milestone for artificial intelligence as it will be a problem for online security .
Arms race
In the last couple of years , the arms race between CAPTCHA maintainers and their adversaries has escalated .
To escape the bots able to solve some CAPTCHAs they have been made more difficult – at the expense of frustrating legitimate users .
Various commentators have claimed CAPTCHAs will soon be obsolete .
“ Actually , that ’s not true , ” von Ahn told New Scientist , but he admits that the spammers are highly motivated and making headway .
The biggest target is von
Ahn ’s reCAPTCHA system , used by over 40,000 websites including Facebook and Craigslist .
He has seen bounties as high as $ 500,000 offered for software to break it – enough to attract people with the skills to the task and five times more than the Loebner Grand Prize offers to the programmer who designs a computer that can truly pass the Turing test .
Silver lining
The demise of reCAPTCHA could , however , be beneficial .
It has users decode distorted text taken from historic books and newspapers that is beyond the ability of optical character recognition ( OCR ) software to digitise .
Humans who fill in a reCAPTCHA are helping translate those books , and spam software could do the same .
“ If [ the spammers ] are really able to write a programme to read distorted text , great – they have solved an AI problem , ” says von Ahn .
The criminal underworld has created a kind of X prize for OCR .
That bonus for artificial intelligence will come at no more than a short - term cost for security groups .
They can simply switch for an alternative CAPTCHA system – based on images , for example – presenting the eager spamming community with a new AI problem to crack .
Image puzzle
One example will be presented ( pdf ) by researchers from Google at the International World Wide Web Conference ( WWW2009 ) in Madrid , Spain , next week .
It ’s a CAPTCHA system that asks users to correctly orientate images randomly spun around ( see image , right ) .
Without a telltale horizon , image orientation is difficult for computers .
But if this new CAPTCHA becomes common , it wo n’t be long before spammers turn their attention to cracking the problem , with potential fringe benefits to cameras and image editing software .
Speech recognition CAPTCHAs are already being used , and image labelling ones could follow , says von Ahn .
AI researchers are already working in both these areas , but they could soon be joined by spammers also helping advance the technology .
Perhaps it is time to start designing CAPTCHAs in a different way – pick problems that need solving and make them into targets to be solved by resourceful criminals .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
Two out of three Britons have lied about reading books they have not , and George Orwell ’s “ 1984 ” tops the literary fib list , according to a survey published Thursday .

Commissioned by organizers of World Book Day , an annual celebration of reading in Britain , the study also shows that the author people really enjoy reading is J.K. Rowling , creator of the bestselling Harry Potter wizard series .
According to the survey , 65 percent of people have pretended to have read books , and of those , 42 percent singled out “ 1984 . ”
Next on the list came “ War and Peace ” by Leo Tolstoy and in third place was James Joyce ’s “ Ulysses . ”
The Bible was in fourth position , and newly elected President Barack Obama ’s autobiography “ Dreams from My Father ” came ninth .
Aside from a list of ten titles which respondents were asked to tick or leave blank , many admitted wrongly claiming they had read other “ classics ” including Jane Austen , the Bronte sisters , Charles Dickens , Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Herman Melville .
Asked why they had lied about reading a book , the main reason was to impress the person they were speaking to .
The study , carried out on the World Book Day website in January and February , surveyed 1,342 members of the public .
Those who lied have claimed to have read :
1. 1984 - George Orwell ( 42 percent )
2. War and Peace - Leo Tolstoy ( 31 )
3. Ulysses - James Joyce ( 25 )
4. The Bible ( 24 )
5. Madame Bovary - Gustave Flaubert ( 16 )
6. A Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking ( 15 )
7. Midnight ’s Children - Salman Rushdie ( 14 )
8. In Remembrance of Things Past - Marcel Proust ( 9 )
9. Dreams from My Father - Barack Obama ( 6 )
10 . The Selfish Gene - Richard Dawkins ( 6 )

With this publication , taxpayers can take stock of how the federal government spent each 2008 income tax dollar .
Income tax dollar spending is available for all states as well as over 200 cities and towns .
Several years ago , my then colleague Matt Foemmel , dissatisfied with the tools with which we were building software , managed to get in touch with Charles Simonyi to find out more about the shadowy Intentional Software .
What he saw impressed him , and he persuaded me and other ThoughtWorkers to get involved too .
What we saw was a tool with startling potential , but we remained frustrated by the secrecy and lack of urgency to release .
That frustration ended last week .
Last week I set off for Chris Sells 's DSL Devcon , and Magnus Christerson - Intentional 's product manager - suggested I pop in to see how they were going on .
After several years of " Real Soon Now " , I was unsure , but Rebecca Parsons , my colleague who has been keeping regular contact with Intentional , said that now would be a good time .
I spent a fascinating and exciting day at their office in Bellevue .
It 's not that I saw anything particularly new - these were all ideas and capabilities that had been around for a while - but there was a realness and maturity that I had n't seen before .
Indeed Intentional had released a version 1.0 of their product a few weeks earlier .
The usual approach is to trumpet a version 1.0 release of a ground - breaking product from the mountaintops .
Only Intentional would make such a release and not bother to tell anyone .
Indeed as I write this there 's no mention of their product on their website - if you want more information you have to talk to them .
What 's There
This is n't a comprehensive discussion of their tool ( called the Intentional Domain Workbench ) , I have n't had time to put something like that together .
But I hope my scattered thoughts and observations will be interesting .
The Intentional Domain Workbench is a LanguageWorkbench , indeed it 's one of the systems that made me coin that term .
A Language Workbench is a tool that allows people to design DomainSpecificLanguages : not simply to parse them , but build a comprehensive environment that includes rich editing .
In Intentional 's case this is a ProjectionalEditing environment .
One of the examples they have is the state machine example I use for my book introduction .
The workbench allows you to define the schema of the semantic model state machine in its schema definition language .
In order to manipulate state machines you define projections of the semantic model .
One of the striking features of the Intentional Domain Workbench is its ability to support multiple projections of the same semantic model .
For the state machine example they 've defined projections in several of the DSLs I 've used in discussing the example : XML , custom syntax , and Ruby .
All three of these projections are reversible , meaning that you can edit through them , updating the semantic model and other projections .
Switching between the projections is just a matter of selecting a menu item .
They also had read - only projections in fluent C# , command - query C , and a state machine diagram .
Although they had n't set up the diagram to be editable , the workbench can handle editable diagrammatic representations .
In another example they show an electronic circuit which is editable in both a tree structured property sheet projection and in a circuit diagram projection .
The circuit diagram also showed another really powerful feature of the workbench - the ability to fluidly integrate example executions with the program definition .
In the electronic circuit case , this means that you can give the various elements of the circuit properties and the model will calculate the impedance of various parts of the circuit and display them as you are editing the circuit .
Of course you can build a custom program to do this kind of thing - but the point is that this behavior comes easily as part of a DSL definition in the workbench .
Combining example execution with program definition is one of the features of spreadsheets - and may be a reason why spreadsheets have become so successful as an environment for LayProgrammers .
It 's also a notion that 's been propelling much of Jonathon Edwards 's interesting and wild ideas .
My sense is that interesting DSLs in language workbenches will have this characteristic , particularly if they are aimed at being used by lay - programmers .
Another way that you can combine execution with specification is with test cases .
They have an example of a pension workbench , build with Capgemini , that allows actuaries to enter formulas using full mathematical notation , together with FIT - like tables to show test cases .
These test cases are live with the appropriate red / green behavior as you edit the formulas .
The pension workbench also illustrates the combination of multiple languages .
When you look at a pension document on the screen , you 're looking at three independent languages : word processed text for the prose , mathematical notation for the formulae , and test case tables .
These languages are developed independently but integrated in the workbench 's core data structure ( called the Intentional Tree ) .
This integration extends to the execution too - you can step into a test case and delve into the intermediate values in the mathematical formulae .
In order to make these things run , you have to include behavior with the semantic model .
Intentional have developed their own general purpose language , whose working name is CL1 , to do this .
CL1 can look like superset of C# , but such a view is again a projection of the core semantic model .
I found it interesting that this is a similar feature to JetBrains MPS who have their " base language " which projects into a Java - like general purpose language .
Increasingly much of these tools are programmed using this in - workbench general purpose language .
The intended way of working is that developers use the Intentional Domain Workbench to build a domain - specific workbench .
They provide a runtime ( the Intentional Domain Runtime ) for them to run without language editing capabilities .
So Capgemini used the Intentional Domain Workbench to build the Pension Workbench as their own product .
The Intentional Domain Workbench allows you to define new model schemas and projections , while the Pension Workbench allows you to build pension plans using these languages .
The Intentional system is primarily arranged in the .NET ecosystem .
Both the workbench and runtime run on the CLR and core parts of them are written in C# .
The workbench makes it really easy to generate .NET assemblies that can be automatically loaded into the workbench for testing or run with the runtime .
Custom workbenches can generate code for any environment , and Intentional have done some work with another partner that involves generating Java code so that people can specify behavior in the custom workbench and then deploy the resulting system in a Java environment .
An interesting aspect of the implementation is that they handle representational transformations by using lots of little transformations rather than one large one .
As an example , code generating C# from a semantic model involves about a dozen small transforms lined up in a pipeline similar to a multi-stage compiler , the last step being a transformation from a C# AST to text .
Much of their internal design goes into making this approach efficient so you can happily string together a lot of small transforms without worrying about any efficiency cost .
A further consequence is that the pipeline of transforms for code - generation is very similar to that used for editing projections .
A common problem with tools that use projectional editing is how they deal with version control .
Often the answer is to just let multiple people edit the same store simultaneously , which makes many serious developers quake .
The Intentional Domain Workbench has a built in version control mechanism that records all the changes made to the Intentional Tree and can do commits and merges at the tree level .
You then see diffs in languages by doing another projection .
An interesting feature of this version control approach is that you can commit with conflicts and the conflicts are committed into the repository as conflicts .
Unlike with text files they do n't mess up your text - you have a real data structure present , so you can find the conflicts and fix them .
The developers use this feature to commit a conflict they can't sort out to a branch so that developers more familiar with the conflicted area can update to the branch and fix it .
The fact that editing is done on an intentional tree rather than text also changes some other things .
For example unordered collections are tagged so that a change in the ordering of the elements in an editor does n't trigger a conflict .
You can also include domain - specific conflict detection and resolution behavior .

A woman who was filmed being struck by a police sergeant at the G20 protests has described his actions as " very violent and unnecessary " .
Film footage showed an officer hitting Nicola Fisher , 35 , from Brighton , across the face with his hand and on her leg with a baton .
" He just said ' get back ' , pushed me and then hit me across the face , " she said .
Ms Fisher admits pushing the officer .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) is investigating .
The sergeant accused of striking Ms Fisher works for the Territorial Support Group and has been suspended from duty pending the IPCC inquiry .
Ms Fisher , who is being represented by PR agent Max Clifford , was making her way to a vigil for 47 - year - old Ian Tomlinson who died during the 1 April G20 protests .
' Angry and shocked '
She told BBC South East Today that at first the protest seemed " very calm and very peaceful " .
" Suddenly quite a few police officers came and made a line in front of us and almost straight away the officer in front of me shouted ' get back ' and pushed me before I even had a chance to move .
" When he did that I , as an instant reaction , pushed back , then straight away he gave me a back hander across my left cheek . "
Ms Fisher said she reacted by swearing at the officer .
" I started shouting at him saying ' what are you doing hitting a woman ? ' and pointed at my face and said ' do you realise there are three film crews filming you ? '.
" I was just so angry and shocked that he had done it and to be honest , I really did n't think he was going to get his baton out and hit me like he did .
" It was n't a tap , he used his full force .
It was very violent and aggressive and unnecessary . "
' Immediate concerns ' Ms Fisher added : " If he had wanted me to move he could have asked me politely or he could have just picked me up and moved me .
" There was no need to do any of that . "
She said a number of men witnessed the incident and scuffles broke out between the men and some of the officers .
After footage of the incident came to light the Metropolitan Police issued a statement saying the actions of the officer raised " immediate concerns " .
The IPCC said a total of 145 complaints had been made following clashes between police and protesters at the G20 summit in London .
Former London mayor Ken Livingstone said that following media reports there might be violence at the G20 protests , the police then " responded with this ridiculous ' we 're up for it ' . "
He also said that the police tactic of " kettling " - coralling protesters into a confined space for a number of hours - should only be used as a last resort .
" Police need to accept that people have a right to protest , " he added .
A policeman has been interviewed under caution on suspicion of the manslaughter of Mr Tomlinson after a second post - mortem examination appeared to show he died of abdominal bleeding , not a heart attack as first thought .
Mr Tomlinson was struck and pushed over by an officer during protests on 1 April in the City .
Referring to the death of Mr Tomlinson , the ex-mayor said : " Poor Mr Tomlinson was just trying to get home , he kept running into one barrier after another , and eventually it cost him his life . "

David JC MacKay 's Sustainable Energy – Without the Hot Air may be the best technical book about the environment that I 've ever read .
In fact , if I have any complaint about this book , it 's in how it 's presented , with its austere cover and spartan title , I assumed it would be a somewhat dry look at energy , climate , conservation and so on .
It 's not .
This is to energy and climate what Freakonomics is to economics : an accessible , meaty , by - the - numbers look at the physics and practicalities of energy .
MacKay , a Cambridge Physics prof , approaches the subject of carbon and sustainability with a scientific , numeric eye .
First , in a section called " Numbers , not adjectives , " he looks at all the energy and carbon inputs and outputs in Britain and the rest of the world : this is how many kWh of energy are needed to power all of Britain 's vehicles .
This is how many kWh you would get if you covered the entire British shore with windmills , or wave - farms .
This is Britain 's geothermal potential .
Here 's how much carbon vegetarianism offsets .
Here 's how much carbon unplugging your idle appliances saves ( 0.25 % , making the campaign to switch off energy vampires into a largely pointless exercise — as MacKay says , " If everyone does a little bit , we 'll get a little bit done " ) .
This is the carbon - footprint of all of Britain 's imports , gadgets , office towers , and so on .
Using a charming , educational style that teaches how to think about this kind of number , how to estimate with it , and what it means , MacKay explains these concepts beautifully , with accompanying charts that make them vivid and clear , and with exhaustive endnotes that are as interesting as the text they refer to ( probably the best use of end - notes I 've encountered in technical writing — they act like hyperlinks , giving good background on the subjects that the reader wants to find out more about while allowing the main text to move forward without getting bogged down by details ) .
Next , in " Making a Difference , " looks at what it would take to balance Britain 's ( and , eventually , the world 's ) energy budget so that the consumption is sustainable ( that is , so that it uses only renewables or fuels that would last for 1000 years — and emits so little carbon that we avert a 2C ' rise in global temperature ) .
He looks realistically at conservation , considering the theoretical limits on efficiency for rail , electric cars , air , as well as factories , home design and so forth , giving examples ranging from better insulation to tearing down all the housing in Britain and rebuilding it for maximum efficiency ( factoring in the energy and carbon costs of the new building , of course ) .
This chapter also has a lot of sensible personal advice for things you can do to reduce your energy consumption — especially identifying those few badly designed devices in your home whose idle power - draw really is punitive and replacing them ( one Ikea lamp he cites draws nearly as much switched off as running , because of a transformer design that was one penny cheaper to manufacture than a more efficient one would have been ) .
Finally , in a long technical appendix , MacKay delves into the physics of maximal performance in transport , manufacturing , housing and energy generation , explaining it in a way that I — who have not studied physics since I was 18 — was able to follow .
This reminded me of nothing so much as Saul Griffith 's wonderful talk on climate change as an engineering problem .
Add up all the energy we can make if we harness every erg , every photon .
Subtract all the energy we want to use .
Examine this difference and come up with strategies for bringing the two into balance .
Once you get this approach , it becomes a lot simpler to figure out what is and is n't worth doing .
My only complaint about this book is its packaging : if it were tarted up to look like the transformative , important popular science book that it really is , I think it would be at the center of the environmental debate today .
The entire book is available as a free 10 MB PDF download so you can start reading immediately

April 30 , 2009 -- Action in Solidarity with Asia and the Pacific --
There are two unforgettable images of Vietnam 's Liberation Day on April 30 , 1975 .
The first is the image of liberation fighters entering the Independence Palace ( now Reunification Palace ) in Saigon ( now Ho Chi Minh City ) .
The second is the hasty evacuation by helicopter from the roof of the US embassy .
Thirty - four years later Vietnam will celebrate not just the end of a 16 - year war of aggression by the US , Australia and other imperialist and pro-imperialist states but also the end of the two - decade - long economic blockade that was subsequently imposed by the US on this poor and war - ravaged nation .
Doi Moi
A decade of economic stagnation and widespread hunger was lifted after a broad economic reform package called Doi Moi ( renovation ) introduced market reforms in 1986 .
Since then , according to the Vietnam News Agency ( VNA ) , Vietnam became one of the fastest - growing economies in the world , averaging around 8 % annual gross domestic product growth from 1990 to 1997 and 6.5 % from 1998 - 2003 .
Agricultural production doubled , transforming Vietnam from a net food importer to the world 's second - largest exporter of rice .
Per capita income , US $ 220 in 1994 , had risen to $ 483 by 2003 with a related reduction in the share of the population living in acute poverty .
However , average income is widely disparate -- $ 483 on average for the whole country , but $ 1640 in Ho Chi Minh City and much lower than average in poorer provinces of the central and northern highlands .
The VNA says that much of Vietnam 's new - found prosperity comes from commodity exports like oil and agricultural products .
The International Monetary Fund says Vietnam is the world 's largest pepper exporter , and the second - largest exporter of rice , coffee and cocoa .
Tourist arrivals have reached three million visitors a year .
But this also leaves Vietnamese economy very susceptible to international economic conditions .
The Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s slowed the pace of economic growth that marked the earlier part of the decade .
While returning to pre-crisis levels of growth and development has been slow , the pace picked up over the following years , primarily as the result of ongoing economic and trade liberalisation .
Impact of global economic crisis
Le Vinh Thu , head of a four - person delegation from the Communist Party of Vietnam , told the recent World At A Crossroads in Sydney that the new global economic crisis was already having a serious impact on the Vietnamese economy .
He said that growth had slowed to 7.3 % in 2008 and the estimate for 2009 was around 5 % .
While Vietnam has moved toward a more market - oriented economy , the Vietnamese government still continues to hold a tight rein over major sectors of the economy , such as the banking system and state - owned enterprises .
This was evident when the country faced twin blow - outs in inflation and trade deficit blow - outs .
In February 2008 , the annualised inflation rate topped 15 % .
In May , prices rose 3.9 % in a single month , according to a December 12 , 2008 Deutsche Presse - Agentur report :
Prices were also being driven up by high worldwide prices for oil and food .
Vietnam , the world 's number two rice exporter after Thailand , helped worsen the problem in March by barring new exports of rice , due to food security concerns .
World rice prices doubled .
The government tried to hold down prices , freezing the prices of basic materials like petrol and steel .
It raised banks ' capital requirements to soak up some of the excess currency .
It also hiked the prime interest rate , first to 12 % in May , then up to 14 % in June .
Interest rates on loans charged by commercial banks went as high as 21 % .
Finally , the government did something many Western governments might find odd : it told banks to stop lending out so much money .
And it told massive state - owned corporations to stop spending money on speculative ventures unrelated to their core businesses .
By September last year , inflation was down to a monthly rate of just 0.2 % , the DPA report said , and in October and November , prices actually fell .
The obvious question is whether the Vietnamese government will be able to use its relatively greater influence over the economy to ease the impact of the worst global recession since the Great Depression .
While Vietnam 's recent economic growth has been driven by increasing marketisation it has also secured stronger economic cooperation with the socialist government of Venezuela especially in oil and gas prospecting , exploitation and processing .
Legacy of Vietnam War
The Vietnam War did not only kill millions of people and leave a ravaged economy but it also poisoned the country and left it littered with mines and bombs .
US chemical firms provided the US military forces with tens of million of litres of chemicals and defoliant containing highly concentrated dioxin .
This wreaked havoc on human lives and the heath of the millions of people exposed , including their offspring , a recent statement by the Viet Nam Union of Friendship Organisations , the Viet Nam - US Association , the Viet Nam Peace Committee and the Viet Nam Peace and Development Fund :
Tens of thousands of war veterans from the US , South Korea , Australia and New Zealand were also poisoned while engaged in the war in Viet Nam .
Their children were also sick .
Many scientific studies conducted by Viet Nam and the US proved that undeniable fact .
The US chemical firms admitted to the damages caused by Agent Orange / dioxin by compensating US $ 180 million to affected US veterans in an out - of - court settlement in 1984 . "
However , in March this year , the US Supreme Court ’s dismissed a lawsuit filed by Vietnamese Agent Orange / dioxin victims .
Millions of Vietnamese Agent Orange / dioxin victims who are battling serious ailments and genetic diseases every day have been refused by the US legislators to claim for the most basic human rights : the right to live and the right to ask for justice .
A November 22 , 2008 report in the Viet Nam News explained that 20.2 % or 6.6 million hectares ( or 66,000 square kilometres ) of land in Vietnam is affected by unexploded ordinance in Vietnam .
About 104,000 people have been injured or killed by these unexploded munitions since 1975 .
The widespread use by the US of cluster bombs which fragmented into hundreds of smaller bombs , contributed to this ongoing horror .
Nearly 97 million tons of bombs , of which 296,000 were cluster munitions , were dropped across Vietnam between 1965 and 1975 alone .
The director of the Vietnam Bombs and Mines Clearance Center , Nguyen Trong Canh , says that it would take 440 years and $ 10 billion to clear this leftover ammunition across Vietnam .
The $ 10 billion price tag is the equivalent of about a week 's worth of war expenditure by the US in Iraq .

Despite the recent rash of space - debris problems , the risk that the space shuttle mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope will have a catastrophic collision with space junk and micrometeoroids wo n't exceed NASA guidelines .
NASA said Thursday the new orbital debris risk for STS - 125 had fallen to 1 in 221 .
A couple of precautionary maneuvers – in particular coming into a lower , less crowded orbit on the 10th day of the mission and using Hubble as a shield – reduced the spaceship 's chance of getting hit with a stray paint chip or metal bolt .
New , more precise observations of the orbital debris encircling Earth also showed the amount of junk was slightly lower than had previously been calculated .
The new information means the shuttle mission to the Hubble can fly without any safety reservations .
" It 's an improvement , " said Steve Stich , the head of the orbiter project office at Johnson Space Center .
An initial risk assessment in October calculated a 1 in 185 risk that a piece of space debris or a micrometeorite would hit the shuttle and cause a catastrophic loss of the crew and vehicle .
Only the Hubble service mission STS - 61 in December 1993 faced a higher calculated risk of a catastrophic hit by space junk , at 1 in 150 .
Risk higher than 1 in 200 requires a special waiver to fly .
The absolute cut - off for a shuttle mission is 1 in 60 .
The Hubble is located in a debris - ridden area that 's three times riskier than the orbit the International Space Station flies in .
Given the difficult environment , it seemed the final Hubble service mission would be the first in 58 shuttle launches to exceed the 1 in 200 risk threshold .
Then , in February , an American communications satellite collided with a Russian Kosmos satellite , spreading debris around the Earth and prompting fears that the risk to the Hubble service mission would would be even higher .
Orbital debris specialist Mark Matney of Johnson Space Center told Nature the mission was " uncomfortably close to unacceptable levels " and that the satellite collision was " only going to add on to that . "
But NASA officials have managed to re-engineer the flight plan to not just keep the risk level from rising , but to reduce it .
They came up with ways to carry out the mission 's important scientific mission while protecting the vulnerable areas on the spacecraft , namely the nose cap and the leading edge of the wings .
And , in what has become standard procedure , the astronauts will give the Shuttle a thorough inspection on the next - to - last day of the mission before attempting to re-enter
Earth 's atmosphere .
Despite the good news for this mission , the overall orbital debris trend remains disturbing .
The satellite collision alone increased the risk to the shuttle mission by 8 percent .
The risk of a micrometeroid or orbital debris ( MMOD ) hit is , in fact , very real .
" MMOD is the highest risk for the shuttle program , " Stich said .
" That 's why we take such extra special precautions . "
If during inspections , the astronauts find that their shuttle has been hit , they 'll have options to save themselves .
" We have a couple mitigations there .
One is that we could effect a repair using a material called NOAX , " Stich said , alluding to a putty - like material akin to space - strength Bondo .
Astronauts would spacewalk out to the problem and patch up the craft .
In the case of a more severe hit , NASA would fly the shuttle Endeavor up to the crew .
Because they wo n't be able to wait in the International Space Station , which would be normal protocol for a shuttle docked there , they 've brought extra food and water .
Stich said they'd have 18 days to retrieve the crew from a damaged vehicle .
Impacts occur regularly on shuttle flights .
Wired Science obtained the Hypervelocity Impact Database , which revealed that in the 54 missions from STS - 50 through STS - 114 , space junk and meteoroids hit shuttle windows 1,634 times necessitating 92 window replacements .
In addition , the shuttle 's radiator was hit 317 times , actually causing holes in the radiator 's facesheet 53 times .
None of those impacts , apparently , were severe enough to endanger the crew or vehicles involved ( the Columbia disaster was attributed to damage that occurred during liftoff ) .
It could , however , just be a matter of time before NASA can't outmaneuver the space - debris risk , particularly in the most satellite - crowded orbit , which is several hundred miles above Hubble .
" That region of space is already supercritical .
Given the amount of debris that was up there , the debris would double in 50 years , even if you did n't launch anything up there . " said David Wright , a space security specialist at the Union of Concerned Scientists .
" What that says is that debris mitigation is n't enough .
We 're at the point where we have to do debris remediation and we do n't know how to do that . "
But at lower orbits , where Hubble and the space station are , we will be able to continue the cat - and - mouse game with tiny pieces of debris , at least for a while .
" You certainly can't say that anytime soon , the debris consequences are going to be so high that it 's going to keep us out of space , " Wright said .

Social networking feels free , but we pay for it in ways that may not be readily apparent .
The rich personal data many of us enter into these networks is a treasure trove for marketers whose job it is to target us with ever - increasing precision .
A company called Colligent mines social networks for data that it sells to record labels to help them decide which demographics or individual fans might like a particular artist , and those are just the very first nuggets marketers pull out of profiles .
It and other companies track everything we publicly do on social networks and crunch it into marketing data .
The company recently began signing clients outside the music industry , so your next household detergent could be marketed to you based on your appreciation of vintage Mister Clean ads .
Never before have we voluntarily publicized so much of our personal data and consumption preferences , especially not in very structured ways that ease the work of marketer 's data scrapers ( Compare Facebook 's categorized favorites listings to old Geocities free - for - all web designs ) .
And most of it accurately reflects what 's going on in our actual lives , according to Sree Nagarajan , founder , president and CEO of Colligent , which gives marketers a way to hit us up in the offline world using information gleaned online .
" If you think about your Facebook profile , " said Nagarajan , " 95 percent of what you describe there is not about your online life , even though it is online .
You 're talking about your hobbies , you 're talking about your interests , your favorite TV show or your favorite band . "
Social networking sites allow his company to measure content 's " stickiness " – not only what you watched , but how much you liked it based on your Facebook profile , YouTube video ratings , and so on .
Traditional ways of monitoring the media you consume remain important to marketers , says Nagarajan .
But those methods can't monitor our behavior when we might watch a show on television , a DVR , iTunes , YouTube , Hulu , or any other number of places .
No matter where we watch something , we tend to express our preferences on public social networking sites , allowing marketers to unite our fractured media consumption habits once again – this time in far greater detail .
" Did they love the show so much that they are favoriting the shows on YouTube , saying Grey 's Anatomy is one of their favorite shows on their Facebook or MySpace page , or putting the theme song on their pages ? " asked Nagarajan .
" Being able to measure all the engagement levels of that entertainment by consumers is going to be the next generation of measurement . "
This monitoring of publicly - available data has already paid dividends .
Disney 's Hollywood Records label had noticed more Latin American fans at Jonas Brothers concerts than it expected to see , but until Colligent 's data revealed a " statistically significant " correlation between that band and the Latin American community , it had n't capitalized on that observation .
Data from social networks convinced them to increase their marketing budget in Latin American communities , and when the next Jonas Brothers album came out , Nagarajan says , the label saw a significant uptick in sales to Latin Americans .
In that example , a broad group was identified as being more - likely - than - average to like the Jonas Brothers .
But the individualized nature of social networking profile pages means that some of the resulting marketing campaigns target specific individuals too , which is what concerns privacy advocates .
" For Columbia Records , we marketed Bob Dylan 's last album , not the current album , and they had a deluxe package for $ 130 , " said Nagarajan .
" We reached out to hardcore superfans of Bob Dylan and let them know that this album exists , and that they can pre-order it from Columbia 's site " – a strategy he says is of the utmost importance to labels as they shift from selling low - margin products to the mass market to selling high - margin products to superfan niches .
Plenty of Dylan fans were probably happy to hear about the box set , and because people post their personal information of their own free will , there may not appear to be much of a privacy issue .
Colligent follows all relevant privacy rules , according to Nagarajan .
His rule of thumb is that if you can find a piece of personal information through a search engine , it 's fair game for marketing databases .
The problem is , people do n't necessarily know their behavior is being tracked in these ways , according to Marc Rotenberg , executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC.org ) , who bristles at the idea of marketers analyzing individual Facebook users ' news feeds and the like .
" There are huge privacy concerns for social network sites , " said Rotenberg .
" Part of it has to do with the expectations that people have about how marketers will collect data ...
The new kind of advertising , which is what happens when Facebook provides an API that allows advertisers to scrape the data stream and news feeds of individual users – that 's a whole new development , with some privacy dimensions .
I do n't think users expect that their news feed is going to be used by marketers . "
In addition , he said , there are no restrictions as to what marketers can do with the data once they 've extracted it from social networks .
There 's a lesson here :
If you want to participate in social networks and interact with free content online , there 's a clear privacy trade - off .
In a way , it 's a fair deal : we get free data in the form of social networks and free entertainment , while marketers get free data about who we are – and what we can't resist .
Update : Nagarajan wants to clarify that although his company collects data from social networks , it does not sell direct marketing lists , but rather a layer of services around that data .
He likens the approach to a business built partially on open - source software :
" We see the public info put out by consumers as somewhat equivalent to open source ( Linux , et al ) that can't be sold as is .
We monetize not the data but the value added services on top of this data .
There is a difference and it's easy for people to think that we ’re another direct marketing list provider , which we are not ...
What we sell is a marketing service that wraps this consumer information with strategy , creative consulting , sending the message out , tracking results , all in addition to finding the targets .
We do all of these steps ourselves .
Thus we are a value added service provider on top of public consumer data ( akin to , say , Salesforce.com or Google using Linux ) .
Those value - added services are research , analysis and campaigns . "

Oh -oh .
Yes , yes , Dick Cheney was a wrestler in school , like his buddy Donald Rumsfeld .
And wrestlers going out there on the mat to grapple aggressively and viciously for six long minutes with opponents are rarely shy about confrontations .
However , most everybody pictured Vice President Cheney next week heading out of Dodge after the inauguration and virtually four decades of inside government experience -- and fishing , enjoying Wyoming , family , six grandchildren , hunting , all that .
He will .
But Cheney , the silent sly one who 's words were mostly saved for the ears of the president , just told Sean Hannity today that he 's seriously considering writing a book .
" I never have , " Cheney said .
" and my family has been bugging me about it .
I 've got 40 years since I came to town to stay 12 months .
I 've got a lot of stories to tell .
And a few scores to settle . "
And he laughed .
" I 'm going out with a good heart , " Cheney added .
" It 's been a tremendous experience .
It 's been great serving with this president .
And I think we did some good work .
And I do look forward to family time , and a little more time on the stream and out in the fields .
But I do n't plan to retire yet . "
Cheney , a Nebraska native who grew up in Wyoming and represented that state for five House terms , arrived in Washington in 1969 , began work in the Nixon administration and became chief of staff for President Gerald Ford .
In 1989 he became secretary of Defense for Bush I and oversaw two of the larger military operations in modern times -- in Panama and the first Gulf War .
These next few days will be Cheney 's fourth presidential transition , after the Nixon resignation , the Carter inauguration of 1977 , Clinton in 1993 and now 2009 .
The stories he might tell .
Cheney also told Hannity :
He 's been in the government / political business long enough to know you rarely get credit for what does n't happen .
But he worries the longer the nation goes after 2001 .
" I think the thing that I sense most is that as we get farther and farther away from 9/11 , we 've got more and more people sort of taking it all for granted , getting pretty complacent about the world we live in , and lose sight of the fact that there are some very bad actors out there still trying hard to find ways to kill more Americans . "
He said like most Americans he wishes President - elect Obama well starting with next week 's inauguration , but as a conservative , he expects to have major differences over time with a liberal Democrat .
In 1996 , Cheney seriously considered running for the Republican nomination eventually won by Bob Dole , who lost to Bill Clinton .
But he decided against it then and forever more .
Which Cheney thinks helped him be a more effective vice president because everyone knew he had no agenda but President Bush's .
Of course , that situation also left the Republican Party with no experienced and well - known political heir - apparent now and for some time to come .
The book , on the other hand , will be Cheney 's alone .

ABUJA ( Reuters ) - Nigeria is hoping a new patriotic slogan emblazoned on T - shirts and baseball caps can restore self - confidence and overturn its battered reputation .
Africa ’s most populous nation is known for corruption , is poor despite decades of oil production and is increasingly used as a drug transit route and for e-mail scams and online fraud .
Under the slogan “ Nigeria : Good People , Great Nation , ” Nigeria hopes to eschew that image and “ entrench a culture of moral re-armament , ” President Umaru Yar ’Adua said in a speech .
“ At international airports , in trains , in shopping malls , and almost everywhere , every Nigerian is a marked person , ” Dora Akunyili , information minister and self - styled chief image maker said at the launch of the re-branding campaign this week .
“ We are pulled aside for questioning .
We are seen as potential drug pushers or fraudsters .
We are unfortunately denied the benefit of the doubt , ” she said .
But many Nigerians wear their country ’s reputation for mayhem and chaos as a mark of pride -- if you can survive Nigeria , you can survive anywhere , they say .

Thousands of officers were drafted in to police G20 " There 's extreme frustration that there seems to be trial by media going on , " says Paul McKeever , chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales .
The policing of the G20 protests in London earlier this month has dominated the headlines over the past couple of weeks , with accusations of officers being heavy - handed towards protesters .
More than 180 complaints stemming from the protests have been received by the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
It has launched three investigations into allegations of assault , including one minutes before the death of newspaper seller Ian Tomlinson .
The Police Federation , which represents officers , says it has received numerous e-mails from concerned officers .
' Damned ' Mr McKeever , a serving Metropolitan Police sergeant , told the BBC : " There 's a great deal of frustration amongst rank - and - file officers about comments made by politicians and people who really do n't have any understanding of policing .
" They 're putting two and two together and making five , six and seven .
No -one knows what happened and there 's an investigation taking place . "
Another Metropolitan Police officer who contacted the BBC said : " We really are damned if we do and damned if we do n't .
" People 's memories are very short and I am in no doubt that if we had a repeat of the chaos of the May Day riots of a few years ago , then the police would have been slammed by the media for not doing anything to stop it . "
One of the claims about policing of the G20 demonstrations is that officers removed their numbers from their shoulders to stop them from being identified .
Police officers , when they come on duty , want it to be a quiet demonstration .
They respond to what is put before them
Paul McKeever
Chairman , Police Federation
G20 Protests : Police officers ' views
But this is not true , Mr McKeever says .
Officers had been told to wear their fluorescent jackets so they were easily identifiable in the crowds and these did not have numbers on , he told the BBC .
He said an incident when an inspector " refused " to give his number was because they did not have numbers but pips .
And balaclavas had been worn to protect officers from petrol bombs , not to hide their faces , he added .
Officers are trained to follow an " escalation tree " when dealing with protesters - at first they get a verbal warning , which builds up to officers reacting physically with equipment , such as batons , if they continue their behaviour .
" Police officers , when they come on duty , want it to be a quiet demonstration .
They respond to what is put before them , " Mr McKeever said .
' Fear for life ' " If you look at the early stages of the G20 protests , they 're wearing normal police uniform .
It 's only when they move to the public order stage they wear protective gear .
" The police have tactics which have worked for many years .
When policing demonstrations we 'll always try to use the lowest number of officers available and as low level as possible .
Allow people to go out and exercise their democratic right in a peaceful way . "
Tim , an inspector in a southern constabulary , said people forgot that police could also be under attack during demonstrations .
" When you 're in that situation , your adrenalin is high and you 're outnumbered and encircled by a baying crowd , there are times when you do fear for your life , " he said .
The contact Ian Tomlinson had with officers is being investigated " There are times when you 're thinking you need a way out of this , it just needs one more thing to happen and you 're in real trouble .
Sometimes you need to act to stop it from escalating . "
He said the feeling being asked by officers was : " What do the public want us to do ?
" Do they want it to be like Thailand where protesters can close down a summit , stop democracy from working ?
Or [ do they want us to ] defend free speech and when the situation demands it , step in ? "
He echoed the comments of Sir Ken Jones , president of the Association of Chief Police Officers , who said earlier that he did not know of any country other than the UK which did not use water cannon , CS gas or rubber bullets to police protests .
" Other countries pre-empt problems using water cannon and CS gas .
If that 's what people want us to use , than that should be considered - it potentially could cause less problems for police but is indiscriminate as to who it affects . "
The coverage of the G20 policing has had two main impacts - on the morale of officers and public perception , officers argue .
' No support '
The UK does not have designated riot police - they are officers who have taken on the role in other sections .
" Put yourself in their shoes - officers who work in public order units are volunteers .
Would you put yourself forward to do that in future ? "
Mr McKeever said .
This was echoed by another serving Met officer , Steve .
He said if he were on the list of trained officers or on the Territorial Support Group , he would remove himself immediately - because of what he perceived as a lack of support for officers involved in G20 protests controversy .
Tim said officers on the street are already experiencing fall - out from media coverage .
" It does affect people 's view of us , it is pervading across the UK .
Everyone is tarred with the same brush but 99.9 % of officers do a decent job .
" We 're hearing now already comments like ' are you going to kill us , like in London ? ' , " he said .

The classic question whether our actions are governed between Freewill or Pre-destination has been asked by all schools of thought .
The correct answer according to Islamic thought is that it ’s somewhere in between .
We do n’t have complete freewill over all our actions , as that would imply that God has no power over our actions .
At the same time we ’re not completely powerless over our actions , as that would imply that God controls us like robots .

Remember the blurry blob of pixels reputed to be Samsung 's entrance to the Android handset market ?
It was initially expected to come into focus sometime after July , but word from Dr. Won -Pyo Hong , a Samsung VP , is that the phone will see international release a month earlier , in June .
He has also confirmed that two other Google - powered handsets are in development by the company , both set for US release sometime in the second half of the year .
The phones are said to be " totally different " from each other and will be so at odds they 'll have to go to separate networks or risk creating a hilarious feud of the type we have n't seen since TV's Perfect Strangers .
Both are said to offer considerable enhancements and tweaks to Android that should distance them HTC 's offerings , but will the two ever stand a chance of getting along ?
Do n't be ridiculous !
( CNN ) --
A receptionist with a gunshot wound in her stomach played dead under her desk and called 911 on Friday after a shooting massacre in a Binghamton , New York , immigration center .
Zhanar Tokhtabayeba , who was taking an English class at the center , says she hid in a closet during the rampage .

It is unclear how much time passed from the moment the woman and her colleague were shot until she placed the 911 call , police said .
But by the time law enforcement arrived at the American Civic Association , about two minutes after the 10:31 a.m. call to 911 , the shootings had ceased and 14 people were dead in the center , including the suspected gunman , law enforcement officials said .
Four more people were wounded in the attack , in what the city 's mayor has called the " most tragic day in Binghamton 's history . "
The incident has sent shockwaves through Binghamton , a city of about 50,000 about 140 miles northwest of New York City , as police work to confirm the gunman 's identity .
A senior law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation identified the suspect as Jiverly Wong , who is believed to be in his early 40s .
Authorities executed a search warrant at Wong 's home in Johnson City , near Binghamton , and spoke to the suspect 's mother , the source said .
Binghamton police Chief Joseph Zikuski said Wong , a naturalized U.S. citizen , was unemployed at the time of the shooting .
He told CNN's Susan Candiotti that Wong had recently worked in a vacuum repair shop .
Christine Guy said she worked with Wong a few years a go at Endicott Interconnect Technologies , a high - tech electronics company in Endicott , New York , where he was an engineer .
He went by the name " Vaughn , " which is what co-workers called him , she said .

" He was quiet -- not a violent person , " said Guy , who now lives in Wellington , Colorado .
" I can't believe he would do something like this .
Police are still investigating motives but said the use of a car to block the back door of the building suggested premeditation .
" It is our understanding he had ties to the civic association , " Zikuski said .
Watch Zikuski give a timeline of the shooting »
The shooter , who was carrying a satchel of ammunition , was found dead of an apparently self - inflicted gunshot to the head , Zikuski said .
In all , law enforcement removed 14 bodies from the building and 37 survivors , Zikuski said .
Watch Binghamton 's mayor extend his condolences »
Two semi-automatic handguns -- a .45 - caliber and a 9 - millimeter -- were found at the center , where immigrants were believed to be taking citizenship and language classes .
Most of those who managed to survive the incident hid in a boiler room and storage closets during the rampage .
" I heard shootings , very long time , about five minutes , and I was thinking when it will be stopped , but it was continued .
No screaming , yelling , just silence , shooting , silence , shooting , silence , " said Zhanar Tokhtabayeba , who was taking an English class .
" It 's free English class and it 's very good , but now I 'm scared to go , " she said .
Others in the building also reportedly described lulls between the gunshots .
" They told me they tried to be quiet and run away , " Than Huynh , 45 , a high school teacher who translated for some of the Vietnamese survivors during police interviews , told the New York Times .
At 10:31 a.m. , authorities received a 911 call from the receptionist , who said she 'd been shot in the stomach , Zikuski said .

She told police that a man with a handgun also shot and killed another receptionist before proceeding to a nearby classroom , where he gunned down more victims , Zikuski said .
American Civic Association  Founded in 1939 by group of immigrants
 Private organization funded by United Way
 Sponsors citizenship education
 Promotes racial , religious , political understanding
 Helps immigrants get visas , green cards
 Hosts everything from tenants ' rights seminars to St. Patrick 's dinners to polka concerts
While the gunman continued to fire , 26 others in the center hid in a boiler room downstairs , where law enforcement found them .
It took another two hours or so for officers to clear the building .
Some men who were led out of the building in plastic handcuffs were not considered suspects , the chief said .
Wilson Medical Center spokeswoman Christina Boyd said the Binghamton hospital was treating two females and one male for gunshot wounds .
Another victim , a male Binghamton University student , was treated and is in stable condition at Our Lady of Lourdes Memorial Hospital in Binghamton , hospital spokeswoman Kathy Cramer said .
Watch store owner describe police ' flooding the streets ' »
One man who owns a business across the street said he did n't realize anything was wrong until police cars came rushing to the scene .
" We were thinking that there 's some sort of dispute , some disagreement , " Richard Griffis told CNN .
" But then it became obvious it was more than a disgreement , there must be some sort of gun involved because of the way they were surrounding the building . "
President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama offered their condolences to the grieving community .

" Michelle and I were shocked and deeply saddened to learn about the act of senseless violence in Binghamton , New York , today , " he said .
" Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims , their families and the people of Binghamton . "
Vice President Joe Biden , who was in New York on unrelated business , also condemned the acts and called on Americans to stop the cycle of violence .
" I 'd ask you to keep all those folks in your prayers , " he said .
" I think it 's time that , we gotta figure a way to deal with this senseless , senseless violence . "

Nearby apartments were evacuated , and Binghamton High School was locked down for most of the afternoon .
The American Civic Association helps immigrants and refugees with a number of issues , including personal counseling , resettlement , citizenship and reunification , and provides interpreters and translators , according to the United Way of Broome County , which is affiliated with the association .
Rashidun Haque , who owns a nearby convenience store , said police had him and his four customers stay inside and away from the windows .
" I 'm really shaky , because this kind of thing -- it 's a small city , it 's a beautiful city , but nothing goes down serious like this , " Haque said .

It is India that gave us the ingenious method of expressing all numbers by means of ten symbols , each symbol receiving a value of position as well as an absolute value ; a profound and important idea which appears so simple to us now that we ignore its true merit .
But its very simplicity and the great ease which it has lent to computations put our arithmetic in the first rank of useful inventions ; and we shall appreciate the grandeur of the achievement the more when we remember that it escaped the genius of Archimedes and Apollonius , two of the greatest men produced by antiquity .

ABOUT TEACHING MATH
[ Photo by herval . ]
The traditional mathematics professor of the popular legend is absentminded .
He usually appears in public with a lost umbrella in each hand .
He prefers to face the blackboard and to turn his back to the class .
He writes a , he says b , he means c ; but it should be d .
Some of his sayings are handed down from generation to generation .
“ In order to solve this differential equation you look at it till a solution occurs to you . ”
“ This principle is so perfectly general that no particular application of it is possible . ”
“ Geometry is the science of correct reasoning on incorrect figures . ”
“ My method to overcome a difficulty is to go round it . ”
“ What is the difference between method and device ?
A method is a device which you used twice . ” — George Pólya

I use Debian , and I use an option you did n't list .
I use the system Perl ( threaded 5.8.8 ) , and I install all my packages in a fresh directory using cpan ( although using cpan is not required ) .
Set makepl_arg to PREFIX=~ LIB=~/lib/perl5
( Any version of MakeMaker )
to ( Any version of MakeMaker )
Set makepl_arg to INSTALL_BASE=~ ( Alternative for MakeMaker 6.31 + )
to ( Alternative for MakeMaker 6.31 + )
Set mbuildpl_arg to -- install_base /home/ikegami ( Might accept ~ )
to ( Might accept )
Add export PERL5LIB=~/lib/perl5 to ~/.bash_profile
to
Run mkdir -p ~/.kde/env && ln -s ~/.bash_profile ~/.kde/env/profile.sh
( For KDE console login )
( The following setup uses ~ , but you can use any directory .
I do n't know the equivalent of the last for gnome . )
I have n't had any issues yet .
I think it was JavaFan who told me he uses the idea of having cpan installation dirs writable by a special group , and told me it worked fine .
Maybe we 'll hear from him ...
( Update : he was even faster than me ... read for yourself :-)
However , there is still a downside .
Unless I am missing something in the documentation ( am I ? ) , the debian package simply calls the CPAN modules 's own make files .
That means that you are still dependent on the quality of the CPAN module writer 's build scripts .
If they have put in something that conflicts with the system Perl , one has the same problems as one would have downloading directly from CPAN .
First of all let me clarify that it does call the Makefile of the package via make install , with a special path prefix .
I usually run dh - make - perl under fakeroot , so that it does no damage to my system if something is accidentally written to the wrong location .
There is a still the conflict with core modules , or for example when installing TAP :: Parser 3.0 ( I think ) on Debian Etch it conflicted with perl core 's prove utility .
That 's something that you can only avoid by using a separate perl installation independent from the system perl .
On my desktop I usually go the dh - make - perl route , and sometimes install a blead perl in /usr / local / for testing .
When I ran /usr / local / bin / perl - MCPAN -e shell I never had problems that modules where accidentally installed into / or /usr / instead .
I think it was JavaFan who told me he uses the idea of having cpan installation dirs writable by a special group , and told me it worked fine .
Actually , I use a special user ( usually I call the user perl , camel or onion ) .
But then I use said user to install anything Perl related - I never tried installing half of it as root , and the other half as someone else .
About the only module that requires an additional step when installing is Tk on the local machine while using sudo su - xxx to switch users ; I do n't allow others to open windows on my X client , and hence Tk's test will fail when run as a different user .
Running xauth fixes that .
But none of that really relates to what the OP wants to do , so I did n't mention it .
I do n't allow others to open windows on my X client , and hence Tk's test will fail when run as a different user .
Running xauth fixes that .
i use ssh - X for that .
e.g. ' ssh - X otheruser@localhost ' or ' ssh - X otheruser@remotehost ' .
it 's the least hassle way of allowing other UIDs temporary access to my X server .
oh , and as for the original thread topic - i use dh - make - perl , and have done so for many years without problem .
For a systems administrator , if not for a programmer , it is THE best way to use non-packaged CPAN modules and still have a consistent environment across hundreds of systems .
package it once on your fastest / best dev box and ship it out using scp and install with dpkg ( or , if you 're doing it a lot , make your own apt repository for your local packages )
If 2 ) depends on modules authors catering for Debian , I would n't use 2 ) .
We have all those lovely tools to make CPAN packages , and to download them so module authors do not have to care about the gazillion ways CPAN modules can be installed .
I 'd go for 1 ) if Debian has made that easy .
Solaris used to do this right ( and probably still do , but I do n't have access to a recent Solaris at the moment to verify ) .
Solaris also has tools using Perl .
/usr / bin / perl is a link to /usr / whatever / perl .
Solaris specific tools start with #!/usr / whatever/perl .
This means that if one does n't install their own perl , one can use #!/ usr / bin/perl ( because a perl is there ) .
But it also means one can install a / usr / bin / perl without breaking the system tools .
If Debian does the same , I 'd certainly go for 1 ) .
Otherwise , I probably would go for 3 ) .
I 've done all of these .
The primary reasons to build your own perl are to use your own compile options ( so you can turn off threads , for example ) or to avoid Debian auto - upgrading a module you depend on .
If neither of those concern you , making packages with the script you mention or the one in CPANPLUS seems good because you can uninstall them .
The problem you 'll encounter is that some modules have build scripts that are hard to deal with , but there 's no way around this .
I 've had similar problems with OpenBSD .
And Solaris is even worse , as it does n't come with a C compiler .
I tend to favour the dual Perl approach , but I largely work in a server environment .
As you have pointed out , that makes a huge difference : code ( whether Perl or otherwise ) is not so much run on a server as it is added .
It 's trivial to start a script with #!/ usr / local / bin/perl on a server .
It gets enormously harder when the script is to run on machines outside the sysadmin's ( or the sysadmin 's team 's ) control .
A solution I have commonly seen is to simply not use CPAN modules .
I know that goes against all the " best practices " ever published ; but several sysadmins I know have decided it 's better to re-invent the wheel than to jeopardize a running system with 3rd - party code that typically comes without warranties .
In fact , one friend of mine is a sysadmin in a finance company , and there are policies in place explicitly forbidding the use of CPAN modules .
I hate to say it , but there is a lot of merit in that approach .
And if there are issues with distributing code across a number of machines because of CPAN dependency issues , re-inventing the wheel is a very reasonable option .
I 've moved to a much more relaxed environment ( and the lower pay that goes with it ) in the last 8 months .
It 's been nice to use CPAN again without having to justify it to everyone and their dog .
In fact , one friend of mine is a sysadmin in a finance company , and there are policies in place explicitly forbidding the use of CPAN modules .
We have a ban on modules we can't receive from Debian 's package manager , so I take the CPAN module and drop it into my project .
Now it 's no longer a CPAN module :)
I work on projects used internally , so the license is not an issue .
This way , we test against the same version of the module that ends up being used .
It also gives us the ability to make and track changes to it , if need be .

This sounds like a good , simple solution , but is n't it a bit of a problem that the CPAN module can't receive any updates unless you decide to apply them ?
It takes the process of doing updates out of the domain of the sysadmin's and leaves them up to the programmers .
one friend of mine is a sysadmin in a finance company , and there are policies in place explicitly forbidding the use of CPAN modules .
I hate to say it , but there is a lot of merit in that approach .
No , really , there is n't .
Wherever possible , risks should be managed , not simply avoided .
And CPAN is a manageable risk .
A policy that does have merit is " no unaudited CPAN modules " .
It makes sense to control the code coming into your systems ; it makes sense to check the licenses and to perform due diligence in ( for example ) looking at the bug trackers , reading module reviews , looking over the code for nasty smells , and finally installing the code on a development server and checking that it is n't likely to break anything in the operational environment .
And , of course , it makes sense to require people to present a good business case before you allocate the resources to do all that work .
It does not make sense to automatically reject all third - party code .
You will waste time and money reinventing wheels .
Has that place seriously even written their own versions of stuff like DBI ?!
If so , they 'll have ended up with something that probably contains more bugs , performs worse , and behaves differently from the standard interface that everyone else in the world uses .
And to this day they 'll be wasting even more time and money maintaining it themselves , instead of letting other people take care of that while they put all their resources into doing their core business well .
This is not the path of merit .
It does not make sense to automatically reject all third - party code .
You will waste time and money reinventing wheels .
Has that place seriously even written their own versions of stuff like DBI ?!
I 'm only passing on what I 've been told ...
It 's hard to imagine a profitable company in an extremely competitive and fast - paced business that does n't have a protocol for working around policies where they are counter - productive .
I assume there is a process in place whereby CPAN code can be vetted , tested , approved , and added to some sort of whitelist .
The immediate effect on my friend , however , is that he can't search CPAN whenever he runs into a wall with his Perl .
When he calls to bounce ideas off me , he generally adds the caveat : " I ca n't use CPAN . "
If we imagine a company with even the most stream - lined vetting process , we still end up with a scenario where a sysadmin's one - off monitoring script becomes a several week effort while he waits for approval for that module .
Home - rolling is faster .
Even with intense testing and debugging , it 'll get the code across the finish line before a module passes review ; and a sysadmin does n't care about portability : the code she is writing has to run on a very specific platform .
That removes a huge amount of effort that goes into anything on CPAN .
People in that environment are n't writing frameworks .
As far as I know , neither my buddy 's employer nor I have ever advocated re-writing a generalized framework like DBI .
That 's what Paul Graham calls a " pathological edge- case . "
In a case where sensitive data is potentially exposed , or where loss of service is measured in millions of dollars per hour , the loss of developer and / or administrator time re-inventing a lot of wheels is negligible by comparison .
Additionally , in - house code does n't have to be portable : operating platforms are concretely known and change very rarely .
From a coder 's perspective , using 3rd - party modules makes a lot of sense .
But there are business scenarios where it 's just not the right thing to do .
And in some cases , it 's been decided to reject foreign code by default for very sound business reasons .
That 's my only point .
And Solaris is even worse , as it does n't come with a C compiler .
SUN no longer ships gcc with Solaris 10 ?
Are you sure ?
It may not be installed by default , but SUN used to ship a set of GNU software on their Solaris installation CDs , including gcc .
You are correct in thinking that Sun does still ship gcc with Solaris 10 and it can be found on the " Software Companion " CD .
The version is 2.95.3 which is hardly recent but you can find version 3.4.6 on http://www.sunfreeware.com/.
Cheers , JohnGG
Doh !
I forgot the GNU companion CD .
I always use http://sunfreeware.com/ instead .
Still , I 've had issues getting the installed Perl to play nicely with gcc on Solaris .
I just started building a parallel Perl system under /usr / local when I set up new systems .
Is it just me ?
I 've booked a lot more time on Solaris 8 & 9 than 10 , so perhaps my information 's outdated .
I am using Ubuntu and I have come across the same problems .
If your lucky the module is already bundled as a package and you can install that .
If not , I try to use CPAN .
The problem is sometimes finding all the dependencies ( underlying libraries ) to get packages installed can be difficult .
I have also installed a separate version of Perl due to a Class : : Std problem with the default system build .
Luckily my application had relatively few library dependencies but sometimes you are still stuck trying to identify and install the correct libraries for modules .
My recommendation .
Install debian packages first .
If the module is outdated , upgrade via CPAN .
Worst case you can delete the files manually and reinstall the debian package .
Install via CPAN .
Worst case , you spend time finding the packages that are needed to install the libraries you are going to depend on .
Extreme case , you have no options , install a separate version of CPAN .
Change the search path for the account (s ) that will use the newer version of Perl .
God knows what you would break if you replace the default perl executable .
There are two more options not mentioned in this thread : debian.pkgs.cpan.org -- debified CPAN packages , all the work is already done for a lot af CPAN - Modules
cpan2dist $ cpan2dist -- format CPANPLUS :: Dist :: Deb -- buildprereq Desired :: CPAN :: Module
Hth ,
Thomas
for modules that need to be deployed across an organization , inspect and test the CPAN module carefully for conflicts .
If the build file is OK , use dh - make - perl to bundle up the package for installation .
Otherwise patch the make file , and then use dh - make - perl .
ya true i use lot of CPAN modules which is not listed in Debian package repository like Asterisk : : Manager , etc
but I test it rigorously and third party testing also will be done on the code before getting deployed , moreover we used to give OS and the same perl ( 5.8.8 ) also with code to clients so it becomes easy .
I have n't used dh - make - perl file much , but I will try to use it henceforth .

In accordance with the prarabdha of each , the One whose function it is to ordain makes each to act .
What will not happen will never happen , whatever effort one may put forth .
And what will happen will not fail to happen , however much one may seek to prevent it .
This is certain .
The part of wisdom therefore is to stay quiet .
I use Debian / testing aka squeeze and I 've got ~300 non-Debian CPAN packages installed , all as .deb 's using dh - make - perl .
FWIW my workflow {1} is : cd << cpanplus build directory >> cpanp t Module :: To :: Install download & test the module and all dependencies dh - make - perl -- version << module - version >>- 0.0 -- build << directory > > for each directory created by cpanp .
( Some fail , and some succeed . ) su -c ' dpkg - i *.deb '
Install those that succeeded Repeat 3 & 4 until all the modules are installed It 's a long way from being perfect , but it works for me . { 1} Scripted , of course : #!/usr /bin/perl use 5.010 ; use strict ; use warnings FATAL => ' all ' ; run ( ) ; sub run { fetch_and_test ( $_ ) for @ARGV ; for my $ dir ( grep -d , glob " * " ) { system qw[rm - rf ] , " $ dir / debian " if -e " $ dir / debian " ; my ( $ module , $ ver ) = $ dir =~ m/(.*)-(.*) / ; my $ deb = lc " lib$module - perl " ; system ( qw / dh - make - perl -- version / , " $ver - 0.0 " , " - - build " , $ dir + ) == 0 and system qw / rm - rf / , $ dir ; #created a deb } } sub fetch_and_test { my $ module = shift ; system qw [ cpanp s conf prereqs 1 ; ] , " t " , $ module ; } [ download ]
Another option is to install modules into application specific libraries .
I have systems running multiple perl applications , each with its own module requirements .
While the modules installed on the system are usually adequate , sometimes newer or older or patched versions are required for a particular application .
To avoid adversely impacting the system or other applications , I prefer to install such modules into an application specific library - just a few more modules among the application 's own modules .
I am currently investigating options for cpan and cpanplus to have them use application specific configurations rather than the system wide or personal configurations .
I do n't see easy support for this out - of - the - box , so I expect I will customize cpanplus to make installation and maintenance of these modules easier .
ELISHEVA ++ , it 's a great question .
And at the risk of piling a question on top of a question , does Ubuntu have the same issues ?
Yes , Ubuntu has the same problem .
After a dreadful headache trying to get mod_perl2 / Apache2 / MySQL set up and failing on obscure package problems ... I went with Option 1 .
We 're starting to use CPANPLUS :: Dist :: Deb and cpan2dist .
It 's almost pleasant .
4. Use CentOS / RHEL
I 'm not trying to be cheeky - I realize it wo n't be possible for people to just replace a Debian / Ubuntu server at their company .
Using CentOS and RH systems since 2005 , though , I have not encountered any of these problems - being a sysadmin - I mix system Perl , CPAN , dag / apt modules all over the place and they all seem to get along fine .. these are mostly all Perl 5.8.8 BTW , so that will probably make a difference as well as Debian 's kernels and libs are more recent which might be having some impact on what problems people are seeing in this regard ..
Then again I may not have many modules installed where the XS dependency is critical - what are some of those ?
( so I can test .. thanks ..)
FreeBSD removed
Perl from the base system requirements and moved it to ports a while ago ... smart .
I 'm sorry , and I 'm not trying to be difficult either , but Red Hat & Cent are not the poster children for ideal Perl operating systems .
Then again , neither is Mac OS X .
This sort of thing is why I prefer to build my own .
At least that way , I know where to find the idiot who screwed things up .
Hm , that bug was addressed , at least on CentOS 5.2 by Karabir Singh and RH released a fix too - 18 months ago ...
I saw that blog when it originally came out .
I just want to emphasize that I ( emphasis on " I " ) have not seen the module compatibility problems mentioned in ELISHEVA 's original post here , since 2005 and Centos4.4 ..
Using CentOS and RH systems since 2005 , though , I have not encountered any of these problems - being a sysadmin - I mix system Perl , CPAN , dag / apt modules all over the place and they all seem to get along fine ..
And I do the same on my Debian and Ubuntu boxes .
You really can just ignore this issue and you 'll most likely be fine ... but there are odd cases where you might be burned which you ( and I ) have n't run into yet .
It really is unlikely that CentOS / RH have some magic solution to these problems ( after all , the usual state of affairs is for RH to imitate Debian five years later ... ) .
What is the problem exactly ?
I have used Debian for years and whenever a module is not in the Debian repositories or it is not the version I require I just used CPAN to install it .
And I have never ever had any issues .
cpan installs in the same @INC folders as the debian packages do , so what difference does it make where the module comes from ?
I like the variant of ( 2 ) that uses special locations in /usr / local for all CPAN installation .
This sounds like the easiest way to cover any possible problems , and I suspect that CPAN.pm and CPANPLUS .
pm already do this by default ( see below ) .
Technique ( 1 ) on the other hand strikes me as very generally useful : it might be more work , but once you 've mastered those techniques you 'll find other uses for them ( like , for example , you want to try upgrading from perl 5.8 to 5.10 for the production code , but leave 5.8 in use for the system code ) .
Technique ( 3 ) is very Debian / Ubuntu specific , and at a guess is only worth hassling with if you 're interested in getting involved with helping the Debian project by maintaining debs of perl modules .
What I actually do , however , is ignore the problem : I install a bunch of debian / ubuntu perl packages , but whenever I 'm so inclined I do installations and updates via CPAN. pm or CPANPLUS.pm .
I realize it seems like living dangerously ( how do I know an " apt - get upgrade " wo n't downgrade something important ? ) but I 've yet to run into any difficulties like that .
Taking a look at my @INC , I see I 've got a rough order of precedence of dev , local , and system locations .
Maybe that 's a policy that helps .
I just experimented with installations via CPAN.pm and CPANPLUS.pm , and I see they both install in /usr / local / share -- it could be I 've got method ( 2 ) covered already without realizing it .
There 's nothing special in my ~/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm that does this , so it would seem that CPAN.
pm/ CPANPLUS.pm do the Right Thing by default .
This is an experience I 've been having lately with perl , by the way ...
I start worrying about some issue , dig into it , and I find that it 's largely a non-issue because someone else did something intelligent a long time ago .
As the auto industry as we know it continues to crumble , a new model is emerging out of the Netherlands , known currently as c , mm , n .
Open source design has proven itself successful in a number of arenas from software to restaurants .
But a car ?
Yes , one where the design will be made available to the public , with the provision that their design be likewise made open to the public to do their own revisions and modifications on it .
With the focus being shifted to creating a vehicle that meets people ’s needs in conjunction with other modes of transport , the experience of driving it enhanced by currently useful information , and the profit centered on the services rather than the product itself , this is a radical shift from tightly reigned intellectual property , proprietary after market parts , and a rather slow development curve when it comes to becoming a truly green car .
The thinking about and creation of the c , mm , n car is being done both online and in person , with the three c , mm , n garages happening so far .
800 + people are on their wiki , with 80 actively participating in conception and design at the moment .
What ’s the actual car like ?
According to a recent article in Springwise after the first prototype ’s premier at an the AutoRAI 2009 show in Amsterdam ,
Boasting zero emissions , the hydrogen - powered vehicle features a lightweight ( and therefore fuel - saving ) thermoplastic exterior and an interior including soy - based memory foam and other recyclable materials .
What its developers call a “ river display , ” meanwhile , is said to function like an iPhone with access to a variety of information including route - planning , carpooling and efficiency - maximizing systems .
The vehicle is also optimised to minimize depreciation and repairs .
Materials in the body , for example , last only three years ; after that , the car is designed to be taken back to the factory and rebuilt .
This video shows what it may well look like when made .

* Stora sells old paper plant to Google
* Google says plans to open data centre at site ( Releads , adds Google comments )
HELSINKI , Feb 12 ( Reuters ) - Google GOOG.O said on Thursday it aimed to build a data centre at an old paper mill in southeastern Finland that it bought from Stora Enso STERV .
HE for 40 million euros ( $ 51.7 million ) .
“ We are currently considering to build a data centre at this site , ” said Google spokesman Kay Oberbeck .
Google has dozens of data centres , or server farms , which consume significant amounts of energy , around the world .
In early 2008 Stora Enso closed down the loss - making Summa mill , which consumed 1,000 gigawatt hours of electricity per year , after nearly 53 years in operation .
The oldest parts of the mill were designed by renowned Finnish architect Alvar Aalto .
Stora Enso and Google have agreed that part of the mill site will be transferred to the city of Hamina for other industrial uses .
The sale is expected to close by the end of the first quarter 2009 .

The list of papers accepted to Graphics Interface 2009 ( with abstracts ) is now online .
Graphics Interface has had some pretty good real - time rendering papers : here is a handful of examples from the last few years .
Judging from this year ’s abstracts , the following look particularly interesting :
Fast Visualization of Complex 3D Models Using Displacement Mapping :
This looks like a combination of the “ sparse voxel ray casting ” approach popularized by id software with “ relief mapping ” approaches .
Depth of Field Postprocessing for Layered Scenes Using Constant - Time Rectangle Spreading :
This is closely related to one of my favorite I3D 2009 posters , “ Faster Filter Spreading and Its Applications ” .
The basic idea ( which has also been discussed in this paper by Dan Piponi ) is to “ splat ” rectangles in constant time ( independent of the rectangle size ! ) by “ splatting ” just the corners into a buffer , from which a summed - area table is constructed ( using existing fast methods ) , yielding the desired image .
This can be extended to more general splats .
Although there is no preprint yet , the tech report is available .
An Analytical Approach to Single Scattering for Anisotropic Media and Light Distributions : A follow - on paper to one published in Eurographics 2009 , it adds anisotropic phase functions and more general lighting .
The basic solution is similar to an earlier paper by Bo Sun and others , but using a slightly different approach that enables increased precision .
Rendering the Effect of Labradorescence :
This is of interest to me as an optical reflectance geek , but I doubt anyone will be using it in a game anytime soon .
This paper presents a physically - based method of rendering a complex optical phenomena that exists in gems such as Labradorite and Spectrolite .
Ke-Sen Huang ’s Graphics
Interface 2009 page should be a good place to hunt for preprints of these papers as they appear .

FAQ
( Frequently Asked Questions )
Q. How long do stories need to be ?
A . We ca n’t tell you until contest start time how long the entries must be .
Past contests have ranged from 500 max . to 2,000 max .
You ’ll just have to wait and see .
Q . Why wo n’t you tell us the contest word count ahead of time ?
A. Because we have found that some write their stories ahead of time and then ( crafty they are ) creatively incorporate the contest topic into their almost - completed story .
Q. What ’s the biggest mistake writers make in the contests ?
A. Bad endings !
Oh , we do so detest bad endings !
Predictable endings , poor and weak endings … they can turn a wonderful story into a sour grape .
We ’ve read thousands of stories over the past two years and some absolutely wonderful and beautifully written stories end up losing on the last sentence .
It ’s sad , but it ’s very , very common .
Hint : We LOVE surprises !
Q. What do you base your judging criteria on ?
A . In the contests , we give the topic and what we find , after reading the first few entries , is that most of the stories are the same story told over and over but in a different way .
Those are weeded out because it is obvious that originality did not play a major part in their planning .
We also look at good writing ( but if the story is not good … it gets tossed as well ) .
Some writers can weave a beautiful thread , but tell a really bad story at the same time .
Humor plays a part , too , when appropriate in the story .
If we groan , we do n’t like it .
If we laugh out loud , we love it .
What we end up with ( at the end ) is 10 - 20 stories that stood out above the rest .
While good writing is a must , originality plays a huge role in the judging as well .
For example :
A past topic was : Life Threatening Situation in A Natural Disaster .
Common themes were people trying to survive hurricanes , floods , tornadoes and the like .
The winning entry focused more on the psychological madness of the wife than on the hurricane itself .
Another winner gave us an avalanche .
Not only was the story beautifully written , but it was the only avalanche story we received , and the life threatening situation was not the natural disaster , but the impending suicide of the main character .
Another topic was “ It was the most terrifying classifed ad yet and , to top it off , a there was a blizzard brewing ! ”
One writer wrote about a woman and classified ad…and she was drinking a blizzard from Dairy Queen .
Now THAT was original !
I hope this gives you some ideas of what we ’re looking for in winning entries .
Q. What should I avoid ?
A . Far too many stories come in with the main character being a writer .
Please do n’t do that .
It is far too common .
Also , do NOT make the main character of your story named Angela and do not base your story in Bangor , Maine .
These tactics are always used by a few in each contest and they do n’t work .
In fact , making us think that favoritism because of a name or location will be used has the opposite effect on our judging .
Good writing is what makes a winner …not manipulation of the judges .
Oh , and do n’t make your story about a writer who is participating in a writing contest but who ca n’t come up with an idea on the topic .
We always get a couple of those and that idea is pretty old by now . 😉
Q. What is the judging process ?
A. Stories are read and broken down into two categories .
Finalists versus other .
The finalists are read and ranked by all judges .
Using the rankings , we pick the top 23 .
These 23 are then re-read and ranked again by the judges and awarded either first , second , third place , or an honorable mention .
All others are eligible for door prizes which are awarded at random .
Have fun !

In a measured break with a half - century of U.S. policy toward communist Cuba , the Obama administration lifted restrictions Monday on Cuban - Americans who want to travel and send money to their island homeland .
In a further gesture of openness , U.S. telecommunications firms were freed to seek business there , too .
But the broader U.S. trade embargo remained in place .
The White House portrayed its changes , which fulfilled one of President Barack Obama 's campaign promises , as a path to promoting personal freedom in one of the few remaining communist nations .
They also marked another major step away from the foreign policy priorities of the Bush administration .
But the moves fell far short of the more drastic policy adjustments that some — including Republican Sen.
Richard Lugar — have argued are required to promote U.S. interests in Latin America and to bring about change in Cuba .
For most Americans , Cuba remains the only country in the world their government prohibits them from visiting — a barrier to potential travelers as well as to the Cuban tourist industry that would like to see them .
Cubans welcomed the changes but said more should be done .
" It 's help that the people really need , " Fermina Gonzalez , a 46 - year - old housewife in the leafy Havana neighborhood of Vedado , said of the ending of limits on money sent by Cuban - Americans .
" Right now , we have to work lots of jobs just to make ends meet . "
But few Cubans expect Obama to end the trade embargo or allow American tourists to visit the island without limits .
" He should do more and lift travel restrictions for all Americans , " said Alberto Sal , a 68 - year - old retiree .
" Until he does that , I do n't think he 's doing much . "
Lifting or substantially easing the economic embargo , as set forth in the Cuban Assets Control Regulations and administered by the Treasury Department , would require legislative action by Congress .
The White House made no mention of any intention to seek such changes ; Obama said as a presidential candidate that the embargo was a form of leverage to press for democratic reforms in Cuba .
Julia Sweig , director of Latin studies at the Council on Foreign Relations , described Obama 's changes as " teensy , weensy " and said they appear to be driven more by domestic political calculations that by foreign policy considerations .
" This is a cautious first step by a president whose political advisers are looking at the Florida electoral vote , " she said in a telephone interview , " and who are not looking at this as a matter of foreign policy .
That 's the big problem with Cuba policy .
We have a policy toward Miami and not toward Havana . "
Sweig added , however , that Obama 's decision to authorize more telecommunications links with Cuba was a " potentially significant opening , " particularly if the Cuban government follows through and allows those connections .
Jose Miguel Vivanco of Human Rights
Watch welcomed the Cuba announcement but said more should be done .
" If President Obama is serious about promoting change in Cuba , this executive order must be part of a larger shift away from the U.S. 's unilateral approach toward the Cuban government , " Vivanco said .
Taking the other side , three Democratic lawmakers wrote in a letter to Obama on Monday that his decisions would have " devastating consequences . "
They said the Cuban government takes 30 cents of every dollar in U.S. remittances that enters the country as a usury fee .
" This income facilitates the regime 's finance of its repressive state security apparatus , " they wrote .
The letter was signed by Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida and Albio Sires and Robert Andrews of New Jersey .
They recommended a more calibrated approach : doubling the amount of allowable money transfers to family members in Cuba rather than allowing unlimited transfers .
American policy toward Cuba has been frozen since 1962 , when the Kennedy administration broadened a partial trade embargo imposed by the Eisenhower administration the previous year .
The original aim was to bring down Fidel Castro's Marxist government at a time when U.S. - backed exiles mounted the failed Bay of Pigs invasion and Soviet missiles in Cuba pushed the world close to nuclear war .
Sporadic congressional efforts to end the embargo since then have failed , largely due to the political influence of powerful Cuban exiles , mostly in Florida , who are determined to isolate Cuba , strangle its economy and force Castro out .
Castro , now 82 , ceded the presidency to his brother last year due to illness .
Raul Castro , 77 , shows no sign of making any fundamental changes .
The White House portrayed the lifting of travel restrictions and money transfers to family members in Cuba — coupled with the telecommunications changes — as steps to bridge the gap among divided Cuban families .
" All who embrace core democratic values long for a Cuba that respects the basic human , political and economic rights of all of its citizens , " White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said in announcing the decision .
" President Obama believes the measure he has taken today will help make that goal a reality . "
It had been known for more than a week that the White House would announce the Cuba changes in advance of Obama 's attendance this weekend at a Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago .
Cuba is excluded from that gathering of 34 heads of government , but a number of participants are expected to use the session as an opportunity to press the U.S. to improve relations with Havana .
There has been a growing chorus of congressional advocates for change in U.S. policy toward Cuba .
In February , Sen. Lugar , R - Ind. , issued a report based on a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff visit to Havana that called for a repeal of the family travel and money transfer restrictions .
Lugar 's report also urged congressional action to remove all U.S. travel restrictions , not just those for Cuban - Americans .
Further , it advocated lifting travel restrictions on Cuban diplomats in Washington , who are not allowed to journey outside the capital area .
It said this would encourage a reciprocal lifting of Cuban restrictions on U.S. diplomats , improving the U.S. government 's ability to understand more fully the conditions that exist on the entire island .
Separately on Monday , a U.S. religious freedom watchdog group said it had been forced to call off a fact - finding trip after the Cuban government did not issue visas to its delegation .
The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said the visas had been applied for weeks earlier and it had received no explanation for why they were not granted .

In Indonesia and Pakistan , questions about how science and faith can be reconciled .
In the first large study of its kind , a survey of 3,800 high - school students in Indonesia and Pakistan has found that teachers are delivering conflicting messages about evolution .
The Can$ 250,000 Islam and Evolution research project is the first large study of students , teachers and scientists in countries with significant Muslim populations to examine their understanding and acceptance of evolution .
Some results from the three - year project were presented at a symposium at McGill University in Montreal , Canada , this week .
The data could help teachers and students from diverse backgrounds work together better .

" We now have empirical data for how Muslim students , teachers and scientists think about the subject , " says Brian Alters , the study 's lead investigator and director of the Evolution Education Research Center , a joint project between McGill and Harvard universities .
" It was pretty much a black hole prior to this . "
The survey polled 2,500 students enrolled in public high schools in Pakistan and 1,300 high - school students in public and Islamic schools in Indonesia .
It found that students had a good understanding of evolution .
" The majority of students thought evolution was based on solid evidence and that it was a well accepted scientific concept , " says Anila Asghar , a science education researcher at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland , who was involved in the study .
For example , 85 % of students agreed with the statement that millions of fossils show that life has existed for billions of years and changed over time .
But when students were asked if " the first humans on planet Earth were created by God , not gradually , but in their present form " , 80 % of Pakistani students and 49 % of Indonesian students surveyed agreed .
Teaching the teachers
When the students were asked if the holy book of their religion was in conflict with science regarding explanations of human origins , 64 % of Pakistani students and 36 % of Indonesian students agreed .
The country differences may stem , in part , from the textbooks used , says Asghar .
Some Indonesian teachers , for instance , used materials produced by Turkish creationist Harun Yahya , but these were not used in Pakistan .
Conversely , many Pakistani textbooks included Koranic verses that were interpreted to show that scientific ideas of evolution and the Koran were not in conflict .
Still , interviews with high - school teachers showed that most teachers had a vague understanding of evolution , did not accept it and tended to include religious explanations in their teaching .
" We can address these issues in teacher education programmes , " says team member Jason Wiles , who studies science education at Syracuse University in New York .
" If they do n't understand evolution and they have a contradictory view , then they are going to oppose it , not teach it and tell their students that it is wrong .... This is the next generation of Muslim scientists , teachers and community leaders . "
On the other hand , says Asghar , Muslim scientists surveyed did not see any conflict between Islam and evolution , although some said they faced opposition from colleagues from other sciences or departments .
Of 12 Pakistani biologists interviewed , one rejected evolution .
In June 2006 , both the Pakistani and Indonesian academies of sciences — and many other countries with Muslim majorities — signed a statement urging parents and teachers to educate children about the origins and evolution of life on Earth .
The data could also be useful to biology professors in North America who teach an increasingly diverse student population , says Wiles .
" It means that people like myself in the ivory tower have to reach out and engage people , " adds Ehab Abouheif , an evolutionary developmental biologist at McGill University , who was not involved in the study .
" I 'm concerned about every detail of evolution and trying to discover its deeper meaning … and much of the world does n't believe it or want to believe in it . "
" You ca n't understand modern medicine or biotechnology without having evolution as the organizing principle , " says Joshua Rosenau , a project director at the National Center for Science Education in Oakland , California .
" The lack of understanding of evolution will hold some countries back .
I worry that it will hold the United States back , too . "

The report suggested conflicts ahead between taxpayers struggling to keep their own households afloat and elected officials charged with balancing budgets , making their payrolls and protecting their credit ratings .
“ Taxpayers , worried about their own financial condition , are more resistant than ever to increasing property or other local taxes , ” the report observed .
The report ’s publication coincided with the downgrading by Moody ’s of the credit of the State of Illinois to the A level from double - A. Moody ’s said Illinois was having difficulty managing its cash , and in recent weeks had been trying to push its scheduled pension contributions into the future .
The state pension fund is already seriously underfunded .
The Federal Reserve chairman , Ben S. Bernanke , warned that local governments had probably lost their ability to lower their borrowing costs by linking their bonds to derivatives .
Such bond packages had become popular in the last few years because they appeared to offer cities both the lower borrowing costs of variable - rate bonds and the predictability of fixed - rate bonds .
But the structures broke down during last year ’s market turmoil , leaving some municipalities staggering under more debt than they can afford .
Mr. Bernanke said he was aware that some governments with low credit ratings were completely shut out of the short - term financial markets , while others were stuck with a type of derivative called interest - rate swaps that no longer made sense for them .
Mr. Bernanke offered his remarks in a letter to members of Congress who had asked the Fed to create a facility to breathe new life into segments of the municipal bond market that were still paralyzed .
But Mr. Bernanke said municipal debt had “ unique characteristics ” that made it “ unlikely ” that the Fed could be of much help .
He suggested that instead , Congress could consider setting up some other form of assistance for municipalities unable to restructure or refinance their debt , like a federal bond reinsurance program .
( CNN ) -- " Braced for Fate " believes that Jews control American media , financial institutions and government and that federal authorities plan to confiscate guns owned lawfully by American citizens .
Suspect Richard Poplawski , in an undated North Catholic
High yearbook photo , is in police custody .

Those chilling beliefs are revealed in posts on a white supremacist Web site that the Anti-Defamation League says were made by Richard Poplawski , the man who allegedly ambushed and killed three Pittsburgh police officers last week .
The organization , which tracks anti-Semitic activity , says Poplawski posted on the Web site first under the username " Rich P " and more recently under the ominous username " Braced for Fate . "
In one post , " Braced for Fate " describes the eagle tattoo he sports in a photograph taken from Poplawski's MySpace page before the page was taken down , calling it a " deliberately Americanized version of the [ Nazi ] Iron Eagle . "
The Anti-Defamation League says that other posts match up -- " Braced for Fate 's " comments about Wellington , Florida , where Poplawski lived a few years ago , some names and some common links .
" Braced for Fate " is not shy about his beliefs .
" ZOG ( Zionist - occupied government ) is , " he wrote in a lengthy post on March 13 .
" One can read the list of significant persons in government and in major corporations and see who is pulling the strings .
One can observe the policies and final products and should walk away with little doubt there is Zionist occupation and -- after some further research & critical thinking -- will discover their insidious intentions . "
" Braced for Fate " made just 52 posts , but in a post late last fall , he wrote that he sees himself " probably ramping up the activism in the near future . "
" He did n't like the Zionists controlling the media and controlling , you know , our freedom of speech , " Eddie Petrovic , who described himself as Poplawski 's best friend , told CNN .
" He did n't like the control of the guns that was about to happen .
He believed everything our forefathers put before us and thought that it was being distorted . "
Petrovic said that Poplawski received a dishonorable discharge from the Marine Corps for an incident during boot camp .
" He believed the Jews were coming , the Jews controlled society , you know , we 're all under the thumb of Zionists and so on , " said Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center , which tracks the movements of hate groups .
" Braced for Fate " referred to himself as a " skinhead " in some posts , and urged his compatriots to fight for the " ultimate victory for our people " by " taking back our nation . "
" A revolutionary is always regarded as a nutcase at first , their ideas dismissed as fantasy , " he wrote on November 1 .
He feared that a total collapse of all order in the country was " inevitable , " but , he wrote , that might be a blessing in disguise .
" If a total collapse is what it takes to wake our brethren and guarantee future generations of white children walk this continent , if that is what it takes to restore our freedoms and recapture our land :
Let it begin this very second and not a moment later , " wrote " Braced for Fate . "
In another post , answering a question about what weapon he'd like to have if he were allowed only one , he said , " I guess I 'd have to say my AK .
Which is nice because it does n't have to fall from the sky -- it 's in a case within arms reach . "
Police believe Poplawski , wearing a bullet - proof vest , fired more than 100 rounds at officers on April 4 with an AK - 47 , another rifle and pistol .
Poplawski himself was wounded in the four - hour stand - off with police and is hospitalized .
Police initially responded to a 911 call for a domestic disturbance call from his mother .
But a dispatcher 's error kept police from learning there were guns in the home .

All About Pittsburgh • Police • Anti-Defamation League
In 1957 , the area suffered its next calamity when the cooling system of a radioactive waste containment unit malfunctioned and exploded .
The explosion spewed some 20 million curies of radioactivity into the atmosphere .
About two million curies spread throughout the region , exposing 270,000 people to as much radiation as the Chernobyl victims .
Less than half of one percent of these people were evacuated , and some of those only after years had passed .
The third disaster came ten years later .
The Mayak complex had been using Lake Karachay as a dumping basin for its radioactive waste since 1951 .
In 1967 , a drought reduced the water level of the lake , and gale - force winds spread the radioactive dust throughout twenty - five thousand square kilometers , further irradiating 436,000 people with five million curies , approximately the same as at Hiroshima .
In the past 45 years , about half a million people in the region have been irradiated in one or more of the incidents , exposing them to as much as 20 times the radiation suffered by the Chernobyl victims .
“ The Most Contaminated Spot on the Planet ” is a journey , starting on a train which , after 36 hours , brings me from Moscow into the city of Chelyabinsk , the administrative center of the province and home to over a million people .
The city sprang up during the Second World War , when Stalin moved weapons production to the isolated region .
It would go on to produce 50 % of the Soviet Union ’s tanks .
This gave the city its nickname , “ Tank City . ”
From there , the camera travels to the villages of Muslyumovo , Brodokalmak , Tishma , and the town of Argayash .
The villagers of Muslyumovo and Brodokalmak were never evacuated from the banks of the contaminated Techa River .
Authorities moved the villagers of Tishma in the late 1950 ’s , but only a few kilometers , leaving the locals ’ grazing land along the banks of the Techa .
Argayash is the home of the Sunrasin family resettled after the 1957 explosion .
Through Idris Sunrasin , we learn the radiation ’s death toll on one family : his grandmother , parents , and three of his eight siblings have already died of cancer .
Idris himself is dying of stomach cancer and Argayash , a town of 10 thousand , falls within one of the most radioactive zones in the province , according to Russian environmentalists .
“ We ’re all sick .
As for the children , I do n’t know .
It ’s some kind of dying generation . ” – Lena Morozova , 32
The camera interviews people from all walks of life : Simple farmers and shepherds , teachers , doctors , factory workers and environmental activists from the association Kishtym - 57 .
Officials who represent the Mayak complex and doctors who work for the infamous FIB , the institute devoted to testing the region ’s people for radiation , are also interviewed .
Until 1988 , FIB also kept secret the cause of the cancers and chronic illnesses , even from the patients themselves .
The private citizens tell us the stories of being kept in the dark , ineffectively resettled or not resettled at all , the deaths in their families from cancer , their children ’s chronic illnesses , and their inability to move out of this contaminated area .
The mullah of the largely Muslim village of Muslyumovo says simply , “ It is the will of God .
” The villagers tell us that they do not because their roots are there , because they have no money , because their fear the ability to get a job elsewhere , because they know no other life .
One man says simply : “ You ca n’t escape your fate . ”
When the camera visits doctors , we learn that the horrifying illnesses faced by the people are compounded by the authorities ’ refusal , until about three years ago , to even acknowledge that cancer existed in the region .
We visit a renowned osteopath whose patient tells us that many , many children in the area of the Mayak complex are born without hands , legs , and feet .
“ We ’re nothing but guneia pigs here …
They do n’t give a damn about us . ”
There are n’t many births , the women do n’t want to have children .
Who needs more cripples ?
– Men gathered at the Muslyumovo store .
The camera visits Dr. Genady Romanov , the head of the nuclear complex ’s research institute .
His reactions illustrate the official view of the continuing mismanagement of radioactive waste .
When I mention my conversations with local doctors about the high cancer rate in the region , he replies : “ What doctors ?
The Muslyumovo doctors ?
They ’re ignoramuses .
They ’re all ignorant about nuclear biology and radiology . ”
Interviews with villagers reveal the presence of the Institute of Biochemistry , called FIB , which has been checking the residents for radiation since the late 1950s , but neither told them the cause of their illness , nor treated them .
The camera travels to FIB and talks to Dr. Kosenko , who has worked in the institute for over 30 years : “ They did n’t know anything , and we had no right to tell them that they had been irradiated .
All this information was top secret , because the factory produced weapons - grade plutonium …
If someone had found out that in some area there were people who had been irradiated , then it would have been possible to find the factory .
That ’s why these people were n’t given any information about radiation . ”
The authorities ’ cover-up of the situation expands , as we learned from yet another doctor that until recently , doctors were not allowed to give cancer as a cause of death : “ Write something else , either a stroke , or a severe heart attack , or even chronic heart disease , basically any of those accompanying factors .
But to just put down cancer as a cause of death was just not allowed . ”
The camera returns to Dr. Kosenko at FIB , where we see her in a room with thousands of files .
She explains that even at FIT they were not allowed to write “ radiation sickness ” on the patients ’ charts :
“ We were given instructions to indicate it with initials , and the three letters were ABC .
Wherever we see that abbreviation … all of us who work here knew that it was radiation sickness . ”
When I left the region in March of 1992 , I promised the friends I had made to return soon .
When the next summer comes , I am once again on the train to Chelyabinsk .
My camera revisits the people in the contaminated areas .
I meet kids fishing on the Techa River , where my Geiger counter shows that the fish they ’ve just caught contains twenty times the normal radiation .
” We eat these fish , ” they tell me , and add sarcastically , “ It ’s like they say , ‘ you ca n’t infect the infected ’ . ”
The camera then travels to the village of Tishma , which was rebuilt several kilometers from the contaminated Techa in the late 1950s .
Anisa Nineeva explains that the village ’s problems have not been solved : “ Only eight kilometers from us there ’s a radioactive waste containment facility …( the trucks that carry the radioactive waste ) come right through our village …
And right alongside ( the Techa River ) is our collective farm …
That means we cut our hay there , drink that milk . ”
We go with Anisa to see her grazing land and Anisa is shocked to tears when our Geiger counter ’s needle repeatedly goes off the scale , showing forty times the normal background radiation .
“ This is terrible news for me .
What should I do now ?
This is where half the village has been cutting hay since 1956 . ”
The cinema verite style encourages these disclosures .
A woman talks casually in her own kitchen , Dr. Romanov in his office , Dr. Kosenko among her files .
The people are unposed and unprepared to dissemble of put a good face on things .
The camera allows us to see that the victims , who were so proud to live where the Soviet Union produced its first atomic weapon , to some degree collaborate in their own undoing : Faced with death and the increasing weakness of each generation , they do not move away , they do feel helpless , and they strive more for financial remuneration that for a cleanup or resettlement .
In the final interview , Dr. Romanovinsists that nobody died as a result of the 1957 explosion .
Because the interviews seem so informal both to the victims and their victimizers , the camera captures a glimpse not just of a black - and - white situation , but of something much more complex :
The victims are not saints , and while the officials are unpleasant , they were also victims of the propaganda of the Cold War , fe d on patriotism , and , of course , threatened with labor camps should they reveal the secret of Mayak .
“ When they evacuated us … they made us sign a form saying that we would n’t reveal state secrets .
Of course , we knew what that meant …
People knew where we were from , and were afraid of us ; they thought we might be contagious .
They shied away from us like people do now if you have AIDS . ”
– Sofiya Khrylenko , retired teacher from an orphanage
The reasons for making this film are clear : the story of these people needs to be told , and needs to be shown to the Western audience , as well as the Russian one .
The film operates on three levels : the most immediate is that of a region in crisis , a region where people expect to live to be 50 , perhaps 55 , where as many as 90 % of the children suffer from chronic illnesses .
They deserve attention and help at least as much as the victims of Chernobyl .
But the story is also a cautionary tale .
Because this is not one cataclysmic even , one explosion , one calamity resulting from short - term carelessness , but the effects of a long term policy of skewed priorities , the film also illustrates the dangers of allowing a government to put military secrets above its people .
Finally , it is a story about the dangers of nuclear power and the production of nuclear weapons .
“ Nobody knows anything about us .
Chernobyl happened , but that ’s Europe .
The pollution reached Europe , and the whole world was upset .
But us , out here in the backwoods of Russia ?
Nobody knows about it , nobody in the world cares about the fate we ’ve sealed for ourselves here . ”
– Farida Shaimardanova , Muslyumovo teacher

In his March 11 Wall Street Journal op - ed , former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan tried to exonerate himself from the housing boom and bust .
Even though more and more analysts are realizing that Greenspan 's low interest rates fueled the bubble , the ex-maestro himself uses statistics to defend his record .
On these pages Frank Shostak has already taken on Greenspan 's spurious arguments , but in the present article I 'll touch on a few more points .
Greenspan Could n't Push Up Rates ?
Greenspan 's main argument is that the Fed lost control of the ability to move long - term interest rates , especially 30 - year fixed mortgage rates .
Since it is these longer rates that ( at least in theory ) ought to influence house prices much more than the overnight federal - funds rate , Greenspan can't possibly be held responsible for the housing bubble .
In his words ,
The Federal Reserve became acutely aware of the disconnect between monetary policy and mortgage rates when the latter failed to respond as expected to the Fed tightening in mid-2004 .
Moreover , the data show that home mortgage rates had become gradually decoupled from monetary policy even earlier — in the wake of the emergence , beginning around the turn of this century , of a well arbitraged global market for long - term debt instruments .
U.S. mortgage rates ' linkage to short - term U.S. rates had been close for decades .
Between 1971 and 2002 , the fed - funds rate and the mortgage rate moved in lockstep .
The correlation between them was a tight 0.85 .
Between 2002 and 2005 , however , the correlation diminished to insignificance .
Now this is extremely misleading .
Judging from Greenspan 's description , the reader would think that the federal - funds rate ( which the Fed directly targets with its open - market operations ) and the mortgage rate moved along in sync , when all of a sudden Greenspan tried to jack up short - term rates in 2004 , and yet those pesky mortgage rates refused to move up .
Hence , he did what he could to slow the housing bubble , but alas , it was precisely when he tried to help that the markets rendered him impotent .
On the other hand , Greenspan says ( truthfully ) that the correlation between the two series broke down earlier , in 2002 .
Let 's look at the graph and see exactly what happened :
Effective Federal Funds Rate vs. 30 - Year Conventional Fixed Mortgage Rate ( monthly data , source : St. Louis Fed )
So it 's true , the red and blue lines in the chart above moved pretty much in lockstep up until 2002 , as Greenspan claimed .
But the disconnect occurred when Greenspan slashed short - term rates while mortgage rates held steady .
Since the participants in the mortgage market wisely realized that rates would n't be held at 1 % forever , they did n't foolishly drop their own yields down so far .
Then in June 2004 , when Greenspan began ratcheting the federal - funds rate back up , it is perfectly understandable that mortgage rates would n't rise with them .
To repeat , Greenspan 's defense of his policies made it sound as if he tried to push up mortgage rates , but that they would n't budge .
Yet , as the chart above makes clear , Greenspan did n't really push up very hard on rates .
After all , he stopped short of breaking through mortgage rates ( the blue line ) once the federal - funds rate ( the red line ) plateaued in June 2006 at 5.25 % .
If he really had wanted to push up mortgage rates , he could have pushed up the federal - funds rate more .
Let 's look at this issue a little more carefully .
In the chart below , I 've graphed the difference between the federal - funds and mortgage rates ; i.e. , I am plotting the gap between the blue and red lines from the first chart , above .
In addition , I overlay the average value of this gap for the period 1971 –2002 :
Gap Between Mortgage and Federal Funds Rate
The above chart takes a minute to digest , but if the reader masters it , he will see just how silly Greenspan 's argument is .
The great " divergence " between the two interest rate series that began in 2002 was nothing unusual by historical standards .
And once Greenspan tried to slam on the brakes by raising short rates ( in 2004 ) , a full year went by before the gap between the two had returned to its average over the 1971 –2002 period — the very period that Greenspan says the two series moved " in lockstep . "
In terms of the graph itself , it is not until June 2005 that the blue line crosses below the red line .
Only from that point onward was the gap between the mortgage and federal - funds rates even smaller than average .
( And the gap even went negative several times during the 1970s , when the federal - funds rate exceeded mortgage rates . )
Finally , just step back and look at the chart .
Does it look as if something crazy and unprecedented happened from 2002 –2005 ?
Not at all : the whole housing boom period from 1998 – 2007 looks almost like a mirror image of 1988 – 1997 .
So to repeat , the reason that the correlation between the federal - funds rate and the 30 - year mortgage rate broke down during the housing boom was that Greenspan whipsawed short rates waaaaaay down , then waaaaaay up , in a fairly narrow window .
Mortgage rates ( thank goodness ) did n't move around in such a volatile manner .
If one series goes from 6.5 % down to 1 % , then back up to 5.25 % , while the other series stays roughly flat , then obviously the measured correlation is going to be low .
Those Pesky Asian Savers
Greenspan repeats the claim that Asian savings were the real culprit .
But there are two problems with this theory : first , global savings rates continued to rise throughout the housing boom and bust .
So it 's very difficult to explain the peak of the housing boom with reference to Asian saving .
( In contrast , Greenspan 's actions with short - term rates fit the fortunes of the housing market much more closely . )
But a second major problem is that even on its own terms , the influx of blind Asian saving — to the extent it existed at all — was itself partially a product of Greenspan 's monetary inflation .
Remember that the Chinese central bank had maintained a rigid peg to the dollar until it was pressured to drop it — right around the time the housing boom faltered :
To put it somewhat simplistically , when Greenspan flooded the world with more dollars , the dollar fell sharply against most major currencies .
But in order for the Chinese to keep the renminbi ( yuan ) from appreciating against the dollar as well , they had to load up on dollar - denominated assets , such as US Treasuries .
Thus , Greenspan 's inflation in combination with the Chinese peg , on paper might have appeared as an irrational influx of Asian investment , which stubbornly refused to subside even as US indebtedness grew .
Conclusion
It is bad enough that Alan Greenspan refuses to acknowledge what more and more people are realizing : his ultralow interest rates — which were in turn accomplished through injections of artificial credits into the banking system — fueled the housing boom .
The Greenspan Fed was not a sufficient condition to cause the housing and stock bubbles , but it was almost certainly a necessary factor .
If the Fed had let the post - 9/11 recession run its course , there would have been no absurd boom ( and now bust ) .
But beyond Greenspan 's refusal to admit his mistakes is the ludicrous accusation that high savings rates among the world 's poorest people — coupled with growing incomes made possible by technological and legal advances — was cause for misery .
What a warped view of how the market economy works , to think that savings and foreign investment can cripple an economy .
Bob Whisonant is a Civil War buff with a peculiar way of looking at the Civil War .
If you ask him to talk about , say , the Battle of Antietam , he might begin , “ Well , it all started 500 million years ago . ”
Whisonant is a geologist , trained to study how layers of sediment form .
He worked first at an oil company , then as a professor at Radford University in Virginia for more than 30 years .
It was n’t long before his geologic training began to inform his longstanding fascination with the Civil War .
When Whisonant learned that there were others like him , he began to attend conferences on what is known as military geology .
About a decade ago , he met Judy Ehlen , an Army Corps of Engineers geologist with similar interests , and the two hatched a plan : what might they learn by studying the geology underlying the Civil War ’s 25 bloodiest battles ?
When they plotted those battles on a map , they found that nearly a quarter of them had been fought atop limestone — more than on any other kind of substrate .
What ’s more , those limestone battles were among the most gruesome of the list .
“ Killer limestone , ” they called it .
But limestone is not inherently toxic .
Why had it proved so hazardous ?
The key to the puzzle , they found , is that limestone erodes relatively easily .
Over millions of years , limestone bedrock weathers into flat , open terrain .
And as any soldier who has charged into enemy fire knows , open terrain “ is a bad place to be , ” as Whisonant puts it .
He and Ehlen presented their work at the 2008 meeting of the Geological Society of America ; an article is forthcoming in a book titled Military Geography and Geology : History and Technology .
Whisonant and Ehlen are quick to acknowledge that soldiers have known for thousands of years that terrain affects battles .
But military geology takes things “ a step deeper , ” Whisonant says ( with “ no pun intended ” ) .
Where a military historian might note the importance of the high ground or available cover in a battle , geologists look at a longer chain of causation .
By making the strata of battlefields their subject of study , they give greater context , and a new perspective , to old battlefields .
Take the battle of Antietam , which occurred on September 17 , 1862 .
It remains the bloodiest day in American history — 23,000 men died or were wounded on that battlefield — as well as one of the most strategically significant of the Civil War .
The Union victory marked a turning point and emboldened President Abraham Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation a few days later .
The battlefield also offers one of the best illustrations of Civil War geology .
Antietam was fought atop different types of bedrock : in one area was limestone ; in another , dolomite .
Over millions of years , these different bedrocks eroded into distinct terrains .
The limestone area became flat and open .
But because dolomite is harder than limestone , the dolomite areas eroded into less even terrain , filled with hills and ridges that provided some cover .
One result : the fighting atop the limestone produced casualties at almost five times the rate of the fighting atop the dolomite .
Limestone underlies the section of the battleground called the Cornfield — “ the single bloodiest piece of ground in Civil War history , ” Whisonant says .
There , the bullets flew so relentlessly that by the battle ’s end , “ it looked like a scythe had come through and mowed down the cornstalks . ”
There were 12,600 casualties after three hours of fighting at the Cornfield , or 4,200 casualties an hour ; at Burnside Bridge , which sat atop dolomite , there were 3,500 casualties after four hours , or 875 an hour .
Beyond its role in shaping battlefield topography , geology affected Civil War battles in less intuitive ways .
At Gettysburg , Union soldiers arrayed themselves along a high , rocky spine called Cemetery Ridge .
It was a commanding position , but it had a disadvantage : when the Confederates began bursting shells above them , the Union soldiers found that they could n’t dig foxholes into the rock .
Between battles , troop movements were fundamentally “ constrained by geology , ” says Frank Galgano of Villanova University , who previously taught military geology at West Point .
There is an oft - repeated myth that the Battle of Gettysburg occurred where it did because a Union general brought his weary , ill - shod troops there in search of a shoe factory .
The fact , Galgano says , is that eight roads converged at Gettysburg , so a confrontation was bound to occur there .
Those roads , in turn , had been built along axes determined by the topography , which was formed by tectonic events .
“ This seminal event in American history occurred here because of something that happened eons ago , ” Galgano says .
Military geologists acknowledge that their work reveals only one of many forces that influence the outcome of war .
“ Leadership , morale , dense woods … the list goes on and on , ” Whisonant says .
Plus , he points out that there are plenty of battles where the role of geology was minor .
Even so , the lay of the land and its composition have long been recognized as crucial .
For that reason , armies have sought the counsel of geologists ( or their contemporary equivalents ) since ancient times .
But not until the 20th century , Whisonant says , were there organized efforts to harness geologists ’ knowledge in waging war .
Today , military geologists work on a “ whole wide range of things , ” he says .
How easily can troops march along a certain terrain ?
What vehicles can pass ?
How will weaponry affect the landscape ?
Before she retired from the Army Corps of Engineers in 2005 , Judy Ehlen conducted research intended to help Army analysts learn to identify rock types from satellite and aerial imagery .
Whisonant says he knows a geologist who is “ looking at the geology of the area [ Osama ] bin Laden is supposedly in , helping the Department of Defense assess what will happen if a missile goes in a cave . ”
So long as warfare is waged on Earth , armies will need people who study the planet ’s surface .
“ Throughout history it ’s always the same , ” Galgano says , “ and it will be the same 100 years from now . ”
But it ’s that war from over 100 years ago that keeps beckoning to Whisonant .
He says he has been moved by his visits to battlefields from the American Revolution to World War II , but that the Civil War battlefields — with their level fields , their rolling hills , their rocky outcroppings — move him most .
“ The gallantry , the willingness to pay the last full measure , as Lincoln said , by both sides has really consecrated that ground , ” he says .
This is excellent news from the Obama administration :
After a tense internal debate , the Obama administration this afternoon will make public a number of detailed memos describing the harsh interrogation techniques used by the Central Intelligence Agency against al Qaeda suspects in secret overseas prisons .
The interrogation methods were among the Bush administration ’s most closely guarded secrets , and today ’s release will be the most comprehensive public accounting to date of the interrogation program that some senior Obama administration officials have said used illegal torture .
The documents are expected to include Justice Department memos from 2002 and 2005 authorizing the C.I.A. to employ a number of aggressive techniques - including sleep deprivation , exposure to extreme temperatures and " waterboarding , " the near - drowning technique .
Among the anticipated documents are detailed 2005 memos by Stephen G. Bradbury , who as acting head of the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel authorized the C.I.A. techniques .
The documents have never before been made public , but an article in The New York Times in October 2007 said that the memos gave legal support for using a combination of coercive techniques at the same time and concluded that the C.I.A.’s methods were not " cruel , inhuman or degrading " under international law .
Another document expected to be released this afternoon is a Justice Department memo written August 1 , 2002 .
The memo , written by John C. Yoo and signed by Jay S. Bybee , two Justice Department officials at the time , is a legal authorization for a laundry list of proposed C.I.A. interrogation techniques .
The next step
Last week 's CES saw the announcement of the much anticipated public beta of Windows 7 , with 2.5 million license keys promised to beta testers on Friday .
Friday arrived , and as is now well - known , Microsoft 's servers melted under the load .
The key generation is now more or less working , and the 2.5 million limit has been scrapped , so it 's time to take a look at what 's on offer .
The first public sightings of Windows 7 were at Microsoft 's PDC developer conference in October last year .
The lead - up to PDC was unusually secretive , with Redmond giving little away about what Windows 7 would actually contain when it shipped , in contrast to the extremely public lead - up to Windows Vista 's release .
The covers came off at PDC , with the star of the show being Windows 7's new taskbar .
Unfortunately , the build that was given out to PDC attendees lacked the new taskbar , so the one feature we all wanted to play with was n't actually available .
The public beta , build number 7000 , finally gives us the new shiny taskbar .
If all goes well , this will be the only beta Windows 7 gets ; a Release Candidate should land some time around April , going RTM in July , and hitting retail two to three months later .
Windows Vista made a lot of changes to the driver model and the display layer , and took a much harder line on security , which was all very necessary work , but which caused a lot of teething trouble in its early days .
Windows 7 does n't undo any of that work ; it does , however , build upon it to make using the OS simpler and more refined .
The major focus with Windows 7 is how the user interacts with the machine , and so the major work in Windows 7 is to the user interface .
Therefore I 'll focus mainly on the new interface elements in this brief look .
For those more interested in the system administrative perspective , our PDC Coverage would be a good place to start .
The taskbar
The taskbar is probably the defining feature of the Windows user interface .
The introduction of the taskbar and Start Menu with Windows 95 was something of a landmark ; it was the taskbar more than any other aspect of the Windows 95 UI that made Windows 95 feel modern , leaving Windows 3.11 far behind .
While the Start Menu has undergone radical improvements ( culminating in Vista 's searchable Start Menu , which I can't live without ) , the taskbar has changed little since its introduction .
Minor refinements have been made over the years — the IE4 shell update added the ability to dock special toolbars to the taskbar ( most notably the Quick Launch icons ) , Windows XP added stacking to allow multiple buttons to collapse if the taskbar became too full , and Vista added thumbnails when hovering the mouse — but the basic mechanics of switching between running tasks have remained unaltered .
The new taskbar
Fire up Windows 7 for the first time and the taskbar is pretty much what we saw back in October .
No more Quick Launch toolbar , no more button text , just a set of large icons .
An icon on the taskbar does n't necessarily mean that a program is running ; programs can be pinned to the taskbar so that their icon is persistent .
Clicking the icon starts the program ( if it 's not running ) or switches to it ( if it is ) .
If a program has multiple windows , clicking the icon shows a list of thumbnails ; clicking the thumbnail switches window .
The new taskbar with multiple windows
Once you get too many windows , you just get a list instead of thumbnails
Though the appearance is quite unlike any previous taskbar , and is liable to cause some consternation among those resistant to change , the basic operation of the taskbar is much the same as it has been in XP .
In this regard , the biggest behavioral change is the conflation of running and non-running programs .
Personally , I like this .
Whether a program is currently running or not is , to me , a minor detail , and so the mechanism I use to switch to an application should be the same regardless of whether the application is currently running .
Forcing me to do one thing ( Quick Launch or Start Menu ) when the application is n't running , and a second ( taskbar ) when it is strikes me as unnecessary .
With Windows 7 , the same approach can be used in both situations ; just click the icon .
There are small visual cues to indicate the state of each application ; IE ( left - most ) is n't running , so has no box around the icon .
Media Player ( second from left ) has a single window , so gets a single box .
Chrome ( third from left ) and Explorer ( fourth from left ) have multiple windows , so they get a kind of stacked box .
The rather vociferous supporters of a certain Cupertino - based company will probably say that this aspect of the new taskbar ( in conjunction with its large icons ) shows that Microsoft has simply copied Apple .
That may be so , but I 'm not sure why anyone should care .
The new taskbar works better than the old one , and that alone justifies the decisions Microsoft has taken .
Roit police come under heavy attack from Poll Tax rioters
The “ double - whammy ” of the worst economic crisis in living memory and a motley crew of political extremists determined to stir up civil disorder has led to the ­extraordinary step of the Army being put on ­standby .
MI5 and Special Branch are targeting activists they fear could inflame anger over job losses and payouts to failed bankers .
One of the most notorious anarchist websites , Class War , asks : “ How to keep warm ­during the credit crunch ?
Burn a banker . ”
Such remarks have rung alarm bells in Scotland Yard and the Ministry of Defence .
Intelligence sources said the police , backed by MI5 , are determined to stay on top of a situation that could spiral out of control as the recession bites deep .
The chilling prospect of soldiers being drafted on to the streets has not been discounted , although it is regarded as a last resort .
What worries emergency planners most is that the middle classes , now struggling to cope with unemployment and repossessions , may take to the streets with the disenfranchised .
The source said “ this potent cocktail is reminiscent of the poll tax riots which fatally wounded Margaret Thatcher ’s government in 1990 ” .
Last night Scotland Yard vowed it was ready to face any threat .
A source said : “ We do have a policing plan in place and we have riot police officers trained for such measures . ”
But other senior police leaders fear the force will be unable to cope .
Were that to be the case , the ­Government has a contingency plan to deploy troops on the streets of Britain ’s major cities .
A senior source said : “ This is a very real , and very serious , problem .
“ I can tell you there have been crisis talks in Whitehall about this .
“ Half the senior officers in Britain have been warning the Home Secretary about the dangerous effects that reducing police manpower may have this summer , especially in the industrial heartlands .
“ We are not just talking about the problems of immigration and British jobs for British worker .
We are also talking about mass unemployment .
“ In many of our industrial cities , this will not be measured in the hundreds , but in the thousands .
With unemployment , comes the risk of increased crime .
Some forces , such as South Wales , have publically ­stated they would be swamped .
“ Others are keeping it quiet , but you can be sure they are trying to make the Home Secretary listen , ­before it ’s too late . ”
The “ protest season ” is due to ­begin on April 1 with the G20 Summit in London next month , followed by the 60th anniversary of Nato in Strasbourg a few days later .
May Day is also ­potentially a flashpoint .
Ministers cannot afford to allow ­latent public anger at Government policy to get out of hand if they are to maintain credibility through what promises to be ­Gordon Brown ’s most testing period as Prime Minister .
The Stop the War coalition , orchestrating the G20 protest , said : “ The first week of April could be a week of world leaders will never forget . ”
The British authorities want to avoid a repeat of the rioting that scarred British cities in the 1980s
Then , as now , the country was in recession with rising unemployment and deep public hostility to perceived social divisions .
Today that anger is focused on the banks , with their bonus culture surviving despite billions being paid in taxpayer bail - outs .
This has fomented in the outrage over news that senior executives will be rewarded for their failure .
Sir Fred Goodwin , former boss of RBS , has refused to hand back his £ 693,000 - a- year - pension even as the ailing bank announced a £ 24 billion loss last year , the single largest loss in British corporate history .
Early warnings of trouble ahead came from the furore over last months “ British jobs for British workers ” protest and wildcat strikes across the country .
People evacuated buildings and were forced onto the streets , which have been empty of late as civilians try to avoid contact with the flu that is thought to have killed 149 across the country so far .
This kind of talk from George Will , on today ’s This Week With George Stephanopolous , is just disgusting :
I think there ’s a radical sense of dislocation .
They think we have adopted an economic model of Lemon Socialism , transferring wealth from the successful to the unsuccessful .
That is not a long - term recipe for national success .
Translated into current reality , Will is saying that because Obama has proposed to restore the top tax rate for the top 5 % of income tax payers and cut taxes on the remaining 95 % , this is “ transferring wealth from the successful to the unsuccessful “ .
“ Unsuccessful “ ?
Seriously !?
This is a sentiment that pervades American culture that frankly disgusts me .
Far too many people in this country labor under the latent notion that you ’re not “ successful ” until you make a lot of money .
To suggest that a dockworker , machinist or plumber making a good living at , say , $ 75,000 per year is somehow “ unsuccessful ” is shameful .
And we wonder why Americans have grown so disgusted with the conservative elites in Washington …
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has revealed the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s much - touted toxic debt recovery plan that hopes to cleanse the tainted assets held by the country Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s major financial institutions .
Initially , the plan calls for the Treasury to use $ 75 to $ 100 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) which gives the government Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ purchasing powerÃ¢â‚ ¬Â of $ 500 billion of the affected assets .
If this first phase proves effective , the government says it could use up to one trillion dollars to solve the ongoing banking crisis .
Plan Highlights
The Treasury , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporations ( CDIC ) , and the Federal Reserve will work together on this initiative and will provide investment capital to help private investment firms buy the ear - marked assets from the banks and will also guarantee the safety of their investments .
Essentially , Geithner is counting on the backing of the government Ã¢â‚¬â€œ combined with the availability of lending capital Ã¢â‚¬â€ œto entice private firms to buy and manage the damaged assets held by the banks .
Fully one half of the money reserved for this proposal will be used as part of the so - called Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Legacy Loans ProgramÃ¢â‚ ¬Â to be administered by the FDIC .
This money will be used to buy a pool of assets from the banks and private fund managers are expected to supply the rest of the money for the pool .
The FDIC will guarantee financing for the investors to a maximum of six times the amount pledged .
The other half of the money will go to the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Legacy Securities ProgramÃ¢â‚ ¬Â  and will be used to shore - up the value of asset - backed mortgages that can no longer be traded as investors have no confidence in the original mortgages used to create the securities .
The WorldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Largest Hedge Fund ?
Obviously , GeithnerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s plan is to transfer the risk associated with the bank - held assets to other investors thereby providing the banks with sufficient liquidity in hopes that the banks can return to more normal lending practices .
Since the crisis took hold , credit has all but dried - up as few investors have been willing to deal in these assets Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at least not without some form of guarantee for the safety of their funds .
Cue the Federal Treasury .
Geithner has made it clear that the government believes the sale of these assets is critical to restore confidence in the system and this is the first step to what officials claim will be the way to recovery .
However , as much as I want to see a recovery , I canÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t help but thinking this scheme is essentially a massive hedge fund .
Consider the parallels Ã¢â‚¬â€œ like a typical hedge fund , this plan will be offered to only a select group of investors .
In the case of the toxic debt purchase Ã¢â‚¬â€œ five private investments firms will be determined by the end of April – at which point the firms will be given time to raise funds for which they will receive matching contributions from the government .
Investments will be highly - leveraged Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in this case at a six - to - one ratio Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to maximize returns .
Unlike privately - managed hedge funds however , the risk for this scheme is held solely held by the investors ; public money is also involved and this little fact could cause some problems for the government .
Taxpayer Fury
At a time when the average taxpayer needs a scorecard to keep track of all the bail - outs and rescue plans being offered , this one comes hard on the heels of growing protests over the AIG bonus payments .
The anger over the news that AIG executives gave themselves hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses out of the more than $ 170 billion in bailout money AIG received gave rise to public protests over the weekend .
In fact , this issue is well on its way to becoming a political scandal as questions of Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ who knew whatÃ¢â‚ ¬Â and Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ when they knew itÃ¢â ‚ ¬Â are being asked of top officials .
While this may have a ways to go before becoming a Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ youÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re doing a heckuva job , BrownieÃ¢â‚
¬
Â type moment , when the President has to come out and say he still has Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ absolute confidenceÃ¢â‚
¬Â in the abilities of his top officials as he did for Geithner a couple of days ago , you know someone is being prepped for tossing under the bus .
There really is a sense now that if this recapitalization of the banks does not result in positive and tangible results , the chances of the Obama administration securing more money from Congress could be seriously down - graded .
Republicans naturally oppose these moves , but even some key Democrats are questioning the effectiveness of these programs that have already added more than two trillion dollars to the national debt with little to show for the costs incurred .

As the global economic downturn gathers pace , police in the UK say protesters are planning in an " unprecedented " way for London 's G20 summit next week .
But who are those taking to the streets and what do they want ?
A number of flyers publicising protests are being circulated
The coming together of the world 's biggest economic powers has always attracted vocal and sometimes violent demonstrations .
But this year there are fears that anger over the recession could make next week 's G20 meeting of the world 's most powerful countries the focus for mass protest on a scale not seen for some time .
The Metropolitan Police warned last week that anarchists and environmentalists were planning in an " unprecedented " way ahead of the summit , and that groups active in the late 1990s were re-emerging and forming new alliances .
And Foreign Office Minister Lord Malloch - Brown has said anger over the financial crisis will mean people are more likely to " sympathise " with the hard - line G20 protesters .
Those inside the more radical groups themselves have claimed a " groundswell " in support , and warn the downturn is bound to boost numbers on the streets before and during the summit on 2 April .
A number of coalitions - both mainstream and militant - have formed to co-ordinate action ahead of G20 .
They will be campaigning on a vast range of subjects , from poverty , inequality and jobs to war , climate change and capitalism .
Household names
So , who will be waving what banners next week ?
In the first scheduled protest on Saturday , thousands are expected to join the Put People First march through London , when more than 100 charities and unions will call for democratic governance of the world economy , measures to tackle climate change and an end to global poverty and inequality .
The alliance brings together household names , such as development charities ActionAid , Oxfam and Plan , green campaigners Greenpeace , Friends of the Earth and Stop Climate Chaos , and jobs and homelessness groups like the TUC , the Salvation Army and Shelter .
G20 LONDON SUMMIT
World leaders will meet next week in London to discuss measures to tackle the downturn .
See our in - depth guide to the G20 summit .
The G20 countries are Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Mexico , Russia , Saudi Arabia , South Africa , South Korea , Turkey , the United Kingdom , the US and the EU .
Q&A : G20 Summit Organisers of the march - which police say is not expected to be " anything other than lawful " - argue that protesting this year is particularly important because the downturn is hitting the poorest hard and is offering governments an opportunity for change not seen for decades .
" Many people think things are possible now who did n't think so six months ago , " says Dr Claire Melamed , head of policy at ActionAid .
" And that 's not just among NGOs [ non- governmental organisations ] but also in the government . "
Plan 's UK chief executive , Marie Staunton , agrees that London 's G20 comes at a " pivotal time " and says it is crucial that richer countries take advantage of the recession to make changes to tackle poverty and climate change .
" There are some very simple things that could be done if there is the political will to do them , " she says .
' Spectacular action '
In addition , veteran campaigners CND have joined forces with Stop the War Coalition , the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and the British Muslim Initiative .
They will stage a demonstration on 1 April calling for the abolishment of nuclear weapons and the removal of foreign troops from Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as action over the Middle East .
But those groups of most concern to the authorities are the band of activists planning direct action , including Camp for Climate Change Action and those acting under the umbrella name G20 Meltdown .
We are at an absolutely pivotal point
Professor George McKay
University of Salford
G20 protesters :
What they want Climate Camp - the group behind direct action at Heathrow Airport and power stations in North Yorkshire and Kent - has been using text messages , e-mails and social networking sites to plan what it calls a day of " spectacular action " , which will see supporters " set up camp " in the City .
It has seen support grow , with more than 1,000 people already signed up to the group 's Facebook site ahead of the 1 April protest against the policy of carbon trading .
" I do n't think that there has been such a clear sense of the need for change in the general public for quite some time , " said one Climate Camp member .
" That 's bound to reflect in greater levels of unrest on the streets . "
' Angry energy '
Meanwhile , G20 Meltdown is appealing to those who have lost their " homes , jobs , savings or pensions " to join what they call a " Financial Fools ' Day " targeting the banking elite on 1 April .
Organisers say they have seen a " groundswell " in support since the start of the recession and their Facebook site has attracted more than 1,000 members .
" There really is a shift because people feel no - one is listening - the government is in some world of its own , " said one of the organisers , Camilla Power .
" Our aim is to challenge the legitimacy of the G20 summit . "
Thousands joined 2005 's Make Poverty History march in Edinburgh
But while G20 Meltdown insists its intentions are peaceful , the authorities fear other protest groups are preparing more disruptive tactics - such as attempting to enter banks and financial institutions - to fulfil their aim of bringing the City of London to a halt .
Protest expert Professor George McKay , of the University of Salford , says the economic crisis has served to boost support for such street protests this year because it has made criticising capitalism acceptable again - something that had all but disappeared in the 1980s and 90s .
" Here we are at an absolutely pivotal point , " he says .
" That , I think , will add to a new level of angry energy . "
Cdr Bob Broadhurst , in charge of policing the G20 , has said a £ 7.2 m police operation is being launched , but has admitted security and protest are not " always happy bedfellows " .
Only time will tell whether demonstrators demanding change and those defending the rule of law come into conflict once again .

A free fall in tax revenue is driving more state lawmakers to turn to broad - based tax increases in a bid to close widening budget gaps .
At least 10 states are considering some kind of major increase in sales or income taxes : Arizona , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Jersey , Oregon , Washington and Wisconsin .
California and New York lawmakers already have agreed on multibillion - dollar tax increases that went into effect earlier this year .

I had pastrami and eggs at the Carnegie Deli on 7th Avenue for breakfast one day last week and while I was sitting there thinking about what a unique New York food experience this was , it dawned on me that I could eat pastrami and eggs in Houston anytime I felt like it .
And it would probably cost me a lot less money .
( Although I have to admit that pastrami at Carnegie Deli was awfully good . )
The reason we do n't think about New York Jewish deli breakfasts in Houston is that we are too busy wolfing down Czech kolaches ; Tex - Mex migas and huevos rancheros ; Mexican barbacoa and carnitas ; and Southern catfish and grits , chicken and waffles , and biscuits and gravy .
In fact , we have so many great breakfast traditions around here it's hard to get around to all of them .
The lady sitting beside me at the Carnegie Deli was eating fried ring bologna and eggs .
When I commented about how good the fried bologna looked , she told me to mind my own business .
Pointing at my camera , she also told me I should n't even think about taking a picture of her breakfast .
It did look good though .
Should you get the hankering this weekend , Katz 's on Westheimer does pastrami and eggs with a potato pancake and a bagel for just under ten bucks .
The New York Bagel Shop & Deli on Hillcroft sells a pastrami omelet for $ 6.60 .
( Tell Jay that Robb sent you . )
And Kenny & Ziggy's on Post Oak in the Galleria will serve you two fried eggs with hash browns and your choice of pastrami or fried bologna for ten bucks .

Four monkeys who escaped from cages at Hillsboro 's Oregon National Primate Research Center remained on the loose Saturday morning .
Workers were cleaning the monkeys ' cages at the lab , in east Hillsboro near 185th Avenue and Walker Road , on Friday afternoon when the animals escaped .
Around 6:30 p.m. Friday , the monkeys were seen near the Willow Creek Transit Center , which has a park and ride lot , MAX station and several bus stops .
According to a release from Oregon Health and Science University , which operates the lab , the animals pose little threat to humans but could bite if they feel threatened .
" The animals have not been tested to determine if they carry diseases that are low risk to them but higher risk to humans , " the release said .

Spring is here – the days are longer , warmer and suddenly there ’s sexy in the air .
And slight panic , as women everywhere realize that in just three short months their derrieres will be bare by the pool and on the beach .
Yes , it ’s bikini season , ladies , and while tightening and tanning is totally your business , I ’m happy to share with you a few of this season ’s sexy and stylish bikinis .
Because I believe the time is now to celebrate our bodies , and what better way to celebrate than to wear a bikini ?
Here are a few of my favorites :
Loyale Hermosa Bikini
This sweet , flirty suit is made of 100 % organic cotton and low impact dyes .
Soft and subtle , the top offers extra coverage via an empire - like elastic waist - line .
The sassy bottoms are just the right type of small , the “ not - too ” kind .
Great coverage and still oh - so - sexy .
The Hermosa is available in small and medium ( large is sold out ) at Beklina for $ 98 .
Meadow Red Luna Bamboo Bikini
Made of bamboo and organic cotton with 2 % spandex , the Red Luna is a slightly sophisticated bikini that says sporty with a touch of sweet .
This basic two - piece has a cute bow - tie over the booty .
Simple but definitely sexy , the Red Luna is available in XS - L at The Oko Box for $ 92 .
Nikster Earth Bikini
This suit has a Brazilian bottom ( a.k.a. itty bitty , teeny weeny ) with a bandeau top .
It is n’t for the modest or meek .
The Earth Bikini ’s special features are the bamboo rings perfectly placed on the hips and cleavage .
The rings are hardly a new idea , but I ’m never tired of their sassy implications .
It ’s made in the U.S. of bamboo , soy and organic cotton and comes in black or brown .
Find the Earth Bikini in XS - L ( top and bottom sized separately ) at Nikster for $ 120 .
Kelly B. Ruffled Wrap Bikini
This suit looks comfy without being frumpy and might be the perfect choice for those who like a more covered look .
It ’s sporty with a touch of girly .
The ruffly wrap - around halter top is the comfy I was referring to , and the bottoms have gathers in just the right spots .
It ’s fully lined and made of 90 % organic cotton with 10 % spandex .
The Ruffled Wrap Bikini comes in white and is available in XS , M and L at BTC Elements for $ 124 .
JungleGurl Mikaela Bikini
JungleGurl is the brainchild of former model Natalie Golonka , who makes her one - of - a- kind swimsuits from the recycled vintage garments collected during her travels .

It comes in a myriad of colorful and eye - catching fabrics and is available in sizes XS - L at JungleGurl for $ 220 .
Machja Organic Sirena Bikini
The Sirena Bikini makes a unique statement with its strapless top and boy - cut bottoms made of organic cotton and spandex .
I love the simple lines of this suit that say sexy , sporty and “ I ’m not your average bikini ” .
The Organic Sirena comes in cream with a pink floral print ( low impact dye , of course ! ) or blue with a dark blue print , both available in sizes S - L for $ 72 at The Oko Box .
Aaron Chang Rincon Paradise Bikini
This suit has a slider halter top and string - tie bottoms , both reversible in black or an ocean - blue print that ’s meant to mimic the surf .
The Rincon Paradise Bikini is polyester , but wait ” ¦it ’s eco kind , made using recycled plastic bottles .
Better in the bikini than floating in the ocean , do n’t you think ?
Available in S , M, L find it at Faeries Dance for $ 99 .
Anna Cohen Teal Triangle Bikini
What you see is what you get , with some added eco for ease of mind .
This simple , sexy swimsuit is made using leftover fabric from the manufacture of Olympic speed skater uniforms .
Nothing extra , nothing wasted , just a low - low rise bottom and a double - tie triangle top .
The Teal Triangle Bikini is available in small and medium at BTC Elements for $ 98 .
Tropi-Ties Butterfly Bikini
Here ’s another eye - catching and breathtaking summer suit , this one made from hemp , organic cotton and bamboo .
More bamboo rings on the top and bottom , as well as string - ties around the neck and back .
What I adore most is the cream - colored fabric with subtle but fabulous texture .
Even better , the Butterfly Bikini is on sale for $ 79 at Tropi-ties ( available in S - L ) .
I hope at least one of these suits appealed to your inner sexy , but more than that I hope yours is a summer full of self - celebration !

The United States ’ first Muslim congressman , Keith Ellison of Minnesota , was arrested about an hour ago along with seven other activists protesting the Muslim government of Sudan ’s expulsion of foreign aid agencies .
Remember when Virginia congressman Virgil Goode protested Ellison ’s decision to swear his oath of office on a Koran as a threat to American “ values and beliefs ” ?
( Not to mention the first step in what Goode predicted could be a Muslim conquest — by election ! — of America )
Looks like he ’s been vindicated now !
Because America WILL NOT STAND for protesting murderous , dictatorial regimes , no sir .
Sigh .
And if you think Goode was a lone kook , check out the shit Ellison has to deal with at home :
A report from the University of Minnesota ’s Humphrey Institute “ researched and written by Eric Ostermeier , suggested that Ellison ’s out - of - state contributions came from Muslims and asked , ‘ Who does Keith Ellison represent ? ’ ”
I think we know the answer today — evil Muslims in an insidious conspiracy to protect victims of Sudan ’s fundamentalist regime .
Will they stop at nothing ?

Is This Hockey Or The WWE ?
Total Pro Sports -
Last night in the WHL , the Tri-City Americans took on the Spokane Chiefs in a fight - filled affair .
The game ended in 5 - 2 win for Americans , but the real story was a huge brawl that erupted near the end of the third period .
“ Up 5 - 1 going into the third period , the game began to disintegrate at the 6:33 mark of the period .
As Ryan Letts joined the Spokane rush into the Tri-City zone , Letts ran into Pickard , who dropped to the ice .
Meanwhile , a melee ensued as things went downhill from there .
Pickard , who needed help off the ice went straight to the locker room and did not return .
Back - up Brett Martyniuk entered the game in his place and played the final 13:27 . ’ ” ( AMSHockey )
I enjoy a good hockey fight as much as the next guy , however I ’m starting to think that it is losing its place within the game .
This brawl could have been avoided because there is no reason to run a goalie late in a 5 - 1 game .
I think that if hockey ever wants to become bigger in the United States something has to be done about all the fighting .
If fights continue like this it will always be viewed in a negative way .

BBC News Magazine
The collective gasp that greeted Susan Boyle when she opened her mouth to sing suggests we think talent cannot exist without beauty .
Why ?
It 's unlikely Oscar Wilde would spend his Saturday evenings watching ITV1's Britain 's Got Talent , if alive today .
The writer and aesthete preferred beauty pageants to talent contests , and once famously remarked : " It is better to be beautiful than to be good , but it is better to be good than to be ugly . "
Susan Boyle is now an internet hit So who knows what he would have made of the audience rising to its feet to acclaim singer Susan Boyle , who has been unkindly described as " hairy angel " " ugly duckling " and " Shrek " .
When she walked on stage , it was as an unwelcome guest at the wrong party or , as psychologist Colin Gill puts it , like a real person in a puppet show .
With this vulnerability came the expectation that she would fail .
" Everybody was against you , " said one judge .
But three minutes and one standing ovation later , the middle - aged singer was a failure no more .
And within days she was an unlikely global star .
So has she changed the way society views beauty ?
Do n't bet on it , says Ellis Cashmore , author of Celebrity / Culture , who says in an ideal world it would n't even be a news story because Boyle 's voice would be all that mattered .
TALE OF THE UGLY DUCKLING
Boyle taps into the way we want to think being good is what counts , says Gill ' It 's the message of the Ugly Duckling , that if you have got what it takes within you , then the external does n't matter '
' Boyle demonstrated her internal " swanness " of character despite her Ugly Duckling appearance '
" Every time someone watches her their reaction is 'is n't it amazing that someone who looks like that can sound like that ? '
" The astonishment we feel re-enforces the belief that there exists not only a correlation between looks and success but a causal relationship .
One causes the other .
" The Hollywood movie industry figured that out in the 1940s , that you do n't need to act that well as long as you look good .
The very fact that we are astonished by Susan Boyle makes it an oddity , so it wo n't break down barriers , it will have the opposite effect . "
Under the knife
When the likes of Boyle come along - and before her Rik Waller and Michelle McManus - the public accept them only as curio pieces , he says , and as odd characters .
Twenty years ago , Alison Moyet 's size was hardly mentioned , but since then appearance has become more important on screen , partly because society is bombarded far more by pictures of beautiful people , says Cashmore .
Are soaps today more glossy ?
Soap operas like Emmerdale ( the farm failed to survive the makeover ) and Coronation Street feature far more good - looking actors than before .
The message is that beauty and fame / success are linked and to that end , more people are going under the knife for surgery .
But the concept of physical beauty is not fixed , so while some people in the West pursue a tan , people in the Far East might avoid it .
And while blond hair and blue eyes may draw envy in one country , another might rank wide hips and big bottoms as more desirable .
One reason why good looks may be linked to success in people 's minds is that it can be a reality .
Many studies conclude that better - looking people are given positive personality traits by others , the so - called halo effect .
The impact is that they earn more money ( about 12 % on average ) , are happier , more popular and more likely to be acquitted in court .
THE BENEFITS OF GOOD LOOKS Earn 12 % more ( Univ of California , 2007 ) Judged more positively ( Langlois , 2000 ) Rated happier and more successful ( Dion , 1972 ) More likely to be acquitted by jurors ( Sigall & Ostrave , 1975 ) Pass more job interviews ( Dipboye , Arvey & Terpstra , 1977 ) But while they tend to get the most opportunities in society , in careers and in relationships , after this initial advantage they have to prove themselves , says Ingrid Collins , consultant psychologist at the London Medical Centre .
And the reason they have this advantage is an evolutionary one .
" It 's a natural animal law of selection and looks are the first signal of having good genes .
" Whichever lucky person fits the received wisdom of the day that says they have beauty then they are the ones most likely to be sought after to produce the next generation .
" So with a cat in the wild , it might be the one who can run the fastest and fight the best .
But humans have worked out how to survive , with our homes and our televisions and phones , so that is n't such an important attribute any more .
And we look for different concepts to elevate . "
First impressions
In the fast pace of the modern world , people are assessed on appearance within a blink of an eye , says body language expert Judi James .
" It 's called cognitive algebra - people do little sums and make assumptions about people and make attributions .
It 's part of our survival instincts and has always occurred .
But it used to take 10 seconds to sum up someone and now it 's a tenth of a second .
" It 's based on very complex information that the brain takes in but we do n't bother to analyse it .
If we did , we would realise that just because Susan Boyle does n't pluck her eyebrows , that does n't mean she can't sing . "
People viewed as ugly draw unfair assumptions from others , she says , because back in the time of contagious diseases , it was a sign of ill - health - bad skin , deformed facial features and an unhealthy body size .
Yet it 's not all about looks .
Height is just as important as the face , says James , and you only need to look at how tall world leaders are to see the proof - Nicolas Sarkozy excepted .
NOT PRETTY ?
FAKE IT Breathe out before entering a room Keep shoulders back Iron out facial expressions Keep right hand free for a firm handshake Make eye contact Listen Don't be too familiar or over - friendly Source : Judi James
And while the workplace is a beauty contest of sorts , there are limits .
Being very good - looking can count against you , especially if you win a promotion , because you could be considered vain or unintelligent , says James .
Anyway , ordinary - looking people can fake it , she says , through showing confidence in themselves , by having good listening skills , making eye contact and making other people feel special .
" It 's all a bit of a con act and about giving off the right vibe .
We are drawn to people who have the confidence without the arrogance . "
Amid the applause for Boyle was an acknowledgement that ironically , no - one better demonstrates that quality of being happy in their own skin than her .
And that 's what makes her attractive , regardless of how she looks .
Below is a selection of your comments .
If our attraction to good looking people was indeed the " natural animal law of selection " at work , one wonders why the planet is n't populated with pretty people .
A walk around your local shopping mall will lay the lie to this specious bit of evolutionary science .
Newsflash :
On the beauty continuum one will find most of the human race closer in appearance to Susan Boyle than Angelina Jolie .
Aaron Herald , Phoenix , Az The fact that a plain * female * had the audacity to get on stage and show what she could do seems to have caused this stir .
I do n't remember anyone making such a fuss when Paul Potts got up on stage , sang his heart out on a certain talent show and went on to win it .
They referred to him working in a mobile phone shop , but no one mentioned his looks .
It 's a bit like the rules for TV newsreaders .
Looks do n't matter if you 're a man , but if you 're a woman , you do n't figure or you 're no longer required after a certain age .
Fi , Gloucestershire , UK
To swim a little against the stream here , I do n't see what 's so amazing about her voice .
The difference between Susan Boyle and half the choir singers in choirs and churches around the country is that she was on the TV the other week .
The miracle is n't that someone who is n't traditionally gorgeous can sing , it 's that she was allowed to get up on a stage in front of a TV camera .
Judie , Inverness , Scotland Judie , the real difference between Susan Boyle and half the choir singers in choirs and churches around the country was that she believed in herself , applied to the show and was accepted .
She made it onto TV because of her talent ( and of course the surprise that she was n't one of the usual crazies ) .
Applaud her for trying and succeeding , rather than reducing it by complaining about the x thousands who did n't get off their backsides to apply , or think it 's beneath them .
Tony , Liverpool
The first world Idol competition was won by " hobbit " Kurt Nilsen - has anybody outside Norway heard of him since ?
Having an extraordinary talent is simply not enough any more .
Would Elton John or Freddy Mercury make it if they tried to break into show business today ?
Laurie Skjelten , Trondheim , Norway People seem to have forgotten that Paul Potts ' appearance WAS commented on - Simon Cowell 's first comment at Paul 's audition was " I was n't expecting THAT ! " .
Why ?
Because Paul did n't fit the stereotype of someone who could sing .
He looked set to fail .
His creased suit and broken teeth were much debated at the time .
I 'm delighted to see that he now has a world - wide career , with great suits and a good dentist .
Susan 's voice is of such quality that you have to wonder if it is just her appearance that has prevented her from being discovered previously .
Shallow , shallow people to have made such judgements .
Andrea McCulloch , Newton Aycliffe , County Durham
It 's not just beauty though is it ?
It 's youth as well .
People seem to assume that older people have little to offer and prefer smooth - featured children to populate our screens and " entertain " us .
This seems to apply more to women than to men so I suppose Susan Boyle 's talent was doubly shocking .
Good on her .
Lesley , Hope Valley
A case in point was the young girl chosen to sing at the Olympics last year who turned out only to be miming , as the the little girl who actually sang the song was n't deemed pretty enough to be seen in front of the world 's cameras .
Why not ?
Is n't beauty in the eye of the beholder anymore ?
Janice , South Lanarkshire
We do n't just judge people by how they look but how they " care " to look .
The same person can look wildly different - witness Judi Dench in Notes on a Scandal v her red carpet glamour .
So someone who does n't seem to make any effort with their appearance we expect , by extension , not to be a person who would make much effort in anything else - which is clearly wrong .
And yes , schools can still be complicit in enforcing this misconception .
Constantly casting the same good - looking kids in leading roles does n't encourage anyone else to make much effort with what life has dealt them .
Karen , New Malden Does anyone remember Jim , the Neighbours actor ?
He had a beautiful voice , and he , himself , commented on his ugliness and his voice differing from his face .
Corlyss Morrel , Springfield , Illinois Absolutely spot on .
I watched Susan Boyle and admit to opening my mouth wide in surprise when she began to sing .
Does that make me shallow ?
Possibly ( but I would hope not ) .
It 's a shame that looks are valued more than personality and ability .
Mandy , London I think people have missed the point with Miss Boyle .
The surprise factor was created by the fact that she looked like one of the many socially inept whack jobs this show and others like it wheel out every so often to give us a laugh .
Beauty has nothing to do with it .
John Bush , Oldham I was embarrassed by the reaction of the presenters , judges and audience when Ms Boyle went on stage .
They were laughing at her .
Cruel and unjustified .
Their shock at her immense talent and ability to interpret a song was all the more distasteful when it was due to her not being a beauty .
What a sad , shallow and dysfunctional society we have become .
It is n't too many years ago that looks were n't so important .
Can anyone say that Mick Jagger would have been in a modern day boy - band ( would he want to be - but that 's a different question ) , and what about some of the most influential and important singers and performers , such as world famous opera singers .
If we weeded out talent on a scale of gorgeousness before we accepted it just think of the massive gaps in our cultural history .
Fi Exon , Cumbria
I watched her performance and was amazed that she was a fantastic singer .
However , it was n't down to her looks that I judged she would n't be , rather the way she spoke and the topics she discussed beforehand that led me to believe she was a bit of a simple yokel .
Adam Clarke , Lincoln , Lincolnshire Adam , so you mean a simple yokel could n't sing either ?
I see ...
Prometheus , London
The worship of beauty and celebrity are the primary sicknesses of our culture .
This also proves that both American Idol and Britain 's Got Talent are not singing competitions , but performance and popularity contents .
A true singing competition would be held on the radio , not television , with the appearance of the contestants ( including their real names ) hidden from the voting audience .
Larry -T , Montgomery Village , MD Aside from Ms Boyle , the pictures of the " stars " in the heading of this piece are exhibiting the ' just groomed ' look .
All are excessively bronzed ( probably fake ) , dyed hair , curled or straightened .
It says more about their stylists than the people themselves .
John , London , UK
If a slim , big - breasted big - haired blond woman with full makeup came out you would n't expect her to be a genius at mental arithmetic .
So , sometimes being " attractive " can go against people .
I think the general message is that people make split - second judgements about someone 's personality based on the way they look - this is not something that can be helped , most people do n't even realise they 're doing it until it 's too late !
Natasha , Kent I 've often marvelled at how people assume that the girl with the prettiest face has the most talent , no matter what field of expertise we 're talking about .
This is often instilled in us even as children in primary school .
I 'm not ashamed to say that I 'm not pretty , and as a 7 or 8 year old , found it very demoralising that when we auditioned for school plays , I would always be second shepherd while every year , the blond , slim girl would be the star part , usually Mary .
This was made all the worse when every year , I and other average looking pupils would sing or act a lot better than the pretty ones .
This attitude is still having a huge influence on my life and the lives of everyone around me .
Heather , Willenhall Heather , as a primary school teacher I can tell you honestly that we do n't pick children for parts on the basis of their looks OR their talent .
It 's mostly down to who can be relied upon to learn their lines , speak up nice and loud , and not pick their nose whilst on stage .
For nativity plays especially , angels are nearly always children who can't sit still for two minutes ( they 're only on stage for a minimal amount of time ) , and Mary and Joseph are always the quietest children in the class who wo n't chat to their friends during the performance .
Niki , Birmingham
I have to say that I 'm instantly suspicious of very attractive people - I always assume that they 'll be vacuous and dull as they wo n't have had to develop a personality .
I 've been proved wrong on lots of occasions , so I suppose it does work both ways .
Susie , London
The entertainment industry has been dominated by looks ever since time immemorial .
So having the judges and the audience gawking at Susan Boyle 's performance was hardly surprising .
Kelly Brook's , a member on the panel of judges , herself is a product of that very same Barbie trend .
It 's either a 36 - 24 - 36 for women or a near Hulk - like physique that sells these days , be it a pop single or a long - drawn soap opera .
I for one quite do n't think talent = beauty .
Beauty = a fad , here today gone tomorrow .
Talent is something altogether different , something you are really remembered for long after your time .
Funny real music does n't sell via a two - bit music video .
Hat 's off to Susan Boyle who faced all these odds and yet bashed on regardless .
Eric Arakel , Manchester Perhaps some of us are a little disingenuous in that we hope the attractive contestant has the better talent as it is they that we wish to SEE again in the following rounds .

Research led by the University of Warwick has found a way to use doughnut shaped by - products of quantum dots to slow and even freeze light , opening up a wide range of possibilities from reliable and effective light - based computing to the possibility of " slow glass . "
The key to this new research is the “ exciton . ”
This describes the pairing of an electron that has been kicked into a higher energy state by a photon , with a hole or gap it ( or another electron ) leaves within the shell or orbit around the nucleus of an atom .
Despite its new high energy state , the electron remains paired with one of the holes or positions that has been vacated by electrons moving to a higher energy state .
When an electron ’s high energy state decays again , it is drawn back to the hole it is linked to and a photon is once again emitted .
That cycle usually happens very quickly , but if one could find a way to freeze or hold an exciton in place for any length of time , one could delay the reemitting of a photon and effectively slow or even freeze light .
The researchers , led by PhD researcher Andrea Fischer and Dr. Rudolf A. Roemer from the University of Warwick ’s Department of Physics , looked at the possibilities presented by some tiny rings of matter accidentally made during the manufacture quantum dots .
When creating these very small quantum dots of a few 10 - 100nm in size , physicists sometimes cause the material to splash when depositing it onto a surface , leaving not a useful dot , but a doughnut - shaped ring of material .
Though originally created by accident , these “ Aharonov - Bohm nano rings ” are now a source of study in their own right , and in this case seemed just the right size for enclosing an exciton .
However , simply being this useful size does not , in itself , allow them to contain or hold an exciton for any length of time .
However , remarkably the Warwick led research team have found that if a combination of magnetic and electric fields is applied to these nano - rings , they can actually then simply tune the electric field to freeze an exciton in place or let it collapse and re-emit a photon .
While other researchers have used varying exotic states of matter to dramatically slow the progress of light , this is the first time a technique has been devised to completely freeze and release individual photons at will .
Dr Roemer said : “ This has significant implications for the development of light based computing which would require an effective and reliable mechanism such as this to manipulate light . “
The technique could also be used to develop a “ buffer ” of incoming photons which could re-release them in sequence at a later date , thus creating an effect not unlike the concept of “ Slow Glass ” first suggested by science fiction author Bob Shaw several decades ago .
The new research paper is entitled “ Exciton storage in a nanoscale Aharonov - Bohm ring with electric field tuning , " by University of Warwick PhD student Andrea M. Fischer , Dr Rudolf Roemer ( University of Warwick ) Vivaldo L. Campo Jr. ( Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos - UFSCar , Brazil ) , and Mikhail E. Portnoi ( University of Exeter ) , and has just been published in Physical Review Letters ( PRL ) .

Hey look !
Amazon has a new book sales policy .
The policy , instated today , spontaneously transformed many books about LGBT issues into " adult " titles , and therefore no longer includes them in the " Best Sellers " lists / rankings .
UPDATED
Advertisement
Search functionality is also affected , allegedly , as the banned books will not show up in search even when the exact name is entered .
From LiveJournal user and Amazon Advantage member Mark Probst 's entry on the censorship of gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered reading material ( Note : Amazon 's PR response was bolded by the author of the diary entry ) :
On Amazon.com two days ago , mysteriously , the sales rankings disappeared from two newly - released high profile gay romance books : " Transgressions " by Erastes and " False Colors " by Alex Beecroft .
Everybody was perplexed .
Was it a glitch of some sort ?
The very next day HUNDREDS of gay and lesbian books simultaneously lost their sales rankings , including my book " The Filly . "
There was buzz , What 's going on ?
Does Amazon have some sort of campaign to suppress the visibility of gay books ?
Is it just a major glitch in the system ?
Many of us decided to write to Amazon questioning why our rankings had disappeared .
Most received evasive replies from customer service reps not versed in what was happening .
As I am a publisher and have an Amazon Advantage account through which I supply Amazon with my books , I had a special way to contact them .
24 hours later I had a response :
In consideration of our entire customer base , we exclude " adult " material from appearing in some searches and best seller lists .
Since these lists are generated using sales ranks , adult materials must also be excluded from that feature .
Hence , if you have further questions , kindly write back to us .

Well , happy Easter everyone !
As the author notes later in his journal , Harold Rollins ' and Jackie Collins ' steamy romance novels remain unaffected .
A quick Twitter search on the current Amazon hashtag protest #amazonfail revealed that lesbian parenting books are also banned from search and best seller lists , yet Sex and the City the movie is not ( but the book is ! ) .

Truly , a PR clusterfuck for the ages .
P.S. - With the new filter in place , a 5:40 p.m. EST search on " homosexuality " over at Amazon search turned up nothing but , well , mostly anti-homosexuality garbage .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 " 8 K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Update 2 : The system by which books are banned and which ones remain is something akin to Amazon randomly reaching into a Scrabble bag and throwing out whatever tiles they can get ahold of .
Except all the titles are LGBT books .

When you work in the software industry , either in the services sector , or in the products sector , you never get to see the harmony , the cooperation and the amiability that , you find in the Free Software Community .
I am not claiming that , it is all friendly , harmonious and amiable , but you get to feel it very often , and in quite a lot of communities , and when you do , it is bliss .
I had earlier written on the monetary aspects of Free Software development .
Today I will share one of my personal experiences in getting a feel of the bliss mentioned above .
Free Software Community is fundamentally a meritocracy where you get judged by your contribution and your capability .
It is not that people are ruthless and look only from the meritocratic perspective .
On the contrary people are normally ready to help you while you are out there .
When you face problems somebody would guide you towards a solution .
Experts will normally help you move in the path towards expertise .
When you make mistakes people will criticize you , but then they will also tell you how to rectify your errors , and would probably also help you rectify your errors .
It is all fundamentally a philosophy of sharing - sharing knowledge , sharing capability .
In a typical meritocracy there is no place for weaklings .
But in Free Software newbies are normally guided towards expertise provided they stay in the loop .
At Zyxware we have had the opportunity to get a feel of this process first hand .
When we set up our site www.zyxware.com, we wanted some way for our visitors to subscribe to the comments that they post on the site .
We had used Drupal to set up the site and we found a module comment_notify that did almost what we wanted but not quite .
The module allowed people to subscribe to all comments to any given article .
So if I was a visitor and I comment on an article , I would get notifications for every comment that was posted under the article .
We felt that we wanted something more targeted and less email - intensive than the above strategy .
We wanted a module that sends out notifications to the authors of comments , only for replies to their comments .
Additionally the comment_notify module required users to be logged on to be able to subscribe to the comments , but we wanted anonymous users also to be able to subscribe to comments .
The module comment_notify was not being maintained by its author and we wanted our feature fast .
Zyxware.com was on shared hosting and we had very intensive commenting happening on our site and hence we could not afford to have too many notifications sent out per hour .
Since there was no other ready to go module with the features that we wanted we hacked the comment_notify module and created a comment_subscribe module that did just what we wanted .
Like is wont with us , we contributed the module back to the community and it was accepted by drupal.org as a module .
Surprisingly the module became reasonably very popular because it looked like people were looking for such features .
It was around this time that we organized the one week long GNU Linux Install Fest in Technopark and then right away after that the Freedom Walk campaign .
In the ensuing hurry - burry we failed to monitor the Issue queue of comment subscribe module and issues started piling up .
It was at this time that one of the very active contributors to the Drupal project Greg Knaddison and the author of the extremely popular Pathauto module came across the sad status of the comment subscribe issue queue .
Now comes one beautiful aspect of Free Software .
If the developer of a software stops developing it and the software is good , somebody will take up the development and continue the good work .
Greg Knaddison a.k. a greggles took up the responsibility of the comment_notify module since that was the original module and started solving the problems in the issue queue one by one .
By the time I came back on scene and realized the issue greggles had done massive upgradation to the comment_notify module and the development on the project was going smooth .
After I came back from Freedom Walk we resumed the support of comment_subscribe module and greggles once again suggested that we stop duplicating our efforts and join hands together for the comment_notify module .
He had earlier suggested it once during the initial stages of the comment_subscribe module .
At this point of time the only feature in comment_subscribe that was not supported in comment_notify was the support for notification on threaded comments .
Support for anonymous commenting was already implemented by Greg .
Here comes another beautiful aspect of Free Software .
We had two options - one was to compete with comment_notify and continue on the development of comment_subscribe , the second was to merge the two modules and combine efforts on comment_notify .
There are good instances in the Free Software world where you can see both of the above options being invoked .
In fact when Greg came to us with the suggestion to merge , our original response was in the negative .
But Dave Reid , another active Drupal user / developer , took the initiative to come back to us and requested to merge comment_subscribe and comment_notify , after we had rejected the initial suggestion and , ultimately his logic made sense to us .
We were wasting effort on an almost duplicate module where as we could join forces and focus on building a top class module .
We finally decided to merge our comment_subscribe module with comment_notify and let Greg know about this .
He was very happy about this decision and together with him we created a plan of action to merge .
The idea was to first make sure that comment_notify had the capability of sending notifications on threaded comments .
We volunteered to implement this feature .
We created a patch and then sent it to Greg who then took the effort to go through the code and let us know of some of the drupal coding standards that we were incorrectly following .
This is yet another beautiful aspect of Free Software development .
Over IRC he specifically guided me on the areas where we were making mistakes .
We then recreated the patch twice before he gave us the clean chit .
Creating the patch was a learning experience in itself because it helped us learn more clearly the nuances of the Drupal coding standards .
Recently Greg let us know that he will be integrating the patch soon and we have decided to start working on an update to the comment_subscribe module that will allow users to migrate to comment_notify seamlessly .
We have also volunteered to ajax - ify the comment subscription part so that readers can subscribe to comments without additional page loads .
So if all goes well and we merge the two modules together , we will have gone the complete cycle of branching , developing , supporting and merging back - the better of the two options mentioned above .
Through this process we were also able to experience first hand some of the beautiful aspects of Free Software development .
[ digg - reddit - me ] Barack Obama ’s incipient presidency has set off a furious debate over what his administration ’s principles are .
George Will described Obama ’s administration on this past Sunday morning as the Third Wave of government intervention and expansion ( with FDR ’s New Deal and LBJ ’s Great Society being the first two .
Will , for some reason , declined to mention TR ’s introduction of the regulatory state , as does almost everyone . )
Right - wingers from Rush Limbaugh to Sarah Palin have described Barack Obama as a “ socialist . ”
Meaghan McCain and Niall Ferguson deride what they characterize as a leftist agenda .
On the other hand , supporters of Barack Obama ’s candidacy have criticized him for betraying his progressive vision and defending the status quo .
Others have defended him against charges of socialism and suggested he stands for good old - fashioned liberalism .
At this moment in history , as capitalism seems to have failed , as American international power is at an ebb , as globalization seems destined to continue , as the threat of terrorism continues to grow – evident both in our vulnerability and in the number of our enemies , as the nation - state which derives its legitimacy from providing for the needs of its citizens seems to be evolving into a market - state which is legitimated by the opportunities it offers its citizens – at this moment in history , Barack Obama has become president .
The liberalism I am attempting to describe in this post is merely a sketch – but it is a sketch of what I see to be the right approach in this world – which as I have commented before , seems to have much in common with what I identified in the summer of 2007 as the Obama approach .
As liberalism tends to be pragmatic rather than theoretical , many of these principles have regained prominence most specifically in response to recent problems in the world and with the Bush administration .
I am focusing here on those aspects of principles which distinguish liberalism from other political philosophies – specifically , progressivism , various leftist movements , conservatives , libertarians , and extreme right - wingers .
Here are the 10 principles of liberalism – whose three goals are to allow individuals liberty , opportunity , and community .
Doubt v. Action .
These two competing impulses are at the heart of all the rest of these principles .
A Hayekian doubt about the efficacy of centralized planning coupled with a Rooseveltian ( TR or FDR ) need to act – to conduct “ bold , persistent experimentation ” while acknowledging that our “ grasp on the truth is always provisional . ”
This balance was best articulated by Reinhold Niebuhr who wrote that while “ We must exercise our power , ” we must be remain aware that power corrupts even ourselves .
Hayek similarly explained that “ we needed to think of the world more as gardeners tending a garden and less as architects trying to build some system . ”
Liberalism was never utopian , but today ’s liberalism has been tempered by the failures of big - state liberalism – as well as the failures of anti-regulatory “ free ” market fetishism .
Only conservatism , properly defined historically , attempts a similar balance .
The Market & the Government .
Contemporary liberals reject the doctrinaire distinction between the “ market ” and the government that animated so much of the conflict in the 20th century .
The free market should not be treated as some theoretical utopian ideal or as a perpetually lost state of innocence .
And the government is not some evil force which must be reduced until it is of a size that it “ could be drowned in a bathtub . ”
Rather the government and the free market exist together – and in a capitalist republic such as ours , each is dependent on the other .
The free market does not exist in a state of nature but must be created by and maintained by the society and the state which provide the values and the rules and other conditions without which a market cannot be free .
In other words , a free market is a product of a just government .
Empower individuals .
One of the key roles of government then – in creating a free market – is to empower individuals to participate in market freely , as individuals .
A market is less than free if employees can be held hostage by large corporations and health care burdens .
To empower individuals then , the government must ensure that there is sufficient technological and transportational infrastructure ; the government must ensure that basic needs can be met by individuals – for example access to health care ; and the government must ensure that every individual has the opportunity to get an education .
At the same time , individuals must be empowered to shape and control government more directly .
Liberalism in a market - state must exhibit a preference for the individual over the corporation and government and must empower individuals against bullying and coercive measures of these large institutions .
Predictability & stability .
Government in a market - state must be predictable and the economy and society must be stable .
Neither of these is an absolute good – both are contingent goods – as without predictability and stability , economic growth is impeded and liberty is impossible .
Related concepts are sustainability and resilience .
Reform .
( Not revolution . )
Liberalism has embraced a policy of reform – presuming that the status quo is not perfect yet acknowledging that rapid change could lead to worse .
Reform is the balance liberalism strikes between stability and progress .
This distinguishes them from conservatives who embrace the status quo over any change ( standing athwart history yelling stop ! ) and leftists and right - wingers who embrace revolutions of various types to overthrow the current order as fundamentally wrong .
The focus on reform is informed by the balance between doubt and action .
Perhaps the best understanding of what reform means for a liberal can be found in Nassim Nicholas Taleb ’s advocation of the word “ tinkering . ”
Preventing destabilizing concentrations of power and encouraging fair processes of distribution .
Liberalism acknowledges that power tends to become concentrated – sometimes in particular branches of the government ( for example , in the presidency in the unitary executive theory ) ; sometimes in corporations ( as they become too big to fail ) ; sometimes in a particular class of individuals ( as they control more and more wealth . )
Liberalism sees that such concentrations of power are incompatible with democracy and liberty – and that while such concentrations of power will empower certain individuals – they do so at the expense of most people .
While socialists and communists and other utopians believe equality must be created – liberals merely seek to prevent extreme concentrations of power in the hands of any minority .
At the same time , as Confucius said , “ In a country well governed poverty is something to be ashamed of .
In a country badly governed wealth is something to be ashamed of . ”
Which is why liberals must ensure that power is distributed through a fair process .
Political power has been distributed by a constitutional order that needs to be tweaked now and then – and sometimes shaken up , as with the abolition of slavery .
Economic power similarly is distributed in a market that sometimes is entirely unjust – as pollution imposes costs on some that are paid by others ; and of course with the issue of slavery again .
Government must step in to ensure that such unfair practices are not allowed .
The goal is not to prevent someone like Bill Gates from having so much wealth , as his wealth is small enough to pose little threat to stability no matter what he does ( almost ) – it is to prevent 75 % of the power from being controlled by 5 % of the population – which does pose such a threat .
The Rule of Law .
Liberals embrace the fact that our nation was founded “ as a nation of laws , not men ” and that laws , while sometimes inconvenient are the foundation of our social bargain .
Our leaders swear to uphold the law and to remain subject to it .
That means if say , a President authorizing wiretapping in direct contravention of federal law , then he must be prosecuted .
Aid to the disadvantaged .
Liberals believe in the moral principle that a society and a government cannot be judged without taking into account how it deals with the disadvantaged – especially those who are disadvantaged as a result of the inevitable flaws in the system we choose to embrace .
Liberals subscribe to the idea that “ A nation ’s greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members . ”
First among equals .
Liberals acknowledge that America has often been and remains a force for good in the world – but they believe that it detracts from this when it considers itself unrestrained by any law or treaty and unilaterally imposes its will .
This creates instability and unpredictability – as well as encouraging other nations to form collectives against us and to obtain weapons of mass destruction to prevent an invasion and provoke a standoff .
Instead , liberals see that America has been most effective and done the most good when it acted as “ first among equals ” in the community of nations .
As technologicaland macro-economic forces have been rapidly decentralizing power , America remains the single most potent force in a non-polar world – but it detracts from it ’s power when it acts alone and delegitimizes the trust the world has given it to act responsibly .
Diversity and federalism .
Liberals – embracing their fallibility as human beings , and acknowledging that their grasp of the truth is always provisional – embrace diversity and federalism .
Diverse viewpoints , diverse cultural , cultural , economic , etc. backgrounds all should be welcome and protected so long as they do not attempt to impose their specific view on those not willing .
This is why liberals must embrace federalism – which has traditionally been a conservative principle .
Liberals seem to be embracing the idea of federalism – at least with regards to the issues of gay marriage and medical marijuana .

Hands scraped and bloody from climbing two barbed - wire fences and out of breath from a half - mile sprint , James Clithero called 9 - 1 - 1 about 5 p.m.
Thursday from a stranger 's home in Southeast Portland .
He was reporting that his boss had just gunned down a co-worker .
" I was in there working today and my boss came downstairs and started firing a gun at one of the employees , " he told the dispatcher .
Portland police responded in force , scrambling officers in nine patrol cars to the scene , the Art Heads custom picture framing warehouse in the 5000 block of Southeast 18th Avenue , said Mary Wheat , a Portland Police Bureau spokeswoman .
But when officers cautiously approached the business with rifles and shotguns in hand , they were surprised by what they saw : Four men playing football .
Thirty minutes later , after police left , the boss and co-owner , Chad Paranto , 35 , and three workers stood in the business 's gravel parking lot , shaken but somewhat amused .
They explained that the shooting was a prank , like a version of the MTV practical - joke show " Punk'd . "
Clithero , 24 , had walked into the warehouse to do some cleaning when he saw Paranto appearing to argue with another employee .
" He was yelling at me about a screwed - up order , " said the supposed victim , who declined to give his name .
The staged argument escalated and Paranto pulled out a gun , pointed it at the man and shot him .
Or so Clithero thought .
The weapon was nothing more than a cap gun .
Clithero immediately bolted into the rail yards next to the warehouse .
He climbed two fences and a few minutes later was crouched behind a van in the driveway of a home in the 4200 block of Southeast 24th Avenue , about a half - mile away .
The homeowner spotted Clithero with blood on his hands and let him into his home .
" My hand 's cut and it 's bleeding from the razor wire , " he said on the 9 - 1 - 1 tape .
As Clithero began to catch his breath , he identified Paranto as the shooter but began to suspect he might not know all the facts .
" I feel like something was going on there .
I do n't know what , " he said .
" But I feel like I was the only person there who did n't know what was going on . "
" ( Paranto's ) a really nice guy , he 's a good boss .
I have no idea why this happened .
He 's like my favorite boss at any job that I 've had . "
Friday afternoon , Paranto said the employees at Art Heads often play practical jokes .
" We like to have fun in the shop and horse around , " he said .
" It keeps up morale . "
Wheat said police did not cite any of the men in the incident .
As for Clithero , he was resting Friday afternoon from his injuries , a family member said .
And Paranto said he posted large signs around the warehouse Friday : " No Horseplay . "

ACLU : Texas border security funds mismanaged ACLU : Millions for Texas border security misused
Millions of dollars budgeted by the state to beef up security along Texas ’ border with Mexico has been misdirected toward routine police activities and has done little to combat drug trafficking or potential terrorism as the Legislature intended , the American Civil Liberties Union said Wednesday .
In its report , the ACLU evaluated the activities of 11 of the 40 local law enforcement agencies that have participated in Operation Border Star , a program for which the Legislature appropriated $ 110 million two years ago .
“ As a law enforcement program , Operation Border Star has been a failure because it encourages police and sheriff ’s departments to measure their success based on everyday policing activities like disorderly conduct , ” said Laura Martin , an ACLU policy analyst .
“ It therefore takes the focus from the program ’s intended goal of fighting ( drug ) cartel violence and organized crime . ”
According to the report , the Val Verde County Sheriff ’s Department searched 851 vehicles during 83 days of participation in the program , resulting in only one substantial drug seizure , 623 pounds of marijuana , and no asset forfeitures .
The report also noted that police in the small border communities of La Joya and Sullivan City combined to make 9,576 traffic stops — one for about each resident of the two towns — as part of Operation Border Star .
The stops resulted in 3,314 traffic citations and 5,387 warnings .
“ Operation Border Star ’s performance measures encourage participating agencies to engage in law enforcement activities that do not further the state ’s goal of improving statewide public safety and protecting Texas from organized crime , ” said Rebecca Bernhardt , the ACLU ’s Texas policy director .
The report , Martin acknowledged , is based on agencies that were provided only about $ 5 million of the $ 110 million .
Katherine Cesinger , a spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Perry , said the findings are n’t an accurate representation : “ The governor is confident that Operation Border Star and the state ’s border security efforts are working . ”

The sparrow that turned a village shop into an ashtray after taking a lit cigarette to its nest
Playing with fire :
The sparrow had collected cigarette ends to line his nest with ( file picture )
When the village store went up in flames , owner Paul Sheriff was at a loss to explain how it had happened .
But eventually a little bird told him the truth .
Insurance investigators concluded that a sparrow must have picked up a smouldering cigarette butt and deposited it among the dry twigs of its nest under the eaves .
The resulting conflagration caused £ 250,000 of damage at Crescent Stores in Leasingham , near Sleaford , Lincolnshire .
Initial investigations found no gas or electrical faults , but 35 cigarette ends were eventually found in various sparrows ’ nests in the roof .
Mr Sheriff , 48 , a non-smoker , said : ‘ It ’s a pity really because I like seeing birds around the place but to think one of these pesky sparrows took a cigarette end onto the roof and caused all this damage is amazing .
Up in smoke :
The blaze caused by the nest - building sparrow caused £ 250,000 in damage
‘ At the end of the day , what is done is done .
It ’s a busy shop and people jump out of their cars , drop their cigarette ends on the floor and come in to buy a packet of fags .
' I do n’t know whose cigarette end it was but the chances of it being mine are nil .
I suppose that ’s something . ’
Mr Sheriff , who has owned the business for eight years , said he escaped thanks to a customer who alerted him to the fire .
‘ I was serving in the shop when he ran in and told me I had to get out because the shop was on fire .
‘ The roof had disappeared and the upstairs flat had gone .
I ’d only just decorated the flat and everything was fine up there .
‘ The shop was a total mess .
All the suspended ceilings came down , all the electrics were down , all the fridges were broken , it was horrendous .
Evidence : Around 35 cigarette butts were found in nests on the roof of the shop
' The fire brigade came out but came to no conclusion about how it started .
' Then the forensic investigator from the insurance company , AXA , told me he had enough evidence to conclude that it was a sparrow that took up a cigarette end into the roof . ’
An AXA spokesman said : ‘ We believe it ’s the first case of its kind we ’ve ever had to deal with .
We had to bring in a specialist to investigate .
‘ I ’ve certainly never come across this sort of thing before .
It ’s strange to think how such a little bird armed with such a small object could cause such chaos . ’
Mr Sheriff , who lives with his wife Sharon in a pub they run in the same village , finally cleared up and managed to reopen the shop six weeks after the blaze .
A reader writes :
I was raised in a virulently Mormon community .
I served two years as a missionary , but left the faith soon after returning home .
My first encounter with herb was in Taiwan in 1994 , with some friends over the holidays .
That first high was simply amusing , but I continued to used cannabis over the years .
While in Banares , India , I smoked Bhang and talked religion with a wandering Sadhu .
In Goa , southern India , I rolled spliffs with a crowd of East Germans .
I arrived late to the Camel festival in Pushkar , Rajasthan .
All the rooms were sold out , and I was graciously given the personal quarters of a hotel owner .
We spent many evenings over the next two weeks conversing .
He would bring in a bit of hash , and we would puff and talk - a better cultural exchange I cannot imagine .
I was in Jamaica and in my quest for the perfect cup of coffee visited the famous Blue Mountain .
While I was there I was invited to smoke ganja with some traditional Rastafari .
One of our party - a 60 something woman from London who had never smoked before and decided it was time to try - was convinced by the sincerity of our guests .
The experience that day is still vivid in my mind .
I 've been through Anchorage , Key West , Seattle , Tucson , Salt Lake City , and everywhere I go I find that people enjoy lighting up and settling down , into conversation .
In short , in each place I 've traveled I 'm confronted by the availability of herb .
People like it , and for strangers , it is one of the best barrier - breakers I 've yet to encounter .
Last week I wrote about the first part of my talk to the Bellevue Kiwanis Club on why our economy is in the position it is today .
It is a story about good intentioned policies – like modifying credit scoring for Americans working in a cash - economy – that were bastardized in the execution – like some Americans using modified credit scoring to lie about their income .
Just like there were superstar firms among the original “ junk bond ” companies , there were also firms like Enron and WorldCom .
In the first part of my story : banks wrote mortgages , their broker - arms sold them to the public in the form of bonds , they paid fees to Standard & Poor ’s and Moody ’s to get triple - A credit ratings , and they devised crazy default protection schemes which they also sold in the public capital markets .
On top of all that , they screwed up the paper work so there was no relationship between houses and the ultimate financial paper that could be used to cover potential losses .
That ’s when Wall Street staged a weenie - roast over the blazing fire of your 401k plan .
They were making so much money in fees and trading profits that they decided to extend the scheme to car loans , credit card debt , and anything else they could package and sell off in capital markets around the world .
When new money stopped flowing in and when the value of the underlying assets began the decline , the whole mess came falling down over their – and our – heads .
In case after case , there are more derivatives than their underlying assets .
Here ’s an example of just how absurd this is :
The market value of Bank of America ( BofA ) is $ 32 billion ; the contracts that payoff if BofA fails are worth $ 119 billion .
This is n’t rocket science math .
It ’s worth a lot more to someone to see BofA fail than it is to see them succeed .
Here ’s a table of some of financial companies and home builders , alongside some countries , to give you an idea of what the potential cost would be of letting them collapse – because the derivatives would have to be paid off if they collapsed .
Where the market value of a company ’s publicly - traded shares ( or the outstanding public debt of a nation ) is greater than the derivatives outstanding ( a negative number in the difference column ) , the “ market ” is probably betting in favor of the company .

Derivatives outstanding is data made available by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation for publicly traded credit default contracts .
Market value is for public companies generally in early March 2009 ; public debt is for countries generally from year - end 2008 .
Difference is author ’s calculation .
The average derivatives outstanding for entities with positive differences are 22 times the value of the entity ( excluding GMAC as an outlier with a multiplier of 17,816 ) .
In other words , you could buy all the shares of Lennar for $ 1.2 billion .
However , if they go bankrupt , the payoff will be $ 40 billion for the holders of the derivative contracts .
And at this point , we – the US taxpayers – are in the position of paying off on these contracts if the banks and other “ too big ” companies fail .
This table also tells you that the “ markets ” think that Bank of America is significantly more likely to fail than , say , Brazil – which is probably true , if for no other reason than the fact that Brazil has an army and Bank of America does n’t !
The bottom line is that the government has to continue to bailout these banks and large companies because many of them , including AIG which is now owned about 80 % by us , are the same entities that will have to pay off the bets if the other companies fail .
There ’s really no way out of it now .
I remain opposed to the bailouts – they create “ moral hazard , ” the scenario whereby it is more profitable to fail than to succeed .
But : I understand why they are being done and why we have to keep doing it .
The reason is : it matters to our 401k plans , the pension plans of teachers and firefighters , the retirement benefits of loyal , hard - working Americans .
You see , the debt of insurance companies and other triple - A rated credits ( AIG had a good credit rating less than 12 months ago ) are required investments for money market funds , pension plans , etc .
Take a look at the prospectus for any of these investments if you have them and you ’ll see what I mean .
It is necessary for such funds to make triple - A investments because the funds need to be able to make payments and honor withdrawals , sometimes on short notice .
That means they have to hold some very safe , very easily sold investments .
Investments like those issued by AIG .
If the mutual funds holding your 401k and the pension fund supporting the school teachers and all that go broke – well , no one wants to imagine what that America would look like .
Despite all the bad economic news , few Americans have run out in the streets in protest and even those who did did n’t vandalize any property , public or private .
Nor did we take our CEOs hostage .
In fact , I think a little civil unrest may be called for : print this story , wrap it around a hotdog , mail it to the New York Stock Exchange and tell them to enjoy their weenie - roast !
Here ’s why : the time is coming very soon when Wall Street will need us again .
Uncle Sam is doling out the bailout money to the financial institutions , but even now they are devising ways to get ordinary investors to come back to the markets – and to use our own money to do it .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - About one in eight U.S. homeowners with mortgages , a record share , ended 2008 behind on their loan payments or in the foreclosure process as job losses intensified a housing crisis spawned by lax lending practices , the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Thursday .
With unemployment at a 16 - 1/2 - year high and expected to continue rising until mid- to late 2010 , more borrowers will pay late or fall into foreclosure this year , said the group ’s chief economist .
“ While California , Florida , Nevada , Arizona and Michigan continue to dominate the delinquency numbers , some of the sharpest increases we saw last quarter in loans 90 days or more delinquent were in Louisiana , New York , Georgia , Texas and Mississippi , signs of the spreading impact of the recession , ” said Jay Brinkmann .
Duress is no longer isolated to borrowers with lower credit quality .
As joblessness grew , so did late payments on prime fixed - rate loans that represent two - thirds of mortgages .
U.S. President Barack Obama ’s $ 275 billion housing stimulus program will standardize modifications for distressed loans and pave the way for more refinancing .
That should smooth differences caused by various moratoria by states and companies that temporarily curbed the surge in foreclosures in the fourth quarter , Brinkmann said .
“ But keep in mind that there are three drivers to the housing problem , and this program of course addresses mostly the first one , ” he added , referring to loan structure , underwriting quality and fraud .
The two other problems -- an oversupply caused by overbuilding and foreclosures , and unemployment -- still loom large .
Having one in eight households late paying or in foreclosure is “ unacceptable in a country like ours , ” said Nicholas Bratsofolis , senior managing director of structured refinance at mortgage bank LendAmerica in Melville , New York .
“ Instead of wringing our hands , I think we should start utilizing the tools that the government has given to us to remedy the ills that are facing many of these homeowners , ” he said .
A record 11.18 percent of loans on one - to - four unit residences were at least one payment past due or in the foreclosure process in 2008 .
The delinquency rate jumped 2.06 percentage points from a year ago to a record 7.88 percent .
The share of loans in the foreclosure process leaped 1.26 percentage points in the year to a record 3.30 percent .
MBA started tracking the data in 1972 .
Housing has yanked down the U.S. economy after being a key driver of it earlier this decade .
In a vicious cycle , a weakening economy is now further siphoning demand for homes .
“ In a recession like this , housing is never just about housing , ” said Jed Kolko , associate research director at the Public Policy Institute of California , in San Francisco .
“ Unemployment leads to foreclosures , foreclosures contribute to lower tax revenues , less consumer spending -- it ’s all related . ”
MORE STATES WITH MORE PROBLEMS
As the economy sours , more states have joined the five that had been primary trouble spots for late payments and foreclosures .

“ We see New York being influenced by the layoffs that we ’ve been seeing on Wall Street and some of the rest of the industry associated with that , ” Brinkmann noted .
“ Some of the Southern states that had construction - related unemployment , whether it was forest product or plywood manufacturing .
Some of the tourism industry is now being hit , certainly in Mississippi with the casinos , and in Florida . ”
Subprime adjustable - rate loans and prime ARM loans still drive the late payments , but that is shifting .
“ We will continue to see , however , a shift away from delinquencies tied to the structure and underwriting quality of loans to mortgage delinquencies caused by job and income losses , ” Brinkmann said .
Of particular concern , he said , is rising joblessness for people with college education or technical training .
The rate nearly doubled in the last half of 2008 to just under 4 percent .
“ We saw some sharp pickups in delinquency rates with prime loans and I think that ’s now going to continue as long as we see unemployment continue to climb among the people most likely to own homes , ” Brinkmann said .
How high unemployment in that segment of the population gets and how long it stays there will “ determine ultimately how long the prime fixed loan delinquencies continue to climb , ” he said .
“ Some of these people do have adequate reserves to last maybe six months or a year without a job .
But the longer this thing goes on , the quicker they then run through those reserves and their loans go delinquent . ”

In pictures : Battling heroin in Russia Russia says it has become the world 's biggest consumer of heroin .
The head of Russia 's anti-narcotics service , Victor Ivanov , said that seizures of Afghan heroin were up 70 % .
Speaking ahead of a meeting in Vienna of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs , he called on the UN to do more to fight the problem .
Mr Ivanov , a former KGB officer and senior Kremlin official , said the flood of the drug from Afghanistan posed a threat to Russia 's national security .
He painted a grim picture , says the BBC's James Rodgers in Moscow .
He said the drug was partly to blame for rising crime and a fall in Russia 's population .
Afghanistan is thought to be the source of 93 % of the world 's heroin " In recent years Russia has not just become massively hooked on Afghan opiates , it has also become the world 's absolute leader in the opiate trade and the number one heroin consumer , " he said in a report made available to reporters .
" Drug trafficking has become a key negative factor for demography and a blow to our nation 's gene pool ... [ and ] a challenge to Russia 's civilisation . "
The Russian health ministry says Russia has up to 2.5 million drug addicts out of a population of some 140 million , most of them aged between 18 and 39 .
Mr Ivanov did not give details about which country Russia was thought to have displaced as the main heroin consumer .
The CND 's World Drugs Report for 2008 reported that China was estimated to have about 2.3 million users of opiates , though how many of those used heroin was unclear .
War factor Mr Ivanov said that in the first two months of this year , Russia had seized 400 kg ( 880 lb ) of heroin - a 70 % increase on the same period last year .
He said it was time for the international community to take action against Afghan narcotics by spraying poppies and offering farmers incentives to grow other crops .
Afghanistan is estimated to produce 93 % of the world 's heroin .
While not directly blaming the US - led coalition in Afghanistan for the worsening problem , Mr Ivanov said that Afghan farmers had used the tense military and political situation to plant opium poppies .
He also said patrolling the 7,000 - km ( 4,375 - mile ) border with Kazakhstan , through which drugs arrive , was an impossible job .

Dass man im Web mit juristischem Unbill rechnen muss , auch wenn man nach bestem Gewissen handelt , haben einige Kunden des Webhosters Strato erfahren müssen .
Sie erhielten eine Abmahnung der Bildagentur Getty Images , in der für die angeblich unberechtigte Verwendung eines Fotos rund 1500 Euro Nachlizenzierungsgebühr verlangt werden .
Dabei haben sich die Kunden lediglich eine Website mit dem Homepage - Baukasten LivePages des Berliner Hosters zusammengeklickt .
In einigen Templates befanden sich aber Bilder , für die Getty nun die Verbreitungsrechte reklamiert .
Strato sind die Fälle bekannt : " Bei uns haben sich innerhalb von mehr als einem Jahr 17 Kunden gemeldet , die eine derartige Abmahnung von Getty erhalten haben , wobei die abgemahnten Bilder teilweise gar nicht von Strato zur Verfügung gestellt worden sind " , bestätigte Lars Gurow , Sprecher des Hosters , im Gespräch mit heise online .
Es habe ihn erstaunt , " dass Getty gegen unsere Kunden , aber nicht gegen uns als Rechteinhaber vorgeht " .
Mittlerweile befinde sich Strato in Gesprächen mit der Bildagentur , um die Probleme im Sinne der Kunden zu lösen .
" Als wir von den ersten Abmahnungen erfahren hatten , haben wir das jeweilige Bild sicherheitshalber umgehend aus den Templates genommen und allen Kunden , die sie einsetzen , empfohlen , ihre Homepage entsprechend zu aktualisieren , damit die Bilder aus ihrer Webpräsenz verschwinden und die Kunden nicht unnötig in die Schusslinie von Getty geraten . "
Gurow hält die Situation für vertrackt : " Das generelle Problem , auch mit Bilder - CDs oder Bilder - Pools ist , dass nicht der Anbieter , sondern der Verwender aufgefordert wird , seine Lizenz nachzuweisen – was der Abmahner selbst bisher noch nie getan hat . "
Man habe betroffenen Kunden Unterstützung zugesichert , falls es zu einer gerichtlichen Auseinandersetzung mit Getty kommen sollte .
Strato ist kein Einzelfall , in der letzten Zeit mahnt Getty Images vermehrt Webmaster ab , die ihre Sites in gutem Glauben mit Templates zusammenstellen .
So hatte ein Nutzer der Webdesign - Software NetObjects Fusion 10 heise online berichtet , dass er eine Abmahnung von Getty erhalten hatte , weil ein Bild in einem NetObjects - Template angeblich zum Getty - Pool gehört .
NetObjects Fusion wird in Deutschland von Avanquest Deutschland vertrieben , aber vom US - amerikanischen Unternehmen Web.com hergestellt .
Von heise online befragt , erklärte Web - com - Vice - President Steve Raubenstine , man stehe mit Getty diesbezüglich in Kontakt .
Die Bildagentur könne ihre Rechte auf Nachfragen nicht immer korrekt nachweisen .
Immerhin bat Getty den Rechtsanwalt des NetObjects - Nutzer mittlerweile um einen Kaufbeleg für die Software , weil man sich direkt mit dem Hersteller in Verbindung setzen wolle .
Ein Ergebnis gibt es noch nicht .
" Ich hoffe , dass ich dann aus der Schusslinie bin .
Mal sehen " , schrieb uns der Kunde .
heise online ist zwar kein Fall bekannt , bei dem Getty Images die Nachlizenzierungsforderungen selbst eingeklagt hat .
Doch wenn sich die Abgemahnten wehren , scheint die Bildagentur gute Karten zu haben : Ende 2008 verurteilte das Landgericht München ein EDV - Unternehmen zur Zahlung von insgesamt 10.460 Euro für sechs kopierte Bilder .
Das Unternehmen hatte versucht , mit einer negativen Feststellungsklage die Getty - Forderungen abzuwehren .

CAMBRIDGE , Mass .-- One of the perplexing questions raised by evolutionary theory is how cooperative behavior , which benefits other members of a species at a cost to the individual , came to exist .
Cooperative behavior has puzzled biologists because if only the fittest survive , genes for a behavior that benefits everybody in a population should not last and cooperative behavior should die out , says Jeff Gore , a Pappalardo postdoctoral fellow in MIT 's Department of Physics .
Gore is part of a team of MIT researchers that has used game theory to understand one solution yeast use to get around this problem .
The team 's findings , published in the April 6 online edition of Nature , indicate that if an individual can benefit even slightly by cooperating , it can survive even when surrounded by individuals that do n't cooperate .
In short , the study offers a concrete example of how cooperative behaviors can be compatible with evolutionary theory .
Yeast may seem unlikely subjects for a study of cooperative behavior , but in fact they are perfectly suited to such studies , says Gore .
Unlike humans , yeast have no emotions or thoughts that interfere with rational decision - making ; their actions are solely driven by their genetic response to the environment .
" You can apply game theory to biological interactions and in some ways it 's more broadly applicable than it is in humans , " says Gore , the paper 's lead author .
Game theory , traditionally employed by economists and military strategists , uses mathematics to predict individuals ' behavior in certain situations .
Cooperators and cheaters
Working with MIT physics professor Alexander van Oudenaarden , also an author of the paper , Gore developed an experimental setup involving yeast sucrose metabolism .
Sucrose is not yeast 's preferred food source , but they will metabolize it if no glucose is available .
To do so , they must secrete an enzyme called invertase , which breaks sucrose into smaller sugars that the yeast can absorb .
Much of that sugar diffuses away and is freely available to other yeast cells in the environment .
In this scenario , yeast that secrete invertase are known as cooperators , while those that do n't secrete invertase and instead consume the simple sugars produced by others are called cheaters .
If all of these simple sugars diffused away , with no preferential access to the yeast that produced it , then it would always be better to cheat , and the cooperators would die out .
The researchers observed that cooperating yeast have preferential access to approximately 1 percent of the sucrose they produce .
That benefit outweighs the cost of helping others , allowing them to successfully compete against cheaters .
In addition , no matter the initial starting numbers of yeast in a given population , the microbes always come into an equilibrium state , with both cooperators and cheaters present .
" It does n't matter where you start .
You always end up with equilibrium , " says Gore .
This suggests that the yeast are playing what game theorists call a snowdrift game .
The name of the game comes from a situation in which two drivers are trapped in cars behind a snowdrift .
Each one can choose to get out and clear a path or stay put .
If one driver does not shovel , the other must .
The best option is to " cheat " by staying in the car while the other driver shovels .
However , the worst - case scenario occurs if both drivers cheat and no one gets home .
Therefore , the best strategy is always the opposite of your opponent 's strategy .
The same rules apply to the cheating and cooperating yeast :
Like the driver who grudgingly gets out and shovels so that both she and her fellow motorist — snug inside his car — may continue on their journeys , the yeast who cooperate do so because there is a slight benefit for themselves .
However , when most of the yeast are cooperating , it becomes advantageous for some individuals to cheat , and vice versa , which allows co-existence between cheaters and cooperators to arise .
Studies have shown that in the wild , yeast carry different numbers of copies of the invertase gene .
This genetic diversity in the wild may be similar to the long - term coexistence of cooperators and cheaters observed in the laboratory , says Gore .

McCain 's response ad to Obama 's TV special :
Jason Zengerle notices an odd detail :
It 's a fairly standard negative spot -- until the very last line , which asserts that Obama 's " not ready . . . yet . "
It 's the " yet " that 's interesting -- as if it 's finally dawned on the McCain folks that a lot of Americans actually like Obama and do n't really buy the notion that he's a dangerous radical intent on installing Weather Underground alums in key cabinet posts .
McCain seems to be acknowledging voters ' warm feelings toward Obama and even sort of agreeing with them , with the crucial caveat that he thinks Obama still needs some seasoning .
Maybe McCain 's final hail mary is to pledge to serve one term . . . and then to pledge his support to Obama in 2012 .
Mycocepurus smithii
A group of Amazonian ants have evolved an extremely unusual social system :
They are all female and reproduce via cloning .
Though their sexual organs have virtually disappeared , they have also gained some extraordinary abilities .
University of Arizona biologist Anna Himler orginally began studying the ants , called Mycocepurus smithii , because they had incredible success as farmers .
Many breeds of ant keep domesticated “ farms ” where they breed various kinds of fungus for nourishment .
But Mycocepurus smithii was able to breed fungus far more successfully , and in greater varieties , than other ants Himler had encountered .

Mr Morales complains of " negligence by neoliberal lawmakers " Bolivian President Evo Morales has said he will refuse to eat until the upper house of parliament , the Senate , passes a new electoral law .
The opposition - controlled Senate is blocking a bill that would give greater political power to Bolivia 's indigenous majority , to which Mr Morales belongs .
Fourteen special indigenous electoral districts would be created in places where Indian groups are in a minority .
The opposition says the bill would help the re-election of Mr Morales .
We think that the president is blackmailing via the strike
Walter Guiteras
Opposition senator Tensions flared last week when members of the governing party , which controls the lower house , clashed with the opposition over the bill .
The Andean nation has been marked by decades of political upheaval .
A new constitution designed to give more rights and a greater share of the land and resources to the country 's indigenous majority was approved by more than 60 % of voters in late January .
But tensions and deep division between the poorer , indigenous majority located in the highlands , and the wealthier and mixed - race lowlanders , have increased since Mr Morales took office three years ago , the BBC's Andres Schipani reports from La Paz .
' Blackmail ' " Faced with the negligence of a group of neoliberal lawmakers , we have to take this step , " Mr Morales told reporters at the presidential palace in La Paz on Thursday .
A joint session of the Bolivian Congress saw heated exchanges " Now is the best time to force opposition senators in the National Congress to approve the new law . "
The electoral law would set the next presidential election for 6 December .
Members of the presidential cabinet pledged to join Mr Morales in his hunger protest but a palace spokesman ruled out a solidarity strike , to ensure the country continued to function .
Fernando Mesmer , a member of the influential centre - right opposition party Podemos , dismissed the president 's hunger strike as " ridiculous " .
He said that the ruling Movement for Socialism wanted to ensure the president 's re-election in order to " cover up the massive corruption " .
An opposition senator , Walter Guiteras , called Mr Morales ' action " shameless " .
" Congress is absolutely independent of the executive branch , " he said .
" We think that the president is blackmailing via the strike .
Hunger strikes can't be used within the logic and dynamics of democracy , within the terms of the coherence of law , to try to get something .
It seems absolutely shameless to me . "

A recent draft of the controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) surfaced on Wikileaks this weekend .
Among other things , the draft aims to strengthen the power and rights of the entertainment industry and other copyright holders , by letting them choose how they want to be compensated for copyright infringements .
ACTA is an international agreement that aims to target piracy and counterfeiting globally .
The degree of secrecy surrounding the negotiations is astonishing .
Many institutions , the press and various individuals have requested that the participating countries provide an insight into their plans , but none have succeeded thus far .
It almost seems they are actively blocking the public from having their say , while in contrast they continue to receive input from anti-piracy lobbyists such as the RIAA and MPAA .
However , as time progresses more details about ACTA become public , largely thanks to Wikileaks .
With the most recent draft that leaked a few days ago , another piece of the puzzle is completed .
The leaked draft covers a wide range of issues which are impossible to cover in one article , so here we focus on the damages section .
In this section , it is explained how copyright infringers should be compensated by those who share copyrighted content .
It starts as follows :
1. Each Party shall provide that : ( a) In civil proceedings , its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer of intellectual property rights to pay the right holder .
( b )
In determining the amount of damages of intellectual property rights , its judicial authorities shall consider , inter alia , the value of the infringed goods or service , measured by the market price , suggested retail price , or other legitimate measure of value submitted by the rights holder .
This basically means that the courts should be allowed to make those who share copyrighted content pay compensation to the rights holders .
By itself this is not that groundbreaking , but combined with point ( b ) it means that the RIAA , MPAA and others pretty much have a carte blanche for the amount of damages they want to request .
But it gets even worse .
2 . At least with respect to works , phonograms , and performance protected by copyright or related rights , and in the case of trademark counterfeiting , in civil proceedings , each party shall establish or maintain a system that provides : ( a ) pre-established damages
( b ) presumptions for determining the amount of damages
In the footnote of paragraph 2 b it is detailed that the damages should be equal to the number of infringed goods , multiplied by the profit that would have been made if the infringement had not taken place .
The “ would have been sold ” part is crucial here .
Is every copyrighted file shared to be considered a lost sale or will there be another formula to calculate the claimed loss in sales ?
If this paragraph ends up in the final version of the agreement the participating countries are encouraged to come up with a standardized fine for copyright infringers based on lost profit .
The way we see it this could easily lead to a situation where file - sharers face thousands of dollars in fines if their IP - address is found sharing a popular movie or music album .
The damages section of the ACTA draft continues with the following paragraph that suggests giving rights holders full control over how they want to be compensated .
3 . Each party shall provide that the rights holders shall have the right to choose the system in paragraph 2 as an alternative to the damages in paragraph 1 .
This is even more absurd .
It basically means that the RIAA and MPAA will have the right to come up with their own damages formula , where they will probably cite one of their own studies to legitimize asking for exorbitant amounts of damages .
Even though this leaked ACTA text is just a draft , and many member states have suggested it should become less extreme , it is crystal clear that the legislation is heavily skewed towards the rights holders .
The rights of the public , their privacy and the general criticism on the claimed “ loss in profit ” because of illegal downloading are all completely ignored .

Heavy casualties during Israel 's campaign have provoked criticism Israeli military police have closed an investigation into soldiers ' accounts of abuses committed in Gaza , saying they were based on hearsay .
An Israeli military college published the accounts , which included claims that soldiers fired on civilians and vandalised property .
The probe concluded that the stories were " purposely exaggerated " .
Rights groups fear war crimes took place during the January assault which Israel said aimed to end rocket fire .
In a written statement , the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) said the investigation had focused on two stories which alleged that civilians had been fired on , but found the soldiers who told them were not direct witnesses .
In one of them , a commander was said to have ordered troops to kill an elderly woman walking on a road , even though she was easily identifiable and clearly not a threat .
" In fact , the soldier witnessed no such thing , and was only repeating a rumour he had heard , " the statement read .
Sniper fire Another account tells of a sniper killing a mother and children at close range whom troops had told to leave their home , when they misunderstood instructions about which way to walk .
DIFFERENT DEATH TOLLS Palestinians killed during Israeli military offensive in Gaza , 27 Dec to 18 Jan Total dead : 1,166 ( 1,434 ) Fighters : 710-870 ( 235 ) Non-combatants : 295-460 ( 960 ) Women : 49 ( 121 ) Children under 16 : 89 ( 288 ) Sources : Israeli Defence Intelligence Research Dept ( and Palestinian Centre for Human Rights )
Who is a civilian ?
Counting war casualties
Who can probe war crimes claims ?
" It was found that during this incident a force had opened fire in a different direction , towards two suspicious men who were unrelated to the civilians in question , " the statement said .
The testimonies were published by the military academy at Oranim College .
Graduates of the academy , who had served in Gaza , were speaking to new recruits at a seminar .
The statement did not comment on more general claims made about the rules of engagement and the attitude among soldiers .
" The climate in general ...
I do n't know how to describe it .... the lives of Palestinians , let 's say , are much , much less important than the lives of our soldiers , " an infantry squad leader was quoted saying in reports carried in Israeli newspapers .
While academy director Dany Zamir told public radio that " [ the testimonies ] conveyed an atmosphere in which one feels entitled to use unrestricted force against Palestinians " .
Testimonies , which were given by combat pilots and infantry soldiers , also included allegations of unnecessary destruction of Palestinian property .
" We would throw everything out of the windows to make room and order .
Everything ... refrigerators , plates , furniture .
The order was to throw all of the house 's contents outside , " a soldier said .
Heavy civilian casualties during the three - week operation which ended in the blockaded coastal strip on 18 January have provoked an international outcry .
The IDF is conducting separate investigations into allegations raised by human rights groups on the basis of Palestinian testimony and evidence from the battlefield .
The IDF say 1,166 Palestinians were killed during the conflict , of whom 709 were " terror operatives " .
A Palestinian rights group says the toll was 1,434 , including 960 civilians , 235 fighters and 239 uniformed police .

By now you ’ve most likely joined Twitter ( and if you have n’t , you need to , pronto ! ) .
Twitter is not only a great place for businesses and marketers , but it ’s also a great place to spruce up your writing skills .
Yes .
You read that correctly .
Twitter can make you a better writer .
Here ’s how .
Twitter forces you to be concise
If you ’ve ever used Twitter , you know that you have 140 characters to say whatever you want to say .
Now keep in mind , I did n’t say 140 words — or even 140 letters — I said 140 characters .
That ’s not a lot of room .
Letters , numbers , symbols , punctuation and spaces all count as characters on Twitter .
What all of this means is , you have to be concise .
You have to know exactly what you want to say , and say it in as few words as possible .
Many writers , however , are “ wordy ” and often have long , drawn out descriptions and sentences , so it can be pretty difficult to create a message that ’s only 140 characters .
Here ’s where Twitter comes in again .
Twitter forces you to exercise your vocabulary
Since you only have 140 characters to get your message across , you ’re forced to dust off your dictionary and thesaurus and find new words to use — Words that are shorter , words that are more descriptive , and words that get the job done in 140 characters or less .
Crafting a message for Twitter requires you to “ pump up ” your verbs ( replacing adverbs and adjectives with them ) , and discover a better , clearer and more concise way to say what you want to say .
Now most people wo n’t hit 140 characters right away .
No , they ’ll end up with 160 or 148 characters to start out with ( Twitter tells you how many characters you need to remove to make your message fit ) .
This is the final way that Twitter makes you a better writer .
Twitter forces you to improve your editing skills
Every writer needs to be able to edit their work .
And by using Twitter , you can really hone your editing skills and make them top - notch .
It ’s almost like playing a game ; trying to write a 140 - character message and still get your point across in a way that inspires your followers to take action , to click on your link or to “ retweet ” your post .
I like to think of it as a brainteaser , forcing me to think hard and dig deep down into my vocabulary to find a way to shorten my message .
I ’ve been using Twitter since January , and my writing skills have not only improved , but I ’ve been writing better copy as well .
Yet another reason you should be using Twitter .
Not that you needed one .

A vicious smear attack on Alex Jones and his websites launched by the ADL in the aftermath of the Pittsburgh police shootings which attempted to classify Infowars as an outlet for “ hate speech ” has been discredited after the ADL ’s own website admitted that Richard Poplawski held views that opposed those of the Texas radio talk show host .
Stories claiming that Poplawski was influenced by Alex Jones , Infowars and Prison Planet originally appeared Sunday in the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette and Raw Story .
Neither of these news organizations attempted to speak with us before claiming the link and Raw Story later issued a retraction and removed us from their original piece altogether after we questioned the sloppy nature of their writer Muriel Kane ’s hit piece .
The Raw Story piece now omits any mention of Prison Planet , Infowars or Alex Jones , stating , “ Editor ’s note : RAW STORY regrets an early version of this article was published without an editor ’s approval .
This article has been revised and edited . ”
Liberal blogs and websites have grossly inflated the shootings out of context to claim that the tragic events were not as a result of a domestic dispute gone horribly awry , but as some kind of retribution launched deliberately by Poplawski borne out of his fierce support for the second amendment and interest in conspiracy websites .
They have employed classic guilt - by - association tactics to attack gun rights activists in an attempt to discredit the very real agenda on behalf of the Obama administration to curtail the second amendment .
Forget the snarky blog entries at Little Green Footballs and Daily Kos — the attack against Alex Jones is now a main course diet for the Anti-Defamation League .
“ Web sites like the neo - Nazi Stormfront forums and the anti-government conspiracy Infowars site fueled [ Richard Poplawski’s ] racist , anti-Semitic , and conspiratorial mindset , ” the ADL claims in the white supremacy section of its website .
The ADL wrote the following about the Pittsburgh shooter and a post in the comment section of Infowars :
“ One of Poplawski ’s favorite places for such conspiracy theories was the Web site of the right - wing conspiracy radio talk show host Alex Jones .
Poplawski visited the site , Infowars , frequently , shared links to it with others , and sometimes even posted to it .
One of his frustrations with the site , though , was that it did n’t focus enough on the nefarious roles played by Jews in all these conspiracies .
“ For being such huge players in the endgame , ” he observed in a March 29 , 2009 posting to Infowars , “ too many ‘ infowarriors ’ are surprisingly unfamiliar with the Zionists . ”
Another time he was more hopeful , noting that “ racial awareness is on the rise among the young white population . ”
A search of the comments section on Infowars , Prison Planet , and the Prison Planet forum produces zero matches for Poplawski ’s handle , “ Braced for Fate . ”
A search of his name also produces no results .
However , a Google search of the quote used in the ADL article produces a comment posted to Infowars that matches the one in the ADL article under the handle “ P O Status ” with an email containing “ Richp , ” the name cited by the media .
This undated photo released by the Pittsburgh Police shows Richard Poplawski .
The ADL claims Poplawski or somebody using his handle posted “ frequently ” on the Infowars comments .
In fact , “ P O Status ” left three short posts , thus making him an infrequent commenter at best .
Comments on Infowars are open to the public and until very recently contained no restrictions and very little moderation .
Considering this , it should be obvious to the ADL and others that Alex Jones and Infowars do not support the views expressed in all comments .
Obviously , the ADL has an axe to grind and does not find it objectionable to lead its readers to unwarranted conclusions — that Alex Jones operates a racist and white supremacist website .
Even a cursory examination of Alex Jones ’ comments and those of the writers on his websites reveals the exact opposite —
Alex Jones has on numerous occasions denounced racism .
Even if we are to take the ADL ’s accusation at face value , despite it being backed up with no hard evidence whatsoever , the attachment to their own press release admits that the nature of Poplawski ’s statements on our website comment boards was antagonistic towards Alex Jones , Infowars and Prison Planet for not subscribing to his warped political world view .
How on earth can that be taken as meaning that Poplawski was influenced by Alex , Infowars or Prison Planet when Poplawski expressed his explicit disagreement with our political stance ?
There ’s no doubt that Poplawski was a neo -nazi and a white supremacist who held distasteful opinions .
The fact that such views are a complete 180 from what we write about every day , and the fact that the ADL itself admits Poplawski expressed disagreement with our material , debunks the ridiculous notion that his shooting rampage was remotely influenced by anything he may have read on our websites .
[ efoods ]
This is not the first time that the ADL has attempted to classify Alex Jones and his websites as “ hate ” material .
Several years ago they attempted a similar stunt and were later forced to back down and retract their statements after Jones sent them a letter informing them of their slanderous accusations which were libel .
It is also noteworthy that clear evidence points to the ADL having had a significant influence in the writing of the controversial MIAC report , which equated Ron Paul supporters , libertarians and people who display political bumper stickers with domestic terrorists and hate groups .
The report later had to be completely withdrawn after numerous different parties threatened lawsuits on the back of the report ’s ludicrous assertions that third party political candidates Ron Paul , Bob Barr and Chuck Baldwin were somehow tied in with white supremacists and people like OKC bomber Timothy McVeigh and Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph .
Over at the Daily Kos site operated by the former Reaganite and documented wannabe CIA employee Markos Moulitsas Zuniga , the knives are coming out in a big way against Alex Jones .
“ In the end , I believe the mainstream media needs to press hard on people like Glenn Beck , Don Black ( Stormfront ) and Alex Jones ( PrisonPlanet ) to discuss how the poisonous environments they ’ve created and the hate they spew fuel people like Richard Paplowski , ” writes a contributor with the handle fcvaguy .
“ The mainstream media should also educate Americans about these hate sites , because my guess is most of America knows nothing about them . ”
Prison Planet and Infowars , of course , are anything but hate sites as regular readers know .
Daily Kos has long been in the business of such absurd political reductionism and guilt by association , even though Prison Planet and Infowars are not even remotely associated with Stormfront or its brand of racist ideology .
In many ways , Daily Kos is a website peddling the worst kind of mean - spiritedness with its sharply divisive Democrat partisan politics .
We vehemently advise the Daily Kos , the ADL and the other blogs who have jumped on this fallacious and slanderous bandwagon in an attempt to smear Alex Jones , Infowars and Prison Planet to follow the example of Raw Story and issue retractions .
Let it be on record that we are currently considering what further action to take should retractions not be forthcoming .

General Motors has all but bet its future on the Chevrolet Volt , but the government says the range - extended electric vehicle wo n't save the beleaguered automaker .
" While the Volt holds promise , it likely will be too expensive to be commercially successful in the short term , " President Obama 's auto task force said in its assessment of GM 's restructuring plan .
The panel soundly criticized the restructuring plan GM submitted as part of its request for a federal bailout , saying it relies on unrealistic and overly optimistic projections .
The task force believes GM can become a competitive automaker , but only by shaking up its management — which is why Obama essentially fired CEO Rick Wagoner — and accelerating its restructuring .
" A great deal of progress needs to be made , " the panel said in its five - page summary ( .pdf ) assessing GM 's proposal , " and GM 's plan contemplates initiatives that will take many years to complete . "
Among them is the Chevrolet Volt , which the White House calls too little , too late and too expensive .
GM says the range - extended electric car will be in showrooms by the end of next year ; the first production prototypes will be on the road in June .
The four - door sedan will deliver 40 miles on a charge ; a small gasoline engine will recharge the battery as it approaches depletion , extending its range by as much as 200 miles .
The car is expected to cost around $ 40,000 .
" While the Volt holds promise , it is currently projected to be much more expensive than its gasoline - fueled peers and will likely need significant reductions in manufacturing costs in order to become commercially viable , " the president 's task force wrote .
General Motors concedes the car is expensive but argues costs will quickly come down as the technology is established .
" It 's the first generation of transformational technology , " spokesman Rob Peterson told Wired.com .
" It 's expensive .
We 're aware of that .
But we think there 's a business case for plug - in electric vehicles . "
The company plans to sell the Volt worldwide ; it will appear in Europe as the Opel Ampera in 2011 and in Australia as the Holden Volt one year later .
Peterson says General Motors is already looking ahead to " generation two and generation three " — it unveiled the Cadillac Converj concept at the Detroit auto show — though he would n't say what those vehicles might be or when they 'll appear .
" As you sell more plug - in electric vehicles , costs will come down , " he said .
" It wo n't happen overnight .
It wo n't happen within the first year .
But the engineering team is already looking at generation two . "
GM likes to boast that the Volt leapfrogs the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight because those vehicles rely in large part on gasoline to drive the wheels .
The Volt uses only electricity for propulsion ; the engine serves only to recharge the lithium - ion battery .
But the task force says GM bet too heavily on the Volt when it should be building better , more efficient small cars .
" GM is at least one generation behind Toyota on advanced ' green ' powertrain development , " the panel wrote .
" In an attempt to leapfrog Toyota , GM has devoted significant resources on the Chevy Volt . "
Peterson concedes Toyota clearly has the advantage when it comes to hybrids .
But he notes that GM produces eight hybrids and offers 18 vehicles that get 30 mpg or better — more than any other major automaker .
The company also has invested in cellulosic ethanol startups and offers a large number of cars that run on E85 .
It also plans to have the 45 - mpg Chevrolet Cruze on the road next year , and the 40 - mpg Spark microcar also is in the works .
" They have a head start on us , absolutely , " he said , referring to Toyota 's hybrid advantage .
" But to say we have n't done anything is a stretch .
There 's no shortage of effort . "

[ Ben Franklin , _Poor Richard 's Almanac_ , 1754 ( Works , Volume XIII ) ]

They are always of two classes : fools and hypocrites . "

" Christianity neither is , nor ever was a part of the common law . "

Shake off all the fears of servile prejudices , under which weak minds are servilely crouched .
Fix reason firmly in her seat , and call on her tribunal for every fact , every opinion .
Question with boldness even the existence of a God ; because , if there be one , he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear . "
[ Thomas Jefferson , letter to Peter Carr , Aug. 10 , 1787 ]
" The Christian priesthood , finding the doctrines of Christ levelled to every understanding and too plain to need explanation , saw , in the mysticisms of Plato , materials with which they might build up an artificial system which might , from its indistinctness , admit everlasting controversy , give employment for their order , and introduce it to profit , power and pre-eminence .
The doctirnes which flowed from the lips of Jesus himself are within the comprehension of a child ; but thousands of volumes have not yet explained the Platonisms engrafted on them : and for this obvious reason that nonsense can never be explained . "
[ Thomas Jefferson , in a letter to John Adams ]

" The divorce between church and state ought to be absolute .

Lexington , MA : D.C. Heath and Co. 1971 ]
" Our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions more than our opinions in physics or geometry ; that therefore the proscribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of trust and emolument , unless he profess or renounce this or that religious opinion , is depriving him injuriously of those privileges and advantages to which in common with his fellow citizens he has a natural right ; that it tends also to corrupt the principles of that very religion it is meant to encourage , by bribing , with a monopoly of worldly honors and emoluments , those who will externally profess and conform to it ; that though indeed these are criminal who do not withstand such temptation , yet neither are those innocent who lay the bait in their way ; that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles , on supposition of their ill tendency , is a dangerous fallacy , which at once destroys all religious liberty , because he being of course judge of that tendency , will make his opinions the rule of judgment , and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or differ from his own ; that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order ; and finally , that truth is great and will prevail if left to herself , that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error , and has nothing to fear from the conflict , unless by human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons , free argument and debate , errors ceasing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them . "
[ Jefferson and Madison , from the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom ]
" History I believe furnishes no example of a priest - ridden people maintaining a free civil government .
This marks the lowest grade of ignorance , of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purpose . "
[ Thomas Jefferson , to Baron von Humboldt , 1813 ]
" To penetrate and dissipate these clouds of darkness , the general mind must be strengthened by education . "
[ Thomas Jefferson ]
" The care of every man 's soul belongs to himself .
But what if he neglect the care of it ?
Well what if he neglect the care of his health or his estate , which would more nearly relate to the state .
Will the magistrate make a law that he not be poor or sick ?
Laws provide against injury from others ; but not from ourselves .
God himself will not save men against their wills .
But a short time elapsed after the death of the great reformer of the Jewish religion , before his principles were departed from by those who professed to be his special servants , and perverted into an engine for enslaving mankind , and aggrandizing their oppressors in Church and State . "
[ Thomas Jefferson , to S. Kercheval , 1810 ]
" ... If we did a good act merely from the love of God and a belief that is pleasing to him , whence arises the morality of the Atheist ?
It is idle to say , as some do , that no such thing exists .
We have the same evidence of the fact as of most of those we act on , to wit : their own affirmations , and their reasonings in support of them .
I have observed , indeed , generally that while in Protestant countries the defections from the Platonic Christianity of the priests is to Deism , in Catholic countries they are to Atheism .
Diderot , D'Alembert , D'Holbach , Condorcet are known to have been among the most virtuous of men .
Their virtue , then , must have had some other foundation than love of God . "
[ Thomas Jefferson , letter to Thomas Law , June 13 , 1814 ]
" They [ preachers ] dread the advance of science as witches do the approach of daylight and scowl on the fatal harbinger announcing the subversions of the duperies on which they live . "

" I have recently been examining all the known superstitions of the world , and do not find in our particular superstition ( Christianity ) one redeeming feature .
They are all alike founded on fables and mythology . "
[ Thomas Jefferson , letter to Dr. Woods ]
" Creeds have been the bane of the Christian church
... made of Christendom a slaughter - house . "
[ Thomas Jefferson , to Benjamin Waterhouse , Jun. 26 , 1822 ]
" The Athanasian paradox that one is three and three but one , is so incomprehensible to the human mind , that no candid man can say he has any idea of it , and how can he believe what presents no idea ?
He who thinks he does , only deceives himself
He proves , also , that man , once surrendering his reason , has no remaining guard against absurdities the most monstrous , and like a ship without a rudder , is the sport of every wind .
With such persons , gullibility , which they call faith , takes the helm of reason , and the mind becomes a wreck . "

" [ In regard to the Trinity ] ; " Tom , had you and I been 40 days with Moses , and beheld the great God , and even if God himself had tried to tell us that three was one . . . and one equals three , you and I would never have believed it .
We would never fall victims to such lies . "
[ John Adams , letter to Thomas Jefferson ]

" The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe in blood for centuries . "
[ James Madison , 1803 ]
" Experience witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments , instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of religion , have had a contrary operation .
During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial .
What has been its fruits ?
More or less , in all places , pride and indolence in the clergy ; ignorance and servility in the laity ; in both , superstition , bigotry and persecution . "
[ James Madison , " A Memorial and Remonstrance " , addressed to the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia , 1785 ]
" [ I ]t may not be easy , in every possible case , to trace the line of separation between the rights of religion and the Civil authority with such distinctness as to avoid collisions and doubts on unessential points .
The tendency to unsurpastion on one side or the other , or to a corrupting coalition or alliance between them , will be best guarded agst .
by an entire abstinence of the Gov't from interfence in any way whatsoever , beyond the necessity of preserving public order , and protecting each sect agst .
trespasses on its legal rights by others . "

" There is nothing in either savage or civilised history that is more utterly complete , more remorselessly sweeping than the Father of Mercy 's campaign among the Midianites .

" Strange ...a
God who could make good children as easily as bad , yet preferred to make bad ones ; who made them prize their bitter life , yet stingily cut it short ; mouths Golden Rules and forgiveness multiplied seventy times seven and invented Hell ; who mouths morals to other people and has none himself ; who frowns upon crimes yet commits them all ; who created man without invitation , then tries to shuffle the responsibility for man 's acts upon man , instead of honorably placing it where it belongs , upon himself ; and finally with altogether divine obtuseness , invites this poor , abused slave to worship him !

" ( The Bible ) is full of interest .
It has noble poetry in it ; and some clever fables ; and some blood - drenched history ; and some good morals ; and a wealth of obscenity ; and upwards of a thousand lies .
This Bible is built mainly out of fragments of older Bibles that had their day and crumbled to ruin .
So it noticeably lacks in originality , necessarily .
Its three or four most imposing and impressive events all happened in earlier Bibles ; there are only two new things in it : hell , for one , and that singular heaven I have told you about . "

" During many ages there were witches .
The Bible said so .
The Bible commanded that they should not be allowed to live .
Therefore the Church , after doing its duty in but a lazy and indolent way for 800 years , gathered up its halters , thumbscrews , and firebrands , and set about its holy work in earnest .
She worked hard at it night and day during nine centuries and imprisoned , tortured , hanged , and burned whole hordes and armies of witches , and washed the Christian world clean with their foul blood .
Then it was discovered that there was no such thing as witches , and never had been .
One does not know whether to laugh or to cry . "

EINSTEIN
" I cannot conceive of a personal God who would directly influence the actions of individuals , or would directly sit in judgment on creatures of his own creation .
I cannot do this in spite of the fact that mechanistic causality has , to a certain extent , been placed in doubt by modern science .
[ He was speaking of Quantum Mechanics and the breaking down of determinism . ]
My religiosity consists in a humble admiratation of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we , with our weak and transitory understanding , can comprehend of reality .
Morality is of the highest importance -- but for us , not for God . "
[ Albert Einstein , from " Albert Einstein : The Human Side " , edited
by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman , Princeton University Press ]
" If people are good only because they fear punishment , and hope for reward , then we are a sorry lot indeed . "
[ Albert Einstein ]
" I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures , or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves .
Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death ; let feeble souls , from fear or absurd egoism , cherish such thoughts .
I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world , together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion , be it ever so tiny , of the Reason that manifests itself in nature . "
[ Albert Einstein , _The World as I See It_ ]
" The idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I am unable to take seriously . "
[ Albert Einstein , letter to Hoffman and Dukas , 1946 ]
" The foundation of morality should not be made dependent on myth nor tied to any authority lest doubt about the myth or about the legitimacy of the authority imperil the foundation of sound judgment and action . "
[ Albert Einstein ]
" I do not believe in immortality of the individual , and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it . "
[ " Albert Einstein : The Human Side " , edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh
Hoffman , and published by Princeton University Press . ]
" I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal God is a childlike one , but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth .
I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being . "
[ Albert Einstein ]
" A man 's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy , education , and social ties and needs ; no religious basis is necessary .
Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death . "
[ Albert Einstein , " Religion and Science " , New York Times Magazine , 9 November 1930 ]
" What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly , and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of " humility . "
This is a genuinely religious feeling that has nothing to do with mysticism "
[ Albert Einstein ]
" I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation , whose purposes are modeled after our own -- a God , in short , who is but a reflection of human frailty .
Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body , although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms . "
[ Albert Einstein , obituary in New York Times , 19 April 1955 ]
" Although I cannot believe that the individual survives the death of his body , feeble souls harbor such thought through fear or ridiculous egotism . "
[ Albert Einstein ]
" It was , of course , a lie what you read about my religious convictions , a lie which is being systematically repeated .
I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly .
If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it . "
[ Albert Einstein , 1954 , from " Albert Einstein : The Human Side " , edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman , Princeton University Press ]
" The mystical trend of our time , which shows itself particularly in the rampant growth of the so - called Theosophy and Spiritualism , is for me no more than a symptom of weakness and confusion .
Since our inner experiences consist of reproductions , and combinations of sensory impressions , the concept of a soul without a body seem to me to be empty and devoid of meaning . "

SAGAN
[ Carl Sagan , " The Demon - Haunted World : Science As a Candle in the Dark " ]
" Life is but a momentary glimpse of the wonder of this astonishing universe , and it is sad to see so many dreaming it away on spiritual fantasy . "
[ Carl Sagan ]
" ( When asked merely if they accept evolution , 45 percent of Americans say yes .
The figure is 70 percent in China . )
When the movie " Jurassic Park " was shown in Israel , it was condemned by some Orthodox rabbis because it accepted evolution and because it taught that dinosaurs lived a hundred million years ago -- when , as is plainly stated at every Rosh Hashonhan and every Jewish wedding ceremony , the Universe is less than 6,000 years old . "
[ Carl Sagan , _ The Demon - Haunted World :
Science as a Candle in the Dark_ , p. 325 ]
" In science it often happens that scientists say , ' You know that 's a really good argument ; my position is mistaken , ' and then they actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again .
They really do it .
It does n't happen as often as it should , because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful .
But it happens every day .
I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion . "
[ Carl Sagan , 1987 CSICOP keynote address ]
" One of the saddest lessons of history is this :
If we 've been bamboozled long enough , we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle .
We 're no longer interested in finding out the truth .
The bamboozle has captured us .
it is simply too painful to acknowledge -- even to ourselves -- that we 've been so credulous .
( So the old bamboozles tend to persist as the new bamboozles rise . ) "

" At the extremes it is difficult to distinguish pseudoscience from rigid , doctrinaire religion . "

" If you want to save your child from polio , you can pray or you can inoculate .... Try science . "
[ Carl Sagan , quoted in " 2000 Years of Disbelief , Famous People with the Courage to Doubt " , by James A. Haught , Prometheus Books , 1996 ]
" The idea that God is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous .
But if by " God " one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe , then clearly there is such a God .
This God is emotionally unsatisfying ... it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity . "
[ Carl Sagan ]
" Is it fair to be suspicious of an entire profession because of a few bad apples ?
There are at least two important differences , it seems to me .
First , no one doubts that science actually works , whatever mistaken and fraudulent claim may from time to time be offered .
But whether there are * any * miraculous cures from faith - healing , beyond the body 's own ability to cure itself , is very much at issue .
Secondly , the expose ' of fraud and error in science is made almost exclusively by science .
But the exposure of fraud and error in faith - healing is almost never done by other faith - healers . "
[ Carl Sagan , " The Demon - Haunted World : Science As a Candle in the Dark " ]
" Many statements about God are confidently made by theologians on grounds that today at least sound specious .
Thomas Aquinas claimed to prove that God cannot make another God , or commit suicide , or make a man without a soul , or even make a triangle whose interior angles do not equal 180 degrees .
But Bolyai and Lobachevsky were able to accomplish this last feat ( on a curved surface ) in the nineteenth century , and they were not even approximately gods . "
[ Carl Sagan , _ Broca 's Brain_ ]
" Think of how many religions attempt to validate themselves with prophecy .
Think of how many people rely on these prophecies , however vague , however unfulfilled , to support or prop up their beliefs .
Yet has there ever been a religion with the prophetic accuracy and reliability of science ? "
[ Carl Sagan , " The Demon - Haunted World : Science As a Candle in the Dark " ]
" I would love to believe that when I die I will live again , that some thinking , feeling , remembering part of me will continue .
But as much as I want to believe that , and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife , I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking . "
[ Carl Sagan ]
" Skeptical scrutiny is the means , in both science and religion , by which deep thoughts can be winnowed from deep nonsense . "
[ Carl Sagan ]
" You can't convince a believer of anything ; for their belief is not based on evidence , it 's based on a deep seated need to believe . "
[ Carl Sagan ]
" If we long to believe that the stars rise and set for us , that we are the reason there is a Universe , does science do us a disservice in deflating our conceits ?.... For me , it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion , however satisfying and reassuring . "
[ Carl Sagan , " The Demon - Haunted World : Science As a Candle in the Dark " ]
" Finding the occasional straw of truth awash in a great ocean of confusion and bamboozle requires intelligence , vigilance , dedication and courage .
But if we do n't practice these tough habits of thought , we cannot hope to solve the truly serious problems that face us -- and we risk becoming a nation of suckers , up for grabs by the next charlatan who comes along . "
[ Carl Sagan , " The Fine Art of Baloney Detection , " ]
" I maintain there is much more wonder in science than in pseudoscience .
And in addition , to whatever measure this term has any meaning , science has the additional virtue , and it is not an inconsiderable one , of being true . "
[ Carl Sagan , The Burden Of Skepticism ]
" You see , the religious people -- most of them -- really think this planet is an experiment .
That 's what their beliefs come down to .
Some god or other is always fixing and poking , messing around with tradesmen 's wives , giving tablets on mountains , commanding you to mutilate your children , telling people what words they can say and what words they can't say , making people feel guilty about enjoying themselves , and like that .
Why can't the gods let well enough alone ?
All this intervention speaks of incompetence .
If God did n't want Lot 's wife to look back , why did n't he make her obedient , so she 'd do what her husband told her ?
Or if he had n't made Lot such a shithead , maybe she would have listened to him more .
If God is omnipotent and omniscient , why did n't he start the universe out in the first place so it would come out the way he wants ?
Why 's he constantly repairing and complaining ?
No , there 's one thing the Bible makes clear :
The biblical God is a sloppy manufacturer .
He 's not good at design , he 's not good at execution .
He'd be out of business if there was any competition . "
[ Carl Sagan , character Sol Hadden in _ Contact_ , 1985 ]
" There was no deathbed conversion , " Druyan says .
" No appeals to God , no hope for an afterlife , no pretending that he and I , who had been inseparably for twenty years , were not saying goodbye forever . "
" Did n't he want to believe ? " she was asked .
" Carl never wanted to believe , " she replies fiercely .
" He wanted to KNOW . "

HAWKING
" What I have done is to show that it is possible for the way the universe began to be determined by the laws of science .
In that case , it would not be necessary to appeal to God to decide how the universe began .
This does n't prove that there is no God , only that God is not necessary . "
[ Stephen W. Hawking , Der Spiegel , 1989 ]
DAWKINS
" It 's been suggested that if the supernaturalists really had the powers they claim , they'd win the lottery every week .
I prefer to point out that they could also win a Nobel Prize for discovering fundamental physical forces hitherto unknown to science .
Either way , why are they wasting their talents doing party turns on television ? "
[ Richard Dawkins , The Richard Dimbleby Lecture : Science , Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder ]
" Certainly I see the scientific view of the world as incompatible with religion , but that is not what is interesting about it .
It is also incompatible with magic , but that also is not worth stressing .
What is interesting about the scientific world view is that it is true , inspiring , remarkable and that it unites a whole lot of phenomena under a single heading . "
[ Richard Dawkins ]
" It is often said , mainly by the " no- contests " , that although there is no positive evidence for the existence of God , nor is there evidence against his existence .
So it is best to keep an open mind and be agnostic .
At first sight that seems an unassailable position , at least in the weak sense of Pascal 's wager .
But on second thoughts it seems a cop-out , because the same could be said of Father Christmas and tooth fairies .
There may be fairies at the bottom of the garden .
There is no evidence for it , but you can't * prove * that there are n't any , so should n't we be agnostic with respect to fairies ? "
[ Richard Dawkins ]
" In childhood our credulity serves us well .
It helps us to pack , with extraordinary rapidity , our skulls full of the wisdom of our parents and our ancestors .
But if we do n't grow out of it in the fullness of time , our ... nature makes us a sitting target for astrologers , mediums , gurus , evangelists , and quacks .
We need to replace the automatic credulity of childhood with the constructive skepticism of adult science . "
[ Richard Dawkins ]
" They express a preference for ' natural ' methods of population limitation , and a natural method is exactly what they are going to get .
It is called starvation . "
[ Richard Dawkins , " The Selfish Gene " ]
" Science offers us an explanation of how complexity ( the difficult ) arose out of simplicity ( the easy ) .
The hypothesis of God offers no worthwhile explanation for anything , for it simply postulates what we are trying to explain .
It postulates the difficult to explain , and leaves it at that .
We cannot prove that there is no God , but we can safely conclude the He is very , very improbable indeed . "
[ Richard Dawkins , from the _New Humanist_ , the Journal
of the Rationalist Press Association , Vol 107 No 2 ]
" The trouble is that God in this sophisticated , physicist 's sense bears no resemblance to the God of the Bible or any other religion .
If a physicist says God is another name for Planck 's constant , or God is a superstring , we should take it as a picturesque metaphorical way of saying that the nature of superstrings or the value of Planck 's constant is a profound mystery .
It has obviously not the smallest connection with a being capable of forgiving sins , a being who might listen to prayers , who cares about whether or not the Sabbath begins at 5 pm or 6 pm , whether you wear a veil or have a bit of arm showing ; and no connection whatever with a being capable of imposing a death penalty on His son to expiate the sins of the world before and after he was born . "
[ Richard Dawkins ]
" If you have a faith , it is statistically overwhelmingly likely that it is the same faith as your parents and grandparents had .
No doubt soaring cathedrals , stirring music , moving stories and parables , help a bit .
But by far the most important variable determining your religion is the accident of birth .
The convictions that you so passionately believe would have been a completely different , and largely contradictory , set of convictions , if only you had happened to be born in a different place .
Epidemiology , not evidence . "
[ Richard Dawkins ]
" Blind faith can justify anything .
In a man believes in a different god , or even if he uses a different ritual for worshipping the same god , blind faith can decree that he should die - on the cross , at the stake , skewered on a Crusader 's sword , shot in a Beirut street , or blown up in a bar in Belfast .
Memes for blind faith have their own ruthless ways of propagating themselves .
This is true of patriotic and political as well as religious blind faith . "
[ Richard Dawkins , " The Selfish Gene " ]
" Faith is the great cop - out , the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence .
Faith is belief in spite of , even perhaps because of , the lack of evidence . "
[ Richard Dawkins ]
" I suspect that today if you asked people to justify their belief in God , the dominant reason would be scientific .
Most people , I believe , think that you need a God to explain the existence of the world , and especially the existence of life .
They are wrong , but our education system is such that many people do n't know it . "
[ Richard Dawkins ]
" The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is , at bottom , no design , no purpose , no evil and no good , nothing but blind pitiless indifference . "
[ Richard Dawkins , " River Out of Eden " ]
" On the contrary , if the universe were just electrons and selfish genes , meaningless tragedies like the crashing of this bus [ full of children from a Roman Catholic school and for no apparent reason but with wholesale loss of life ] are exactly what we should expect , along with equally meaningless _good_ [ italics in original ] fortune .
Such a universe would be neither evil nor good in intention .
It would manifest no intentions of any kind .
In a universe of blind physical forces and genetic replication , some people are going to get hurt , other people are going to get lucky , and you wo n't find any rhyme or reason in it , nor any justice .
The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is , at bottom , no design , no purpose , no evil , and no good , nothing but blind , pitiless indifference . "
[ Richard Dawkins , _River Out of Eden : A Darwinian View of
Life_ , 1995 , BasicBooks , New York ; ISBN 0-465-01606-5 ]
" I suspect the reason is that most people [...] have a residue of feeling that Darwinian evolution is n't quite big enough to explain everything about life .
All I can say as a biologist is that the feeling disappears progressively the more you read about and study what is known about life and evolution .
I want to add one thing more .
The more you understand the significance of evolution , the more you are pushed away from the agnostic position and towards atheism .
Complex , statistically improbable things are by their nature more difficult to explain than simple , statistically probable things . "
[ Richard Dawkins , from the _New Humanist_ , the Journal
of the Rationalist Press Association , Vol 107 No 2 ]
" The theory of evolution by cumulative natural selection is the only theory we know of that is in principle capable of explaining the existence of organized complexity . "
[ Richard Dawkins , _ The Blind Watchmaker_ ( New York : W. W. Norton & Company , 1987 ) , p. 317 ]
" And it 's not just faith itself : it 's the idea that faith is a virtue and the less evidence there is , the more virtuous it is .
You can actually quote , well , Tertullian for example : " It is certain because it is impossible . "
Sir Thomas Brown , actually seeking for more difficult things to believe , because things for which there is mere evidence are just too easy , and it 's no test of his faith .
In order to have a test of your faith , you must be asked to believe really daft things like the transubstantiation , you know , the blood of Christ turning into wine , and stuff ...
That is so manifestly absurd that you 've got to be a really great believer , in the class of the Electric Monk , in order to believe it .....
You 're actually showing off your believing credentials by the ability to believe something like that ...
If it were an easy thing to believe , substantiated by facts , then it would n't be any great achievement . "

[ Sigmund Freud , Austrian physician and
pioneer psychoanalyst ( 1856-1939 ) ]
" While the different religions wrangle with one another as to which of them is in possesion of the truth , In our view the truth of religion may be altogether disregarded ... if one attempts to assign religion it 's place in mans evolution , it seems not so much to be a lasting acquisition , as a parallel to the neurosis which the civilized individual must pass through on his way from childhood to maturity .

" No , our science is no illusion .
But an illusion it would be to suppose that what science cannot give us we can get elsewhere . "

" A great deal is already gained with the first step : the humanization of nature .
Impersonal forces and destinies cannot be approached ... if everywhere in nature there are Beings around us of a kind that we know in our own society .... we can apply the same methods against these violent supermen outside that we employ in our own society ; we can try to adjure them , to appease them , to bribe them , and , by so influencing them , we may rob them of a part of their power

"

" Our creationist detractors charge that evolution is an unproved and unprovable charade -- a secular religion masquerading as science .

This claim is nonsense .
We make and test risky predictions all the time ; our success is not dogma , but a highly probable indication of evolution 's basic truth . "

A WWII action - adventure picture being executive produced by Mr. Star Wars himself , George Lucas , has made some headway in the casting department .
According to Variety , Academy Award nominee Terrence Howard , A cademy Award winner Cuba Gooding Jr , and Bryan Cranston have signed on to star in Red Tails , about the Tuskegee Airmen .
The cast already included Nate Parker , David Oyelowo , Tristan Wilds , Method Man , Lee Tergesen , Ne - Yo , Elijah Kelley , Andre Royo and Jesse Williams .
Anthony Hemingway is directing the film for the Lucasfilm production company which will soon begin shooting in Europe .
It ’s nice to see that Cuba is going to be doing something that might actually show people why he got that Oscar in the first place , because he has n’t put out anything worth a damn since the epic Alaskan survival tale that was Snow Dogs .
Hopefully he wo n’t have a part the size of his Pearl Harbor bit .

As promised today comes the next part of Soviet posters .
Some people ask to be more exact about the dating of each poster , but it ’s almost impossible , they come from personal collections and go without a date .
Soviet army participated in the Afghanistan war in 80s , and Soviet propaganda points here on the source of funding for those who oposed Soviet army in Afghanistan .
I think that was not far away from truth , remember that Rambo the Last movie , or it has been said that Osama was the main heroe of Afghani war .
“ We sow Peace !
They sow Death !
Two Worlds – Two Plans ! ” , an American part of the poster , the lower one depicts “ locations for army bases ”
This is how USA makes Third World countries to be entirely dependent on them .
Uncle Sam offers to Pentagon a plate with the sign “ Increasing Strategic Weapons ” , Pentagon does not mind to have it .
It ’s self depictive .
Again two worlds two plans .

Nilssen says the shots were fired on Friday as pupils gathered for classes in the playground outside the 300 - student Kanebogen primary school .
State radio network NRK says the boy fired when teachers tried to take the gun away from him and that the shots went over the school roof .
Police say a teacher then took the gun without further incident .
Police say the boy is being looked after by school officials and public health experts .
Roger Friedman , an entertainment columnist for FoxNews.com , discovered over the weekend just what Rupert Murdoch means by “ zero tolerance ” when it comes to movie piracy .
On Friday , the film studio 20th Century Fox  owned by the News Corporation , the media conglomerate ruled by Mr. Murdoch  became angry after reading Mr. Friedman ’s latest column .
( Movie bloggers had started opining about it late Thursday , alerting the studio . )
The subject was “ X - Men Origins : Wolverine , ” a big - budget movie that was leaked in unfinished form on the Web last week .
Mr. Friedman posted a minireview , adding , “ It took really less than seconds to start playing it all right onto my computer . ”
The film studio , which enlisted the F.B.I. last week to hunt the pirate , put out a statement calling Mr. Friedman ’s column “ reprehensible , ” among other things .
Then the News Corporation weighed in with its own statement , saying it asked had Fox News to remove the column from its Web site .
( It did . )

KALAMAZOO --
The economy has more people reaching out for a helping hand .
The problem is , there 's less to give out .
" The time our nonprofits need to be the strongest , we have challenges , " said Mike Larson , president of the Greater Kalamazoo United Way .
" We 're seeing a tremendous growth in need , specifically basic needs .
People who never thought they would need services are there , whether it 's food or some other basic need .
Traditionally , if you have those needs , you have other needs too . "
Food banks are among those struggling mightily .
Wayland Area Christian Neighbors Food Pantry has seen its demand double in the past two years .
At the same time , donations are down 50 percent .
The increased need has wiped out the pantry 's savings , and by the end of this month the pantry will have exhausted the cash donations it collected during the holidays .
" It 's scarier than it 's ever been now that the numbers have doubled , " said KeLinda Scott , pantry director .
Of the 328 families served last year at the pantry , 185 were new .
Among all those served , the biggest increase was in children and those between age 21 to 40 .
" That 's a working age , " Scott said of the adults .
Those new to the pantry include a teacher , a part - time police officer and a minister .
" These are middle - class , prosperous people with white - collar jobs , " Scott said .
" They can't believe they 're here . "
The pantry , which is open on Tuesdays , gave out 47,000 pounds of food last year , compared to nearly 35,000 pounds in 2007 .
The pantry spends about $ 2,000 a month on nonperishable healthy food such as tuna fish , peanut butter and canned soup .
It is supported by donations and several organizations and schools that collect food .
Senior center needs funding
Other nonprofit agencies , such as the Ecumenical Senior Center in Kalamazoo , are having similar struggles .
The Ecumenical Senior Center serves mostly low - income , elderly African - Americans and operates on about $ 150,000 annually .
The center is facing a $ 50,000 shortfall by July 1 if donations do n't increase .
" It 's tough all over , " said Executive Director Joseph Scott .
" Organizations like ours are dependent entirely on donations . "
The center is open daily , offering free services and programs and a hot lunch daily .
Last year , the center served 5,000 meals .
Some are unable to afford the suggested $ 2 donation , Scott said .
If funding continues to decline , services could be cut , he said .
" If we had to roll back services , or , God forbid , close , I do n't know where they 'd go .
For some , this is the only meal they get .
... I 'm planning on the faith and goodwill of the community that started this organization to not let ... ( it close ) , " Scott said .
Demands increasing
Larson , of Greater Kalamazoo United Way , said he suspects that the need locally will continue to grow .
" I do n't see the end in sight , " he said .
Greater Kalamazoo United Way partners with 43 agencies to fund 61 area programs .
Larson said he does n't know of any group at risk of closing but that all the agencies are re-evaluating what services they can offer and how to provide them .
United Way is n't immune to the struggle .
Its 2008 fundraising campaign was down 17 percent , to about $ 8.9 million -- the first decline in years .
" Obviously , it 's going to trickle down and impact the organizations who we partner with , " Larson said .
Although there is hope that the federal government 's economic stimulus program will help local service organizations , Larson said he 's unsure what to expect , who will benefit and when .
Some nonprofits stable
Not all nonprofit agencies are experiencing such struggles .
Ken Greschak , director of the American Cancer Society 's Southwest Michigan Area Service Center , said the center expects to raise $ 2.4 million this year -- consistent with last year 's fundraising amount -- to support local programs and cancer research .
People are touched by cancer and continue to give , he said
.
Greschak also credited volunteers with supporting the society 's mission .
" What we have is 15,000 volunteers , when you start counting Relay ( For Life ) team captains , " he said , referring to the cancer society 's signature 24 - hour fundraiser .
" If we weather this storm , it will be on the backs of our volunteers . "
Greschak said there has been greater demand for the cancer society 's services , noting a 70 percent increase in the number of newly diagnosed cancer patients who have contacted the organization .
The center offers services such as free transportation to medical appointments .
The Hangover after the Party Eastern Europe 's Economic Crash
The global downturn has hit Eastern Europe with particular vengeance .
Countries that profited more than many others from globalization and were previously capitalism 's rising stars are now seeing demand for exports collapse , along with their currencies .
They are bracing for a hard landing .
UNITED NATIONS - UN boss Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday added his voice to calls for the release of the 19 United Nations staffers currently under arrest , missing or detained around the world .
" I call on member states and non-state actors to release them immediately , " Ban said at a UN headquarters ceremony to mark the 24th International Day of Solidarity with Detained and Missing Staff Members .
The ceremony , sponsored by the UN Staff Union , highlighted the dangers faced by journalists as well as UN and humanitarian personnel in carrying out their work .
" While there is a treaty in place protecting staff , states still do not fully comply , " UN Staff Union Vice President Thomas Ginivan said .
" The UN establishes missions and offices , yet staff assigned find themselves increasingly in the line of fire with little support or proper security in place , " he added .
" Political factions reportedly have targeted staff while on humanitarian missions . "
Ban said locally recruited personnel are the most vulnerable , and account for a majority of security incidents .
" But anyone serving the United Nations , supporting us as a partner or reporting on our work , is a potential victim , as recent hostage incidents in Niger and Pakistan attest . "
The UN secretary general drew attention to current efforts to secure the release of two Canadian UN officials snatched in Niger in December , Robert Fowler and Louis Guay , as well as that of American John Solecki , a UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) official abducted in Pakistan , as well as detained staff of the UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea .
Fowler and his assistant Guay were kidnapped in the West African country while returning from a visit to a gold mine operated by Canadian company Semafo west of Niamey .
They are believed to be held by Moctar Ben Moctar , one of the leaders of Al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb .
Solecki , the local head of the UNHCR , was seized at gunpoint in Quetta , the capital of southwestern province of Baluchistan , on February 2 .
His driver was killed .
The International Day of Solidarity marks the anniversary of the March 25 , 1985 kidnapping of British journalist Alec Collet by gunmen near Beirut airport .
Collett , a former UN Information Centre Director , was serving with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ( UNRWA ) .
He has never been seen again and his case remains unsolved .
He called on the companies to produce statements that are clearly written and do not have any confusing terms and conditions .
He also proposed that every company issue a “ plain - vanilla , easy - to - understand , simplest - terms possible credit card ” to make it easier for the average consumer .
Mr. Obama was told by executives that the industry still faced its own financing problems , as roughly half of the nation ’s credit card debt is repackaged and sold as securities to investors in what is called the secondary market , which is still largely frozen .
The president responded that he was sympathetic and that the Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner , had been working to thaw the credit markets .
In response to one executive who was trying to make the case for less regulation , Mr. Obama told the executives to remember that they were “ talking to a president who still has a very fresh memory of relying on credit cards ” to finance his lifestyle .
“ I know them firsthand , ” he reportedly said .
Mr. Obama ’s firm tone left some executives resigned .
One executive told the president that although her assignment had been to try to persuade the president not to support new restrictions , “ it was pretty clear I wo n’t succeed . ”
“ You ’re probably right , ” the president replied .
“ But you should feel free to make your pitch . ”
The comment prompted the room to break out in laughter .
The House measure is likely to sail through next week , lawmakers and lobbyists predicted .
Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York , said a similar measure that he and others have been working on would be on the floor of the Senate before the Memorial Day recess .
Lawmakers said on Thursday that they had agreed to some amendments that were being sought by senior White House officials .
One provision would require the credit card companies to apply consumer payments first to any debt that has the highest interest rate .
Last week Chinese ingenuity brought us a homemade scrap-metal F1 replica car .
Today we 've got ourselves a Chinese Icarus - wannabe who made his own homemade helicopter .
Though not constructed of scrap parts , it 's nonetheless epic .
Advertisement
Chen Zhao Rong is the builder of this crazy little homemade helicopter and has somewhat of an amazing little tale .
His education seemingly failed him before he made it to middle school and never learned to read English , limiting him to some really horrible Engrish .
But Chen 's always been more interested in mechanical engineering , though without the formal education and training , than English .
But he 's had to figure both out on his own .
Now there are plenty of people out there that fit within the same realm as Chen , but they typically do n't set out to build a helicopter as their first project .
Advertisement
Chen decided the only way he'd be able to realize his dream was by using the vast resource of the often time - blocked or heavily - censored Chinese internet , attempting to locate foreign - language flight and engineering websites .
It was on these sites where he spent countless hours poring over schematics and carefully studying diagrams in order to start building his own personal helicopter .
When he was confident enough in his abilities , Chen started out by building and welding all of the parts himself , all the while , cross checking his internet - sourced research images .

Once he had completed all necessary components for the space frame , he located , purchased and mounted an older used motor .
He had finally completed the build of his very own , homemade helicopter after roughly two years of development and a little less than RMB 70,000 ( $ 10,294 USD ) , but there was one final challenge that faced Chen —
He needed to learn how to fly it ... without killing himself .

Eventually , after many false starts ,
Chen got himself off the ground like the little Chinese Wright Brother he is and as you can see in the video below , he looks to be fairly confident in his homemade craft 's abilities .

Chen 's luck would not last long .
In May 2008 , while he was taking to the skies on his way to a neighboring village his motor sputtered to a stop at nearly 70 km/h , sending him hurtling back to Earth and eventually landing in a field .
Chen managed to survive the crash and even walked his self - defeated ass all the way back home .
He probably wished he would have died because when he finally arrived back home , his wife was irate and left him for a week and then threatened to leave him for good if he did n't stop flying .
Not only was Chen 's wife unhappy , but news of his crash traveled the airwaves and eventually caught the attention of local police who made him sign a document stating that he would never fly again .

We heartily applaud Chen and plan to induct him into the Jalopnik DIY Hall Of Fame , alongside Basement Lamborghini Guy .

Sarah Palin is seeking the advice of a Scientologist as she plots her 2012 presidential run , which just makes sense to us .
John P. Coale , a prominent Washington lawyer and power - broker , is secretly running Palin 's political action committee and working to " protect the Palin brand , " according to the Washington Post .
He is very , very good at doing that because he can walk through walls and read minds and leave his body and never gets sick because he is a Scientologist .
Coale is also the husband of Fox News Channel 's Greta Van Susteren , whom he recruited into the church .
Van Susteren 's penetration of the Palin clan is total — she 's been in Alaska practically every other week burnishing Palin 's image in friendly profiles .
The church 's recruitment strategy has always been to snag high - profile converts like Tom Cruise and Will Smith , and it is well known for dispatching operatives on elaborate covert schemes to draw unsuspecting targets into the cocoon .
Coale is no Scientology slouch ; according to a web site that tracks public announcements of Scientology course completions , he appears to have reached OT - VII , the cult 's second most powerful level .
His most recent training , in 2005 , was in how to " detect and handle suppressive persons " — that means you , Todd !
On the other hand , Alaskans do n't have a great history with L. Ron Hubbard — in 1940 , he reportedly decamped to Ketchican on a " radio - experimental expedition , " got a loan from a local bank , and split town .
Palin , with her wild - eyed confidence and preposterously healthy skin , already seems vaguely Scientological ; " Keep Scientology Working ! " is n't a bad rejoinder to " Yes We Can , " right ?
GHENT , Belgium , March 27 - New team sponsor logos will mingle with the old as the riders pass over the hard cobbles of Belgium to race this cycling - mad nation ’s most important one - day classic , the Tour of Flanders , next month .
In early - season races this year , last year ’s most successful team , Columbia - Highroad , parked their motorhome in the same church square in Ghent as fellow U.S. squad Garmin - Slipstream , just across from the buses of new teams from Russia and the Netherlands .
Team owners say cycling is a cheap path to pan-European brand awareness and this year sponsors have come to bike racing seeking inexpensive sports marketing deals .
“ The last time we did a cross - sport analysis , cycling was about a buck twenty - five , ” said Columbia - Highroad ’s owner Bob Stapleton , speaking of the sponsors ’ return on investment as a ratio of cost per one thousand media impressions , or CPM .
“ Formula One teams were about 25 - 30 euros ( 23 - 28 pounds ) per CPM ... and then football ( soccer ) was about 35 ( euros ) .
If we look at our results last year we were down in the 20 - 30 cents per thousand range , ” Stapleton said ahead of the April 5 Tour of Flanders .
Columbia - Highroad won 85 races in 2008 , including five stages and 20 podium appearances at the Tour de France .
“ For five million euros a year , you can get a lot of exposure in cycling , ” said Stapleton .
European sports advertising was worth around 5.3 billion euros in 2008 , according to Italian sports marketing group StageUp .
As companies slash an expected 11.3 percent from those budgets in 2009 , cycling looks like a bargain deal .
SPORTING DOWNTURN
Team Vacansoleil , sponsored by a holiday campsite operator with sites in 15 European countries , is run by accountant Daan Luijkx , who said full naming rights and nine months of televised racing made cycling team sponsorship attractive to businesses .
“ In the past Vacansoleil sponsored a lot of football teams in all their countries , one in England , one in Belgium , one in Holland , one in France .
Now they have put their budget together and now they have their own team , ” Luijkx said .
“ Unlike in football , where Ajax will always be Ajax , never the ABN - AMRO team , this team will be called Vacansoleil for at least three years , and probably four to six . ”
Europe ’s two most popular spectator sports , Formula One and soccer , are facing budget contraction as sponsors draw away from expensive deals in search of cheaper ways to advertise .
The English FA ’s chairman David Triesman said last year that English soccer was collectively three billion pounds in debt , and that he could not rule out a top club collapsing .
Manchester United 's record 56.5 - million - pound jersey sponsorship agreement with American International Group AIG.L will not be renewed when it expires in May next year , after the insurance company 's repeated bailouts by the U.S. government .
AIG have also been discussing the current deal with the club .
Honda have pulled out of Formula One as a result of the global credit crunch and concern lingers over the commitment of fellow carmakers Toyota and Renault .
REVENUE STREAMS
Russian cycling team Katyusha , newly formed this year with a 20 - million - euro , Kremlin - funded budget as a child health education programme , has no commercial goals for its corporate sponsors .
“ The oil and gas companies that make up our sponsors , Itera , Gazprom and Rosstechnology , have no need for advertising , ” said Andrey Tchmil , Katyusha ’s manager .
“ Our project is global cycling awareness for Russian youth , to get kids involved in sport , away from bad habits . ”
To compete with Katyusha ’s non-commercial goals , fill budget gaps and add cash where sometimes sponsorship means discounted equipment and stocks of water bottles , U.S. team Garmin - Slipstream created fan - club sponsorships .
“ For us to be competitive with a team funded by a government , we have to have a similar - sized budget in order to recruit athletes of a similar calibre , ” said Jonathan Vaughters , manager of Garmin - Slipstream .
“ It ’s a way to make up that 10 - 20 percent gap between a commercial sponsor who is able to give X amount of dollars because they can justify it with strict marketing metrics , and a government that can just plunk down a hunk of cash , ” he said .

It marked a threshold moment in relations between the current superpower and the potential one - Beijing demonstrated that it is prepared to use its financial power over the US as an instrument of pressure .
US officials , including Barack Obama himself , hastened to reassure the Chinese over the weekend .
" Not just the Chinese Government , but every investor can have absolute confidence in the soundness of investments in the US . "
Wen 's remark was not random .
It was made in answer to a pre-approved question at his annual news conference .
It came just as his Foreign Minister , Yang Jiechi , was in Washington to negotiate with the US the approach the two countries would take to the Group of 20 summit in London on April 2 .
And it emerged a few weeks after Hillary Clinton went to Beijing and explicitly called on the Government to keep buying US bonds - the Obama Treasury is hoping to sell the world another $ 1.7 trillion in treasuries this year to pay for the US Government 's deficit .
In other words , the US , the world 's biggest debtor , finds itself unusually vulnerable .
And China , the world 's biggest creditor , is newly powerful .
It is the culmination of the different ways the US and China have pursued power .
In 1992 China formally adopted a new concept of the national interest it called " comprehensive national power . "
This is officially defined as " the totality of a country 's economic , military and political power " .
Among these , economic power has held priority as the basis for all other forms of power .
And this has been the national strategy ever since .
By contrast , the US , especially under George Bush , put increasing emphasis on its military as its preferred instrument of power .
Fiscal prudence was not just overlooked but violated .
When Bush 's first treasury secretary , Paul O'Neill , warned the vice - president Dick Cheney against tax cuts because of the looming deficit , Cheney said : " Reagan proved deficits do n't matter . "
O'Neill 's resistance cost him his job .
Of course , he was right .
The deficit has emerged starkly as a vulnerability of the US state .
It was in Reagan 's term that the US went from being the world 's major creditor to becoming its biggest debtor .
Bush , his ideological and political heir , has left the US , at the end of a boom , with a deficit of half a trillion dollars .
To fight off recession , Obama is putting the country into much deeper deficit .
One of China 's most influential strategic thinkers , Yan Xuetong , observed some years ago that China had put its communist ideologies aside in pursuit of economic growth , while the US increasingly based its economic policies on political ideology : " Which is the ideological country now ? " he asked .
The jostling of a US Navy survey vessel by five Chinese ships in the South China Sea last week provided a timely illustration of the weakness of America 's narrow concept of power .
The Chinese ships crowded around the US vessel and put wooden barriers in the water ; the US ship turned its firehoses on the Chinese sailors .
The US might have decided to press its case .
But it would then have to face the reality that its defence budget is crucially supported by the very country it wanted to confront .
China 's options for retaliation would include abandoning US government bonds .
It could even dump its existing US treasuries , which could seriously damage the country 's ability to finance itself on reasonable terms .
Obama 's recovery plans could be at risk .
But , of course , if Beijing waged fiscal war on Washington , it would rebound .
Twenty - one per cent of Chinese exports go to the US .
By sabotaging the US recovery , China would be crimping its own .
This is the financial version of the doctrine of " mutually assured destruction " that kept the US and the Soviet Union from launching their nuclear arsenals at each other during the Cold War .
Wen made exactly this point in his news conference : " On the foreign reserves issue , the first consideration is our national interest .
But we also have to consider the stability of the overall international financial system , as the two factors are interlinked . "
The market reaction to Wen 's remarks took this into account .
Investors read the comment as a negotiating ploy .
Already , Obama has agreed to support China 's demand for voting power in the International Monetary Fund , and no doubt other demands are under negotiation in Washington right now .
Still , the world nearly came to an end twice in the Cold War , during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 and Operation Able Archer in 1983 .
The deterrent power of mutually assured destruction depends on rationality and sound flows of information , never assured in a real crisis .
As Lawrence Summers , the chairman of Obama 's council of economic advisers , said five years ago : " It surely can not be prudent for us as a country to rely on a kind of balance of financial terror . "
Yet that is exactly the calculus holding together what is left of the global economy .

Cheap , solar - power Kyoto Box cooker for rural Africa
If you are smart enough , it ’s always good to invent smart and efficient things for people to use in lesser extravagant surroundings .
Jon Bohmer has invented a cheap , solar - powered cardboard cooker for rural Africa called the Kyoto Box .
This invention can apparently help prevent two tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per family per year .
It consists of two cardboard boxes with an acrylic cover .
This allows the sun ’s power to come in and not leave .
A layer of straw or newspaper between the boxes provides insulation , while black paint on the interior and the foil on the exterior help ion preserving the heat .
The Kyoto Box costs just $ 5 and can be produced at any cardboard factory .
Also on the cards are a more durable model made from recycled plastic .
The main aim of this is to reduce health problems in the rural villages while also avoiding carbon dioxide emissions .

It ’s about 5:00 in the afternoon , it ’s been raining all day and now into the night , and the radio says it ’ll keep raining well into tomorrow .
The phone rings .
It ’s my arts editor at the Baltimore City Paper .
He sounds like he ’s ready to go home .
“ I ’ve got a play for you , ” he says .
The rain is beating against the windows .
“ Hapgood , ” he says .
“ By Tom Stoppard .
You good with it ? ”
Before I can think of an excuse not do it , he thanks me .
I pop a burrito in the microwave and watch it expand slowly .
Then I find my green notebook , call and cancel on my girlfriend , and grab the car keys .
I head out into the cold , wet Sunday night .
This will be my 123rd night of Baltimore community theater .
But who ’s counting ?
I started counting five years ago , when the editor at City Paper decided he needed someone to cover local theater .
That was partly because someone else had gotten sick of doing that , and had started a column on local bars .
I was the man for the job : I was a writer in need of some steady work , I had n’t seen any plays in Baltimore yet , and , maybe most important , I was willing to do anything for very little money .
They eased me gradually into the job .
For the first assignment I was sent to Center Stage , Baltimore ’s regional theater , to watch Shakespeare ’s A Winter ’s Tale .
I got free tickets , they gave me press packets and , on opening night , they gave me cheap champagne .
I came home , dissected the play , summed it up , listed three good things about the production and one bad thing , and ragged on one actor .
I was the Frank Rich of Baltimore , and I hurled my bolts of insight from the mountaintop :
If you like your Shakespeare straight up and easily pegged , the Bard ’s later plays can be problematic .
I could offer veiled criticism :
The main characters are a little less fiery than one might expect .
And I could always end with a bang :
This is the late Shakespeare , who pleases some , tries all , and does n’t really care if you walk away a little confused .
Just when I thought I had the job down , I ran out of professional theater to review — which , in Baltimore , does n’t take long .
But I kept getting assignments from the City Paper , and I noticed some funny things happening .
The ticket prices started plummeting .
I did n’t need to make reservations .
The audiences were getting smaller .
The people in the seats were getting older .
The theaters were harder to find .
And the actors were n’t necessarily bad , but , well , let ’s just say they stuck to their day jobs .
I had quickly spiraled down through Baltimore ’s few examples of semi- pro theater .
And minor - league theater .
And , because it was the only place to find more shows , I ended up at theater in the rough .
The people on stage were policemen , computer programmers , starry - eyed sophomores , retired schoolteachers .
The plays were n’t classics , but they were n’t exactly cutting - edge : Broadway standbys ( Art ) , comic dramas ( Fuddy Meers ) , zany madcap farces ( Lend Me a Tenor ! ) , and musicals , musicals , musicals .
And Sondheim .
My readership changed .
I was no longer writing for potential theatergoers , people looking for my advice on whether to shell out for tickets .
I was n’t even being read by the actors in the plays .
I was being read by their best friends and close relatives .
And they knew who I was .
They knew where I lived .
And they knew when I screwed up the names :
Thanks for the review and glad you found the show enjoyable .
Just a couple of little points …
The “ stern taskmaster ” you describe is actually Florindo , played by Chris Hickle .
This is not a gig for the weak of heart .
It ’s for the eternal optimist , the dead - end journalist who does n’t believe in dead ends .
It ’s for the tolerant , the cheerful , the brave and gratuitously creative .
It ’s a job for someone who does n’t have a lot to do on weekends .
•
Tonight , it ’s a job for someone willing to log 30 or 40 miles in the pouring rain for a community theater production of Stoppard .
The place is Villa Julie College .
I have no idea where the college is , so I call for directions and somehow end up talking to the athletics department .
Forty - five minutes later , I ’ve done exactly what the guy at the athletics department told me , and I still have no idea where I am .
Something ’s wrong .
There are signs above the highway telling me that if I keep going , I ’ll arrive in Philadelphia .
Standing at a gas-station phone in the driving rain , I discover I ’m so far lost that the call to the college is long - distance — and I do n’t have enough change to pay for it .
And no , I do n’t carry a cell phone .
I slam down the receiver so hard that its earpiece breaks .
Eventually , at a House of Pancakes , I get change , and I reach the athletics department again , and this time I ’m transferred to the school ’s arts director .
I tell her I ’m lost , wet , and , apparently , on the outskirts of Philly .
She tells me it ’s not that far .
“ Try to hurry , ” she says .
“ The play ’s scheduled to go up in ten minutes . ”
The Villa Julie College Players are waiting for me .
I head back along the same highway at about 90 miles per hour — peering through the downpour , avoiding cars on my blind side , trying to make out the exit numbers .
Then I exit .
Three deer step out in the road in front of me , their red eyes in my headlights .
They vanish .
And then I see a small white sign for the school .
It ’s a tiny , dark , nonresidential campus with one athletic center and one arts center , a large , squat , leaning tower of Pisa .
The lobby is deserted .
The arts director is sitting at a table ; she hands me a carefully prepared press packet like a baton .
I apologize for being late .
She accepts the apology .
They ’d held up the play for 15 minutes , she says , and then gone ahead , because the actors have to go home .
I ’ve missed the opening scene , she tells me .
But I know what she ’s thinking :
If I pan the show , I ’m toast , because she ’ll write a letter to the editor saying I arrived midway through the first act .
The 400 - seat theater is empty except for a few audience members , most of them with flowers .
The enormous stage is similarly empty — there ’s not much of a set , just a man and woman in dialogue .
I can barely hear them in the cavernous hall , but the guy is talking to her in a fake Russian accent about the Heisenberg principle .
There ’s a little note in the program itself .
According to the laws of quantum physics , light is generated not through waves but in particles of matter and antimatter .
I do n’t know what they ’re talking about — I keep forgetting that with Stoppard , there ’s a reading list you ’re supposed to complete before seeing the play — but I take out my notebook and begin to madly scribble fragments of their lines .
Meanwhile , strange things are happening on stage .
A briefcase full of classified information is swapped between two identical - looking figures .
I still ca n’t get their names straight .
There ’s something about identical twins .
British secret agents .
Some sort of leak .
I ’ll need to show I ’ve actually been to see the play .
Pastiche , I think .
Theatrical montage .
Sparse set .
Beckettian .
Swiftian .
Pirandelloesque .
I give up .
I ’m sitting there wedged between chairs , digging my fingernails into my forearm :
It ’s what I do to stop myself from falling asleep .
During intermission , I ask the acne - riddled undergrad at the urinal next to mine whether he understands what ’s going on .
I ask the question casually , not letting on that I ’m actually a semi- professional theater reviewer .
He tells me he has n’t the faintest idea , just knows the actress .
I look at the program .
He ’s probably the guy she dedicated her performance to , along with William Shakespeare , Bob Dylan , and her family .
And he ’s probably wondering why an older guy in a raincoat is coming out here on a Sunday night to watch a play his girlfriend is starring in .
I return to my seat , and the characters on stage are talking about quantum theory and how nothing is as it seems .
The actors seem as confused as I am .
There is a large chubby guy in a poncho .
Then there ’s a woman with red hair , who looks a little like – who was it , Liv Ullmann ?
I actually saw Liv Ullmann , years ago , in something by Ibsen .
But I ca n’t hear anything this actress is saying .
I am starting to nod off .
My pen and notepad fall to the ground .
Then I ’m jolted awake by a violent explosion : a gunshot .
I remember a note in the program warning me about it .
I have no idea who ’s shooting whom , or why , but the shots keep coming , one after the other .
People are exchanging identities .
This is all occurring in the Cold War .
Usually , even in the worst case scenario , things start moving toward the end .
It ’s not happening .
The voices all maintain their monotone .
One actress , I notice , is walking around on crutches .
That does n’t seem to have anything to do with the play itself .
When I emerge , 40 or 50 minutes later , my ears still ring .
A small crowd of kids is congregating in the lobby , waiting for their friends to come out , and I head to the garbage can full of opening - night microbrews .
It ’s a breach of journalistic integrity to take one , but it was a breach of something —
I ’m not sure what — to come here in the first place .
I drink two beers with strange names .
The arts director tells me a little about the college — mostly about how it ’s not as far away as everyone thinks it is .
•
It ’s 4 a.m. , and I ’m back home .
I got lost again on the way back , plus the car sort of broke down — and now I ’m finally sitting down to write the review .
I stare at the monitor .
Nothing comes to me .
The rain has stopped by now , and the rosy - fingered dawn is rising above Baltimore ’s skyline .
The world — or at least the friends and family of the cast — is waiting to see what the drama critic of the Baltimore City Paper has to say about Hapgood .
And what do I have to say ?
It was bad ?
It was so bad it was good ?
The kids were so bad you could n’t say they were bad ?
Or should I just tell the world to stay away from drama students trying to do plays they do n’t understand , especially on cold , rainy nights ?
By 6:30 a.m. I ’m tired .
My day job looms .
I remember the last letter to the editor , written in response to a review I ’d spent days agonizing over :
This is a harangue by someone who does not like the play or the writer .
It gives the reader no sense of the production itself .
As such , it is lazy and worthless .
Yes , there ’s a little bitterness .
I have bigger visions of my role as a critic .
But my critics seem to think that somehow it ’s my role in life to drive out there , 50 miles or so ( including detours and retreads ) , because they have something special to show me .
The world does n’t care what I write or how I write it ; the actors just want the thumbs up .
I ca n’t give it to them every time .
But just as I decide to let the world know that this particular production is a disaster , I remember a 20 - year - old college kid who got panned in his college newspaper for his leading role in a Sam Shepherd one - act .
John Barry was shameless in his overacting .
It ’s precisely these people who give contemporary theater a bad name .
Two decades later I still remember the name of the guy who wrote that .
Alex Lee .
I do n’t know where he lives , but if he had a less generic name , I ’d probably have found his address by now .
I remember what he looked like that night , squinting superciliously through his glasses in the front row , passing judgment on me , when all I wanted to do was act .
And to be honest , I was n’t that bad in the play .
He just caught me on a bad night .
The rain has stopped , for the moment , at least .
I ’ve taken slings and arrows in my life , but the ones in print take a lot longer to heal .
Okay , it was a crappy production .
Tom Stoppard ’s going to take the bullet .
Not that I have anything against Stoppard .
It ’s just that if he had n’t written the play , I would n’t have wasted my rainy night trying to squeeze something useful out of an amateur production .
I start to type : Stoppard is funny .
He ’s smart , he makes you think , he makes you drink .
The problem is that unless someone puts a cork in the Merlot at some point , he wo n’t shut up …
That ’s it , Tom .
Take that cork and shove it .
And another thing .
If I ’m only getting paid $ 55 for a sidebar review , do n’t tell me to bone up on Richard Feynman if I want to get the jokes .
And the actors themselves .
Think of them .
They have day jobs .
You know what a day job is ?
Did they ever teach you that at Oxford ?
It happens every time .
I ca n’t slam bad community theater .
I want to .
I want to be contrarian .
I want people to hang on my next word .
The dream will never die : getting drunk on martinis at Sardi ’s after closing down a Disney - sponsored Broadway production , and possibly , later in life , getting a chance to rant on a weekly basis in the opinion pages of the New York Times .
But when these actors read my reviews , they know I ’m one of them .
For most of us , cultural Baltimore is a marriage of convenience :
We ’re stuck with one another .
Outside my window , Saint Paul Street is tricking with people who ca n’t afford to live in DC , artists who never made it big , and lecturers who are desperately juggling four or five courses .
Huge swaths of the city to the west and east are stuffed with people whose chances for success are small .
Then there are the shoebox theaters trying to squeeze out a little applause from people willing to watch .
That population — people who like to watch plays just for the hell of it — is admittedly getting older and smaller .
Now , in a world where it ’s constantly pounded in our heads that there ’s someone more interesting going on somewhere else , people need to be told why they ’re doing it and what they ’re going to get out of it .
In Baltimore ’s community theater , that ’s not always clear .
There are n’t any big names , and no one ’s breaking new ground .
It ’s not guerilla theater , and it ’s not fringe theater .
It ’s exclusive , durable , conservative , filled with core actors and playwrights who are a little jealous of their turf and a little grumpy with people who wonder why they do n’t take a few more risks .
You ca n’t blame them :
They ’ve created a small comfort zone in a city where theater is underfunded , overlooked , and loved by a shrinking crowd of advocates .
Whenever I try to play Frank Rich with them , there ’s one question I ca n’t get out of my head :
Does the world need one more unread reviewer telling unseen actors to stick to their day jobs ?
After 123 reviews , I do n’t know the answer to that question .
Meanwhile , it ’s 7:55 .
I ’ve still got to give this production a thumbs up or a thumbs down .
In one hour , my editor will be sitting there , in his warm office , wondering casually where the hell my 400 - word theater sidebar is .
And I need the 55 bucks .
I head back to the computer and my fingers fly across the keyboard .
I start off with a breach of journalistic integrity .
I call it cushioning the blow : “ The Villa Julie Players offer Tom Stoppard a talented cast … ”
And now for the nugget of truth : “ in Hapgood , they barely get a chance to show it . ” • 11 September 2007

Five other people suffered minor injuries .
The fire service said the roof had collapsed and specialist teams with cutting gear were at the scene to make the factory safe .
More than 40 firefighters from West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service were called out to deal with the explosion .
Keith Robinson , group manager for the fire service , said it was too early to say what had caused the blast but said it was not suspicious .
He confirmed the body was still inside the wreckage of the building and would be recovered once the building was made structurally safe .
' Absolutely devastated ' A police spokesman said : " Due to structural damage at the bakery there have been difficulties in extracting the body of the deceased from the building .
" This will be done by specialist officers from the fire service once the property is made safe .
" Inquiries into the cause of the explosion are ongoing and a joint investigation involving the police , fire service and the Health and Safety Executive is currently under way . "
Floral tributes have been left at the scene .

The award - winning Andrew Jones
Pies has been established in the town for many years and supplies a number of supermarkets .
Graham Easby from the firm said it was a close knit workforce and everyone 's thoughts were with the families of those involved .
He said : " The people that have come with us have started out as apprentices , they 've grown up , you 've seen them grow up , you 've seen them go out for their first pint of beer , you 've seen them get married and have children .
" The colleagues that have been here today are absolutely devastated by what 's happened . "
On its website , the company said : " Due to unforeseen circumstances , the pie factory and our shops will remain closed until further notice . "

Michael Osinski , a former Wall Street computer programmer whose fancy software helped bring the banks to near collapse , says he is dismayed at the financial whirlwind
Telegraph.co.uk
As world leaders in London put the finishing touches to their G20 communiqué , Michael Osinski was up to his thighs in water on the other side of the Atlantic , retrieving oyster cages at low tide off a misty Long Island .
Nowadays , he supplies oysters to some of the best restaurants in Manhattan .
But he was following the efforts to reach agreement on tackling the global economic crisis with a deep personal interest .
For in his previous incarnation , Mr Osinski played a crucial , if inadvertent , role in stirring up the financial whirlwind that has battered the world .
As the top computer programmer for the titans of Wall St , he wrote the complex software that bundled home mortgages into bonds , making possible the subprime loans collapse that sparked the global meltdown .
“ I did n’t realise I was building a bomb at the time , ” said Mr Osinski , 55 , as he reflected on his part in the worst slump since the Great Depression .
“ I thought I was building something that was a valuable tool for the industry .
And for many years , it was . ”
But , he added wistfully , “ the software turned out to be more sophisticated than the people using it ” .
Mr Osinski decided to go public about his contribution to the crisis after two encounters in the same day .
“ I was in a coffee shop near my home and got talking to a stranger about what I used to do and at the end he said : ‘ You ’re the devil ’ , ” he recalled .
“ And shortly afterwards , I saw a friend and neighbour and he told me : ‘ You ’re the facilitator ’ . ”
So how does he feel that he was so intimately involved in a process that has devastated the savings of family , friends and strangers ?
“ To see your work contribute to this is shocking , ” he told The Sunday Telegraph .
“ I feel very bad and certainly somewhat responsible .
It nags at me .
But ultimately I feel more dismay than guilt that my work was used like this . ”
Mr Osinski ’s career path is a classic case of the law of unintended consequences .
After studying journalism at university in Florida , he was working for some small business publications in Atlanta when his fiancée Isabel was struck down by a serious kidney disease .
Lacking health insurance , he took a job at the city ’s Emory university entering computer data so that she could be treated , successfully , at its world - class clinic .
It was from here , in his - mid 20s , that he fell into the software - writing world .
In 1985 , aged 30 , Mr Osinski and the woman who was now his wife moved to New York , and he landed his first job on Wall St with Salomon Bros as a programmer .
“ In the pecking order , the computer guys were slight above the typing pool , figuratively and literally , ” he said .
“ We were a necessary annoyance for the traders . ”
But that was all about to change .
Just two years earlier , finance firms had started experimenting with “ securitisation ” , the process of turning mortgages into securities designed to spread the risk to lenders and investors .
When Mr Osinski asked his manager how these securities worked , he was told : “ You put chicken into the grinder and out comes sirloin . ”
His boss added perceptively that the bonds were also a guarantee of employment for computer programmers .
As traders indulged in the sort of excess and loutish behaviour that was captured in Tom Wolfe ’s portrayal of “ masters of the universe ” in his 1987 epic Bonfire of the Vanities , Mr Osinksi was making a reputation for himself streamlining the process for turning home loans into bonds .
His rewards were less dramatic than his colleagues – bonuses in the low hundred thousands rather than the millions thrown around on the trading floor – but generous nonetheless .
Securitisation is now one of the dirtiest words in the lexicon as blame is doled out for the fall of Wall St , but Mr Osinski says the technique used rightly and cautiously is sound .
“ Securitisation is a good thing when it allows firms correctly to price risk into their calculations , ” he said .
“ If people are re-paying their mortgages , then the process works fine .
But if you put garbage in , you ’ll get junk out . ”
Mr Osinski bounced around various Wall
St firms and ended up in 1995 with the company that supplied the software for nearly all the big finance houses .
It was also around now that a client asked him to enhance his software to include a new ingredient – “ subprime ” debt .
Mr Osinski ’s reaction was excitement at the prospect of both new customers and new challenges .
The loans were so - called because they were made to people who failed to meet standard , or prime , borrowing requirements , presenting a higher risk that was covered by charging much higher interest rates than for borrowers with good credit histories .
With house prices rising year after year , the theory was that people could simply refinance their properties at higher values and take out new loans as their repayments increased .
The laws of house price cycles were collectively forgotten or ignored , and lenders and borrowers alike were caught up in the wave of hubris , greed and naivety .
In 2001 , aged 45 , Mr Osinski retired from Wall St with a comfortable pay - off .
Burned out , he applied for permits to farm oysters in the waters off his summer house on the North Fork of Long Island , nearly 100 miles east and a world away from the cauldron of Manhattan ’s financial world .
Just a few months later , al Qaeda terrorists attacked the World Trade Centre .
The economy tottered but the housing market , driven by the booming world of subprimes , continued to flourish and ensured the good days continued for the denizens of Wall St .
The financial institutions developed ever more complex , mysterious and risky financial instruments , but still relied on the industry standard programmes Mr Osinksi developed .
In the meantime , he and Isabel raised a family , a son now aged nine and daughter , 10 , and developed a thriving oyster business .
But for more than a year , he has watched the wheels come disastrously off the bandwagon that he helped to fine - tune .
“ It is certainly unnerving when you see the world crumbling around you and you have an intimate knowledge about how that process came about , ” he said .
He has regrets every day , but they are tempered with the belief that others misused , sometimes fraudulently , his work .
“ One thing , do n’t portray me as a monster , ” he said , before going back to emptying the oyster cages he had just recovered from the sea -floor .

Absolutely not .
That was an erroneous report .
If anybody has violated the law , they 'll be held accountable , both as to criminal conduct and as to civil conduct .
And in no way did I promise amnesty or immunity or letting anybody off the hook .
We will be moving ahead , I hope shortly , with the leader calling the bill to the floor so that we can make a determination on judicial review to see to it that whatever wiretapping is going on is judicially approved .
It may be that some cases will come up collaterally .
There are a number of cases in district courts .
The one in Portland may have standing .
I do not propose , in my legislation , to strip any court of jurisdiction where a case has been started and has proceeded .
I think , in the course of business , the matters ought to be referred to the FISA court , but not for any jurisdiction stripping where courts have proceeded .
In any case before any court challenging the legality of classified information intelligence activity relating to a foreign threat , including an electronic surveillance program , or in which the legality of any such program or activity is in issue , if the Attorney General files an affidavit under oath that the case should be transferred to the Foreign Intelligence Court of Review because further proceedings in the originating court would harm the national security of the United States , the originating court shall transfer the case to the Foreign Intelligence Court of Review for further proceedings under this subsection .
the FISA court
What I have sought to accomplish is to have this program reviewed ; and the President has made a commitment , confirmed by the White House , that this program will be submitted for judicial review .
UPDATE
Compare
with
In June , both the ACLU and The Washington Post 's Walter Pincus reported that the FISA bill proposed by Arlen Specter would expressly immunize Bush officials from any legal consequences arising out of their illegal eavesdropping -- giving them what Pincus called " blanket amnesty " -- by retroactively legalizing warrantless eavesdropping going back to 1978 .
But that weekend , Specter went on CNN with Wolf Blitzer and categorically denied that his bill contained any such provision , stating :
At the time of Specter 's denial on national television , there was no copy of his bill available online , so I actually wrote a post aggressively criticizing Pincus for his erroneous claim , because I assumed that Sen .
Specter ( due to self - interest , if for no other reason ) would not go on national television and categorically deny that his bill contained what amounts to a Congressional pardon for the administration if it really did contain such a provision .
But once a copy of Specter 's became available that week , it turned out that Specter 's billAs I wrote at the time , the Post and the ACLU were completely correct and Specter -- in order to make his bill seem less draconian than it really was -- simply lied about what his own bill said ( that express amnesty provision was thereafter removed from the bill , though the effect of the current Specter bill might be the same ) .
In order to manipulate enactment of his FISA bill this week , Specter is lying again about his own bill .
I have a high threshold for using the word " lie " ; I try to avoid it whenever possible and use it only when there is no other accurate description for someone 's conduct .
That is the case here .
There are currently pending around the country various lawsuits against the Bush administration ( and telecom companies ) which allege that the President 's NSA program is both unconstitutional and a violation of the criminal law .
In one of them , the court ( Judge Taylor 's case ) has already ruled that the program is unconstitutional and a violation of FISA .
The Bush administration has been trying to get all of those cases transferred away from the various federal judges presiding over them and moved to the secret FISA court in Washington .
One of the criticisms which many people have made of Specter 's FISA bill is that it grants the administration 's wish by simply stripping these cases away from the judges currently deciding them -- several of whom have demonstrated hostility to the administration 's claims ( such as Judge Taylor in Michigan , Judge Walker in San Francisco , and Judge King in Oregon ) -- and sticking them all behind a wall of secrecy in the FISA court ( and then , after that , restricting appellate review and adding on new , possibly insurmountable hurdles for the plaintiffs to overcome ) .
I have repeatedly highlighted these court - stripping provision as one of the most objectionable aspects of the Specter bill -- here , for instance -- because it places judicial proceedings on these vital questions behind a secrecy wall ( even the decision itself could be kept secret ) and is also a blatant attempt by the administration to strip these federal judges of jurisdiction because they have shown that they will not just obediently accept any claims the administration makes .
On Thursday , though , Arlen Specter went to the floor of the Senate to defend his bill and he outright denied that his bill compels transfer of those cases to the FISA court .
This is what he said ( h/t EJ and Obijuan ) : That is just false - undeniably , unambiguously false .
Here is the version of the Specter bill reported by the Judiciary Committee .
Section 702 ( b ) is entitled " , " and this is what it says ( emphasis added ) : Specter 's bill mandates that " " challenging the legality of the NSA program be transferred to the FISA court , not only cases commenced in the future .
The administration already filed a Motion ( with the Multidistrict Litigation Panel ) requesting that all NSA cases be consolidated ina federal district court in the District of Columbia -- a move which deservedly backfired when that Panel denied the administration 's request and , instead , ordered all such cases consolidated with Judge Walker in San Francisco , who was the first judge ( of three ) to reject the administration 's claim that no court could review the legality of the NSA program because to do so would risk disclosure of " state secrets .
"
That 's why it is so important to the administration to have all of these cases yanked away from these judges who have shown independence and a willingness to scrutinize the administration 's claims .
The Specter bill does exactly that , and Specter 's denial that it does -- on the floor of the Senate -- is nothing more than a rank , indefensible falsehood .
And then there is the core dishonesty which lies at the heart of Specter 's defense of his bill .
In his Senate floor speech , Specter admitted that " But ever since the bill was announced , Specter has been trying to depict his humiliating capitulation to the White House as some sort of victory , and to do so , he has continuously touted one perversely hilarious claim -- namely , that he extracted the oral commitment from the President to " consent " to having the NSA program " submitted " to the FISA court for judicial review .
He made that same claim on Thursday on the Senate floor :
The level of ignorance and stupidity required to believe this is so extreme that it 's actually offensive .
In case Specter has n't noticed , the NSA program is already " submitted for judicial review " -- in Michigan , San Francisco , Oregon and numerous other places .
Specter 's bill does not increase the likelihood of judicial review .
It does the opposite -- it restricts what can be judicially adjudicated to the mere constitutionality of the program ( as to opposed to the question of whether the President 's lawbreaking was without a defense ) , and it makes judicial review more difficult in numerous ways .
The President 's " consent " is completely irrelevant to having this program submitted for judicial review .
In this country , courts can review the legality of the President 's conduct with or without the President 's " consent . "
Specter 's claim that he won this " concession " from the President would be like him reaching an agreement with the President where the President agreed that from now on , decisions about how monies will be appropriated will be made by the Congress -- or Specter excitedly announcing that he forced to President to magnanimously agree that from now on , the President 's nominees for the Supreme Court have to be approved by the Senate .
The President 's warrantless eavesdropping is already submitted for judicial review -- neither Specter 's bill nor the President 's consent is required in any way for that , nor would it help that process along .
It would do the very opposite , just as intended , by making judicial review infinitely more difficult and shrouding the whole process with a cloud of secrecy .
Specter obviously knows what a complete travesty -- a total capitulation -- his bill is , which is why he feels the compulsion to so blatantly misrepresent its contents . :
There is one slightly more technical but ( at least ) equally important false claim Specter keeps advancing .
In his Senate speech , Specter said : " There has been a contention raised that there is an inconsistency between Senator Feinstein 's bill , S. 3001 , and my bill , S. 2453 , and it is not true .
The provision in Senator Feinstein 's bill says that the FISA is the exclusive means for wiretapping .
That is true , unless the statute is superseded by a constitutional provision .
" That is exactly , appallingly wrong .
The Specter bill is , in the most critical respect , the polar opposite of the Feinstein bill .
The Feinstein bill purports to restrict the President 's eavedropping powers by making clear that they can be exercised only within the FISA framework .
By contrast , the Specter bill expressly states the opposite -- that it does not seek , in any way , to limit or restrict the President 's eavesdropping powers .
They are exact opposites on this most vital point .
Sec. 101 ( a ) of the Feinstein bill ( FISA " shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance . . . may be conducted " ) Sec. 801 of the Specter bill ( " Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the constitutional authority of the President to collect intelligence with respect to foreign powers and agents of foreign powers " ) .
Specter 's claim that they are consistent is a by - product of his much continuous inability ( or deliberate refusal ) to understand one of the most critical and basic principles of constitutional law -- that the mere fact that the President has a particular power under the Constitution does not mean that Congress is unable to restrict or regulate that power .
That is the whole point of Hamdan and Youngstown -- that where there is a conflict between a President 's constitutional power ( such as the right to try war detainees by military commissions ) and Congressional restrictions on that power ( such as a law requiring that all such military commissions comply with the laws of war ) , the President 's power is subject to Congressional law .
Feinstein 's bill deliberately creates that Youngstown / Hamdan conflict by requiring the President 's eavesdropping powers ( such as they are ) be exercised only in compliance with FISA , whereas Specter 's bill deliberately eliminates that conflict by specifying that there is no intent to regulate or restrict the President 's eavesdropping powers in any way .
Specter 's belief ( or claimed belief ) that a President 's constitutional power cannot be regulated by Congress is undebatably false .
To say that the two bills are consistent requires either an embarrassing lack of understanding of this basic constitutional principle or a decision to purposely ignore that principle .
I honestly do n't know which it is , but whichever it is , Specter 's central argument on the most crucial issue in this debate is just factually , demonstrably wrong .
