( CNN ) -- Walter Marino shouted to his 12 - year - old son , Christopher , as he drifted farther away in the Atlantic Ocean .
A Coast Guard crew found Christopher three miles away from where his father was rescued .
" To infinity , " the father yelled .
" And beyond , " Christopher replied .
After a rip current swept the boy and his father out to sea Saturday , darkness fell , and the sound of rescue helicopters and boats grew faint until they were nonexistent .
Despite the danger , Christopher , who has autism , was enjoying himself , his father said .
The boy lacks a fear of death because of his autism and finds comfort in the water , Marino told CNN .
Marino finds comfort in his son .
Their unique circumstances helped keep them alive for more than 12 hours in the open ocean , Marino said .
" With many kids with autism , the thing that is so dangerous is that they have no concept of fear or fear of death , " Marino said .
" In this case , though , it perhaps saved him -- that and the fact that water is one of his favorite things .
Whenever he goes missing or tries to run away , we can always find him near water ... even at the mall if it is just near a fountain . "

Christopher was laughing as the father and son were pulled farther and farther from Ponce Inlet , Florida .
As the pair lunged for buoys -- and missed -- Christopher could n't help but giggle .
It was this spirit that helped ground Marino , the father said .
" It was a big entertainment roller coaster for him , that 's what got me through it -- because he was n't freaking out , " said Marino , 46 .
But after four hours at sea without a life vest , and after it became obvious that rescue operations had ceased for the night , jellyfish began to sting the pair .
That began to " freak Christopher out , " his father said .
While Christopher is almost nonverbal in his communication , he and his father use catch phases from Disney movies , which the boy loves , to communicate .

After four hours , the currents picked up , and Christopher began to drift from his father 's reach .
Because of the darkness , they could n't see each other .
So Marino shouted out part of a phrase to his son .
" To infinity , " Marino shouted , referencing one of Christopher 's favorite lines from the movie " Toy Story . "
" And beyond , " Christopher shouted back , pumping his fist in the air like movie character Buzz Lightyear .
The call and response went on for a while , with Marino choosing different phrases and Christopher yelling back .
But over the course of an hour , Christopher 's voice faded until his father could n't hear him anymore .
" That 's when I resigned myself to the fact that he was gone , " Marino told CNN , saying he believed his son had been pulled under the water .
At the time , Marino said , he thought about giving up , until he thought of his daughter Angela .
She had just registered for ballroom dance classes , and he told himself over and over he would live to see her dance .
" I just kept thinking about her and how I was not going to leave her without a brother and her father in the same day -- not on my watch , " he told CNN .
" It was the visual of her that kept me going . "

Do you have an incredible story to share ?
Marino used other tricks to keep his mind focused in the 81 - degree water .
He remembered going to the Ponce Inlet museum , which highlighted a lighthouse .
He then set out to use the lighthouse as a guide for himself , so he would know how far he was from shore .
He alternated doing the " doggie paddle " and floating on his back with his ears in the water , the way his son loved to .
He would float on his back and watch the bright stars .
He wished on four shooting stars that flew by and used constellations in the sky to know what direction to go if he drifted away .

Under the stars and in the dark Atlantic , he turned to his spirituality , realizing his life was in God 's hands .
A religious medal rested on his chest .
As morning turned , Marino tried to stay alert for sounds that might mean help was near .
Hearing a boat motor , he waved frantically .
Soon , a group of fishermen pulled him aboard their boat .
A flash of light from the medallion had caught the eye of one of the anglers , who shouted at his brother at the helm to stop the boat , one of Marino 's rescuers told him .
The first thing Marino asked was if the men had heard anything about his son , but they had n't .
Marino began to grieve .
It had been nearly eight hours since he had last seen his son , and he believed he was gone for good .
He wept .
When the U.S. Coast Guard arrived , Marino asked them , too , about Christopher , but they said they had not found him .
The Coast Guard crew asked if he wanted to go to the hospital , but he decided to stay on the boat so the search for Christopher would n't be disrupted .
But Marino chose not to watch the water as the search went on .
" I chose to be down below , because I did n't want to see them pull up on Christopher being face - down in the water , " he said .
So the Coast Guard vessel steamed on .
After more than an hour , the boat went full throttle , jolting Marino backward in his space below deck .
Suddenly , the boat was idling , and Marino was asked to come topside .
" That was my personal green mile , " Marino told CNN , a reference to what some people call the walk on death row from the cell to the execution chamber .
" I took three steps up the green mile to the back of the deck , and they pointed to the helicopter and they said , ' You see that helicopter ?
It has your son on it , and he is fine , ' " Marino recalled a crew member saying .
Marino was so excited he began " kissing all the Coast Guard guys . "

The father and son were reunited at the emergency room at Halifax Medical Center in Daytona Beach , where they were treated for dehydration .
" We were both very weak , tired and thirsty , " Marino said .
" But I reached out and held his hand and could tell from the same sparkle in his eye that he was going to be fine . "
While Christopher can't truly communicate what he felt during those hours alone at sea , his father hopes that one day , he will be able to tell him what he felt alone in the Atlantic .
The one thing Marino knows is that his son still loves the water and that the experience has n't taken away that special comfort from him .
" It may be a while before we go back to a beach , " Marino said .
" But he still loves the water .
He 's already gotten back in a pool . "
Small Lots of Seed
Lots of seed may be imported without a phytosanitary certificate under the following conditions :
The importation of the seed is authorized by a written permit specifically for small lots of seed .
Permits are usually valid for 3 years and cover multiple importations .
The seed is not restricted under the Not Autorized Pending Pest Risk Analysis ( NAPPRA ) category in the Plants for Planting Manual ; is not of any Federal noxious weed species ; does not require an additional declaration on a phytosanitary certificate ; does not require treatment ; is not a parasitic plant ; is not genetically modified ; is not pelleted , coated , or imbedded in growing media , seed tape , cloth , or similar materials .
If the seed is a field / agricultural crop or vegetable , it meets the requirements of the Federal Seed Act import provisions in 7 CFR 361 .
If the seed is regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) or the Endangered Species Act , it meets the additional requirements .
The seed meets the following packaging and shipping requirements :
A typed or legibly printed seed list / invoice accompanies each shipment with the name of the collector / shipper , the botanical names ( at least to genus , preferably to species level ) listed alphabetically , as well as the country of origin , and country shipped from , for each taxon .
Each seed packet is clearly labeled with the name of the collector / shipper , the country of origin , and the scientific name at least to the genus , and preferably to the species , level .
The invoice / seed list may provide a code for each lot , which may be used on the seed packets in lieu of the full list of required information .
In this case , each packet must at least include the appropriate code , which is referenced to the entry for that packet on the seed list / invoice .
There are a maximum of 50 seeds of 1 taxon ( taxonomic category such as genus , species , cultivar , etc. ) per packet ; or a maximum weight not to exceed 10 grams of seed of 1 taxon per packet ;
There are a maximum of 50 seed packets per shipment ;
The seeds are free from pesticides ;
The seeds are securely packaged in packets or envelopes and sealed to prevent spillage [ Note : we recommend that seeds are packed in resealable , clear plastic envelopes to facilitate inspection ] ;
( vi ) The shipment is free from soil , plant material other than seed , other foreign matter or debris , seeds in the fruit or seed pod , and living organisms such as parasitic plants , pathogens , insects , snails , mites ; and
( vii )
At the time of importation , the shipment is sent to an approved port of entry listed in the permit .
How to Apply for a Small Lots of Seed Permit :
For fastest turn around time , apply on - line at https://epermits.aphis.usda.gov/epermits.
Alternately , use PPQ Form 587 , Application for Permit to Import Plants or Plant Products .
On the first line of section 3 of the application , enter “ SMALL LOTS OF SEED PROGRAM ” .
Starting on the second line , list the seed species and countries from which you want to ship each species .
If the list of species is long , you may enter “ eligible taxa ” .
By using this option , you are accepting responsibility for determining the eligibility of the seeds .
The Permit Unit cannot tell you if the species are eligible for importation if you do not list them .
A permit is issued for taxa that are admissible with no restrictions beyond the port of entry inspection .
If port of entry inspectors find prohibited or restricted seeds in your shipment , they will seize and destroy the ineligible kinds .
To determine the entry status of seed taxa , see ( 2 ) above and refer to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Manual 's reference section .
Click on The Plants for Planting Manual , and then find the List of Plants for Planting on the Chapter 6 of the manual .
Plants that are not listed in this section are generally admissible and eligible for the small lots of seed program .
Plants that are listed in this section are ineligible for the small lots of seed program , with the following exceptions :
A taxon is eligible for the small lots of seed program if the relevant manual entries exclude seeds ( check entries at both the genus and species levels and note family - level listings for Cactaceae , Cycadaceae and Rutaceae ) .
Species noted only as FSA - A or FSA -V in the “ other requirements ” column are eligible , but must meet the import provisions of the Federal Seed Act ; i.e. , the labeling must include variety names for vegetable seeds and lot numbers for both agricultural and vegetable seeds .
Species noted only as CITES or ESA in the “ other requirements ” column are eligible if accompanied by any required CITES or ESA permits .
Generally , seeds of both Threatened and Endangered plants are regulated under the Endangered Species Act ; however , the seeds of Threatened plants are not regulated if they come from cultivated plants .

Attentato / i in USA e altri luoghi mondiali
In a plan that would drastically remake New York City ’s skyline and shores , Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is seeking to put wind turbines on the city ’s bridges and skyscrapers and in its waters as part of a wide - ranging push to develop renewable energy .
The plan , while still in its early stages , appears to be the boldest environmental proposal to date from the mayor , who has made energy efficiency a cornerstone of his administration .
Mr. Bloomberg said he would ask private companies and investors to study how windmills can be built across the city , with the aim of weaning it off the nation ’s overtaxed power grid , which has produced several crippling blackouts in New York over the last decade .
Mr. Bloomberg did not specify which skyscrapers and bridges would be candidates for windmills , and city officials would need to work with property owners to identify the buildings that would best be able to hold the equipment .
Environmental art has the power to change the way we view our world .
Some artists showcase the innate beauty in nature , while others make a statement with agit - prop or controversial imagery .
Here are 20 powerful and unforgettable works whose artists seek to make you rethink your relationship with the Earth and its creatures .
1. Earth from the Air
Earth from the Air by Jann Arthus - Bertrand .
A photographic documentation of the planet .
Not just pictures , but portraits , showing a sense of place in many places around the world .
2. The Litmus Garden
The Litmus Garden designed by T. Allen Comp .
With the help of over a hundred volunteers over an April weekend in 2001 , a toxic river of coal mining waste was transformed into a series of cascading pools that eventually filter and clean the water before it flows into Blacklick Creek in Vintondale , PA .
Different trees have been planted at the edge of each pool which reflect the different colors of the water as it purifies .
3. River Cubes
RiverCubes by Bob Johnson .
The artist harvested debris found in local rivers and created sculptures of trash to be displayed nearby .
The resulting “ cubes ” are ugly displays of plastic and rusting metal , but are powerful commentaries on what humans leave in a landscape .
4. Marsh Zone 2000
Marsh Zone 2000 by Mark Brest van Kempen .
A large trash container was filled with remnants of a marsh which was the native ecosystem of Fairfield , CA , before it became a city .
This container was moved around the city with special signs designating parking spaces for cattails , tule reeds and other plants that were there before the asphalt was .
5. Rivers and Tides
Editor ’s note : video embedding is having a hiccup – here ’s the link to watch the video on Youtube in the meantime .
Thanks for your patience , everyone !
Rivers and Tides by Andy Goldsworthy .
This 2001 film is a treasure , bringing environmental art into the public eye as it documents Goldsworthy ’s playful and observant works using only the natural materials at hand to create something even more beautiful than nature itself .
6. Crude Awakening
Crude Awakening by Dan Das Mann and Karen Cusolito .
An installation at 2007 ’s Burning Man , a huge oil derrick was erected and surrounded by worshipping figures .
One night , fireworks exploded over the derrick , climaxed by a huge fireball burning 900 gallons of jet fuel and 2,000 gallons of liquid propane .
The derrick burned to the ground , symbolizing the end of our addiction to oil .
7. Zero Circles
Zero Circles by Daniel Dancer .
Circles of stone placed on logging and mining roads on public lands , these installations are meant to raise awareness of private profits made from mining , logging and grazing on public lands .
8. Wheatfield – a Confrontation
Wheatfield – a Confrontation by Agnes Denes .
In 1982 , the artist planted 2 acres of wheat atop the Battery Park Landfill in Manhattan .
1,000 pounds of wheat were harvested and taken around the world in “ The International Art Show for the End of World Hunger . ”
The point of this piece was a “ comment on human values and misplaced priorities . ”
9. Time Landscape
Time Landscape by Alan Sonfist .
A radical art proposal for its time ( 1978 ) , Sonfist planted a vacant lot in Manhattan in with trees that were native to the area before New York became the city it is today .
He has gone on to create other historically accurate landscapes around the world .
10 . Spiral Jetty
Spiral Jetty by Robert Smithson .
A stone jetty built into the Great Salt Lake of Utah , this earthwork has been submerged and exposed over the years since it was created in 1970 .
As of February 2008 , there has been a proposal for exploratory oil drilling in the lake , 5 miles away from the Jetty .
This drilling could ruin this work of art as well as degrade the surrounding environment .
11 . A Sheep In Wolf ’s Clothing
A Sheep In Wolf ’s Clothing by Sam Easterson .
A video artist , Easterson was curious about seeing the world from an animal ’s point of view .
He straps tiny helmet - cams onto sheep , buffaloes , tarantulas and more .
His goal is to put together the largest library of video captured from the viewpoint of animals and plants .
12 . Agricultural Compositions
Agricultural Compositions by Jean Paul Ganem .
The artist turns fields of human waste and pollution into colorful landscapes made up of compositions of different kinds and colors of plants .
Beautiful views from the air .
13 . Self - Portrait As Revealed By Trash
Self - Portrait As Revealed By Trash by Tim Gaudreau .
For an entire year , Gaudreau photographed all the trash he threw away .
An eye - opening piece on the environmental impact of just one human .
14 . Surrounded Islands
Surrounded Islands by Christo and Jeanne - Claude .
Certainly one of the largest scale installation pieces , this artistic couple created huge pink polypropylene sheets and temporarily surrounded 11 small islands off Miami with the plastic cloth .
Their other works include wrapped trees and an “ iron curtain ” made of old oil barrels .
15 . Edible Estates
Edible Estates by Fritz Haeg .
Bringing public awareness to the pointlessness and waste of the suburban lawn , Haeg has created numerous regional prototype gardens of edible landscapes at various museums around the world , which include drawings and documentation as the gardens grow .
16 . Concrete Flags
Concrete Flags by Shai Zakai .
The artist wanted to bring attention to excess concrete that was being poured into a creek in Israel .
Flag shapes were “ cookie cuttered ” out of dried concrete in the stream and displayed .
This art was used to raise money to clean the cement debris and restore the creek to health .
17 . Trashlog
Trashlog by Nico Van Hoorn .
Bringing awareness to the abundance of trash in the streets , for three years Van Hoorn walked every day and picked up one piece of trash which he then scanned and posted to his website .
The original trashy blog .
18 . Hundreds and Thousands
Hundreds and Thousands by Diana Lynn Thompson .
Intimately connect people with nature , Thompson spent an entire summer numbering every leaf on 5 trees in Bear Creek Park in Surrey .
When the leaves fell , she ( and a whole slew of helpers ) gathered them up and pinned them to a museum wall .
19 . Micro Landscapes and Dissected Ecosystems
Micro Landscapes and Dissected Ecosystems by Josh Keyes .
Slicing ecosystems down to their very core , Keyes ’ paintings showcase tiny glimpses into what creates the little pieces of our world .
20 . Music For Animals
Music For Animals by Jim Nollman .
Wanting to bridge the gap between the species , Nollman makes recordings of himself playing music with animals – complete with the songs from the animals themselves .
Editor ’s note : Sara here .
Honorable mention goes to environmental art in social media .
“ The shade of poison trees ” by butler .
corey is featured at the top of this post .

No two ways about it , Mad Catz has a winner on its hand with this one .
The Rock Band Portable Drum Kit for Xbox 360 is a complete skins kit designed to be shoved into most any backpack and played on nearly any solid surface .
The rubber pads are designed to handle over a million strikes , though that antique coffee table you lay these on may , in fact , not be designed to withstand such abuse .
For those not exactly kosher with a full - fledged kit consuming the den , this seems to be the perfect compromise .

Eight years ago , I left my civil service job as director of the UK Anti-Drug Co-Ordination Unit .
I went partly because I was sick of having to implement policies that I knew , and my political masters knew , were unsupported by evidence .
Yesterday , after a surreal flurry of media requests referring to a blog I wrote that questioned the wisdom of the UK 's drug policies , I found myself in the thick of the debate again , and I was sorry to discover that the terms had n't changed a bit .
I was being interviewed on the BBC World Service , and after I tried to explain why I believe that drugs should be decriminalised , the person representing the other side of the argument pointed out that drugs are terrible , that they destroy lives .
Now , I am a deeply boring , undruggy person myself , and I think the world would be a better place without drugs .
But I think that we must live in the world as it is , and not as we want it to be .
And so my answer was , yes , I know that drugs are terrible .
I 'm not saying that drugs should be decriminalised because it would be fun if we could all get stoned with impunity .
I 'm saying that we 've tried minimising harm through a draconian legal policy .
It is now clear that enforcement and supply - side interventions are largely pointless .
They have n't worked .
There is evidence that this works .
Unfortunately , evidence is still not a major component in our policy .
Take cannabis .
When I was in the Anti-Drug Unit , the moves towards making it a class C drug began , and I hoped that our position on drugs was finally moving in a rational direction .
But then Gordon Brown ignored his scientific advisers to make it a class B again .
It was a decision that pandered to the instincts of the tabloids , and it made no sense whatsoever .

There is no doubt at all that the benefits to society of the fall in crime as a result of legalisation would be dramatic .
The argument always put forward against this is that there would be a commensurate increase in drug use as a result of legalisation .
This , it seems to me , is a bogus point : tobacco is a legal drug , whose use is declining , and precisely because it is legal , its users are far more amenable to Government control , education programmes and taxation than they would be otherwise .
Studies suggest that the market is already almost saturated , and anyone who wishes to purchase the drug of their choice anywhere in the UK can already do so .
The idea that many people are holding back solely because of a law which they know is already unenforceable is ridiculous .
Ultimately , people will make choices which harm themselves , whether they involve diet , smoking , drinking , lack of exercise , sexual activity or pursuit of extreme sports .
In all these instances , the Government rightly takes the line that if these activities are to be pursued , society will ensure that those who pursue them have access to accurate information about the risks ; can access assistance to change their harmful habits should they so wish ; are protected by a legal standards regime ; are taxed accordingly ; and – crucially – do not harm other people .
Only in the field of drugs does the Government take a different line .
The case is overwhelming .
But I fear that policy will not catch up with the facts any time soon .
It would take a mature society to accept that some individuals may hurt , or even kill themselves , as a result of a policy change , even if the evidence suggested that fewer people died or were harmed as a result .
It would take a brave government to face down the tabloid fury in the face of anecdotes about middle - class children who bought drugs legally and came to grief , and this is not a brave government .
I think what was truly depressing about my time in the civil service was that the professionals I met from every sector held the same view : the illegality of drugs causes far more problems for society and the individual than it solves .
Yet publicly , all those people were forced to repeat the mantra that the Government would be " tough on drugs " , even though they all knew that the policy was causing harm .
I recall a conversation I had with a Number 10 policy advisor about a series of announcements in which we were to emphasise the shift of resources to treatment and highlight successes in prevention and education .
She asked me whether we could n't arrange for " a drugs bust in Brighton " at the same time , or " a boat speeding down the Thames to catch smugglers " .
For that advisor , what worked mattered considerably less than what would play well in the right - wing press .
The tragedy of our drugs policy is that it is dictated by tabloid irrationality , and not by evidence .
Why I Don't Buy the Resurrection Story ( 6th ed. , 2006 )
Main Argument
What follows is a half - hour lecture I have given on several public occasions , first at Yale on 26 October 2000 at the request of the Yale College Humanists and Secularists .
It was followed by a Q & A session of nearly two hours .
Many in my audiences have asked that I reproduce the speech online , with hyperlinked footnotes in brackets giving more detail than I am able to provide in person .
I have now made this the central argument in my collection of essays on why I do n't buy the resurrection story .
In this 2004 edit , I have made only a few minor changes to the original 2000 text .
Today I am going to tell you why I do n't buy the resurrection story .
By that I mean the tales in the Gospels , of Jesus physically rising again from the grave .
As a professional historian , I do not believe we have anywhere near sufficient evidence or reason to believe this , and I 've been asked by the Yale College Humanists and Secularists to explain why .
If any of you want to know more about this than what few points I can cover in thirty minutes , I have several writings on this and other subjects on the Secular Web .
But here I will cover the most important reasons why I do n't buy the resurrection story .
It actually begins with a different tale .
In 520 A.D. an anonymous monk recorded the life of Saint Genevieve , who had died only ten years before that .
In his account of her life , he describes how , when she ordered a cursed tree cut down , monsters sprang from it and breathed a fatal stench on many men for two hours ; while she was sailing , eleven ships capsized , but at her prayers they were righted again spontaneously ; she cast out demons , calmed storms , miraculously created water and oil from nothing before astonished crowds , healed the blind and lame , and several people who stole things from her actually went blind instead .
No one wrote anything to contradict or challenge these claims , and they were written very near the time the events supposedly happened -- by a religious man whom we suppose regarded lying to be a sin .
Yet do we believe any of it ?
Not really .
And we should n't . [ 1 ]
As David Hume once said , why do such things not happen now ?
[ 2 ]
Is it a coincidence that the very time when these things no longer happen is the same time that we have the means and methods to check them in the light of science and careful investigation ?
I 've never seen monsters spring from a tree , and I do n't know anyone who has , and there are no women touring the country transmuting matter or levitating ships .
These events look like tall tales , sound like tall tales , and smell like tall tales .
Odds are , they 're tall tales .
But we should try to be more specific in our reasons , and not rely solely on common sense impressions .
And there are specific reasons to disbelieve the story of Genevieve , and they are the same reasons we have to doubt the Gospel accounts of the Resurrection of Jesus .
For the parallel is clear : the Gospels were written no sooner to the death of their main character -- and more likely many decades later -- than was the case for the account of Genevieve ; and like that account , the Gospels were also originally anonymous -- the names now attached to them were added by speculation and oral tradition half a century after they were actually written .
Both contain fabulous miracles supposedly witnessed by numerous people .
Both belong to the same genre of literature : what we call a " hagiography , " a sacred account of a holy person regarded as representing a moral and divine ideal .
Such a genre had as its principal aim the glorification of the religion itself and of the example set by the perfect holy person represented as its central focus .
Such literature was also a tool of propaganda , used to promote certain moral or religious views , and to oppose different points of view .
The life of Genevieve , for example , was written to combat Arianism .
The canonical Gospels , on the other hand , appear to combat various forms of proto -Gnosticism .
So being skeptical of what they say is sensible from the start . [ 3 ]
It is certainly reasonable to doubt the resurrection of Jesus in the flesh , an event placed some time between 26 and 36 A.D.
For this we have only a few written sources near the event , all of it sacred writing , and entirely pro-Christian .
Pliny the Younger was the first non-Christian to even mention the religion , in 110 A.D. , but he does n't mention the resurrection .
No non-Christian mentions the resurrection until many decades later -- Lucian , a critic of superstition , was the first , writing in the mid-2nd century , and likely getting his information from Christian sources .
So the evidence is not what any historian would consider good . [ 4 ]
Nevertheless , Christian apologist Douglas Geivett has declared that the evidence for the physical resurrection of Jesus meets , and I quote , " the highest standards of historical inquiry " and " if one takes the historian 's own criteria for assessing the historicity of ancient events , the resurrection passes muster as a historically well - attested event of the ancient world , " as well - attested , he says , as Julius Caesar 's crossing of the Rubicon in 49 B.C. [ 5 ]
Well , it is common in Christian apologetics , throughout history , to make absurdly exaggerated claims , and this is no exception .
Let 's look at Caesar 's crossing of the Rubicon for a minute :
First of all , we have Caesar 's own word on the subject .
Indeed ,
The Civil War has been a Latin classic for two thousand years , written by Caesar himself and by one of his generals and closest of friends .
In contrast , we do not have anything written by Jesus , and we do not know for certain the name of any author of any of the accounts of his earthly resurrection .

Second , we have many of Caesar 's enemies , including Cicero , a contemporary of the event , reporting the crossing of the Rubicon , whereas we have no hostile or even neutral records of the resurrection until over a hundred years after the event , which is fifty years after the Christians ' own claims had been widely spread around .

Third , we have a number of inscriptions and coins produced soon after the Republican Civil War related to the Rubicon crossing , including mentions of battles and conscriptions and judgments , which provide evidence for Caesar 's march .
On the other hand , we have absolutely no physical evidence of any kind in the case of the resurrection .

On the other hand , we have absolutely no physical evidence of any kind in the case of the resurrection .
Fourth , we have the story of the " Rubicon Crossing " in almost every historian of the period , including the most prominent scholars of the age : Suetonius , Appian , Cassius Dio , Plutarch .
Moreover , these scholars have a measure of proven reliability , since a great many of their reports on other matters have been confirmed in material evidence and in other sources .
In addition , they often quote and name many different sources , showing a wide reading of the witnesses and documents , and they show a desire to critically examine claims for which there is any dispute .
If that was n't enough , all of them cite or quote sources written by witnesses , hostile and friendly , of the Rubicon crossing and its repercussions .
Compare this with the resurrection : we have not even a single established historian mentioning the event until the 3rd and 4th centuries , and then only by Christian historians . [
6 ]
And of those few others who do mention it within a century of the event , none of them show any wide reading , never cite any other sources , show no sign of a skilled or critical examination of conflicting claims , have no other literature or scholarship to their credit that we can test for their skill and accuracy , are completely unknown , and have an overtly declared bias towards persuasion and conversion .

Fifth , the history of Rome could not have proceeded as it did had Caesar not physically moved an army into Italy .
Even if Caesar could have somehow cultivated the mere belief that he had done this , he could not have captured Rome or conscripted Italian men against Pompey 's forces in Greece .
On the other hand , all that is needed to explain the rise of Christianity is a belief - - a belief that the resurrection happened .
There is nothing that an actual resurrection would have caused that could not have been caused by a mere belief in that resurrection .
Thus , an actual resurrection is not necessary to explain all subsequent history , unlike Caesar 's crossing of the Rubicon . [ 8 ]
It should be clear that we have many reasons to believe that Caesar crossed the Rubicon , all of which are lacking in the case of the resurrection .
In fact , when we compare all five points , we see that in four of the five proofs of an event 's historicity , the resurrection has no evidence at all , and in the one proof that it does have , it has not the best , but the very worst kind of evidence - - a handful of biased , uncritical , unscholarly , unknown , second - hand witnesses .
Indeed , you really have to look hard to find another event that is in a worse condition than this as far as evidence goes .
So Geivett is guilty of a rather extreme exaggeration .
This is not a historically well - attested event , and it does not meet the highest standards of evidence .
But reasons to be skeptical do not stop there .
We must consider the setting -- the place and time in which these stories spread .
This was an age of fables and wonder .
Magic and miracles and ghosts were everywhere , and almost never doubted .
I 'll give one example that illustrates this : we have several accounts of what the common people thought about lunar eclipses .
They apparently had no doubt that this horrible event was the result of witches calling the moon down with diabolical spells .
So when an eclipse occurred , everyone would frantically start banging pots and blowing brass horns furiously , to confuse the witches ' spells .
So tremendous was this din that many better - educated authors complain of how the racket filled entire cities and countrysides .
This was a superstitious people . [ 9 ]
Only a small class of elite well - educated men adopted more skeptical points of view , and because they belonged to the upper class , both them and their arrogant skepticism were scorned by the common people , rather than respected .
Plutarch laments how doctors were willing to attend to the sick among the poor for little or no fee , but they were usually sent away , in preference for the local wizard . [ 10 ]
By modern standards , almost no one had any sort of education at all , and there were no mass media disseminating scientific facts in any form .
By the estimates of William Harris , author of Ancient Literacy [ 1989 ] , only 20 % of the population could read anything at all , fewer than 10 % could read well , and far fewer still had any access to books .
He found that in comparative terms , even a single page of blank papyrus cost the equivalent of thirty dollars -- ink , and the labor to hand copy every word , cost many times more .
We find that books could run to the tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars each .
Consequently , only the rich had books , and only elite scholars had access to libraries , of which there were few .
The result was that the masses had no understanding of science or critical thought .
They were neither equipped nor skilled , nor even interested , in challenging an inspiring story , especially a story like that of the Gospels : utopian , wonderful , critical of upper class society -- even more a story that , if believed , secured eternal life .
Who would n't have bought a ticket to that lottery ?
Opposition arose mainly from prior commitments to other dogmas , not reason or evidence .
The differences between society then and now cannot be stressed enough .
There did n't exist such things as coroners , reporters , cameras , newspapers , forensic science , or even police detectives .
All the technology , all the people we have pursuing the truth of various claims now , did not exist then .
In those days , few would even be able to check the details of a story if they wanted to -- and few wanted to .
Instead , people based their judgment on the display of sincerity by the storyteller , by his ability to impress them with a show or simply to persuade and " sell " his story , and by the potential rewards his story had to offer . [ 11 ]
At the same time , doubters did n't care to waste the time or money debunking yet another crazy cult , of which there were hundreds then . [ 12 ]
And so it should not surprise us that we have no writings by anyone hostile to Christianity until a century after it began -- not even slanders or lies .
Clearly , no doubter cared to check or even challenge the story in print until it was too late to investigate the facts . [ 13 ]
These are just some of the reasons why we cannot trust extraordinary reports from that time without excellent evidence , which we do not have in the case of the physical resurrection of Jesus .
For on the same quality of evidence we have reports of talking dogs , flying wizards , magical statues , and monsters springing from trees . [ 14 ]
Can you imagine a movement today claiming that a soldier in World War Two rose physically from the dead , but when you asked for proof all they offered you were a mere handful of anonymous religious tracts written in the 1980's ?
Would it be even remotely reasonable to believe such a thing on so feeble a proof ?
Well - - no . [ 15 ]
What about alien bodies recovered from a crashed flying saucer in Roswell , New Mexico ?
Many people sincerely believe that legend today , yet this is the modern age , with ample evidence against it in print that is easily accessible to anyone , and this legend began only thirty years after the event . [ 16 ]
Even so , it is often said in objection that we can trust the Gospels more than we normally would because they were based on the reports of eye - witnesses of the event who were willing to die for their belief in the physical resurrection , for surely no one would die for a lie .
To quote a Christian website : " the first disciples were willing to suffer and die for their faith ... for their claims to have seen Jesus ... risen bodily from the dead . "
Of course , the Gospel of Matthew 28:17 actually claims that some eye - witnesses did n't believe what they saw and might not have become Christians , which suggests the experience was not so convincing after all .
But there are two other key reasons why this argument sounds great in sermons but does n't hold water under rational scrutiny .
First , it is based on nothing in the New Testament itself , or on any reliable evidence of any kind .
None of the Gospels or Epistles mention anyone dying for their belief in the " physical " resurrection of Jesus .
The only martyrdoms recorded in the New Testament are , first , the stoning of Stephen in the Book of Acts .
But Stephen was not a witness .
He was a later convert .
So if he died for anything , he died for hearsay alone .
But even in Acts the story has it that he was not killed for what he believed , but for some trumped up false charge , and by a mob , whom he could not have escaped even if he had recanted .
So his death does not prove anything in that respect .
Moreover , in his last breaths , we are told , he says nothing about dying for any belief in the physical resurrection of Jesus , but mentions only his belief that Jesus was the messiah , and was at that moment in heaven . [ 17 ]
And then he sees Jesus - - yet no one else does , so this was clearly a vision , not a physical appearance , and there is no good reason to believe earlier appearances were any different .
The second and only other " martyr " recorded in Acts is the execution of the Apostle James , but we are not told anything about why he was killed or whether recanting would have saved him , or what he thought he died for . [ 18 ]
In fact , we have one independent account in the Jewish history of Josephus , of the stoning of a certain " James the brother of Jesus " in 62 A.D. , possibly but not necessarily the very same James , and in that account he is stoned for breaking the Jewish law , which recanting would not escape , and in the account of the late 2nd century Christian hagiographer Hegesippus , as reported by Eusebius , he dies not for his belief in a physical resurrection , but , just like Stephen , solely for proclaiming Jesus the messiah , who was at that moment in heaven . [ 19 ]
Yet that is the last record of any martyrdom we have until the 2nd century .
Then we start to hear about some unnamed Christians burned for arson by Nero in 64 A.D. , [ 20 ] but we do not know if any eye - witnesses were included in that group -- and even if we did it would not matter , for they were killed on a false charge of arson , not for refusing to deny belief in a physical resurrection .
So even if they had recanted , it would not have saved them , and therefore their deaths also do not prove anything , especially since such persecution was so rare and unpredictable in that century .
We also do not even know what it was they believed -- after all , Stephen and James did not appear to regard the physical resurrection as an essential component of their belief .
It is not what they died for .
As far as we can tell , apart from perhaps James , no one knew what the fate was of any of the original eye - witnesses .
People were even unclear about who the original eye - witnesses were .
There were a variety of legends circulating centuries later about their travels and deaths , but it is clear from our earliest sources that no one knew for certain . [ 21 ]
There was only one notable exception : the martyrdom of Peter .
This we do not hear about until two or three generations after the event , and it is told in only one place : the Gnostic Acts of Peter , which was rejected as a false document by many Christians of the day .
But even if this account is true , it claims that Peter was executed for political meddling and not for his beliefs .
Even more important , it states that Peter believed Jesus was resurrected as a spirit , not in the flesh ... [ 22 ]
Which brings us to the second point : it seems distinctly possible , if not definite , that the original Christians did not in fact believe in a physical resurrection ( meaning a resurrection of his corpse ) , but that Jesus was taken up to heaven and given a new body - - a more perfect , spiritual body -- and then " the risen Jesus " was seen in visions and dreams , just like the vision Stephen has before he dies , and which Paul has on the road to Damascus .
Visions of gods were not at all unusual , a cultural commonplace in those days , well documented by Robin Lane Fox in his excellent book Pagans and Christians . [ 23 ]
But whatever their cause , if this is how Christianity actually started , it means that the resurrection story told in the Gospels , of a Jesus risen in the flesh , does not represent what the original disciples believed , but was made up generations later .
So even if they did die for their beliefs , they did not die for the belief that Jesus was physically resurrected from the grave .
That the original Christians believed in a spiritual resurrection is hinted at in many strange features of the Gospel accounts of the appearances of Jesus after death , which may be survivals of an original mystical tradition later corrupted by the growing legend of a bodily resurrection , such as a Jesus that they do not recognize , or who vanishes into thin air . [ 24 ]
But more importantly , it is also suggested by the letters of Paul , our earliest source of information on any of the details of the original Christian beliefs .
For Paul never mentions or quotes any of the Gospels , so it seems clear that they were not written in his lifetime .
This is supported by internal evidence that suggests all the Gospels were written around or after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. , well after Paul 's last surviving letter , which was written around the year 58 . [ 25 ]
Yet Paul never mentions Jesus having been resurrected in the flesh .
He never mentions empty tombs , physical appearances , or the ascension of Jesus into heaven afterward ( i.e. when Paul mentions the ascension , he never ties it to appearances in this way , and never distinguishes it from the resurrection event itself ) .
In Galatians 1 he tells us that he first met Jesus in a " revelation " on the road to Damascus , not in the flesh , and the Book of Acts gives several embellished accounts of this event that all clearly reflect not any tradition of a physical encounter , but a startling vision ( a light and a voice , nothing more ) . [ 26 ]
Then in 1 Corinthians 15 Paul reports that all the original eye - witnesses -- Peter , James , the Twelve Disciples , and hundreds of others -- saw Jesus in essentially the same way Paul did .
The only difference , he says , was that they saw it before him .
He then goes on to build an elaborate description of how the body that dies is not the body that rises , that the flesh cannot inherit the kingdom of God , and how the resurrected body is a new , spiritual body .
All this seems good evidence that Paul did not believe in the resurrection of a corpse , but something fundamentally different . [ 27 ]
Finally , when we examine the Gospel record closely , it becomes apparent that the physical nature of the resurrection was a growing legend , becoming more and more fabulous over time , a good sign that it was n't the original story .
Now , we do n't actually know when any of the Gospels were written , but we can infer their chronological order .
Luke and Matthew both copy whole phrases from Mark and arrange them in an identical order as found in Mark , so it is clear that Mark came first among those three .
Scholars dispute whether Luke preceded Matthew or the other way around , but it seems to me that , since they show no apparent awareness of each other , they were written around the same time , though scholars generally hold that Luke perhaps wrote later than Matthew .
John presents the most theologically elaborate of the accounts , suggesting a late development , and even earliest Christian tradition held that this Gospel was the last to be written , and scholars generally agree on this .
So we start with Mark .
It is little known among the laity , but in fact the ending of Mark , everything after verse 16:8 , does not actually exist in the earliest versions of that Gospel that survive . [ 28 ]
It was added some time late in the 2nd century or even later .
Before that , as far as we can tell , Mark ended at verse 16:8 .
But that means his Gospel ended only with an empty tomb , and a pronouncement by a mysterious young man [ 29 ] that Jesus would be seen in Galilee - - nothing is said of how he would be seen .
This was clearly unsatisfactory for the growing powerful arm of the Church a century later , which had staked its claim on a physical resurrection , against competing segments of the Church usually collectively referred to as the Gnostics ( though not always accurately ) .
So an ending was added that quickly pinned some physical appearances of Jesus onto the story , and for good measure put in the mouth of Christ rabid condemnations of those who did n't believe it . [ 30 ]
But when we consider the original story , it supports the notion that the original belief was of a spiritual rather than a physical event .
The empty tomb for Mark was likely meant to be a symbol , not a historical reality , but even if he was repeating what was told him as true , it was not unusual in the ancient world for the bodies of heroes who became gods to vanish from this world : being deified entailed being taken up into heaven , as happened to men as diverse as Hercules and Apollonius of Tyana , and Mark 's story of an empty tomb would simply represent that expectation . [ 31 ]
A decade or two passes , and then Matthew appears .
As this Gospel tells it , there was a vast earthquake , and instead of a mere boy standing around beside an already - opened tomb , an angel - - blazing like lightning -- descended from the sky and paralyzed two guards that happened to be there , rolled away the stone single handedly before several witnesses -- and then announced that Jesus will appear in Galilee .
Obviously we are seeing a clear case of legendary embellishment of the otherwise simple story in Mark .
Then in Matthew a report is given ( similar to what was later added to Mark ) , where , contrary to the angel 's announcement , Jesus immediately meets the women that attended to his grave and repeats what the angel said .
Matthew is careful to add a hint that this was a physical Jesus , having the women grovel and grab his feet as he speaks . [ 32 ]
Then , maybe a little later still , Luke appears , and suddenly what was a vague and perhaps symbolic allusion to an ascension in Mark has now become a bodily appearance , complete with a dramatic reenactment of Peter rushing to the tomb and seeing the empty death shroud for himself . [ 32a ]
As happened in Matthew , other details have grown .
The one young man of Mark , which became a flying angel in Matthew , in this account has suddenly become two men , this time not merely in white , but in dazzling raiment .
And to make the new story even more suspicious as a doctrinal invention , Jesus goes out of his way to say he is not a vision , and proves it by asking the Disciples to touch him , and then by eating a fish .
And though both Mark and Matthew said the visions would happen in Galilee , Luke changes the story , and places this particular experience in the more populous and prestigious Jerusalem . [ 33 ]
Finally along comes John , perhaps after another decade or more .
Now the legend has grown full flower , and instead of one boy , or two men , or one angel , now we have two angels at the empty tomb .
And outdoing Luke in style , John has Jesus prove he is solid by showing his wounds , and breathing on people , and even obliging the Doubting Thomas by letting him put his fingers into the very wounds themselves .
Like Luke , the most grandiose appearances to the Disciples happen in Jerusalem , not Galilee as Mark originally claimed .
In all , John devotes more space and detail than either Luke or Matthew to demonstrations of the physicality of the resurrection , details nowhere present or even implied in Mark .
It is obvious that John is trying very hard to create proof that the resurrection was the physical raising of a corpse , and at the end of a steady growth of fable , he takes license to make up a lot of details . [ 34 ]
We have no primary sources on what was going on in the forty years of the Church between Paul in the year 58 and Clement of Rome in the year 95 , and Paul tells us almost nothing about what happened in the beginning .
We only conjecture that the Gospels were written between Paul and Clement , though they may have been written even ten or twenty years later still .
But what I suspect happened is something like this : Jesus died , was buried , and then in a vision or dream appeared to one or more of his Disciples , convincing them he had ascended to heaven , marking the beginning of the fast - approaching End Times as the first to be raised , and then what began in the simple story of Mark as a symbolic allusion to an ascended Christ soon to reveal himself in visions from heaven , in time led some Christians to believe that the resurrection was a physical rising of a corpse .
Then they heard or came up with increasingly elaborate stories proving themselves right .
Overzealous people often add details and color to a story they 've been told without even thinking about it , and as the story passed from each to the next more detail and elaboration was added , securing the notion of a physical resurrection in popular imagination and belief .
It would have been a natural mistake to make at the time , since gods were expected to be able to raise people bodily from the dead , and physical resurrections were actually in vogue in the very 1st century when Christianity began .
Consider the god Asclepius .
Doctors associated themselves with this god , and many legends were circulating of doctors becoming famous by restoring the dead to life , as recounted by Pliny the Elder , Apuleius and others . [ 35 ]
Asclepius was also called SOTER , " The Savior , " as many gods were in that day .
He was especially so - named for being able to cure the sick and bring back the dead , and since " Jesus " ( properly , Joshua ) means " The Savior " in Hebrew it may have been expected that his resurrection would be physical in nature , too .
After all , so was that of Lazarus , or of the boy raised by Elijah in 1 Kings - - a prophet with whom Jesus was often equated . [ 36 ]
Jesus ' association with many healing miracles may also have implied a deliberate rivalry with Asclepius , and indeed , Jesus was actually called SOTER , and still is today : we see the Christian fishes on the backs of cars now , containing the Greek word ICHTHUS , the last letter of which stands for : SOTER .
Not standing to be outdone by a pagan god , Christians may have simply expected that their god could raise himself physically from the grave . [ 37 ]
Then there is Herodotus , who was always a popular author and had been for centuries .
He told of a Thracian religion that began with the physical resurrection of a man called Zalmoxis , who then started a cult in which it was taught that believers went to heaven when they died .
We also know that circulating in the Middle East were very ancient legends regarding the resurrection of the goddess Inanna ( also known as Ishtar ) , who was crucified in the underworld , then rescued and raised back to earth by her divine attendant , a tale recounted in a four thousand year old clay tablet from Sumeria . [ 38 ]
Finally , Plutarch writes in the latter half of the 1st century how " Romeo - and - Juliet - style " returns from the dead were a popular theme in contemporary theatre , and we know from surviving summaries and fragments that they were also a feature in romance novels of that day .
This trend is discussed at some length in G. W. Bowersock 's book Fiction as History . [ 39 ]
So the idea of " physical resurrection " was popular , and circulating everywhere .
Associating Jesus with this trend would have been a very easy mistake to make .
Since religious trust was won in those days by the charisma of speakers and the audience 's subjective estimation of their sincerity , it would not be long before a charismatic man , who heard the embellished accounts , came into a position of power , inspiring complete faith from his congregation , who then sought to defend the story , and so began the transformation of the Christian idea of the resurrection from a spiritual concept to a physical one -- naturally , calling themselves the " true church " and attacking all rivals , as has sadly so often happened in history .
Lending plausibility to this chain of events was the Jewish War between 66 and 70 A.D. [ 40 ] , which ended with the complete destruction of the original Christian Church in Jerusalem , and much of the entire city , after all Judaea itself was ravaged by war .
It is likely that many if not all of the original believers still living were killed in this war , or in Nero 's persecution of 64 , and with the loss of the central source of Christian authority and tradition , legends were ripe for the growing .
This would explain why later Christians were so in the dark about the history of their own Church between 58 and 95 .
It was a kind of mini - dark age for them , a time of confusion and uncertainty .
But what exactly happened we may never know .
However it came to change , it seems more than likely that the first Christians , among them Paul , believed in a spiritual resurrection , and not the resurrection story told in the Gospels .
So this is where we end up .
We have no trustworthy evidence of a physical resurrection , no reliable witnesses .
It is among the most poorly attested of historical events .
The earliest evidence , from the letters of Paul , does not appear to be of a physical resurrection , but a spiritual one .
And we have at least one plausible reason available to us as to why and how the legend grew into something else .
Finally , the original accounts of a resurrection of a flesh - and - blood corpse show obvious signs of legendary embellishment over time , and were written in an age of little education and even less science , a time overflowing with superstition and credulity .
And , ultimately , the Gospels match perfectly the same genre of hagiography as that life of Genevieve with which I began .
There the legends quickly arose , undoubted and unchallenged , of treeborn monsters and righted ships and blinded thieves .
In the Gospels , we get angels and earthquakes and a resurrection of the flesh .
So we have to admit that neither is any more believable than the other .
It should not be lost on us that Thomas was depicted as no less righteous for refusing to believe so wild a claim without physical proof .
We have as much right , and ought to follow his example .
He got to see and feel the wounds before believing , and so should we .
I have n't , so I can't be expected to believe it . [ 41 ]
And this leads me to one final reason why I do n't buy the resurrection story .
No wise or compassionate God would demand this from us .
Such a god would not leave us so poorly informed about something so important . [ 42 ]
If we have a message for someone that is urgently vital for their survival , and we have any compassion , that compassion will compel us to communicate that message clearly and with every necessary proof -- not ambiguously , not through unreliable mediaries presenting no real evidence .
Conversely , if we see something incredible , we do not attack or punish audiences who do n't believe us , we do n't even expect them to believe -- unless and until we can present decisive proof .
There is a heroic legend in the technology community about the man who invented elevator safety brakes .
He claimed that any elevator fitted with his brakes , even if all the cables broke , would be safely and swiftly stopped by his new invention .
No one trusted it .
Did he get angry or indignant ?
No .
He simply put himself in an elevator , ordered the cables cut , and proved to the world , by risking his own life , that his brakes worked . [ 43 ]
This is the very principle that has delivered us from superstition to science .
Any claim can be made about a drug , but people are rightly wary of swallowing anything that has n't been thoroughly tested and re-tested and tested again .
Since I have no such proofs regarding the resurrection story , I 'm not going to swallow it , and it would be cruel , even for a god , to expect otherwise of me .
So I can reason rightly that a god of all humankind would not appear in one tiny backwater of the Earth , in a backward time , revealing himself to a tiny unknown few , and then expect the billions of the rest of us to take their word for it , and not even their word , but the word of some unknown person many times removed .
Yet , if one returns to what was probably Paul 's conception of a Christ risen into a new , spiritual body , then the resurrection becomes no longer a historical proof of the truth of Christianity , but an article of faith , an affirmation that is supposed to follow nothing other than a personal revelation of Christ - - not to be believed on hearsay , but experienced for oneself .
Though I do not believe this is a reliable way to come to a true understanding of the world , as internal experience only tells us about ourselves and not the truth of the world outside of us , [ 44 ]
I leave it to the Christians here to consider a spiritual resurrection as a different way to understand their faith .
But I do n't see any reason to buy the resurrection story found in the Gospels .

The first Christians to show a desire to employ the methods of critical scholarship in working out historical facts are Clement of Alexandria , Origen , and Sextus Julius Africanus , all working in the early 3rd century .
Africanus is the first known Christian chronologer , but not quite a historian in the proper sense of someone who tried to develop a critical analysis of what happened with an interest in the relevant causal connections , and very little of his work survives .
In the proper sense , the first Christian historian was Eusebius , yet he is notoriously unreliable .
In fact , no trustworthy Christian historian would appear until the early modern period .
On Eusebius in particular , cf. D.S. Hadrill , Eusebius of Caesarea ( 1960 ) ; R.M. Grant , Eusebius as Church Historian ( 1980 ) .
On the others , see entries in the The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church , 3rd ed .

Two points need clarification .
First , " bias " in and of itself is never a sufficient reason to dismiss any account .
Rather , bias can only act as a supporting reason to doubt when we already have other reasons to be skeptical , since bias , if demonstrable , is a ready explanation for why an author would have consciously or unconsciously created , or uncritically transmitted , an account or detail that was untrue .
But though bias explains this , making other skeptical grounds stronger , it does not entail it .
Indeed , bias can in fact be used to help prove an account true , e.g. if an author is biased against some account of things but reports it anyway .
However , I do not merely charge the Gospels with their obvious bias , but in some cases with an overtly stated propagandist mission , which is something much more damning than mere bias : some of the sources specifically state that their versions of events were written to convert people .
That alone raises them to a whole new level of suspicion .
Cf. e.g. John 20:31 ; Mark 16:16 ; 1 Corinthians 15:1 - 2 ; Galatians 1:1-9 .
Also suspicious are repeated assertions of honesty , without explaining why the account is to be given credit .
This is the sort of thing liars are more likely to do than honest people .
When an author honestly wishes to insist an account is true , he will usually add reasons why such an insistence is appropriate ( " I know this is true because I saw it myself " is the simplest example ) .
But when the insistence stands by itself ( " That 's what happened !
Honest ! " ) we are right to be cautious in trusting what the author says .
Cf. e.g. John 21:24 ; Galatians 1:20 , etc .
But even this is not sufficient to dismiss an account : additional supporting reasons are necessary .
However , sufficient doubt can be raised when obvious bias is combined with a complete lack of any critical analysis or source research .
The Evangelists simply tell stories , and never show any interest in admitting the existence of alternative versions of any events , or admitting any doubt or uncertainty about any details , or identifying or discussing the merits of any of their sources , or making any attempt to justify their accounts with critical or scholarly analysis .
Contrast this with , for example , chapter 8 of Suetonius ' Life of Caligula , and the dubiousness of the Gospel accounts becomes plain .

This was a subject of my Columbia University Master 's Thesis , The Cultural History of the Lunar and Solar Eclipse in the Early Roman Empire ( 1998 ) .
But the general point is carried much further with different examples in my online essay Kooks and Quacks of the Roman Empire .
Relevant scholarship is cited in the endnote there .
[ 10 ] " On Superstition , " Moralia 168C .
Seneca also wrote a work on superstition that does not survive but for a few quotes in book 10 of Augustine 's City of God , and it reveals similar hostility to elite religion from the masses , and the craziness of popular religious opinions .
[ 11 ]
Most relevant to this fact is Graham Anderson 's Sage , Saint and Sophist : Holy Men and Their Associates in the Early Roman Empire ( 1994 ) ; but consider Paul 's mode of argument in his letter to the Galatians as an example of how assertions of authority mattered more than a presentation and analysis of witnesses and evidence .
[ 12 ] Cf. n. 10 above for the only two examples of pagan tracts devoted to debunking popular cults .
Their form of argument is relevant : they did not conduct historical investigations to refute factual claims of distasteful cults , but argued against them solely on ethical , aesthetic , and philosophical grounds .
This was the usual way skeptics dismissed cults like Christianity - - a detailed investigation was n't worth their time .
For example , in the correspondence between Pliny and Trajan ( Pliny the Younger , Letters 10.96 - 7 ) , the interrogation of a few local cult members in Asia Minor led Pliny to conclude that Christianity was such a " depraved superstition " that he saw no reason to investigate it further .
The exception proves the rule : we have no real parallels for what Lucian did in his story Alexander the False Prophet , and even that was a matter of coincidence : Lucian , by chance a keen - minded Epicurean and prolific and talented writer , just happened upon the scene of a new pagan cult as it was beginning .
Similar coincidence drove him to write skeptically on The Death of Peregrinus ( both are available in Lionel Casson 's Selected Satires of Lucian , 1968 ) .
[ 13 ]
Matthew alone records a supposed skeptical attack of Jews , namely the charge that the body of Jesus had " really " been stolen ( 28:11 - 15 ; cf. 27:62-6 ; 28:4 ) .
But this appears in no Jewish writings , of the first century or even later , and as a Christian story it is suspect : it involves reporting secret conversations that no Christian could have been witness to , and Matthew does not explain how he heard of those events .
He only says " This story [ of theft ] was spread around among Jews until today . "
But apparently , not in print .
There are many reasons to doubt the veracity of this report : e.g. my analysis of the guarding story in Section VIII of Probability of Survival vs. Miracle , and my papers on theft ( see Summary ) .
However , as I note there , an ad hoc charge of theft could well have been an intuitive response to the story when the story adopted an empty tomb motif , whenever that was ( in my opinion , probably after the Jewish War concluded in 70 A.D. ) , and in that respect Matthew may simply be inventing a story to " debunk " a new charge raised by the adoption of a new empty tomb story a generation or two after the religion began ( so that what he thinks or claims is " until today " is really just " today " ) .

The ultimate starting points for those interested in studying the Roswell legend are three books : Kal Korff 's The Roswell UFO Crash : What They Don't Want You to Know ( 2000 ) surveys the real evidence meticulously , proving the legend entirely bogus , while UFO Crash at Roswell : The Genesis of a Modern Myth ( 1997 ) by Benson Saler , Charles Ziegler , and Charles Moore , relates the development of the legend itself , and Toby Smith 's Little Gray Men : Roswell and the Rise of a Popular Culture ( 2000 ) explains how the legends became so popular .

That Stephen was not a witness but a later convert is implied in Acts 6:1 ( where he appears among the disciples who are multiplying in the church and his being a witness is not listed as his qualification ) .
Technically , though , he did not die for " hearsay " since he was supposedly trusting what others said they saw .
We just do n't know what that was ( since we only have this account as hearsay ) .

I discuss this vision and Paul 's Christology in sections I through VI of General Case for Spiritual Resurrection .
Paul 's declarations of the " creed " of his religion also support this : physical resurrection is nowhere stated to be a necessary belief .
1 Cor. 15:3-11
I discuss in the links above , but to that can be added 1 Tim.
3:16 , where the necessary elements of the religion are listed as the incarnation , spiritual justification , some connection with angels , the teaching of the Gospel , and the ascension .
No mention of physical encounters or empty tombs or even resurrection ( as anything distinct from ascension ) .
Likewise , Paul 's summary of the Gospel at Philippians 2:6- 11 omits a physical resurrection : instead of being raised , Jesus is merely exalted after death by being given a powerful " name . "
And Colossians 1:13 - 29 summarizes the theology of the Gospel , yet makes clear that by giving his body Jesus removed sin ( vv. 22 ) , and that after death his " body " became the church ( vv. 24 ; supported by Ephesians 5:30 , where it says we are now Christ 's body ) .
This implies that there was no living " body " of Jesus on earth after his death , except the power of his name and message , and thus the church itself .
However , Paul does say Jesus was given a new body in heaven , and that was probably the original belief -- the church becoming his new earthly body , not his corpse .
[ 27 ]
Paul probably had to use so many metaphors and go to such length to explain the nature of a spiritual resurrection to a congregation clearly confused about it because Paul was trying to bring many different sects into his fold .
Though Jews were more resistant than most people of that day to syncretism with Hellenistic and Persian ideas , they were far from immune , and Christianity was always more popular with Hellenic Gentiles than with Jews , and more popular with Hellenized diaspora Jews than with the Jerusalem orthodoxy .
Even so , novel ideas made their way even into mainstream Judaism , as is evident from the allegorizing and mysticism of the Jewish philosopher Philo , the adoption of a notion of Hades in the Book of Enoch similar to that held by popular mystery - religion , the gradual replacement of Hebrew scriptures with Greek , the importation of Hellenic magic ( by attributing it to the Wisdom of Solomon ) , and the Zoroastrian idea of a flaming hell -- all are prime examples .
In fact , the very idea of a bodily resurrection itself is n't Jewish : it was Zoroastrian , and adopted by the Jews during or shortly after their exile to Babylon .

There are at least three endings to Mark in circulation that were combined into what we now read in the Bible , but the mss .
tradition shows they began as separate additions .
The longest is found only in post - 4th century manuscripts ( for all the following , see the apparatus for the relevant passages in The Greek New Testament , Fourth Revised Edition ) .
Outside the mauscript evidence , which is decisive , the addition seems to be first partly quoted in the late 2nd century , in a passage of Irenaeus ( Against All Heresies 3.5 ) , but that text is also a late manuscript ( and a Latin translation , not the original Greek ) that could have been redacted to match the Gospel that was in circulation at the time .
There is evidence of that very fact in the same passage , with regard to his quotation of the first verse of Mark : the words " son of God " are recognized as not being original to that Gospel ( cf. ibid .
apparatus ; also , Bart Ehrman 's The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture : The Effect of Early Christological Controversies on the Text of the New Testament 1993 , pp. 72 - 5 ) , and in fact those words appear in only two of three surviving Latin translations and do not exist in the one surviving fragment of that passage in the original Greek .
We do not have the original Greek for his mention of the ending of Mark , and therefore it remains probable that it , too , was added by a later translator .
Other than that one reference ( which , if genuine , would suggest that Irenaeus added the ending to Mark to help his case against the Gnostics ) , the longest addition seems to first appear in some Coptic manuscripts in the early 4th century , and begins to be added to most Greek versions over the course of that and the following century .
It is cited already in the 4th century by a few Christian authors .
On this whole issue , still of key relevance is F.C. Conybeare 's essay " On the Last Twelve Verses of St. Mark 's Gospel , " The Expositor , 5th ser. , 2 ( 1895 ) , pp. 401-21 .

On Heracles , the references to his ascension on a cloud are found throughout ancient literature ( cf. K. Galinsky , The Herakles Theme 1972 ) , but most notably in the earliest Christian apologetic work , Justin Martyr 's Trypho 69 - 70 .
On Apollonius , cf. Philostratus , Life of Apollonius of Tyana 8.30 .
Empedocles is also a paradigm example of a vanished wise man ( Diogenes Laertius 8.67 - 8 ) ; citing Heraclides of Pontus , the story clearly predates Jesus -- Hermippus had even attempted to invent a clever secular account of the story ( Diogenes Laertius 8.69 ) .
There are also precedents for this in Jewish scripture : Elijah and Enoch were raised into heaven ( 2 Kings 2:1- 18 ) , and a similar legend was growing among Jews in the early 1st century regarding Moses ( cf. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church , s.v. " Moses , The Assumption of " ) .

There are good arguments that this passage is in fact a later addition , and that the original Lukan text has been tampered with ( see pp. 212-17 of Bart Ehrman 's The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture : The Effect of Early Christological Controversies on the Text of the New Testament , 1993 ) .
However , that only reinforces the point : the texts show legendary development over time , even as the outcome of tampering .
How many passages were tampered with that we can't detect ?
How much tampering took place before the story ever even came to be written down ?
We will never know .

The Thracian god Zalmoxis ( also called Salmoxis or Gebele'izis ) was buried , resurrected and deified in his own lifetime , as described in the mid-5th - century B.C. by Herodotus ( 4.94 -96 ) , and also mentioned in Plato 's Charmides ( 156d-158b ) in the early - 4th - century B.C. According to the hostile account of Herodotus ' Greek informants , Zalmoxis buried himself alive , telling his followers he would be resurrected in three years , but he merely resided in a hidden dwelling all that time .
His inevitable " resurrection " led to his deification , and a religion surrounding him ( which preached heavenly immortality for believers ) persisted for centuries .
Innana ( also known as Ishtar ) , a Sumerian goddess whose crucifixion , resurrection and escape from the underworld is told in cuneiform tablets inscribed c. 1500 B.C. , attesting to a very old tradition .
The best account and translation of the text is to be found in Samuel Kramer 's History Begins at Sumer , pp. 154 ff. , but be sure to use the third revised edition ( 1981 or later ) , since the text was significantly revised after new discoveries were made .
For instance , the tablet was once believed to describe the resurrection of Innana 's lover , Tammuz ( also known as Dumuzi ) .
Kersey Graves , for example , thus mistakenly lists Tammuz as one of his " Sixteen Crucified Saviors . "

Bowersock , 1994 .
The notion still floats around , usually citing hopelessly outdated scholarship , that somehow all these works of fiction post - date Christianity .
Many do .
But the whole genre does not .
Some are dated to the first century A.D. and even B.C. , and these we believe are late -- many similar works existed earlier but have not survived .
See Graham Anderson , Ancient Fiction : The Novel in the Graeco - Roman World ( 1984 ) ; Richard Stoneman & J.R. Morgan , eds. , Greek Fiction : The Greek Novel in Context ( 1994 ) ; and Susan Stephens & John Winkler , eds. , Ancient Greek Novels ( 1995 ) .
The genre of historical fiction itself begins in the 4th century B.C. with Xenophon 's The Education of Cyrus ( though the idea was begun with the very dialogues of Plato ) .
But we have one definite proof that the resurrection motif in fiction predates the 1st century : the Latin satire of that very genre , The Satyricon by Petronius .
This is positively dated to around 60 A.D. ( Petronius was killed under the reign of Nero , and makes fun of social circumstances created by the early Caesars ) and is a full - fledged travel - narrative just like Acts , with a clear religious motif .
However , Petronius is making fun of that motif , and also writing in Latin , yet we know the genre began in the Greek language .
Thus , in order for Petronius to move the genre into Latin and make fun of it , it must have pre-existed the time of his writing and been popular enough to draw his attention .
Indeed , the satire itself may actually have existed in a Greek form before Petronius took it up : P. Parsons , " A Greek Satyricon ? " Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies 18 ( 1971 ) pp. 53ff .
It should be noted that Petronius pokes fun at the resurrection theme in section 140. frg2 , where the hero compares his restoration from impotence to the " resurrected Protesilaus , " and attributes it to Mercury 's known role in " bringing back the dead . "
Similarly , Plutarch relates a spoof of the motif in popular theatre , where a performing dog acts out its death and resurrection on stage to the delight of the emperor Vespasian ( " On the Cleverness of Animals , " Moralia 973e - 974a ) .
In order to have something to spoof , the motif must predate the year 80 .

Of course , our closest source is Josephus himself , who fought in the war and witnessed the sack of Jerusalem and who relates it all in detail in his apologetic history The Jewish War ( with some more material in his other works ) .

To make the point clear , Thomas was not denigrated or condemned for asking for hard evidence , and he was given it , thus God , as depicted here , accepted his prima facie right to that evidence before committing to belief .
The Gospel goes on to emphasize that others who waive that right are also blessed , but that does not affect the fact that they have that right , as recognized in Thomas .

Editor 's note : Campbell Brown anchors CNN's " Campbell Brown : Election Center " at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays .
She delivered this commentary during the " Cutting through the Bull " segment of Wednesday night 's broadcast , before President Bush 's speech on the financial crisis .
Campbell Brown says the Bush administration should n't be surprised Americans look askance at the bailout .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
" I have great , great confidence in our capital markets and in our financial institutions .
Our financial institutions , banks and investment banks , are strong .
Our capital markets are resilient .
They 're efficient .
They 're flexible . "
-- Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , March 16 , 2008
" Our policy in this administration -- laws should n't bail out lenders , laws should n't help speculators . "
-- President Bush , May 19 , 2008
" Our economy has continued growing , consumers are spending , business are investing , exports continue increasing and American productivity remains strong .
We can have confidence in the long - term foundation of our economy ... I think the system basically is sound .
I truly do . "
-- President Bush , July 15 , 2008
Watch Campbell take the Bush Administration to task »
Those were the words of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and President George W. Bush just a few months ago .
Today , of course , they have been proven completely wrong .
They are now telling us we are in a dire crisis , and that we must hand over hundreds of billions of dollars so they can lead us out of this mess .
What 's amazing to me is that the administration seems a little surprised that Congress and the American people are not marching in lockstep with them on this and not fully appreciating the urgency .
Well here 's why , in one word : accountability .
This administration missed the boat on this crisis .
They did n't see it coming .
That 's why when Bush goes on TV in a few minutes , he will face a very wary audience .
And Secretary Paulson , frankly , you did n't help the situation with your initial , imperious request to Congress that you be handed this money and that your decisions " may not be reviewed by any court of law or administrative agency . "
Seriously , what were you thinking ?
And Democrats , you are by no means blameless in all of this .
At the center of this crisis are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Although they did n't intend to encourage this spiraling chain reaction , it was leading Democrats in Congress -- Senate banking chairman Chris Dodd and his long - time counterpart in the House , Barney Frank -- who supported legislation that ultimately led to more and more of these bad loans we are all stuck with .
The people you thought you were trying to help are in even worse shape financially .
I know everyone is screaming about how urgent this crisis is and that action must be taken immediately .
But I love and live by former Supreme Court Justice Brandeis ' great quote : " Sunshine is the best disinfectant . "
What we need is scrutiny and debate .
If it has to happen quickly , then do it fast , but without grandstanding or political posturing .
We need serious scrutiny and debate , and that should happen whether we are talking about a giant piece of legislation that is going to affect us all , or whether we are talking about presidential and vice presidential candidates .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .

A scientific panel has issued a blistering report against the Food and Drug Administration , saying the agency ignored important evidence in reassuring consumers about the safety of the controversial chemical bisphenol - A .
The panel , in a report issued this week , did not draw any conclusions about the safety of the chemical , known as BPA .
But it criticized the F.D.A. for ignoring crucial studies and using what it said were flawed methods in reaching its conclusions .
The drug agency ’s evaluation of BPA “ creates a false sense of security ” and “ overlooks a wide range of potentially - serious findings , ” the panel ’s report said .
In a statement , the F.D.A. said that the report “ raised important questions ” and that more study was needed , but it did not back away from its claim that the chemical is safe .
The agency will review the report of the scientific advisory board on Friday .
BPA is widely used to make hard , clear plastic water and baby bottles , and it is found in the lining of nearly every soft drink and canned food product .
The chemical appears to have estrogen - like effects , and in animal studies it appears to accelerate puberty and pose a cancer risk .
While most worries about BPA focus on children , some recent reports suggest BPA interferes with chemotherapy , and in adults the chemical has been linked to higher risk for heart disease and diabetes .
The F.D.A. has maintained that the levels of BPA to which children and adults are exposed do not pose a meaningful risk .
This fall , the agency asked an independent panel of scientific advisers to review its conclusions .
The seven - member panel includes environmental health , toxicology and statistics experts from three major universities , the Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
These are among the concerns raised by the panel :
The F.D.A. assessment does not have an adequate number of infant formula samples and relies too heavily on averages , rather than accounting for variability in the samples .
The agency excluded several important animal studies that raised questions about the safety of BPA .
New research on BPA in adult humans and animals was published after the F.D.A. ’s draft report and should be included in its findings .
The margins of safety for BPA exposure used by the agency are “ inadequate . ”
The agency focused only on food - source exposures to BPA rather than the “ totality of exposures ” from other sources , which “ severely limits the usefulness of the safety assessment . ”
In its statement , the F.D.A. said consumers should know that “ based on all available evidence , the present consensus among regulatory agencies in the United States , Canada , Europe and Japan is that current levels of exposure to BPA through food packaging do not pose an immediate health risk to the general population , including infants and babies . ”
The American Chemistry Council said it awaits direction from the F.D.A. once further BPA assessment is complete .
“ If the agency determines that existing margins of safety are insufficient in infant applications , our member companies that manufacture BPA will put processes in place to promptly phase out the use of materials containing BPA in baby bottles and infant formula packaging , ” the group said in a statement .

Pssst .
Do n't spread it around too much , because there 's still a month to go and I do n't want to jinx things - but substance is in this year .
You , I know , think US presidential elections are always decided by silly or superficial or out - and - out false representations and aspersions .
Al Gore sighed too much in a debate and was n't the sort of fellow you 'd like to have a beer with .
George W Bush never sighed once , as far as anyone could tell , and was the sort you 'd like to have a beer with ( even though he did n't drink beer - I never quite sorted that one out ) .
John Kerry seemed so French and effete .
He windsurfed .
And he did n't save all those men during the Vietnam war .
How could he have , really , being so ...
French and effete and windsurfy ?
Little glimmers of substance have usually shown through .
In 2004 , for instance , a still - significant percentage of American voters remained jittery about a second large - scale terrorist attack on US soil .
Bush ran as the man who had prevented that from happening and argued that he was more trustworthy on this matter than Kerry .
And Bill Clinton withstood an intensive barrage of over - the - top attacks and stayed focused on the economy ( he was helped along by third - party candidate Ross Perot 's hefty 19 % of the vote ) .
Superficialities and attacks , though , usually dominate .
We understand this .
In fact , more than a few liberals have spent the last four years trying to persuade Democrats to be every bit as superficial and nasty as the Republicans are at election time .
But this year , something feels different .
Voters are actually paying closer attention to issues .
It is the result , no doubt , of the US being in terrible shape right now .
It tends to focus the mind .
The economy is terrible .
The stock market is terrible .
Indicators of general societal wellbeing , like healthcare and pensions , are terrible .
Our standing in the world is terrible .
The conditions in Afghanistan are terrible .
The situation in Iraq is improved but was so terrible for so long that people just basically want out .
We are a country in decline .
The decline is the result of the policies of the last eight years .
Everyone outside of hardcore conservatives knows this .
No candidate for president can utter the sentence " we are a country in decline " .
America 's central myth about itself is that , unlike Rome or Austria - Hungary or ( sorry ) an earlier Britain , we are impervious to time 's vicissitudes and will always be numero uno .
People now are worried that underneath that bravado , maybe we wo n't be .
And so , substance matters .
The public responses to the financial meltdown and the first two debates make this evident .
When the Wall Street crisis hit , John McCain erupted with lots of bluster about how he was going to crack down on the fatcats and the greed heads .
He " suspended " his campaign to return to Washington to handle the problem .
He called Barack Obama green and a hypocrite .
In other words , he was superficial and nastily aggressive in precisely the way that usually works in presidential campaigns .
But he lost the argument badly and irrevocably - polls before the Wall Street crisis showed him closing the gap with Obama on the question of who can better handle the economy .
That gap is now wider than ever , and will probably remain that way .
Obama , by contrast , stayed calm , did n't attack McCain 's stunt and at press conferences listed the specific items he needed to see in the bail - out bill .
He was talking with congressional leaders and the treasury secretary about these substantive points .
To the Americans who were paying attention , the distinction between the two candidates was clear .
Likewise with the debates .
McCain had more zingers and one - liners than Obama did and generally speaking was the aggressor that night .
And Sarah Palin , with her repeated winks at the camera , had far more of a folksy , I 'm - just - like - Joe - Sixpack approach than Joe Biden did .
One - liners , aggression and emotive warmth are supposed to win these contests , we are told , and they usually do .
But literally every poll I 've seen shows that voters think Obama and Biden - who were direct and substantive and between them barely said one zingy or folksy thing - won the debates , and handily so .
The Republicans can't win on substance .
Most of their positions are too unpopular .
They know this , and this is why they lie , like Palin did during her debate , about leading the state of Alaska to divest of investments that could benefit the Sudanese government .
It turns out that her administration opposed such divestment when it mattered and that she finally told a legislator or two she was for it - after it was too late for the legislature to act .
That 's not substance .
It 's substance abuse .
So in this closing month , they will do what they know how to do .
Republican operatives told the Washington Post last Saturday that they will spend the remaining days attacking Obama 's character and past associations .
Meanwhile , independent conservative groups are bound to spread all manner of disinformation - about how al - Qaida wants Obama to win and how , if the Democrats capture the White House , they 'll outlaw the Ten Commandments .
We 've seen lies like these work before .
But what we have n't seen before is basically 80 % of American adults feeling this miserably about their country .
If there 's ever going to be a circumstance when voters stay focused on the things that matter , this ought to be it .

US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's plan to end the rout in US financial markets may derail the dollar 's three - month rally as investors weigh the costs of the rescue .
The combination of spending $ US700 billion on soured mortgage - related assets and providing $ US400 billion to guarantee money - market mutual funds will boost US borrowing as much as $ US1 trillion , according to Barclays Capital interest - rate strategist Michael Pond in New York .
While the rescue may restore investor confidence to battered financial markets , traders will again focus on the twin budget and current - account deficits and negative real US interest rates .
'' As we get to the other side of this , the dollar will get crushed , '' said John Taylor , chairman of New York - based International Foreign Exchange Concepts , the world 's biggest currency hedge - fund firm , which manages bout $ US15 billion .
The dollar fell against the euro and 14 of the world 's most - traded currencies on September 19 as Paulson unveiled the plan , even as the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index rose 4 % .
The plan may end the rally that began in June and drove the US currency up 10 % versus the euro , 2 % against the yen and almost 13 % compared with Brazil 's real , strategists said .
Paulson 's plan , sent to Congress September 20 , would mark an unprecedented government intrusion into markets and increase the nation 's debt ceiling by 6.6 % to $ US11.315 trillion .
Officials may also start a $ US400 billion Federal Deposit Insurance pool to insure investors in money - market funds .
Dollar ' Downdraft '
'' The downdraft on the dollar from the hit to the balance sheet of the US government will dwarf the short - term gains from solving the banking crisis , '' said David Woo , London - based global head of foreign - exchange strategy at Barclays , the third - biggest currency trader , according to a 2008 survey by Euromoney Institutional Investor .
Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke began plotting the rescue last week after New York - based Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy , the government seized control of American International Group and Merrill Lynch was forced into the arms of Bank of America .
Morgan Stanley dropped as much as 44 % Sept. 17 , the biggest one - day decline in its history , and Goldman Sachs , where Paulson was chief executive officer from 1998 to 2006 , lost 26 % .
Both are based in New York .
In the four days following Lehman 's bankruptcy , the ICE future exchange 's Dollar Index , which measures the currency 's performance against the US 's six biggest trading partners , dropped 1.2 % , leaving it 1.3 % higher this year .
Dollar Hegemony
The dollar fell 0.8 % to $ US1.4466 per euro on September 19 , bringing the greenback 's decline for the week to 1.7 % .
While it strengthened 1.9 % to 107.45 yen , it was still down 0.5 % on the week .
'' After years of doubting the hegemonic status of the dollar , this proves it 's still there , '' said Stephen Jen , London - based head of research at Morgan Stanley .
'' But of course this situation is definitely not stable .
The capital leaving the emerging markets is only going into the dollar and that 's a powerful force .
It 's a very uncomfortable balance . ''
By the end of the year , the euro will weaken to $ US1.43 and the yen will trade at 108 to the dollar , according to analyst surveys by Bloomberg .
The dollar will depreciate to 1.65 against the real , compared with 1.83 on September 19 .
Growth , Deficits
Although the dollar may suffer short - term , at least one analyst says the US government 's planned rescue will strengthen the currency before long .
Paulson 's proposals will return foreign - exchange markets to the trend of the past months , according to Adam Boyton , senior currency strategist at Frankfurt - based Deutsche Bank , the world 's biggest currency - trading bank .
Since the end of June , the Dollar Index has gained 7.2 % .
'' It 's a positive plan that 's ultimately good for the dollar , '' said New York - based Boyton .
'' It reduces risk and volatility and gets the focus back on macroeconomic fundamentals , which suggest weakness throughout the rest of the globe next year , with returning strength in the US . ''
The US economy may expand 1.5 % next year , according to the median estimate of 80 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg .
That compares with 1.1 % for the euro-region and 1.15 % for Japan , the world 's second - largest economy .
The rescue comes as the US budget deficit and the current - account balance , the broadest measure of trade , grow .
The Congressional Budget Office projects the spending shortfall will increase to $ US438 billion next year from $ US407 billion .
The current account deficit is up from $ US167.24 billion in December .
' Huge New Supply '
'' Investors may start to worry about the amount of debt the US is taking on and its impact on the dollar , '' said Geoffrey Yu , a currency strategist in London at UBS , the second - largest foreign - exchange trader .
'' The fact that they mentioned taxpayer money implies that they 're going to issue debt .
If there 's going to be a huge new supply of Treasuries , this will be dollar negative .
It 's too much for the dollar to take . ''
Traders are also concerned the bank bailout will spread to other US industries suffering from the credit crunch that 's holding back an economy growing at its slowest pace since 2001 .
Detroit - based General Motors , the world 's biggest automaker , said last week it will tap the remaining $ US3.5 billion of a $ US4.5 billion credit line to pay for restructuring costs .
Lower interest rates may also weigh on the dollar .
Futures on the Chicago Board of Trade show there 's a 38 % chance policy makers will lower their target rate for overnight lending between banks to at least 1.75 % by January from 2 % currently .
A month ago , they showed a 46 % chance of an increase to 2.25 % .
' Damaged ' Currencies
Rates in the US are already the lowest of any Group of 10 industrialized nations except Japan , where it 's 0.5 % .
The European Central Bank 's benchmark is 4.25 % .
Another drawback for the dollar is that the Fed 's key rate is 3.4 % percentage points less than the rate of inflation , the most since 1980 , so investors lose money by investing in short - term US fixed - income assets .
'' People thought that the Fed was done cutting , '' said Andrew Balls , an executive vice president and member of the investment committee of Newport , California - based Pacific Investment Management , which oversees almost $ US830 billion .
'' In the longer term the diversification away from the dollar will remain intact .
The US has n't done itself any favors in making its assets attractive to foreign investors . ''
The biggest beneficiaries may be Brazil 's real and Australia 's dollar , as demand for higher - yielding assets rebounds , according to Goldman Sachs .
The two currencies , the biggest losers versus the dollar since July , may rebound 7.7 % and 4.6 % , respectively , the next two weeks , Goldman Sachs forecasts .
'' The currencies that have been damaged the most have the best growth , '' said Jens Nordvig , a strategist with Goldman Sachs in New York .
'' You 're going to see a lot of flows back into these currencies now . ''

If you want to know why Obama appears to be ahead in this once - solidly Republican state , this reader will clue you in :
They are killing me .
I am a registered Republican .
I live in Virginia .
But I am clearly not a " Virginia Republican " .
This ticket and loathesome campaign is a disaster - I have n't left the Republican Party so much as it has left me , at least here in the Commonwealth .
The party gladly allowed Rove / GWB to cultivate a certain brand of politics to win and hold the White House .
And now that the bill has come due , so few wish to face the music .
And in the process - and his quest for office - John McCain has embraced that which he professed to repudiate .
Ignorant Christian Fascism is not a recipe for success , it 's Saudi Arabia under a different prophet .
Count me out .
Despite differing with the Democratic platform on a great number of policies , I will gladly vote for the Obama ticket because at a minimum it promises adults at the helm , a rational approach to policymaking , the return of science over theocracy , the restoration of the primacy of the rule of law , and the creative destruction of that assemblage once known as the GOP .
Hey , America : are your politicians stupid or do they just think you are ?
Check this new analysis of Thursday night ’s “ debate ” :
An analysis carried out by a language monitoring service said Friday that Gov. Sarah Palin spoke at a more than ninth - grade level and Sen.
Joseph Biden spoke at a nearly eighth - grade level in Thursday night ’s debate between the vice presidential candidates .
Which proves my initial take right , I guess .
It seemed pretty clear to me that Biden won – well , technically , I should say that Palin lost it , but let ’s not split hairs .
Since you ca n’t win a debate unless you communicate with your audience on their own level , we have to give the nod to Shoeless Joe , who was able to talk down to the crowd by more than a full grade level .
Granted , both have a long way to go if they ever hope to match the likes of Reagan or Bush .
Ron never ventured higher than second - grade level , and in doing so only overwhelmed the average American ’s intellect by a half grade or so .
As best I can tell Bush has mastered the art of actually speaking at a lower level than the public .
The study also produced some other findings that ought to make America right proud of itself :
“ The two candidates were nearly even in total number of words spoken .
The normally voluble Biden restrained his tendency to ramble by uttering just 5,492 words during the 90 - minute debate , versus 5,235 for Palin , Payack said . ”
As you can tell , the researchers see using fewer words as a good thing .
Obviously – because all those words tend to confuse people .
“ Newspapers are typically written to a sixth - grade reading level . ”
Which explains their declining readership – they need to dumb it down a little more make their publications more accessible .
make their publications more accessible .
“ Letters per word : tied at 4.4 . ”
Because “ dumb ” is a 4.4 - letter word .
“ Ease of reading : Biden , 66.7 ( with 100 being the easiest to read or hear ) , versus 62.4 for Palin . ”
We ’ve certainly come a long way as a society , folks .
Once upon a time brainiacs stalked the political landscape .
Note this bit : “ The analysis said Abraham Lincoln spoke at an 11th - grade level during his seven debates in 1858 against incumbent Stephen A. Douglas in their race for a Senate seat from Illinois . ”
Citizens Consumers are occasionally impressed by people they can’t understand , figuring that it must mean the speaker is really smart .
But in general the US has grown a lot less tolerant of that sort of uppity elitist horsewax , and rightfully so .
Honest
Abe may have bullshitted his way onto Rushmore , but if he were around today he ’d have to speak to us on our terms .
Short words , short sentences , and none of those complicated ideas like they throw around up to the college .
We ’ve come a long way , baby .
God bless America .
Let freedom ring !

At PDC today , Microsoft gave the first public demonstration of Windows 7 .
Until now , the company has been uncharacteristically secretive about its new OS ; over the past few months , Microsoft has let on that the taskbar will undergo a number of changes , and that many bundled applications would be unbundled and shipped with Windows Live instead .
There have also been occasional screenshots of some of the new applets like Calculator and Paint .
Now that the covers are finally off , the scale of the new OS becomes clear .
The user interface has undergone the most radical overhaul and update since the introduction of Windows 95 thirteen years ago .
First , however , it 's important to note what Windows 7 is n't .
Windows 7 will not contain anything like the kind of far - reaching architectural modifications that Microsoft made with Windows Vista .
Vista brought a new display layer and vastly improved security , but that came at a cost : a significant number of ( badly - written ) applications had difficulty running on Vista .
Applications expecting to run with Administrator access were still widespread when Vista was released , and though many software vendors do a great job , there are still those that have n't updated or fixed their software .
Similarly , at its launch many hardware vendors did not have drivers that worked with the new sound or video subsystems , leaving many users frustrated .
While windows 7 does n't undo these architectural changes — they were essential for the long - term health of the platform — it equally has n't made any more .
Any hardware or software that works with Windows Vista should also work correctly with Windows 7 , so unlike the transition from XP to Vista , the transition from Vista to 7 wo n't show any regressions ; nothing that used to work will stop working .
So , rather than low - level , largely invisible system changes , the work on Windows 7 has focused much more on the user experience .
The way people use computers is changing ; for example , it 's increasingly the case that new PCs are bought to augment existing home machines rather than replacement , so there are more home networks and shared devices .
Business users are switching to laptops , with the result that people expect to seamlessly use their ( Domain - joined ) office PC on their home network .
As well as these broader industry trends , Microsoft also has extensive data on how people use its software .
Through the Customer Experience Improvement Program ( CEIP ) , an optional , off - by - default feature of many Microsoft programs , the company has learned a great deal about the things that users do .
For example , from CEIP data Microsoft knows that 70 % of users have between 5 and 15 windows open at any one time , and that most of the time they only actively use one or two of those windows .
With this kind of data , Microsoft has streamlined and refined the user experience .
The biggest visible result of all this is the taskbar .
The taskbar in Windows 7 is worlds apart from the taskbar we 've known and loved ever since the days of Chicago .
Text descriptions on the buttons are gone , in favor of big icons .
The icons can — finally — be rearranged ; no longer will restarting an application put all your taskbar icons in the wrong order .
The navigation between windows is now two - level ; mousing over an icon shows a set of window thumbnails , and clicking the thumbnail switches windows .
Right clicking the icons shows a new UI device that Microsoft calls " Jump Lists . "
They 're also found on the Start Menu :
Jump lists provide quick access to application features .
Applications that use the system API for their Most Recently Used list ( the list of recently - used filenames that many apps have in their File menus ) will automatically acquire a Jump List containing their most recently used files .
There 's also an API to allow applications to add custom entries ; Media Player , for example , includes special options to control playback .
This automatic support for new features is a result of deliberate effort on Microsoft 's part .
The company wants existing applications to benefit from as many of the 7 features as they can without any developer effort .
New applications can extend this automatic support through new APIs to further enrich the user experience .
The taskbar thumbnails are another example of this approach .
All applications get thumbnails , but applications with explicit support for 7 will be able to add thumbnails on a finer - grained basis .
IE8 , for instance , has a thumbnail per tab ( rather than per window ) .
Window management has also undergone changes .
In recognition of the fact that people tend only to use one or two windows concurrently , 7 makes organizing windows quicker and easier .
Dragging a window to the top of the screen maximizes it automatically ; dragging it off the top of the screen restores it .
Dragging a window to the left or right edge of the screen resizes the window so that it takes 50 % of the screen .
With this , a pair of windows can be quickly docked to each screen edge to facilitate interaction between them .
Another common task that 7 improves is " peeking " at windows ; switching to a window briefly just to read something within the window but not actually interact with the window .
To make this easier , scrubbing the mouse over the taskbar thumbnails will turn every window except the one being pointed at into a glass outline ; moving the mouse away will reinstate all the glass windows .
As well as being used for peeking at windows , you can also peek at the desktop :
Peeking at the desktop is particularly significant , because the desktop is now where gadgets live .
Because people are increasingly using laptops , taking up a big chunk of space for the sidebar is n't really viable ; Microsoft has responded by scrapping the sidebar and putting the gadgets onto the desktop itself .
Gadgets are supposed to provide at - a - glance information ; peeking at the desktop , therefore , becomes essential for using gadgets .
The taskbar 's system tray has also been improved .
A common complaint about the tray is that it fills with useless icons and annoying notifications .
With 7 , the tray is now owned entirely by the user .
By default , new tray icons are hidden and invisible ; the icons are only displayed if explicitly enabled .
The icons themselves have also been streamlined to make common tasks ( such as switching wireless networks ) easier and faster .
The other significant part of the Windows UI is Explorer .
Windows 7 introduces a new concept named Libraries .
Libraries provide a view onto arbitrary parts of the filesystem with organization optimized for different kinds of files .
In use , Libraries feel like a kind of WinFS - lite ; they do n't have the complex database system underneath , but they do retain the idea of a custom view of your files that 's independent of where the files are .
These UI changes represent a brave move by the company .
The new UI takes the concepts that Windows users have been using for the last 13 years and extends them in new and exciting ways .
Windows 7 may not change much under the hood , but the extent of these interface changes makes it clear that this is very much a major release .

Obama ’s new political ad , “ The American Promise ” is the single most frightening political advertisement I have ever seen in my life .
It ’s absolutely chilling .
The rabid cultist gleam in the eyes of the supporters nearly weeping as Obama repeats his meaningless rhetoric .
Can this be real ?
I ’ve never had much faith in the political understanding of my fellow man .
Admittedly , I ’m a horrible misanthrope , of the opinion that the masses are irrational chumps , with about as much understanding of basic economics as I have about the inner workings of the Large Hadron Collider .
Maybe I ’m out of touch , but I imagine the average person setting out nachos every Sunday to root for Red or Blue like a political football game ; shouting out buzzwords like “ More Regulations ! ” and “ Al Qaeda Hates Freedom ! ” , then talking about it the next day at the water cooler .
Why else follow politics if not as conversation fodder , right ?
I figured I ’d just watch the madness from the sidelines for a while and move to Costa Rica when the shit really starts to hit the fan and the freaks inevitably vote themselves into slavery .
I did n’t think it ’d happen so quickly though .
To be clear , I ’m emphatically not a McCain supporter .
I ’m not expressing a partisan bias , I ’m expressing a bias against stupidity and absurdity .
Really , this ad is mesmerizingly absurd .
Have we been so completely zombified by political rhetoric spoken over rousing music that we can’t even recognize propaganda when we see it ?
Obama offers nothing in this ad… absolutely nothing , no issues , no solutions , only more fodder for the cult of personality that has grown up around him .
But he even goes beyond that by brilliantly switching the campaign away from himself .
He ’s no longer the candidate , the people are .
According to this ad , a vote for him is a vote for yourself .
You like yourself , do n’t you ?
New Ideas ? , New Politics ? , Change ?
These words mean everything , and therefore nothing .
They ’re vague and obscure and all - encompassing and they have no place in the political arena .
It ’s time people spoke up and stopped letting these pandering maniacs insult our intelligence with nonsense terms .
We , as voters , need to demand clarity from politicians .
We ca n’t sit back and mindlessly applaud every grunt and gesture and bit of gibberish as if it had real meaning .
We ca n’t get hypnotized by whimsical jive , no matter how beautiful it sounds .
And Change is , of course , a beautiful word , especially now .
Undoubtedly , we ’ve had a very real creeping badness growing in the US over the past 8 years .
We have an endless war on terror and constant fear of terrorists and even of our own government .
I do n’t want to get blown up , or snatched away to some far off dentention center for reading a book on the danger list .
The world has changed , and people are hopeless in the face of this insanity .
They need some sort of empowering message , something to make them feel good about their government , to make them think their government is finally on their side .
Obama , the brilliant politician and marketing genius , has capitalized on that , without offering a single tangible , workable , political solution .
The thing is , government is never on your side , and you should never feel good about it .
Anyone telling you otherwise is just covering your eyes to the thievery and corruption that goes hand - in - hand with all government .
Do n’t fall for it , you ’re smarter than that , you ’re better than that .
I have never feared more for my country than I do this election year .
Apple Squashes the iPhone SDK NDA :
What 's the OSS Impact ?

After much teeth - gnashing from the developer community , Apple has finally dropped its draconian and restrictive non-disclosure agreement ( NDA ) on the iPhone software development kit ( SDK ) .
In the seven months since the SDK showed up , Apple has taken much heat from developers and iPhone users alike over its lack of platfrom openness .
The platform still is n't open , but it is a step in the right direction for Apple to eliminate this NDA .
Here 's what this means for the open source phones that will be competing with the iPhone .
Our sister blog the AppleBlog cites the key statements that Apple has made about its decision to drop the NDA :
" We put the NDA in place because the iPhone OS includes many Apple inventions and innovations that we would like to protect , so that others do n’t steal our work .
It has happened before .
While we have filed for hundreds of patents on iPhone technology , the NDA added yet another level of protection .
We put it in place as one more way to help protect the iPhone from being ripped off by others .
However , the NDA has created too much of a burden on developers , authors and others interested in helping further the iPhone ’s success , so we are dropping it for released software . "
Developers will get a new SDK agreement without an NDA covering released software within a week or so , according to Apple .
Unreleased software and features will also remain under NDA until they are released .
In the coming war between Linux phones based on LiMo 's platform , Android phones such as the T - Mobile G1 , and the iPhone , the key to victory is going to be to snag the most good developers delivering the best applications .
Apple 's NDA on its SDK had been restricting many types of development efforts .
In fact , just a few days ago a publisher stopped the publication of a book on developing for the iPhone specifically because of the NDA .
While Apple 's platform is still far from open , dropping the NDA allows developers to share information freely , and will undoubtedly usher in more applications for the already red - hot iPhone .
This is yet another reason that , while I think Android will be a big success ( and not just on handsets ) , it 's going to take time for good open source applications that can compete with iPhone applications to show up .
This is yet another reason why Google would be wise to put some serious funding behind Android application development .
There is a $ 100 million fund in place to encourage development for the iPhone , and RIM has a $ 150 million fund for Blackberry application development .
Making good on a promise it made at the very beginning , Google has today announced that the source code underpinning its Android platform for mobile devices is available for free to anyone who wants a crack at it .
The code is being provided through the newly - announced Android Open Source Project , which will give the public at large the opportunity to make contributions to the platform 's all - important core -- a first for a mobile operating system with true mass - market appeal .
Theoretically , the move should position Android to benefit from a fairly democratic , speedy evolution , and it'll also give anyone with a few spare chips lying around the chance to build a smartphone of their own without shelling out a dime in licensing fees .
We 're really looking forward to seeing Android pop up on a whole bunch of devices for which it was never intended -- but we have to admit , in a sick , totally twisted sort of way , we 're looking forward to some truly deranged individual porting Windows Mobile to the G1 , too .

Dear Joe the Plumber ,
Welcome to your 15 minutes of fame .
It ’s not everyone who gets his name mentioned 286 times in a presidential debate .
If you have n’t already , you simply must change your business ’s name to Joe the Plumber .
That ’s just good marketing .
Oh , and do n’t forget to add the tag line , “ As seen on TV ! ”
OK , Joe , so you had a conversation with Barack Obama and , while media reports are very sketchy about exactly what your circumstances are ( not surprising ) , it appears you want to buy a business that “ brings in ” more than $ 250,000 .
I have yet to find out if “ brings in ” means $ 250,000 in revenue or profit ( a very important distinction , Joe ) , but let ’s assume for a moment that it ’s profit we ’re talking about .
Under Barack Obama ’s plan ( as sketchy as it is on his website ) , a good guess would be that you would go into a higher tax bracket , paying about 3.6 % more in taxes on every dollar you earn over $ 250,000 , for a total marginal tax rate of 39.6 % — exactly the same as it was in the 1990s .
But let ’s take a closer look at your situation , shall we Joe ?
You say you ’re planning to buy this business , and it must be a very large small business , indeed , if it covers salaries , expenses , trucks , inventory and the like and still yields a $ 250,000 + profit .
I ’m going to guess that you do n’t have the cash to buy this business outright , Joe , and if you do , I think you ’re holding back on us .
I think you ’ve inherited some money .
But let ’s assume that you ’re borrowing a fair amount of money to buy the business , using its book value ( what the business is worth if you sold all the assets and paid off all your debts ) as security and using the revenue stream to pay off the loan .
Let ’s also assume a business this size is incorporated .
Here ’s what you do , Joe .
First off , you have your corporation pay you a salary of , say , $ 249,000 per year .
Now you ’re not in the higher marginal tax bracket , right ?
Payments on the loan you took out to buy the business are fully tax deductible , so profits will be reduced by that amount .
If you still have more than $ 250,000 in profit , we ’re talking about a rather large business here , and probably a very large down payment ( which suggests that you can manipulate your down payment to reduce your taxes , does n’t it ? )
But here ’s the thing , Joe .
When you own a business , you can do all kinds of things to reduce taxable income ( profit ) .
For instance , you can buy more equipment , which can then be depreciated over the years , providing a tax deduction and increasing the company ’s book value and , thus , your wealth .
Even fully depreciated equipment can generally be sold , in the future , for something .
You can spend more money on advertising and hire on a new plumber or two .
The advertising costs and the employment costs are generally fully tax deductible .
Well , let me take that back .
If you provide your employees with health insurance , your costs for health insurance wo n’t be tax deductible under John McCain ’s plan , but who ’s counting , right ?
By advertising and hiring on , you can drastically increase your revenues ( the amount of money coming in ) while keeping profits below the $ 250,000 mark .
The increased revenues will make the resale value of your business much higher than it already is , increasing your wealth without getting taxed on that increase .
If you want to take more wealth out right now without paying taxes , there is a cornucopia of tax - free or tax - deferred retirement options , benefits , and the like that can move money right around the IRS ’s outstretched palm .
Eventually , Joe , your company will be so large , and you will be so wealthy , than an extra 3.5 pennies in tax on each dollar on income you earn over $ 250,000 will be chickenfeed to you ( if it is n’t already ) .
But , hey , it ’s up to you .
Increase the underlying wealth in your company without paying taxes , or take cash now and pay a few additional taxes on it .
But , please , do n’t complain to me about paying more taxes .
All it says to me is that you ’re not smart enough to run your business ’s financial side .
All the best to you and yours ,
JS O’Brien
UPDATE
It turns out that Joe is not a good businessman for a simple reason :
He does n’t own a business , appears to have no immediate prospects to do so , has no plumber ’s license , works for a small firm doing residential work ( which means his employer is unlikely to be clearing $ 250 k per year ) , and has occasionally talked to the owner about buying the business — someday .
Poor Joe .
He ’s about to get ripped to shreds by the media , and he seems like a pretty decent guy .
I feel for him .
On the other hand , Joe is a great example of those who are so terrified that they ’ll get rich some day and owe an extra 3.5 cents on every dollar over $ 250,000 that they spend a lot of time worrying about it .
Joe does n’t know that he is unlikely ever to make that kind of money .
UPDATE #2
It just gets better and better .
Bloomberg is reporting that Joe owes around $ 1200 in back taxes , and there is an Ohio lien filed against him .
What a day and age we live in .
The vast amount of information and analytical ability we possess due to our digitalized environment can often times be overwhelming , but there ’s some good stuff to be found .
Some stuff we do ( okay , at least the geekier among us ) with the information we have is to play with it .
No ends needed , no definitive goal or tactical reasons , just playing with data like we had with Matchbox cars as a kid .
That sounds weird , does n’t it ?
Eh , oh well , so I like stuff like that –it could be worse , I could be a plushophile .
Occasionally though , playing with data leads to something neat , as I think it did this time .
There I am , playing with Google trends , comparing ‘ sex ’ to ‘ Jesus ’ , and ‘ Tootsie Roll ’ to ‘ Thoreau ’ ( sex is way more popular than Jesus , and surprisingly , Thoreau beat down Tootsie Roll ) , when I decided to plug in the presidential tickets .
It seemed banal at first , but then I got to thinking .
I downloaded the chart and opened it in Excel , made it into my own chart with linear trend lines , and viola !
An instant explanation of the past month in the campaign .
The big peak that you see is the VP debate .
That orange skyscraper is Palin being searched a ton , probably the searchers looking for some sort of rational explanation of what to expect , and the polling results of the debate .
Biden went up by about the same factor , although his search volume both before and after just ca n’t compare to Palin’s .
Biden , no matter his ability to stuff his size 11 loafer deep into his mouth , has had relatively little search volume for the entire campaign .
This is not only good , it ’s great .
Biden is n’t a sexy choice ( although do n’t tell that to my mother and her friends , apparently he ’s hot stuff to the AARP girls ) , but he ’s one that ’s seen as completely safe to the voter .
There ’s no reason to search for Biden stuff , he ’s a total pro with a resumé longer than da Vinci’s .
The sheer boringness of Biden is his greatest strength on the Democratic ticket .
No surprises .
Palin has peeks and valleys reminiscent of that Himalayan adventure I ’ve never actually taken .
She ’s the most dangerous person I ’ve ever seen on a campaign trail , and not to the opponent .
She ca n’t go three days without some major , idiotic gaffe that a first year poly - sci student would n’t make .
The VP needs more power , the VP is in charge of the Senate , I can see Russia from my snowmobile , the Bush Doctrine ( “ In what way , Charlie ? ” ) , and any number of other mind numbing comments make her like a blind moose on meth running through the entire Republican party with chainsaws for antlers –you know someone ’s getting hurt , but you ca n’t help but watch .
There is reason after reason to search for her on the Internet , and not too many of them are good .
Now , McCain versus Obama .
Senator Obama ’s trend line looks like a plane taking off guided by a demure and responsible pilot .
McCain ’s trend is rising , but ever so slightly .
The best news for him is that by the end of the campaign he should be more searched than his Vice Presidential choice .
It ’s called upstaging , John , and you ’ve been upstaged by a half - wit former sports anchor from a small TV station in Alaska .
That ’s gotta hurt .
These trend lines seem reflected in the polls .
Senator Obama ’s support seems to be solidifying just at the right time , while Senator McCain , although not losing percentage points ( in most polls ) , he is losing ground .
Here ’s the RCP tracking averages for the past month , with an approximate trend lines added :
McCain ’s trend line in the searches seems to be better than the polling numbers , and Obama ’s polling numbers seems to be shallower than his increase in search volume .
Now , one can reasonably expect that closer to the election , more searches will be performed on each candidate , so logically , the trend lines need to be ‘ normalized ’ to some degree .
I could have actually done some math for this , but I decided to merely overlay the trend lines , and adjust the search lines so that they have approximately the same midpoint as the poll trends–about where 50/50 would be .
Lo and behold , the overlay :
Wow , that ’s a close match .
The search trend lines are still not in exact line with what the polls are saying , but I ’d say that they match up better than expected .
Can this be ?
Can searches from Google show the direction of the campaigns ?
Honestly , I ’m not completely sold on the idea , but I ’ll tell you what - that ’s an interesting correlation .
I told you playing with data can be fun .

Hotel chiefs were rapped yesterday for planning to weigh children - and charge fat ones more for Sunday lunch .
Youngsters will be asked to step on the scales to see how much their restaurant meal should cost .
A child weighing five stone will pay £ 5 while a youngster who tips the scales at 10 stone will have to fork out £ 10 .
Bosses at five - star Oulton Hall near Leeds claim the idea is " just a bit of fun " .
But outraged child obesity experts say it could hold overweight youngsters up to ridicule .
Prof Paul Gateley , said : " It 's a cheap shot but ultimately they could end up shooting themselves in the foot .
What child wants to go out for a meal and suddenly be pulled on to the scales ? "
And Dr James Stubbs , the obesity researcher at Slimming World , said : " Families and children who are overweight need friendly support .
" Stigmatising young people who are struggling with their weight is hardly ' a bit of fun ' . "
But bosses at Oulton Hall , owned by De Vere Hotels , were unrepentant last night - and claimed the idea is about cutting the cost of dining out .
Spokesman Nigel Massey said : " There will no doubt be people who say it 's not politically correct .
" Well , frankly , they should get a life and stop being so miserable . "

WHEN , on October 3rd , America 's Congress eventually approved the Bush administration 's $ 700 billion plan to buy troubled mortgage assets , lawmakers earned not only the gratitude of Ben Bernanke , but also a promise from him .
The Federal Reserve , its chairman declared , would do its part with “ all of the powers at our disposal ” .
He has certainly kept his word .
On October 6th the Fed doubled , to $ 900 billion , the planned size of the loans it auctions to banks .
A day later it said it would for the first time in its history make unsecured loans to companies , including banks , by buying commercial paper that they are unable to refinance .
In theory , this tactic could be used to allow the Fed to make any kind of loan , including to state and local governments and in the interbank funds market .
And a day after that it joined other leading central banks in cutting interest rates , lowering its target for the federal funds rate from 2 % to 1.5 % .
It is unlikely to stop there .
The rate could end up at zero .
The rate cut was a conventional response to the growing risk of a deep recession .
The other steps take the Fed farther into uncharted territory .
They were made possible in large part by a provision of the bail - out law that permits the central bank to pay interest on reserves that commercial banks keep on deposit at the Fed .
This is important because every time the Fed makes a loan , it creates additional bank reserves .
Banks lend excess reserves to each other , putting downward pressure on the federal funds rate .
To drain those reserves and offset that pressure , the Fed sells Treasury debt .
But it has been lending on such a huge scale that it has used up the bulk of its Treasuries .
Had it run out , its lending would have had to stop or the funds rate would fall to zero .
Paying interest on reserves largely removes that risk , because it leads the banks to lend the money back to the Fed .
None of this is certain to work .
Share prices fell heavily this week , and the spread of interbank lending rates over the federal funds rate set new records .
Yet the Bernanke doctrine is clear : the Fed will lend as much as it must and to whomever it must to contain the credit crisis .
It is far from finished .
The Fed 's balance - sheet has ballooned from $ 900 billion in August to $ 1.5 trillion on October 1st , and could soon pass $ 2 trillion .
But even that sum equals just 14 % of GDP .
Vincent Reinhart of the American Enterprise Institute , a think - tank in Washington , DC , notes that at the high point of its policy of “ quantitative easing ” , the balance - sheet of the Bank of Japan ( BoJ ) equalled 30 % of that country 's GDP .
Indeed , the Fed 's latest actions have drawn comparisons to quantitative easing : having already cut rates to zero , the BoJ bought loads of government bonds between 2001 and 2006 in order to expand the supply of bank reserves .
That helped reinforce the BoJ 's commitment to zero rates and bring down long - term rates .
Its direct impact on lending , however , was much less clear .
Made in America , not Japan
In fact the Fed 's actions are fundamentally different .
The creation of excess reserves ( Fed liabilities ) is merely the by - product of its actual goal , which is to expand loans ( Fed assets ) .
Frederic Mishkin , an economist at Columbia University who recently quit as a Fed governor , says quantitative easing is aimed at raising the overall level of liquidity in the financial system .
By contrast , the Fed is aiming at the sectors that are encountering problems .
“ It does not want its targeted liquidity determining overall liquidity , ” a job best left to standard monetary policy .
The Fed does face some constraints .
One is legal : like most central banks , it is generally prohibited from unsecured lending .
It gets around this , in part , by lending to its own off - balance - sheet vehicle , which holds the unsecured commercial paper .
Another is political : Americans may object to their central bank displacing private lenders .
But Mr Mishkin says the political risks of doing too little and letting the economy slide are far greater .
A final constraint , notes Kenneth Kuttner , an economist at Williams College , is that the Fed could in theory suffer loan losses so great that it needs recapitalisation , as central banks in Chile , Hungary and the Philippines have in the past .
Fears of such losses were one reason why the BoJ did not purchase much private - sector debt earlier in this decade .
In 2003 Mr Bernanke , then a Fed governor , argued that such concerns were misplaced because , unlike a commercial bank , a central bank cannot go bankrupt .
Mr Bernanke seems set on a different path from the BoJ's .
Its quantitative easing came a decade after Japanese banks began to fail , when they were too weak to lend out the excess reserves the BoJ gave them .
Most American banks can still lend , but uncertainty about their own and their customers ' access to funds holds them back .
The Fed 's expanded liquidity thus has a better chance of being used and supporting the economy .
“ We have learnt from historical experience with severe financial crises that if government intervention comes only at a point at which many or most financial institutions are insolvent or nearly so , the costs of restoring the system are greatly increased , ” Mr Bernanke said on October 7th .
“ This is not the situation we face today … the great majority of financial institutions have sufficient capital and liquidity to return to their critical function of providing new credit for our economy . ”
That belief may be standing in the way of even more radical measures .
Mr Bernanke has seen this crisis chiefly as one of illiquidity , not insolvency .
He has thus pressed first for measures that improve liquidity , such as buying tainted assets from banks and expanding the Fed 's own lending , while being less keen than outside economists on injecting public capital into banks , as Britain did this week .
Some sceptics note that banks will not seem so solvent once unavoidable loan losses are realised .
Mr Bernanke may be coming round : he has played up the fact that the bail - out programme can also be used to inject capital .

Stop and Smell the Miniatures
click photos to enlarge
Artist Michael Chesko must live by a similar credo .
He first caught the miniature bug while working as a software engineer for Motorola in the early 1980s .
His original creation ... a sprawling imaginary city named Britannica !
His medium and tools ... balsa wood , Xacto blades , and fingernail files .
But after ten years of purely creative ( but somewhat geeky ) fantasy , he realized he must put childish things aside ... after all , why spend time daydreaming when one could enjoy the demanding exactitude of reality ?
And so , he brings us Midtown Manhattan , his most ambitious work to date ...
This scale miniature of Midtown took 2000 hours to complete .
As reference , he used blueprints , old photographs , digital reproductions , and satellite images .
On a good day , he 'd work his way through four city blocks .
The entire model is 36 " x 30 " ... a good deal smaller than most office desks .
At the 1:3200 scale , the Empire State Building Chesko's favorite skyscraper ) roughly reaches the dizzying height of a Campbell 's Soup can .
All of us here at the Republic pretty much flipped when we saw Chesko's hand - carved miniatures .
Yet we 're torn .
Because the Republic also takes joy in childish , boneheaded fantasy .
That 's why we 're dying to see some of Chesko's earlier Britannica work !
C'mon Chesko !... show us the geeky fun stuff !
1 Downtown New York .
2 Downtown and Midtown
Chesko's Midtown model will soon go on display at the Skyscraper Museum in New York .
Much thanks to Micheal Chesko himself , who sent Tinselman these photos !

DIGG THIS
Every day brings a new surprise or two from our home - grown financial central planners .
Did they study some Soviet theorists ?
They did n’t have to .
They merely had to grow up in the American political , educational , and media system , our democracy being the disguised socialism - communism - fascism - plutocratic - kleptocracy that it is .
They merely absorbed their socialism second - hand .
Once in power , which means once placed in the closed circle of power , our commissars act accordingly .
People like Paulson and Bernanke and Cox can act in no other way , being the cowards and creatures of the system they are .
They cannot withstand the pressures to conform and survive in the circle of power when combined with their own warped understanding .
What is that closed circle ?
It is the to - and - fro movement of money among : banker - investment banker - central banker - campaign contributor - lobbyist - Congressmen - regulators .
What hath the SEC ( Securities and Exchange Commission ) now wrought ?
It hath banned short - selling in 799 financial stocks until October 2 , 2008 .
Such power !
To be able to stop people from trading on a dime .
And this in the supposed bastion of capitalism .
What a terrible advertisement for capitalism and free markets , except that we do n’t have them .
The next time someone speaks about the free market , or blames the free market for falling stock prices , remind them of this action .
Is n’t this what Murray Rothbard called " violent intervention " in the market ?
You bet it is .
Murray , they are dreaming new dreams of interventions that you ( and I ) never conceived of .
An action like this deserves a few words , reactions that is , not many , even if I thought I had better things to do today .
The financial stocks have rallied sharply .
But we do not know the size of the effect of the short - selling ban because simultaneously came the blockbuster news of a Resolution Trust type entity to bail out the banks .
That possibility has driven up stock prices too .
It will take a few careful studies to determine what effect the short - selling ban may have had on prices .
But the theory of it is clear enough .
And it can guide our understanding .
Short - sellers that have an impact on market prices are a specialized breed of investor .
They work to discover negative information .
They work to discover when stock prices are over - valuing a company ’s stock .
They then borrow stock and sell it .
By the usual market processes of price discovery , which are noisy and subject to volatility , that negative information may then get impounded in prices , showing up as lower prices if the short - sellers are on target in their assessments .
Enron stock , for example , was in a declining mode for some months before its ultimate crash .
Banning short - sales is a partial closure of the market .
The SEC , it goes without saying , has no natural right to do this .
Such violence is uncalled for in a society that values freedom .
Our leaders are upholding something vastly different than liberty , namely , a despicable old boy network , and they and their pals are the old boys .
The immediate effect of the news of such a ban is that traders anticipate that the flow of negative information will be dampened for a while .
That ’s one conclusion .
There are some ways out , however .
One can sell short in a synthetic way .
One can write a call option and buy a put option .
Will the SEC also stop all options trading in the 799 stocks ?
So far , they have not .
Short sellers can trade by writing calls and buying puts .
However , this approach may not work well if the option prices have also been impacted adversely .
That is possible because the call buyers and put sellers on the other side of the trade may want to sell short in order to even up their positions .
In short , the SEC has thrown a monkey wrench into the options markets as well .
Another possibility is that the short selling will go offshore .
This will be slowed down by the cartel of offshore regulators who follow the SEC leadership .
The United Kingdom has done some short - selling banning of its own .
If traders think that the negative news wo n’t be developed and get into stock prices for a while , they will bid up prices .
The existing short sellers then have an incentive to cover their short sales pronto .
These two sets of buyers will tend to drive prices higher .
We get a sharp short - covering bear market rally , induced by the SEC .
This causes great volatility in the market as prices jump sharply and later fall back .
Since prices are rising above their equilibrium values , the odds are they will fall back .
Those who hold the stocks long are given a chance to sell out , so that even without short - selling , a counteracting price pressure arises .
The short - selling ban no doubt results in some net price gain for a while .
This means the SEC has succeeded in preventing the markets from reaching equilibrium for a while .
When that period is slated to come to an end and short - selling is expected to resume , those who hold the stock long have a second chance to sell out and front - run short - sellers .
They are merely selling stock they already own , so they do not violate the short - selling ban .
The SEC has n’t gone that far yet as to close down the markets entirely .
The SEC ban changes the expectations of short - sellers .
They now do not know when another such ban might occur .
They face greater risk .
They have a reduced incentive to investigate to find negative information and get it impounded into prices .
They have a reduced incentive to sell short , even after the ban is lifted .
They have an increased incentive to sell their research to companies that ordinarily hold long positions .
But this avenue is not particularly attractive .
The result is that the SEC has reduced the market ’s efficiency .
Stocks can go along at overpriced levels for longer periods of time , and then , wham , the bad news comes out in one lump sum , at which point the volatility rises sharply as the price collapses .
This means that investors at large cannot be as sure as they once were that prices accurately reflect available information , especially negative information .
They will require higher returns to compensate them for that added risk .
They will also require higher returns to compensate for the added risk of regulatory interruption and interference in the stock market .
Meanwhile , will the SEC ban on short sales actually prevent the prices from attaining their equilibrium values at some point in the future ?
This is highly unlikely .
It may take longer , but the market will learn how badly off these financial institutions are .
For many of them , it knows already and the prices are now trading at artificially high levels .
The SEC is another New Deal monstrosity like Fannie Mae .
In 1982 , Roberta Karmel , who was an SEC commissioner , published Regulation by Prosecution .
Karmel , who was a Democrat , heavily criticized the SEC .
In a paper that I published in 1990 , I summarized her criticisms as follows :
The SEC has a prosecutorial and legalistic orientation that conflicts with regulation designed to encourage commerce and business .
The SEC has been unwilling to articulate clear law enforcement standards .
The incentive structure of the SEC is perverse .
It rewards the making of new rules and new enforcement work that are unwarranted .
The SEC has displayed " historical intransigence in refusing to accept exemptions from registration as a legitimate part of the scheme of the federal securities laws . "
The SEC has opposed needed reforms in order to maintain its own freedom of action to expand securities regulation .
The SEC has over - regulated the investment company industry .
The agency structure shifts the focus of regulation from its center ( the Legislature ) to an agency that by itself is unable to accommodate major regulatory changes .
Government becomes slower and less accountable to the needs of the electorate .
The SEC has a tendency to be on the side of increased disclosure and to serve the constituencies who benefit from it .
The SEC has stifled creativity and innovation in corporate disclosure .
The SEC has displayed inattention and ignorance of the effects of its regulatory actions on small business capital formation .
The SEC has imposed slow and burdensome review procedures for filings to raise capital on small business .
There has been a serious curtailment of the private placement market through attention to legal positions rather than the economic impacts of policies on enterprises .
There has been an unnecessary prevention of sales of letter stock ( unregistered offerings of stocks already possessing a secondary market . )
There has been too high a degree of restriction against new issues at the expense of eliminating the possibility of new ventures .
The SEC has generated slow and uninformed treatment of companies in bankruptcy proceedings .
The SEC shows a tendency to protect all investors against their own greed regardless of the cost .
The SEC has a tendency to act against capital formation .
In sum , the SEC , according to Karmel , was anti-business and especially anti-small business .
It is now 2008 and 26 years have passed .
We can now add many more items to Commissioner Karmel ’s list .
The SEC has greatly expanded its regulation on insider trading , on national market exchange systems , and on disclosure .
It has even butted into the pricing of stocks in pennies rather than eighths .
Now we find it banning short sales so as to support stock prices .
If the U.S. had a claim to standing above your everyday banana republic , it is fast abandoning that claim .
Our government is fast turning into a joke manned by clowns who are n’t even funny .
Does anyone take what they are doing seriously ?
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
I was talking to a friend the other day about the nature of argument and how to argue well and it occured to me that I needed to take a step back and convince him that it was possible to argue well .
Argument just seems like one of those things you do .
You sit and you talk and you generally say the first thing that comes into your head .
That argument would require training and skill is something which does n’t appear immediately obvious at first grasp to people .
We seem to split up the list of personal qualities into skilled and intuitive .
In the skilled category would be things building a house , playing a game of chess , arguing a case in court or solving math problems .
On the intuitive side , we have things like having a good sense of humor , being co-ordinated , having the ability to draw well or coming up with good ideas .
The difference between the two is that we believe that to be good at skilled things is a process of mastery of certain skills which is relatively unmysterious .
On the other hand , being good at intuitive things is something wholly mysterious that seems largely innate .
What ’s interesting about argument is that it seems to have shifted from a skilled task to an intuitive one .
In medieval times , rhetoric was part of the trivium , along with grammar and logic .
People would spend 1/3rd of their university education solely on learning the art of arguing and people understood instinctively back then that you had to work to become a good arguer .
Nowadays , rhetoric is a minor part of a minor department and argument seems like a purely intuitive process .
It seems to me a plausible explanation is that we rely on social signals to cue us in on what is skilled or not .
Because we see people spend years learning to be a professional doctor but not learning to be professional arguers , we tend to believe one requires skill and the other does not .
So why am I going on about this ?
Because such a heuristic is imperfect at best and being aware of how it is flawed can help you gain an incredibly easy win over other people .
By correctly identifying something as requiring skill , you can start to gain immediate improvements and , what ’s more , others will believe that this improvement is innate and both be impressed with how good you are and not try and compete with you .
How smart do you need to be to win an election , really ?
Should n't there be a test ?
The real test of a candidate 's electability is their skill to effectively communicate with the electorate .
Other than that , their IQ , their life experiences , their ' knowledge ' of anything , for that matter , can be hired , that 's why presidents have cabinets and advisors ; but , for a candidate 's electability quotient ( EQ ) , what they ' know ' and how ' smart ' they are , is nebulous at best and a non-issue for most voters .
Sadly , " Reagan proved this " ... to ' re - contextulize ' Cheney .
Republicans , as we know them today , got this quite a few decades ago .
Democrats , as a group , not so much .
Remember the commercial real estate anecdote ?
Location , location , location .
Well , it 's based on experience .
And to paraphrase in the context of politics : Communication , communication , communication .
This is where the Bush / Cheney gang failed : they confused lying with communication .
Endorsement now of the Bush / Cheney regime by the Republican core , their own party ?
Fail .
Massive fail .
This also is where McCain is going wrong .
In this campaign he 's mistaking ' confusion ' for ' communication ' .
The old adage here is ' If you can't convince them , confuse them ' .
Bad bet .
It used to be fun for pols to play this game .
No more .
Now it 's costing our country big - time bucks .
The gamble , no longer pork barrel chicken feed , will trash quite a few political careers .
I hear the chickens marching down Main Street .
Marching .
Marching .
Marching .

The Wachovia Corporation announced a $ 23.9 billion third - quarter loss on Wednesday as it prepared to be taken over by Wells Fargo .
The bank took an $ 18.7 billion charge to write down the value of good will and wrote off $ 6.6 billion in credit losses tied largely to its disastrous purchase of Golden West Financial in 2006 .
And the red ink is unlikely to end soon .
Wachovia projected an additional $ 26.1 billion in mortgage - related losses in 2009 .
And it wrote down only a tiny portion of its $ 219 billion commercial real estate and corporate loan portfolio .
Analysts expect that area to significantly deteriorate as the economy plunges into a recession .
Wachovia ’s record - setting loss translated into $ 11.18 a share , compared with net income of $ 1.6 billion , or 85 cents a share , in the period a year earlier .
That is what certain election officials are saying according to this article .
It says that “ Already states such as New Jersey are refusing to allow election experts to monitor voting because they claim it is “ too important an election . ”
Ponder that sentence my friends .
Turn it around and inspect it .
The article also says that the new Associated Press poll from the greater Zionist media lockdown now shows the election to be a dead heat .
Their reasons for this are as shabby as their conduct .
No , the Zionistas probably do not want Obama to win because he ’s not as likely to be a dumbshit lap dog for their murderous intentions which have been amply demonstrated on 9/11 , the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq and the shrill and nasty cries to bomb Iran ; a country that has n’t attacked another country in eight hundred years .
He ’s probably not going to be as easy to manipulate as McCheeks and Palindrone .
He ’s certainly not the scabrous psychopath that Yellow - Streak George the Drunken Fool is .
Is he bought and paid for ?
Probably not entirely ...
I do n’t think he ’s gotten the bad news yet .
That will most likely come after the election if he wins which is no sure thing at the moment , given what the neo-cons are up to .
As I am looking at this thing shape up , here is how it looks to me .
Some mere days before the election there ’s going to be an event designed to close the gap between Obama and McCain .
They need to close it .
It ’s too wide for what they pulled the last several times .
Whatever happens , Bush will then declare martial law and the election and the election results will remain in doubt and not be cleared up for some time .
This seems to be the likely scenario .
I ’m not rooting for anything like this ; it ’s just how it looks to me .
Now , I ’m not Nostradamus .
He had a beard as I remember and I do n’t .
So what I ’m saying is that something like this looks like a high percentage given .
So wherever you are , if something does n’t look or feel right , be on your way .
The incredible hubris of the swine at the helm and the swine in the financial theater is testimony to the fact that they think they can do anything they want .
They ’re compromised your basic rights in a systematic gang rape and now they ’re looting the country .
They caused this and now you ’re going to pay them for the unreal money they lost with your real money .
Let me get back to that phrase ... “ are refusing to allow election experts to monitor voting because they claim it is “ too important an election . ”
I do n’t think I ’ve ever heard the like .
I ca n’t imagine what others must make of it .
It seems to me that they are saying that if some sort of oversight is instituted they wo n’t be able to get the results they are after .
I think it goes without saying that these people , whoever they are , should be tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail .
Their homes and vehicles should be taken from them and they should be marked in some way so that people can see them coming once they get the tar and feathers gone and attempt to go right back to what they were doing before .
These people are something different than you and I .
I ’m not sure what to make of them .
They are n’t human .
What are they ?
They seem to be some kind of mythic creature , half pig , half alligator and half shit Gollum .
Yeah , I know , I do creative math .
It ’s clear they ’re going to try to steal this election .
Right now I ca n’t see how they might accomplish that except through some permutation of what I presented earlier .
Even then , I do n’t think the American public is going to go for it , not after the 850 billion dollar theft .
It certainly looks like the Republicans are going to lose a lot of seats in both houses and if the Democrats get 60 in the Senate , which they might , if the votes get counted ... well , that would not be something the neo-cons would like at all .
I ’m sincerely hoping that poisonous , viper Nancy Pelosi gets tossed out .
I know she ’s supposed to be a Democrat but you can take my word for it , she ’s a neo-con .
You have my sympathies , all of you who are resident there among the purple mountain ’s travesties above the looted plains .
I ’ve told you this before and I ’m going to tell you again .
You do n’t have the guns and the organization to take back your country by force but there is a way to do it .
Do n’t go to work and do n’t buy anything except food .
Gather with your neighbors in communities across the land and congregate in public places as a statement that you ’ve had it and that ’s it .
Justice gets done , your rights get returned , the criminal suits get thrown in jail or everything stops and stays stopped .
This you can do and this will work .
Tell me people , do you really have a choice ?
Day by day your situation becomes graver and day by day you contribute to the machinery that is causing it .
When Barclay ’s and AIG can spend between half a million and three quarters of a million to get their porcine frames stuffed and stroked after your leaders bailed them out it should tell you what contempt they hold you in .
No one should be returned to office who voted for this and since hardly any Republicans under any circumstances should be returned to office at all you may have to get creative .
If millions of you decide to write in Donald Duck or Snoopy that ’s got to make some kind of a point .
Now , I know and you know that Bush ’s numbers are probably closer to ten percent than what they give him .
Congress is near zero .
However , as long as you are content with bread and circuses and do n’t mind seeing your fellows go down one by one ; and do n’t see that sooner or later you are going to be next , well then , I ’m not sure what help there is for you .
All over the country and especially in battleground and bell - weather states , voting machines are doing very strange things .
How can this be happening after all this time if it is n’t the result of people causing it to happen ?
There is n’t any other answer for this .
You do n’t count .
It ’s that simple .
It does n’t matter what you think or what happens to you .
That ’s how it is .
I ’ll say it again ... do n’t go to work .
Do n’t buy anything but food and congregate in public places to show your displeasure .
One brigade of soldiers and all the police in the country can’t do anything about this .
You will effectively shut it down .
This kind of a revolution will stop them in their tracks .
There are not enough FEMA camps .
There are not enough enforcers and , for the moment , there ’s no law that says you have to go to work or buy things or that you ca n’t congregate in public places .
That ’s why they call them ‘ public places ’ .
Even the dumbest of you , who seem to increase in number every year , should know by now what ’s going on .
It really comes down to how much you can be squeezed before you do something .
You ’re in a strange kind of disconnect .
Your world is crashing down around you and you ’re hoping you get to go to Las Vegas or Disneyland next month .
You just want to grab a beer and sit on the couch and watch the World Series or ... something darker perhaps ?
“ How about those Rays , hey ? ”
One more time with feeling ...
“ “ Already states such as New Jersey are refusing to allow election experts to monitor voting because they claim it is “ too important an election . ”
Well , there you are .
There you are .
I ’m going to Rome for a few days but someone will post your comments and maybe I ’ll find an internet café while I ’m gadding about .
The clock is ticking , people .
The clock is ticking .

I ’m on the radio this Sunday , so tune in if you ’re of a mind .
Uranus can be found high in the southern sky after midnight , floating just off the corner of Aquarius .
Try using the ö and ë stars as pointers .
Here is a trivia question :
How many planets arevisible without a telescope ?
Most will answer " five " ( Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter and Saturn ) .
Some might answer " six " and include the Earth in the mix .
Six , in fact , is the correct number , but if you exclude ourown world , there is indeed one other planet that can be spied without opticalaid : the planetUranus .
This week will be a fine time to try and seek it out , especially since it is now favorably placed for viewing in our evening sky and the waxing moon is not overly bright .
Of course , you 'll have to know exactly where to lookfor it .
Barely discernable by a keen naked eye on very dark , clear nights , Uranus — currently shining at magnitude + 5.7 — is now visible during the evening hoursamong the stars of Aquarius , the Water Carrier .
On this scale , larger numbersare dimmer , with magnitude 6.0 being about the dimmest object visible underideal , dark - sky conditions .
Tilted giant
It is best to study the accompanying chart first , and thenscan that region with binoculars .
Using a magnification of 150 power with atelescope of at least three - inch aperture , you should be able to resolve itinto a tiny , pale - green featureless disk .
Uranus , which currently lies 1.868 billion miles ( 3.005 billion kilometers ) from the sun , has a diameter of about 31,700 miles ( 51,120 kilometers ) and according to flyby magnetic data from Voyager 2 in 1986 , has arotation period of 17.4 hours .
At last count , Uranus has 27 moons , alllying in orbits around the planet 's equator in which there is also a complex ofnine narrow , nearly opaque rings , which were discovered in 1978 .
Uranus likely has a rocky core , surrounded by a liquidmantle of water , methane , and ammonia , encased in an atmosphere of hydrogen andhelium .
A bizarre feature is how far over Uranus is tipped .
Its north pole lies98 degrees from being directly perpendicular to its orbit plane .
Thus , itsseasons are extreme :
When the sun rises at its north pole , it stays up for 42 Earth - years ; then it sets and the north pole is in darkness for 42 Earth - years .
Fortuitous find
The British astronomer Sir William Herschel discoveredUranus on March 13 , 1781 , noting that it was moving slowly through theconstellation Gemini .
Initially , however , Herschel thought he had discovered anew comet .
Soon the name of Herschel became known over all of Europe together with the news of his discovery .
King George III , who loved the sciences , had the astronomer presented to him , and bestowed upon him a life pension and aresidence at Slough , in the neighborhood of Windsor Castle .
Eventually it was determined that Herschel 's " comet " was , in fact , a new planet .
For a while , it actually boreHerschel 's name .
Herschel himself proposed the name Georgium Sidus — " The Star of George , " after his benefactor .
However , the custom of using mythological names ultimately prevailed and the new planet was finallychristened Uranus .
Prior to its discovery , the outermost planet was consideredto be Saturn , named for the ancient god of time and destiny , but Uranus was thefather of Saturn and considered the most ancient deity of all .
It probably was for all for the best .
After all , if Herschel ' srequest was granted , just think of how we might have listed the planets inorder from the sun : Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn and . . . George ?

In a perfect confluence of all the current toxic elements of the GOP :
Sacramento County Republican leaders Tuesday took down offensive material on their official party Web site that sought to link Sen. Barack Obama to Osama bin Laden and encouraged people to " Waterboard Barack Obama "  material that offended even state GOP leaders .
Not a lone protestor or crowd member .
Not a fringe nut on Free Republic .
On the official Republican website in the state capitol of the most populous state in the Union .
This is why the GOP has to be defeated this time .
For the sake of a decent conservatism .
There 's hypocrisy here too :
When reached for comment Tuesday , Craig MacGlashan  head of the Sacramento County Republican Party  owned up to these and other characterizations of Obama .
How curious .
A few weeks ago , MacGlashan spoke out publicly against anti-Obama vandalism around town .
But now , he 's OK with the words " Waterboard Barack Obama " that were displayed prominently on sacramentorepublicans.org ?
Maybe if someone had painted " Waterboard Barack Obama " on the side of a building , MacGlashan would be outraged .
On the Internet ?
Not so much .

Demonstrators outside the Islamabad Stock Exchange in July
The UK's Daily Telegraph reports that Pakistan may be the first nation to go bankrupt as a result of the continuing global financial meltdown .
Officially , the central bank holds $ 8.14 billion ( £ 4.65 billion ) of foreign currency , but if forward liabilities are included , the real reserves may be only $ 3 billion - enough to buy about 30 days of imports like oil and food .
Nine months ago , Pakistan had $ 16 bn in the coffers .
The government is engulfed by crises left behind by Pervez Musharraf , the military ruler who resigned the presidency in August .
High oil prices have combined with endemic corruption and mismanagement to inflict huge damage on the economy .
Given the country 's standing as a frontline state in the US - led " war on terrorism " , the economic crisis has profound consequences .
Pakistan already faces worsening security as the army clashes with militants in the lawless Tribal Areas on the north - west frontier with Afghanistan .
...
Mr Zardari told the Wall Street Journal that Pakistan needed a bail out worth $ 100 billion from the international community .
" If I can't pay my own oil bill , how am I going to increase my police ?
" he asked .
" The oil companies are asking me to pay $ 135 [ per barrel ] of oil and at the same time they want me to keep the world peaceful and Pakistan peaceful . "
The ratings agency Standard and Poor 's has given Pakistan 's sovereign debt a grade of CCC + , which stands only a few notches above the default level .
The economic crisis might yet end Pakistan 's newly elected government , which is facing a crisis of confidence already as it battles 25 % inflation , a drowning currency and a President with a reputation as " Mr 10 % " for past corruption .
It 's also unclear that even a $ 100 billion bailout would be enough to stave off Pakistan 's money woes , since the security situation is itself feeding the economic crisis there - investors do n't want to know about a nation so obviously on the verge of failure .
Nor is it certain that even the US and Western allies will care to throw such a large sum of money into Pakistan .
Sure , they could probably secure protestations of working harder to enact economic reforms after the mismanagement of the Musharraf years and to more strongly pursue the War on Terror , but what would those promises be worth ?
The question " whose side is Pakistan on ? " is being asked in NATO circles nowadays , and more are coming to the conclusion that the Pakistani feudal elite are content to play the West for all it is worth while caring precious little for their own people 's fate .
Then again , Pakistan has nukes and the prospect of a truly failed state there is a terrible one to contemplate .
As usual with that nation , the situation is a Gordian Knot created by decades ( dating back at least to Reagan and the Russian invasion of Afghanistan ) of local and Western leaders ignoring very real problems .
It 's a knot with no easy , or short - term , solution .
It will take decades of strategic containment , careful stick and carrots , law enforcement outwith Pakistan to catch the terrorists it gives safe haven to and some simple truth - telling to roll all that back .
There are no fixes with a timeline of less than decades .
And , as John Robb at Global Guerrillas writes , do n't expect Pakistan to be the last nation to find itself on the financial brink .
The global financial system is much LARGER , FASTER , and COMPLEX than the nation - states that are trying to bail them out .
As a result , nation - state intervention wo n't return things to the status quo .
What it will do , however , is tightly couple western nation - states to the now inevitable failure in the financial system ( this is akin to lashing a dingy to the Titanic to prevent it from sinking ) .
The rampant proliferation of bankrupt and hollow states is now likely inevitable .
If you 've a good idea on where to go from here , you 're doing one better than national leaders across the globe .

Americans ' fear of a terrorism could create a mass outbreak of a psychosomatic illness – even in the absence of any real attack – – creating a fake epidemic that could overwhelm hospitals attempting to treat real victims .
Adding to the confusion , the symptoms of a mass pyschogenic illness look much like symptoms of an anthrax attack , avian flu outbreak or chemical attack .
At least that 's what the feds warned hospitals in a nonpublic 2006 communique recently published by the government sunshine site Wikileaks .
Call it a contagious psychosomatic illness – though the feds preferred to label the phenomenon " psychogenic illness , " defining that as :
A phenomenon in which social trauma or anxiety combines with a suspicious event to produce psychosomatic symptoms , such as nausea , difficulty breathing , and paralysis .
If many individuals come to believe that the psychosomatic outbreak is connected to the cause of the trauma or anxiety , these symptoms can spread rapidly throughout a population .
In fact , the feds suggest ( . pdf ) that there 's already been a totally terrorism - fear - created illness in California where no one was actually sick from an attack .
In that case , a man walked into a California bank in October 2003 , sprayed an aerosol can into the air and then left .
Employees and customers became ill , though investigators found there were no biological or chemical agents in the air .
( Note proof of this incident is attributed to a November 2003 FBI report that is also considered too sensitive for the public 's eyes . )
A similar fear - based illness began in Chechnya – when 13 kids fell ill with headaches , fevers and numbness , according to the report .
Many believed that the kids had been poisoned by a Russian chemical attack and the symptoms quickly spread .
Some 87 people , mostly kids , were hospitalized , though there was no evidence of any chemical attack .
Officials attributed the illness to anxiety over Russian military activities in the area .
And perhaps most seriously , after the deadly sarin gas attacks in Tokyo in 1995 , some 5,000 people went the hospital – claiming to have symptoms , despite the attack 's rather small radius .
Twelve people were killed by the gas and 54 others sustained serious injuries .
The analysis recommended that the government and health system educate people about chemical and biological attacks so they can recognize real symptoms , as well as quickly isolating both real and psychosomatic victims in the case of an attack or perceived attack .
The July 5 , 2006 , analysis entitled Fear of Terrorist Attack Could Trigger Mass Psychogenic Illness ( .pdf ) from the the Homeland Infrastructure Threat and Risk Analysis Center is not classified .
Instead it is labeled For Official Use Only ( FOUO ) – a designation that allows the data to be shared with people without clearances , but away from the public eye .
Such material is usually not available through government sunshine requests .

HURUMA , Kenya ( CNN ) --
We found Barack Obama 's half - brother living in a Nairobi slum .
George Obama says he is sure his half - brother will win the U.S. presidency in November .
George Obama , whose birth certificate shows that he is Barack Obama 's half - brother , lives in a small house in Huruma that he shares with his mother 's extended family , far away from the presidential campaign circus .
In his memoir , " Dreams for my Father , " the Democratic presidential candidate describes meeting George as a " painful affair . "
Barack Obama 's trip to Kenya meant meeting family he had never known .
In the book , which is popular in Nairobi and can be found in almost any supermarket , Obama looks back at his personal story and his struggles to reconcile with a Kenyan father who left him and his mother when he was just a child .
Barack Obama Sr. died in a car accident when George was just 6 months old .
And like his half - brother , George hardly knew his father .
George was his father 's last child and had not been aware of his famous half - brother .
" I think I wanted to learn about my father the same way he did , " George Obama told me about why he read the book .
" He came here searching for his roots , and I was also trying to find my roots . "
Watch George Obama talk about meeting his half - brother for the first time
Unlike his grandmother in Kogela , in Western Kenya , George Obama had received little attention from the media .
But reports surfaced in the past few days , springing from an Italian Vanity Fair article saying George Obama is living in a shack and " earning less than a dollar a day . "
The reports left him angry .
" I was brought up well .
I live well even now , " he said .
" The magazines , they have exaggerated everything .
" I think I kind of like it here .
There are some challenges , but maybe it is just like where you come from , there are the same challenges , " Obama said .
Obama , who is in his mid-20s , is learning to become a mechanic and is active in youth groups in Huruma .
He said he tries to help the community as much as he can .
At least one of his neighbors feels that perhaps the candidate should help the brother .
" I would like Obama to visit his brother to see how he is living , to improve his way of life , " said Emelda Negei , who runs a small dispensary near Obama 's house .
But George Obama will have none of it .
He draws inspiration from his famous half - brother .
He acknowledges that he is biased but said he knows that his half - brother will be the next president .
" Because he wants to be [ president ] , " he said .
" I think in life , what you want is what you are supposed to get . "

In exclusive , never - before - seen footage , former CIA operative E. Howard Hunt discusses his knowledge of and participation in the plot to kill Kennedy in a video testimony he gave shortly before his death .
Alex Jones ’ upcoming film will fully analyze the CIA - shadow government coup that occurred inside the United States 45 years ago .
Rolling Stone and a few other publications have covered Hunt ’s audio confession ( released in April 2007 ) , but no one has yet seen the information the infamous White House ‘ plumber ’ left behind to shed light on the figures involved in the plot .
Here , Howard Hunt discusses LBJ , who saw Kennedy as an ‘ obstacle ’ to the presidency .
According to Hunt , LBJ consorted with top CIA officials Cord Meyer and William K. Harvey to carry out the plot .

For an ad campaign that started a revolution in marketing , the Pepsi Challenge TV spots of the 1970s and ' 80s were almost absurdly simple .
Little more than a series of blind taste tests , these ads showed people being asked to choose between Pepsi and Coke without knowing which one they were consuming .
Not surprisingly , given the sponsor , Pepsi was usually the winner .
But 30 years after the commercials debuted , neuroscientist Read Montague was still thinking about them .
Something did n't make sense .
If people preferred the taste of Pepsi , the drink should have dominated the market .
It did n't .
So in the summer of 2003 , Montague gave himself a ' Pepsi Challenge ' of a different sort : to figure out why people would buy a product they did n't particularly like .
What he found was the first data from an entirely new field : neuromarketing , the study of the brain 's responses to ads , brands , and the rest of the messages littering the cultural landscape .
Montague had his subjects take the Pepsi Challenge while he watched their neural activity with a functional MRI machine , which tracks blood flow to different regions of the brain .
Without knowing what they were drinking , about half of them said they preferred Pepsi .
But once Montague told them which samples were Coke , three - fourths said that drink tasted better , and their brain activity changed too .
Coke " lit up " the medial prefrontal cortex -- a part of the brain that controls higher thinking .
Montague 's hunch was that the brain was recalling images and ideas from commercials , and the brand was overriding the actual quality of the product .
For years , in the face of failed brands and laughably bad ad campaigns , marketers had argued that they could influence consumers ' choices .
Now , there appeared to be solid neurological proof .
Montague published his findings in the October 2004 issue of Neuron , and a cottage industry was born .
Neuromarketing , in one form or another , is now one of the hottest new tools of its trade .
At the most basic levels , companies are starting to sift through the piles of psychological literature that have been steadily growing since the 1990s ' boom in brain - imaging technology .
Surprisingly few businesses have kept tabs on the studies - until now .
" Most marketers do n't take a single class in psychology .
A lot of the current communications projects we see are based on research from the ' 70s , " says Justine Meaux , a scientist at Atlanta 's BrightHouse Neurostrategies Group , one of the first and largest neurosciences consulting firms .
" Especially in these early years , it 's about teaching people the basics .
What we end up doing is educating people about some false assumptions about how the brain works . "
Getting an update on research is one thing ; for decades , marketers have relied on behavioral studies for guidance .
But some companies are taking the practice several steps further , commissioning their own fMRI studies à la Montague 's test .
In a study of men 's reactions to cars , Daimler - Chrysler has found that sportier models activate the brain 's reward centers -- the same areas that light up in response to alcohol and drugs -- as well as activating the area in the brain that recognizes faces , which may explain people 's tendency to anthropomorphize their cars .
Steven Quartz , a scientist at Stanford University , is currently conducting similar research on movie trailers .
And in the age of poll - taking and smear campaigns , political advertising is also getting in on the game .
Researchers at the University of California , Los Angeles have found that Republicans and Democrats react differently to campaign ads showing images of the Sept. 11th terrorist attacks .
Those ads cause the part of the brain associated with fear to light up more vividly in Democrats than in Republicans .
That last piece of research is particularly worrisome to anti-marketing activists , some of whom are already mobilizing against the nascent field of neuromarketing .
Gary Ruskin of Commercial Alert , a non-profit that argues for strict regulations on advertising , says that " a year ago almost nobody had heard of neuromarketing except for Forbes readers . "
Now , he says , it 's everywhere , and over the past year he has waged a campaign against the practice , lobbying Congress and the American Psychological Association ( APA ) and threatening lawsuits against BrightHouse and other practitioners .
Even though he admits the research is still " in the very preliminary stages , " he says it could eventually lead to complete corporate manipulation of consumers -- or citizens , with governments using brain scans to create more effective propaganda .
Ruskin might be consoled by the fact that many neuromarketers still do n't know how to apply their findings .
Increased activity in the brain does n't necessarily mean increased preference for a product .
And , says Meaux , no amount of neuromarketing research can transform otherwise rational people into consumption - driven zombies .
" Of course we 're all influenced by the messages around us , " she says .
" That does n't take away free choice . "
As for Ruskin , she says tersely , " there is no grounds for what he is accusing . "
So far , the regulatory boards agree with her : the government has decided not to investigate BrightHouse and the APA 's most recent ethics statement said nothing about neuromarketing .
Says Ruskin : " It was a total defeat for us . "
With Commercial Alert 's campaign thwarted for now , BrightHouse is moving forward .
In January , the company plans to start publishing a neuroscience newsletter aimed at businesses .
And although it " does n't conduct fMRI studies except in the rarest of cases , " it is getting ready to publish the results of a particularly tantalizing set of tests .
While neuroscientist Montague 's ' Pepsi Challenge ' suggests that branding appears to make a difference in consumer preference , BrightHouse 's research promises to show exactly how much emotional impact that branding can have .
Marketers have long known that some brands have a seemingly magic appeal ; they can elicit strong devotion , with buyers saying they identify with the brand as an extension of their personalities .
The BrightHouse research is expected to show exactly which products those are .
" This is really just the first step , " says Meaux , who points out that no one has discovered a " buy button " in the brain .
But with more and more companies peering into the minds of their consumers , could that be far off ?
UPDATE PART TWO
This issue has been distilled much further and appears to be with how Chrome handles triggering of the DOMContentLoaded event on navigation forward and backward when there are inline scripts .
I ’ve updated the bug report ( Issue 151 ) with a very simple test case that demonstrates this .
Turns out it was n’t related to forms after all .
( My foot sure does taste pretty good . )
UPDATE !
Great news !
The wonderful people up in Mountain View have reopened Issue 151 making this plea unnecessary .
And one more thing , since I do n’t feel I was clear enough about this , I want to make sure everyone knows that when the bug was closed it was a misunderstanding , not Google / Chrome willfully trying to break the web .
Thanks Google , thanks everybody else who looked at this in getting it the attention it needs .
An Intro to the World of History Management
The first thing I did when Google Chrome came out was to test its capabilities with regards to history management .
As a new and theoretically highly capable browser I figured it would behave nicely and there would be no problems .
Besides , it uses an up - to - date version of WebKit , which works just fine .
Well , as you can probably guess by the fact that I ’m writing this , it did n’t exactly work .
There are two basic problems a history manager has to solve .
The first is to ensure the creation of a history state upon every page change and store relevant information to make it accessible .
This is usually handled by changing the hash to create a history point and then , keying off of that hash , updating the page accordingly .
The second problem is to maintain the programmatic history states and their associated data across page requests .
The low - level detail of what occurs on a page transition goes something like this : when I navigate from nathanhammond.com to google .com my window .
document object changes .
As a result of the document object change all JavaScript variables are lost and the new document is redrawn .
That is completely expected ( and specified ) behavior .
A load of a document object is always ( and easily ) replayable simply by re-requesting that document object .
The scenario is a bit different in a history managed web application .
In that approach there is no change to the document object , only a change to the document content that we want to be replayable .
To make it replayable the history manager needs to store some information about how to replay it and then , when that history state is invoked ( by navigating through the browser history ) , respond accordingly .
The problem with this is that we need maintain the information about how to replay it across document object changes since it does not involve a document object request .
Without the benefits of HTML5 client - side storage or Google Gears , the original solution to this problem was to store the history state in a textarea and rely upon an unspecified but entirely consistent browser behavior : the refilling of form fields even after document unload .
This functionality is easily demonstrable by following this process :
Go to a page with a form on it and start filling it out .
Navigate backward in your history .
Navigate forward in your history to the page with the form you were filling out .
You will find it filled with what you had entered .
Noticing a Problem
With all of that in mind , I began testing Chrome ’s support of both Really Simple History and my own JSSM as they are the ones I ’m most familiar with .
As most browser history managers rely upon the same general functionality , this is rather good sample set .
I began by simply browsing around within my test site and making sure that all of the history worked correctly .
Things were all looking fine and everything worked wonderfully .
Then came the test where I navigated away from the site and returned to it only to find that values were n’t refilled in the form .
This completely breaks Really Simple History and messes up the understanding of page request order in JSSM .
I presume that because of Chrome ’s aggressive garbage collection it does not implement this feature , but I ’m unsure .
Filing a Bug
So , noting the issue , I filed Issue # 151 on Chrome ’s Google Code project .
I called it a bug and after a few days it was assigned .
Great , everything will now be correctly handled in Chrome and we can rest easily .
Mountain View , We Have a Problem
Well , after a few days more , this issue was closed as “ wontfix , ” terming it a feature request for autofill .
Google Code did n’t notify me that it was updated and so I did n’t notice until during a presentation about Chrome at The AJAX Experience 2008 .
I was sitting right beside Brian Dillard at that point and we both took the opportunity to comment again on the issue to see if we could get it reopened .
Since then there has been no further discussion .
I ’m hoping to increase exposure for this issue to hopefully get it addressed in Chrome .
If you would , please discuss this topic or link to this discussion on your own blogs to increase exposure .
Also , if you ’re so inclined you could comment on the issue directly .
The judge said Howson had shown no remorse A father who murdered his baby daughter by snapping her spine will spend at least 22 years in prison .
James Howson , 25 , was given a life sentence at Leeds Crown Court for the murder of 16 - month - old Amy at their home in Doncaster , South Yorkshire .
He was convicted of murder on Tuesday after a jury heard he held Amy over his knee and broke her back in two .
Amy 's mother Tina Hunt , 26 , was given a 12 - month suspended sentence after admitting child cruelty .
Sentencing Howson , the judge , Mrs Justice Cox , said : " This was , in my view , a chilling and brutal attack .
" The bone was completely dislocated , resulting in spinal shock , rapid unconsciousness - mercifully - and to death . "
' Truly horrific ' During the trial Howson blamed Ms Hunt , saying she may have been responsible for Amy 's death .
But the judge said : " The jury was satisfied , on the clearest of evidence , that it was you who deliberately inflicted truly horrific injuries upon your defenceless little daughter , Amy , from which she died within a few hours . "
The judge also detailed other occasions in the weeks leading up to the murder in December last year when Howson " cruelly and deliberately assaulted Amy " , leaving her with multiple fractures to her arms and legs .
The girl 's mother has admitted allowing the death
The court heard how Howson had a troubled history and had been violent towards women when he was young , yet he had no previous convictions .
Howson showed no emotion as he was led from the dock .
The judge said to him : " I have not seen the slightest evidence of remorse from you for what you did . "
Hunt 's 12 - month sentence was suspended for two years .
She admitted the child cruelty charge on the basis that she did nothing to alert the authorities to her daughter 's plight .
But the judge said : " Your level of culpability falls at the lowest end of the scale " , after hearing how Howson completely dominated her and was often violent .
She said Hunt was also in the lowest 1 % band of intelligence .
Outside court Amy 's grandfather , Colin Hunt , said : " Life should mean life but what can you say ?
That 's justice for you .
" Twenty - two years is all right but it wo n't bring Amy back , will it ?
" I have 16 grandchildren .
They are all beautiful and he 's taken one away .
I idolise them .
" I 'm very angry .
If I could have done something I would have .
She was my granddaughter . "

The Explorer
The adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland /
3
by Michele Simionato
September 29 , 2008
In the previous two episodes I have discussed a few important subjects such as availability of libraries , reliability of implementations , support in case of bugs , etc .
However , I have not said anything about the language per se .
In this episode I will talk more about the language , by starting from the syntax , with a discussion of the infamous parentheses .
Lisp parens have been the source of infinite debates from the very beginning and always will be .
As you probably know , LISP means Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses , and Scheme has even more parentheses than other Lisps !
I did the mistake of writing Scheme code with an editor different from Emacs ( the default scheme mode is terrible in my opinion ) .
It has been like shooting in my foot .
After a few weeks of suffering I came back to Emacs , I asked on comp.lang .scheme and comp.emacs and I was pointed out to excellent scheme mode , called quack.el and written by Neil Van Dike .
Moreover , I have discovered how to augment the contrast of the parens ( parens - edit mode ) and I feel completely comfortable .
But let me repeat that it is suicidal to try to edit Scheme / Lisp code without a good support from the editor .
In my opinion this is the first reason why legions of beginners escape from Scheme / Lisp : who wants to be forced to learn Emacs only to write a few lines of code ?
Of course , here I am exaggerating a bit , since there programmers that are able to write Lisp code even with vi and other editors , and there are even Scheme IDEs around ( i.e. DrScheme , or a Scheme plugin for Eclipse ) : nevertheless I would still recommend Emacs to write Scheme / Lisp code , since Emacs itself is written in ( Emacs ) Lisp and that should tell something about its abilities to manage Lisp code .
If you are coding in Common Lisp you should not miss SLIME , the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs , which is a really really powerful IDE for Common Lisp .
However , even if I recommend Emacs and even if I think that the time spent to master it is time well spent , I do not think that forcing people to use a highly specialized tool to use a general purpose programming language is a good think .
In theory , everybody should have the freedom to choose her editor , and it should be possible to program even in Notepad ( even if it is a thing I do not wish to anybody ! ) .
This in theory : in practice , every professional programmer use some dedicated tool to write code , so if you do n't want to use Emacs please make sure your editor / IDE has a good Scheme mode , otherwise consider changing your developing environment .
It is interesting to notice what Paul Graham - a big name in the Lisp community and the main author of Arc , a new language of the Lisp family recently released and implemented in PLT Scheme - says about the parentheses :
We also plan to let programmers omit parentheses where no ambiguity would result , and show structure by indentation instead of parentheses .
I find that I spontaneously do both these things when writing Lisp by hand on whiteboards or the backs of envelopes .
Arc for the moment seems to require the parens , but it has a bit less parentheses than Scheme , as you can infer from the tutorial .
It is clear that the parens are NOT necessary and one could imagine various tricks to reduce their number ( I personally tried various approaches when I began programming in Scheme ) .
There is also an SRFI ( SRFI - 49 : Indentation - sensitive syntax ) that proposes to use indentation instead of parentheses taking inspiration from Python (!)
The proposal should be considered as curiosity ; discussing about indentation could have had some sense thirty years ago , at the time Scheme was designed .
Nowadays , when 100 % of Scheme code is written with parentheses , there is no point in not using them .
Beginners would be penalized if they started using a style nobody uses .
In my ( semi- serious ) opinion , parens are a real initiation test : if a programmer cannot stand them than he is not worth of using Scheme / Lisp and he should address himself on inferior languages ( i.e. all languages , according to what the majority of Schemers / Lispers think ) .
In my experience the snobish attitude is more common in the Common Lisp community whereas in the Scheme community there is more respect for the newbie .
Anyway , the initiation test works and the average Scheme / Lisp programmer is usually smarter than the average programmer in other languages , since only the most persistent survive .
As a Pythonista I do not believe in those tricks : I think every language should be made accessible to the largest possible public .
That means many second rate programmers will be able to learn it , but this is an opportunity , not an issue : the existence of poor programmers increases the number of available positions , since you need people to fix their mistakes !
Otherwise how would you justify the number of job offers for Java and C ++?
( I said I was only semi-serious , do n't take this personally , eh ? ;)
Anyway , when after long suffering one has learned to manage with parens , there is no way back : once you have mastered a good editor the parens give you strong advantages when writing code .
One of the main ones is automatic indentation with a single keypress .
No more snippets of code send via e-mail and made unredable by the newlines added by the mail program ; no more time wasted on reindenting code when refactoring .
Of course , nothing is perfect , and you may forget a paren here and there , but overall I will definitively admit that in the long run the parentheses pay off .
On the other hand , in the short run , they make life much harder for the newbies ; I still think that an optional syntax with less parentheses to be used by beginners or when using a poor editor would make sense , in a new Scheme - like langauge .
But it is too late for Scheme itself : for the best or for the worst Scheme is a language full of parentheses and it is better to take full advantage of them .
Nota Bene : new languages based on s-expressions are born every day ( the newcomers are Arc , which I have already cited , and Clojure , which runs on the Java platform and is very interesting ) .
For those new languages it may have sense to investigate the available options .
The best reference discussing alternative to parentheses that I know of is a paper by David Wheeler .
It is an interesting reading , you may want to have a look at it , if you are interested in the topic .
RCA Promotional Photographs
On this page are a group of photographs produced for or by RCA promoting specific products or the company in general .
Some probably appeared in RCA company publications such as the " RCA Engineer " .
All of these photos would appear to date from the 1950's , and were scanned from original prints acquired from the estate of the photographer who took them .
Unfortunately , I do n't know his name .
A 1924 Radiola 24 radio is compared with and experimental transistor radio built into a pen .
This picture must be from the early 1950's .
The device is an RCA electron microscope , and the location is almost certainly the RCA Laboratories , just outside of Princeton , NJ .
Unknown device , unknown person , but this was probably also taken at RCA Laboratories .
This picture shows an RCA color TV camera installation at at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington , D.C. in the 1955 - 56 period .
This system was used to televise operations for instructional purposes .
The round object in the center is a high - intensity lighting fixture with an opening in the center .
The mirror above the lamp allowed the TV camera to focus on the operation as it proceeded .
This picture was probably taken just after the installation was completed .
It might be safely assumed that the patients were not expected to lie on the floor .

Today , the LA Times takes a look at the issue , which we ’ve mentioned here a few times , of the seeming conflict between the belief among some conservative evangelicals that women cannot be leaders of the church and that their proper role is to be submissive to their husbands all while enthusiastically supporting Sarah Palin ’s candidacy for vice president .
The consensus seems to be that biblical restrictions on women ’s roles only apply at church and at home , not out in the secular world and , provided that Palin ’s husband approves , she is free to have a career .
But inevitably , there are those for whom even this seemingly restrictive view is too liberal :
“ The Palin selection is the single most dangerous event in the conscience of the Christian community in the last 10 years at least , ” said Doug Phillips , president of Vision Forum , a Texas - based ministry .
“ The unabashed , unquestioning support of Sarah Palin and all she represents marks a fundamental departure from our historic position of family priorities — of moms being at home with young children , of moms being helpers to their husbands , the priority of being keepers of the home . ”
Voddie Baucham , a Texas pastor who has criticized the Palin selection as anti-family in a series of blogs , said that the overwhelming evangelical support demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice biblical principles for politics .
“ Evangelicalism has lost its biblical perspective and its prophetic voice , ” Baucham wrote .
“ Men who should be standing guard as the conscience of the country are instead falling in line with the feminist agenda and calling a family tragedy . . . a shining example of family values . ”
In an interview , Baucham said the hundreds of responses he ’s received are running 20 to 1 in his favor .
But he said he has also been castigated for “ breaking ranks ” by some , who argue the election is too important to raise divisive issues .
He and other like - minded pastors disagree .
“ It ’s more important for us to truthfully represent the priorities of Scripture than it is for us to win an election , ” Phillips said .
That view is obviously held by a very small minority of evangelicals , but overall this issue is leading to rather odd statements from Religious Right leaders as they try to reconcile this apparent contradiction :
Although many conservative Christians agree that women should place homemaking over working outside , many are hesitant to apply those views to Palin .
Christian author Martha Peace , whose book “ The Excellent Wife ” tells women to submit to husbands and be good homemakers , said she would not make the same choice as Palin .
Ditto for Richard Land , who heads the Southern Baptist Convention ’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission and recommended Palin to the McCain campaign .
He also would not do as the Palins have done .
“ I ’m not hard - wired to be the ‘ First Dude , ’ ” he said .
But Peace and Land are two of many who say the public should stay out of what is a matter between the Palins and their pastor .
“ I would n’t presume to make that judgment for another family , ” Land said .
That ’s rich coming from Land , whose entire career has been based on passing judgment on others .

The Senate has approved a new version of a $ 700 bn ( £ 380 bn ) rescue plan for the troubled US financial system .
Senators voted 74 to 25 in favour of the emergency legislation , which is designed to buy up bad debts and stabilise financial markets .
It includes tax breaks for families and businesses , among other measures designed to win over sceptics .
The plan will now go before the House of Representatives , which narrowly rejected a similar bill on Monday .
President George W Bush praised Senate leaders for making " vital improvements to the rescue package " and urged the House to approve the measures .
News of the Senate vote failed to lift Asian markets .
Japan 's main Nikkei index ended down 1.9 % and Australian stocks lost 0.6 % , on wider fears about economic growth .
But shares in London , Paris and Frankfurt opened up .
Added sweeteners
The original bill was criticised for pandering to the needs of Wall Street bankers at the expense of ordinary citizens .
CHANGES TO BILL Raises government 's guarantee on savings from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000
Tax breaks to help small businesses and promote renewable energy Expansion of child tax credit and help for victims of recent hurricanes
Vote fails to lift Asia shares Bail - out bill : Still a bitter pill ?
Send us your comments
The $ 700bn is designed to be used to buy up devalued assets from struggling firms to help kick - start the economy .
Since the House rejected the bill , politicians have added sweeteners such as tax breaks for small businesses and an increase in the amount of savings the state will guarantee - from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 .
The House is expected to vote again on the bill on Friday , and President Bush was keen to stress that the package was " essential to the financial security of every American " .
" The American people expect - and our economy demands - that the House pass this good bill this week and send it to my desk , " he said .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , the architect of the initial bill who has been criticised over its failure , sounded buoyed by the Senate vote .
" This sends a positive signal that we stand ready to protect the US economy by making sure that Americans have access to the credit that is needed to create jobs and keep businesses going , " he said .
Premature celebrations ?
US presidential hopefuls John McCain and Barack Obama , who both returned from the campaign trail for the debate , voted in favour of the rescue plan .
Both presidential candidates turned up for the vote Senate majority leader Harry Reid , a Democrat , said he was happy with the result and praised both presidential candidates for voting .
" I think it shows that when we work together we can accomplish good things , " he said .
Mitch McConnell , leader of Republican senators , was also in jubilant mood .
" This was a measure that was much needed , to unfreeze the credit markets and get America 's economy working again , " he said .
But the BBC's Jonathan Beale , in Washington , says the bill has passed only the first hurdle , and such celebrations could yet prove to be premature .

What are these ?
It 's " its " !
Okay , look .
I 'm a grammar snob .
If you want to be able to communicate with others , you need to wrap that communication up in an easily digested package .
You need to pay considerable attention to the form and structure of what you 're saying as well as the content .
Careless use of language instills in the reader a lack of confidence in the writer .
In the academic world , poor grammar is often a further impediment towards the understanding of already complex material .
One particular error that never ceases to make me cringe is the misuse of the words " it 's " and " its " .
The distinction between " it's " and " its " was first conveyed to me with great intensity in the eighth grade , by the venerable Donna George at West Island College in Montreal .
For years thereafter I suppressed my anger at the apostrophical affront , playing the stoic as best I could .
But as I grow older and more curmudgeonly , and as the grammatical fibre of our society erodes , my tolerance for this typographical trespass trickles away .
Here , then , is my defiant outpost , my barricade against the teeming masses who would overrun the world with superfluous apostrophes ( or , less often , withhold those apostrophes when they are so rightly required ) .
Of course , I would rather build a classroom than a fortress , and so here follows a lesson in the correct usage of the words " it 's " and " its " .
Be kind to your friend the apostrophe .
It's
Examples :
It 's a small world , after all .
It 's a small world , after all .
It 's a small world , after all .
It 's a small world , after all .
You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around , that 's what it 's all about .
Well , it 's been a long , been a long , been a long , been a long day .
Its
Examples :
He left it dead , and with its head he went galumphing back Love rears its ugly head .
Using them correctly
Try replacing your " it 's " with " it is " in the sentence .
If the sentence becomes obviously wrong , you probably meant to use " its " .
If it sounds okay , " it 's " can stay .
Example : " Nothing can take it 's place " can't be right , because " Nothing can take it is place " is nonsense .
You probably mean " Nothing can take its place " .
Example : " It 's not easy being green " .
Well , " It is not easy " is right , so the original sentence is okay .
Try replacing your " its " with " his " in the sentence .
If it comes out sounding right , " its " can stay .
Example : " That 's just its way of making friends " must be okay , because " That 's just his way of making friends " is grammatical .
In general , " its " as a possessive is like " his " .
You would n't write " hi's " , would you ?
Well , maybe you would if you were talking about something belonging to Hiram ...
Look at the word that follows " its " or " it's " .
A noun means that you want " its " .
An adjective probably indicates " it's " .
This is n't always true , but it 's a half - decent rule of thumb .
Example : " The cat licks its tongue into the corners of the evening " .
" Tongue " is a noun .
I probably do n't mean " it is tongue " , so I 'll stick with " its " .
Where to go from here
The twelve day's of Christmas
Admittedly , rules involving the apostrophe get somewhat fuzzy in places .
I find it hard to pluralize a word like " printf " used as a noun , as in " This function contains twenty - two printfs " , since that can lead to confusion .
I would simply avoid the issue : " This function contains twenty - two occurrences of printf " .
Conclusion
I 'm not alone in my concern for the proper use of the apostrophe .
If you 're still looking for answers , I 'm sure you can find any number of other sources of information .
Post scriptum
October 11th , 1999 : Chuck was nice enough to point me to a frightening yet excellent collection : actual photos of incorrect usage of the apostrophe .
Proceed with caution !
December 31st , 2000 : I was reviewing the access logs for my web pages today , when I came across the following :
/homes/csk/its.html ( 11 hits ) :
http://google.yahoo.com/bin/query?p= " the+twelve+day's+of+christmas+" &hc=0&hs=0 ( 1 )
What all this means is that someone came across the " it 's " page by doing a google search on the phrase " the twelve day's of christmas " ( presumably in a search for the full lyrics ) .
Shame on you , whoever you are , and I hope I have steered you away from a life of punctuation abuse .
January 10th , 2001 : I found this quote in a story on cnn.com today :
Indeed , the TWA transaction will provide American with a critical new hub in St. Louis , significantly bolstering it 's position as an east / west carrier .
I can ( almost ) understand it when somebody 's personal page contains this mistake , or even when the notoriously ungrammatical guys at slashdot slip up .
But CNN ?
I have great respect for the writing skill of the CNN staff .
Oops -- had .
May 23rd , 2002 : I received an email from Brian Bridson this morning .
He points out that for all my hifalutin ' grammar snobbishness , this page is riddled with errors .
Specifically , the rules of punctuation require that when a quotation is followed by a comma or period , the punctuation mark appear before the closing quote , as in " this example . "
So let me warn you : this page should be used only as a guide to the apostrophe .
Do not take it as an example of how to use the comma or period .
For more information , I invite you to read the response I sent to Brian 's email .
August 7th , 2003 : Grammar snobs unite !
Jeremy Roberts writes to point out that one should not hyphenate two word phrases containing adverbs ending in " ly " .
I was n't aware of this rule , and I 'm following up to determine its full scope .
In any case " easily - digested " has been changed to " easily digested " in the first paragraph .
Thanks , Jeremy !
March 9th , 2006 : Slowly but surely , we 're converging on the most grammatically perfect web page in the world ( now that 's a low standard ! ) .
Bruce Chapman of New Zealand spotted a couple of additional typos on this page .
Thanks !
May 1st , 2006 : Thanks to Jeff , who pointed out that " ' s " should be preceded by " an " , not " a " .
It 's a curious rule , being primarily an aid to pronunciation and less relevant in written English .
But it 's a rule nonetheless .
October 12th , 2006 : Martijn Morrien found a small typo in one of the rules of thumb .
It 's amazing that people are still sending in corrections more than seven years after I wrote this web page .
November 2nd , 2006 : The emails continue to arrive at a furious rate !
Mary Zarazinsky claimed that this page was " full of misspelled words " .
I beg your pardon ?
For the first time ever , I ran the page through a spellchecker .
Indeed , I discovered a small number of shocking spelling errors .
Some were not so shocking ; I have no intention of changing " hifalutin ' " into " highfaluting " , thank you very much .
Separately , Jessica Mullen took offence at my abuse of the comma before a dependent conjunctive clause .
That 's a personal weakness of mine , one that I 've decided to leave in .
Sorry , Jessica .
Man , you put one innocuous grammar page on the web , and the Donna Georges of the world come out of the woodwork .
Keep those cards and letters coming !
November 2nd , 2006 : As an aside , I can't help but refer to this web page , which contains a brief bio and photograph of Donna George .
I find it especially amusing given that George McLeish , the person immediately below her on the page , is a family friend .
May 14th , 2007 : I received an email about a month and a half ago praising this web page but asking that I remove the phrase " rule of thumb " .
There is some evidence that the expression goes back to a ruling in England that a man be permitted to beat his wife with a stick provided it was no thicker than his thumb .
I confess that I had not previously heard that theory .
I 've decided to let the text stand .
The evidence for the origin of the phrase is n't conclusive , and in any case the phrase itself is quite divorced from its suspected origins in modern usage .
The request provoked some interesting discussion , though .
( August 14th , 2007 : Richard Bollard offers a link to this page , which does a fairly good job of discrediting this hypothetical etymology ) .
June 6th , 2007 : A few people have inquired about the status of " its ' " , with an apostrophe following the " s " .
Yes , I can imagine a very contrived set of circumstances in which one might be able to use the word " its ' " .
However , those circumstances will not arise in day - to - day writing .
Given that this page is concerned with convenient guidelines , let me simply say this : you will never need to use " its ' " , period .
It 's probably best to assume that it 's not a word at all .
August 15th , 2007 : I 'm starting to see why this page gets so many visitors .
It 's currently the top google hit for both of the individual words " it 's " and " its " .
To be honest , that freaks me out a little bit .
On the other hand , having now attained this minor level of celebrity , I would hate to be ousted .
Link to this page liberally , and help make it the Official Internet Home of " it's " and " its " .
December 10th , 2007 : Thanks to Brian Conradsen for pointing out that I should never have used the expression " most grammatically perfect " in the update from March 9th , 2006 -- words like " perfect " and " unique " should never take intensifiers .
Thus the page is not perfect after all , with the comment on perfection serving as its own counterexample !
Perhaps I ought to have said " least flawed " .
From TPM Election Central …
The McCain campaign is now broadening their attack on Obama ’s past association with William Ayers to include Michelle Obama — even though McCain has repeatedly said spouses should be off limits during the campaign .
The attack ?
Bernardine Dohrn , Ayers ’ wife and fellow former Weatherman , went to work in 1984 for the major Chicago - based national law firm of Sidley & Austin , and three years later , Michelle joined the mega - firm as well .
That ’s the entire attack .
We wish we were joking .
But we are n’t .
Jerome Corsi : ' Obama Nation ' Author Detained in Kenya
s the author of a new smear book entitled The Obama Nation Leftist Politics and the Culture of Personality .
He is probably best known for his association with the Swift Boat Veterans of Truth .
Corsi traveled to Kenya to launch his diatribe when he was detained by immigration officials who claim that he does n't have a work permit .
There appears to be more to it than that .
Apparently Jerome Corsi's promotional literature for the book revealed that he claims Barack Obama has sinister links to Kenyan politicians .
This is apparently not sitting well with the African nation , where the Democratic presidential nominee is very popular .
Corsi had planned to travel to Nairobi after his book launch in order to seek out Obama 's destitute half brother George Obama .
He intends to present a $ 1,000 check to the young man .
It is n't clear whether Corsi will be allowed to do either of the things that he set out to do .
His fatal error was that he leaked information to Kenyan newspapers prior to landing in the country , which tipped off officials to the authors plans and triggered their unwelcoming response .
He was summarily escorted to the airport for immediate deportation .
Corsi is n't the first who wanted to help George Obama out of poverty .

Police have confirmed to Gawker that David Foster Wallace , novelist and essayist , was found dead of an apparent suicide in his home in Claremont , California , where he was a professor at Pomona College .
It 's been reported that his wife found him after he hanged himself .
Foster Wallace , longtime darling of grad students and civilian PoMo lit fans , was often very funny in print ( see his famous essay skewering the cruise ship experience , " A Supposedly Fun Thing I 'll Never Do Again " ) , but as his 2005 speech at Kenyon College implied , he was not unfamiliar with the heft of existence :
[ L]earning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think .
It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience .
Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life , you will be totally hosed .
Think of the old cliché about quote the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master .
This , like many clichés , so lame and unexciting on the surface , actually expresses a great and terrible truth .
It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in : the head .
They shoot the terrible master .
And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger .
Very Sad. [ Via Reluctant Habits ]

( CNN ) -- Tracy
Orr sat in the back of the room and prepared to watch her foreclosed home go up for auction this past Saturday .
That 's when a pesky stranger sat down beside her and struck up a conversation .
Tracy
Orr faced losing her home to foreclosure when Marilyn Mock , a stranger , stepped in to buy it .
" Are you here to buy a house ? " Marilyn Mock said .
Orr could n't hold it in .
The tears flowed .
She pointed to the auction brochure at a home that did n't have a picture .
" That 's my house , " she said .
Within moments , the four - bedroom , two - bath home in Pottsboro , Texas , went up for sale .
People up front began casting their bids .
The home that Orr purchased in September 2004 was slipping away .
She stood and moved toward the crowd .
Behind her , Mock got into the action .
" She did n't know I was doing it , " Mock says .
" I just kept asking her if [ her home ] was worth it , and she just kept crying .
She probably thought I was crazy , ' Why does this woman keep asking me that ? ' "
Mock says she bought the home for about $ 30,000 .
That 's when Mock did what most bidders at a foreclosure auction never do .

" She said , ' I did this for you .
I 'm doing this for you , ' " Orr says .
" When it was all done , I was just in shock . "
" I thought maybe her and her husband do these types of things to buy them and turn them .
She said , ' No , you just look like you needed a friend . ' "
" All this happened within like 5 minutes .
She never even asked me my name .
She did n't ask me my financial situation .
She had no idea what [ the house ] looked like .
She just did it out of the graciousness of her heart , just a ' Good Samaritan , ' " Orr says .
" It 's amazing . "

Orr says she had taken out a mortgage of $ 80,000 in 2004 when she first bought the home .
At the time , she says she worked for the U.S. Postal Service .
But she lost her job a month after taking out the loan when she says the Post Office fired her over a DWI while off - duty .
She says a wrongful termination lawsuit is pending .
Without a job , she fell behind on her home payments .
She sold some property in 2006 for $ 12,000 and paid it to the mortgage company , thinking she had done enough to save herself from foreclosure -- but to no avail , she says .
" It 's just been a bad deal , " says Orr , who now works at All Saints Camp and Conference Center , a Christian group with ties to the Episcopal Diocese of Dallas , Texas .
With the foreclosure auction approaching , she planned to make the nearly 80 - mile drive to Dallas this past Saturday with an investor friend .
But she says he ditched her at the last - minute .
She went to the auction with her family , and suddenly found herself in the back with Mock .
" I always talk to everyone around me , " Mock says .
" I mean you can always find out all kinds of interesting things when you talk to people around you .
So I just asked her , ' Are you here to buy a house ? ' "
Mock , who is known as the " Rock Lady " for her small business selling flagstone and other rocks in Rockwall , Texas , says she went to the auction with her 27 - year - old son to help him buy his first home .
He bought his home , and soon afterward Mock came across Orr .
Mock says she 's using one of her business dump trucks as collateral for the $ 30,000 sale price .
" I ca n't afford to just give [ the house ] to her , " she says .
As for Orr 's payments , Mock says , " We 'll just figure out however much she can pay on it .
That way , she can have her house back . "
Why be so generous ?
" She was just so sad .
You put yourself in their situation and you realize you just got to do something , " says Mock , who says she has trouble walking by homeless people on the street and not helping them out .
" If it was you , you 'd want somebody to stop and help you . "
When she told her husband of 30 years that she 'd just bought a home for a stranger , she says his reaction was : " Whatever . "
" He 's used to it , " she says with a booming laugh .
Mock says she 's excited for another reason too .
Orr 's house is located near a Texas fishing hot - spot .
" She says I can come up there and fish , and I love to fish ! "
Orr , who nearly lost her home , says her newfound friend has " given me back faith and hope to keep going and hold my head up . "
" Things happen for a reason , " Orr says .

Mr Davis said Labour wanted to appear tougher than the Tories Ex-shadow home secretary David Davis has said he feels " vindicated " in quitting as an MP to oppose plans to hold terror suspects for longer .
Peers have rejected the government 's call to extend the pre-charge detention limit from 28 to 42 days .
Mr Davis , who returned as an MP after a by - election on the issue of civil liberties , said he was " happy to burn out a career for a success like that " .
But the government said the 42 days plan could be re-introduced in future .
Peers rejected the proposal - passed by the Commons in June - by a majority of 191 votes on Monday and the government then announced they would not try to force the measure through .
Emergency bill The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats both oppose the measure , which was also voted against on Monday by many Labour peers , including former cabinet ministers Lord Irvine , Lord Falconer and Lord Goldsmith .
Mr Davis , a Conservative who has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the plan , stood down as Haltemprice and Howden MP in June .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

More from Today programme
He was returned with a 15,355 majority in July , after Labour and the Liberal Democrats declined to field by - election candidates .
Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4's
Today programme the government 's 42 days plan had " been all about politics , not about security .
It has been about trying to give the Labour Party a ' tougher - than - Tory ' model in the public mind .
" It has failed miserably and I do n't think anybody sensible would revisit it . "
He said : " I feel vindicated , because before I resigned it looked like it would go through in a ping - pong . "
Parliamentary " ping - pong " is where a bill goes back and forth between the Lords and Commons until one house gives way to the other or the Commons forces the measure through via the Parliament Act .
One - page bill
But following the Lords defeat the 42 days proposal will be removed from the government 's main Counter - Terrorism Bill .
Instead , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has written the plan into a separate one - page bill which could be pushed through Parliament quickly in the case of a national emergency .
She told Today she hoped the government could still " count on people 's support " if such a measure had to be introduced .
She told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme : " My priority is we need to find a way through this , even if other political parties wo n't engage with it . "
Ms Smith said : " The thing about opposition is you do n't have to cover off those risks but government , quite rightly , does and that 's why I brought forward the proposals I did . "
However , former Labour attorney general Lord Goldsmith said the detentions of up to 42 days were " not only unnecessary but also dangerous " .
' Abandoning plans '
The home secretary 's alternative legislation would also not work unless there was an extremely different scenario facing the UK , he added .
For the Conservatives , shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said the prime minister 's spin doctors had stopped Ms Smith from " saying in straightforward terms that she is abandoning 42 days " .
He said his party was " perfectly prepared to be firm on terrorism " and pass difficult bills .
" But they have to be credible , they have to be based on evidence and they must not be put forward in a way that smacks of mere political posturing and gimmicks . "
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg added : " The decision to prepare emergency legislation instead is merely a fig leaf which does little to disguise their defeat . "
He added : " The push for 42 days ' detention was more about ministers posturing and looking tough than it ever was about fighting terrorism . "
MPs passed the proposal by a majority of just nine votes in June , with 36 Labour backbenchers rebelling .
Plans to extend the pre-charge terror detention limit to 90 days were rejected by MPs in 2006 .

What are these ?
Gavin Hewitt
Nashville , Tennessee :
Here 's a question : if your opponent gets dirty , do you join him in the mud ?
It came up in the media centre , or " Spin Alley " , in the hours before the debate in Nashville .
Robert Gibbs , an Obama strategist , was chewing the fat with a few reporters .
Spin , these days , is a 24 - hour business .
It precedes a debate and goes into over - drive afterwards .
Gibbs was wondering out loud which McCain would show up tonight .
Would he be angry and desperate , or the candidate who thrives on town - hall meetings ?
And then Gibbs was asked about going negative .
The Obama camp believes we are entering a new phase in the campaign .
The gloves have started to come off and the Republicans want to make the election a referendum on Obama the man .
They regard Sarah Palin 's comment that Obama was " palling around with terrorists " as straight out of the nasty bag .
So you might think that with Obama pulling ahead in some of the key states , his campaign would stay out of the street fights .
But Gibbs saw it very differently : " If they want to get dirty - we 'll go there with them . "
Barack Obama is of the same mind : " We do n't throw the first punch but we 'll throw the last . "
So , when the Republicans raised Obama 's links to the former radical Bill Ayres , the Democrats hit back by high - lighting McCain 's links to Charles Keating and the savings and loans scandal .
So why not stay out of a " slug - fest " ?
Imprinted in the Democrats ' DNA is what happened to John Kerry and the attacks on his time in Vietnam in the Swift boats .
While his opponents questioned Kerry 's war - time story and his heroism , his campaign said little .
That enabled the story to take root .
The Obama campaign believes not only in instant rebuttal but fighting back .
It 's an interesting strategy because , as the ailing economy has worked for Obama , so he has tried to be reassuring and presidential .
That has so irritated some Republicans that they 've accused him of " coasting " to the White House .
So , they would like nothing better than to draw him into a tough fight .

Fate of Paper Money
-- Posted Monday , 30 June 2008 | Digg This Article | Source : GoldSeek.com
By Mike Hewitt " Paper money eventually returns to its intrinsic value - zero . " ( Voltaire , 1694 - 1778 )
The first well - known widespread use of paper money was in China during the Tang ( 618-907 A.D. ) dynasty around 800 A.D. Paper money spread to the city of Tabriz , Persia in 1294 and to parts of India and Japan between 1319 to 1331 .
However , its use was very short - lived in these regions .
In Persia , the merchants refused to recognize the new money , thus bringing trade to a standstill .
By 1455 , after over 600 years , the Chinese abandoned paper money due to numerous problems of over issuance and hyperinflation .
Figure 1 .
This Kuan note is the oldest known banknote in the world .
It was made in China circa 1380 .
Paper money did not arrive in Europe till 1633 with the earliest known English goldsmith certificates being used not only as receipts for reclaiming deposits but also as evidence of ability to pay .
In 1656 , the Bank of Sweden is founded with a charter that authorizes it to accept deposits , grant loans and mortgages , and issue bills of credit .
By 1660 , the English Goldsmiths ' receipts became a convenient alternative to handling coins or bullion .
The realisation by goldsmiths that borrowers would find them just as convenient as depositors marks the start of the use of banknotes in England .
In 1661 , the Bank of Sweden becomes first chartered bank in Europe to issues notes known as the paper daler .
Figure 2 . A 50 - Daler note from the Bank of Sweden issued in 1666 .
At present there are 177 currencies being used in the world .
Below is a list containing all currencies currently in circulation .
Not all currencies are widely used and accepted , such as the various banknotes of the pound sterling .

Hello folks , I ’m finally back with some good news – we just submitted the updated version of NOVASTRIKE to SCEA , and you should be seeing the update go live sometime in the next few weeks .
For those of you that have been frustrated by the difficulty ( and I know it ’s a lot of you ) – first off , I ’m sorry for the wait ( as well as the frustration factor you went through ) .
But each submission requires a fair amount of work , so we wanted to add as many features as possible before submitting the update .
There are now four difficulty modes :
RECRUIT
SOLDIER
VETERAN
HARDCORE
RECRUIT , SOLDIER , and VETERAN have all been tamed .
As a general rule of thumb I ’d recommend if you could n’t beat RECRUIT in the original release then initially stick to RECRUIT in this release .
If you did beat RECRUIT but were having difficulty with SOLDIER then try the new SOLDIER .
If you did beat SOLDIER then I ’d recommend trying VETERAN .
And HARDCORE has no extra lives per stage and is the most challenging ( similar to the original VETERAN difficulty ) .
Now for a bullet list of other items in the update :
Trophies – you ’ll now be able to unlock sixteen trophies ( 12 bronze and 4 silver )
– you ’ll now be able to unlock sixteen trophies ( 12 bronze and 4 silver ) Fully Customizable Controls – you can now map weapon selection for the primary and secondary weapons to different buttons and remap other control options .
We ’ve also added a Type 2 control scheme that is the default for new players .
For for those of you that already have the game it will stay on Type 1 until you select Type 2 ( or customize the controls ) – this was done so that players not reading this post do n’t get the update then wonder what the heck happened to the control scheme .
And as a final note you ’ll also be able to swap the left stick and right stick functionality ( Steering and the Omni Cannon )

Now you ’ll be able to do just that
– want to play your own rocking tunes instead of listening to NOVASTRIKE ’s music ?
Now you ’ll be able to do just that Multiple Saved Games – you can now have as many saved games as you want
– you can now have as many saved games as you want New Weapon Info pane – this is more for new players , but once a weapon is acquired the game pauses and displays an information pane showing the name of the weapon , how to select it , how to fire it , and a brief description of the weapon .
While this feature is turned on by default you can also go to the ingame options menu and turn it off if you ’re already are familiar with all the weapons and do n’t want the interruption

– now after you finish a stage you can advance to the next Stage ( as you could in the original release ) , or you can Quit and Save ( which will have you starting at the next stage when you later continue ) , or you can select Replay Stage to play that stage over again ( if you failed some objectives and want to try again to get a higher score Restart Stage option has been added to ingame options menu – if you ’re not liking how you ’re playing on a stage you can now open the ingame options menu , select Restart Stage , then start the stage over ( versus having to quit out and continue )
– if you ’re not liking how you ’re playing on a stage you can now open the ingame options menu , select Restart Stage , then start the stage over ( versus having to quit out and continue )
Megapacks and repair packs will replenish the capacitor bar for the afterburner
will replenish the capacitor bar for the afterburner Seeking weapons will now target outer components on capital ships .
For example , if you drop an electro - mine near a Heralder , it will now lash the outer hangar “ wing ” ( versus the main body as it did in the original release ) .
This makes stripping enemy carriers a bit easier

This makes stripping enemy carriers a bit easier Friendly Fire damage has been disabled in RECRUIT and SOLDIER ( this is just part of the overall taming of RECRUIT and SOLDIER – we also limited the maximum number of active waves , and when your Scythe explodes it wo n’t damage friendlies in RECRUIT or SOLDIER , either ) ; VETERAN now gives you two extra lives per stage as well – HARDCORE is , well , hardcore

– in the original release it sometimes had difficulty locking onto very low ground structures ( near sea - level ) – this is no longer the case , and the Shredder is much more useful as a result Player ship ( the Scythe ) is a bit larger in size – but do n’t worry , we made sure that it did n’t make the game harder ( as the collision model is a bit larger as well )
– but do n’t worry , we made sure that it did n’t make the game harder ( as the collision model is a bit larger as well )
Brief invulnerability after respawning – this is only a few seconds so do n’t try to use it to fight , but it will at least provide brief protection if you respawn over an enemy base
– this is only a few seconds so do n’t try to use it to fight , but it will at least provide brief protection if you respawn over an enemy base Leaderboards now show the last completed stage to the right of the score and also show more than 1,000 scores ( and HARDCORE has been added to the Leaderboards )
Beyond this we ’re working with SCEE to try and get NOVASTRIKE out in Europe as soon as possible .
Last , but not least , when the update goes live I ’ll go ahead and do another blog post here so I can respond to the initial reactions .
I ’ll be particularly interested in seeing posts from those of you that stopped playing due to the difficulty – we really hope the update allows you to enjoy and finish the game .
I ’ll also be checking this blog post and trying my best to respond to any questions that are brought up .
And if you made it through this long post – congrats !
I know many of you are sick of hearing about Joe the deadbeat plumber but it warrants a full budget article because “ Joe ” is simply a symbol of the Republican machine of being for the everyman .
In essence , this Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher stopped Senator Obama in Ohio to ask him a question about taxes .
The way the question was worded , he had setup a scenario where he would be owning a business making $ 250,000 + a year trying to lure Senator Obama in answering his question .
Obama answered the question and actually gave this guy more respect than he should have .
As the instant media went full speed ahead , it turns out Sam does n’t even have a plumber ’s license , owes taxes , and is a registered Republican .
So this guy is a fraud .
Big deal .
The bigger story however is that this guy only made $ 40,000 in 2006 .
How in the world is this guy going to buy a $ 250,000 + a year business on that salary ?
Maybe this was an option during the credit boom when any Joe could get a loan but not this time .
What is the bigger story is how the Republican machine tries to recreate this Horatio Alger story that everyman can become a multi-millionaire if they just try hard enough .
50 % of our nation ’s population has a household income of $ 46,000 or less .
Sam did n’t even get to that level .
Here is what Rolling Stone reported :
“ So Joe the Plumber made $ 40,000 in 2006 , according to divorce records dredged up by the Toledo Blade .
Let ’s say he ’s had a good couple years since then and is now making $ 50 grand .
Under Obama ’s tax plan , Joe the Plumber – a single father of one – would get a $ 614 break on his taxes .
That ’s $ 213 more than he ’d get from John McCain .
Enough for an aspiring plumber to buy a Ridgid SeeSnake Micro Camera to check out the cause of mysterious clogs .
Can we stop talking about this now ? ”
Agreed .
This guy has swallowed the pill of a fringe ideology and should be asking why McCain would be raising his taxes .
Yet the question that should n’t be put aside is why do n’t we talk about the legit families , that is 50,000,000 + households in America that are struggling with $ 46,000 a year or less ?
In fact , that is why I had posted the perfect $ 46,000 a year budget for a family living in California here .
The notion that someone is going to take away something you do n’t even have is part of a psychological desire to believe in the boogeyman .
“ When you make $ 250,000 a year , then you ’ll be in some big trouble . ”
You know how many families make more than $ 250,000 a year ?
Try 1.5 % .
This is n’t your common everyman theme .
This is the wealthy via their media outlets and politicians trying to mask their idea through a person that made only $ 40,000 a year in 2006 .
There is nothing wrong with that .
In fact , half the country is in that spot .
But trying to mask a fraud as someone making $ 250,000 and portraying him as some sort of common persons is cynical and pathetic .
This is the false ideology that is coming down and crashing .
I know a few plumbers and they do not make anywhere close to $ 250,000 .
In fact , nationwide the average salary for plumbers is approximately $ 50,000 per year :

The frustrating thing is n’t with Sam .
He has a right to believe what he wants .
But to turn him into a symbol of the common man making $ 250,000 a year ?
Please .
As we just highlighted half of the families in American make $ 46,000 or less a year .
85 % of all households make less than $ 100,000 a year !
What is utterly frustrating about this is the distortion .
Will anyone really check the facts and look at the statistics ?
We have .
But how many others will ?
There are many tax paying families that are pinching pennies everyday trying to do what is right in this world and yet their government seems to not care .
And how can they not avoid feeling this ?
Here we have a global multi-trillion bailout that is geared to the connected , the wealthy , and the global banks who are actually at the center of this mess .
Here we have the case of the everyman who really is n’t like many of us .
He has lived in multiple states , owes taxes , and is worried about making $ 250,000 a year when only two years ago he made $ 40,000 .
Do you really think the average family is concerned about making $ 250,000 when they are simply trying to ensure their kids do n’t get sick ?
Do you realize the number one reason for bankruptcy is medical reasons ?
Maybe that does n’t cross the mind of most .
I think on a site talking about personal finance it is also important to expose the truth about what is really occurring .
Senator Obama ’s tax plan will help you out if you make $ 250,000 or less .
Senator McCain ’s tax plan will help you if you make $ 250,000 a year or more .
Again , only 1.5 % of all households make $ 250,000 a year or more .
How is this even a debate ?
Again , what they want you to believe is this phony story that if you try hard enough and fear the government boogeyman , then you too can be a multi-million dollar plumber .
Yeah right .
What about teachers who work in the inner city making $ 45,000 a year ?
What about police officers who risk their life and make $ 70,000 a year .
They are nowhere near that $ 250,000 mark .
It is important to have the facts straight .

All that glitters golden is not gold .
It could be aluminum .
Or tungsten .
Or another metal of Chunlei Guo ’s choosing .
In a feat of optical alchemy , Dr. Guo , a professor of optics at the University of Rochester , and Anatoliy Y. Vorobyev , a postdoctoral researcher , use ultrashort laser bursts to pockmark the surface of a metal in a way that is not perceptible to the touch  it still feels smooth to the finger  but that alters how the metal absorbs and reflects light .
The result is that pure aluminum looks like gold , and the appearance is literally skin deep .
“ I can not tell it ’s not gold , ” Dr. Guo said .
“ It looks very pretty . ”
Dr. Guo and Dr. Vorobyev reported their findings in the journal Applied Physics Letters published online Thursday .
On Friday , I linked to several videos by Vocal Synthesis , a new YouTube channel dedicated to audio deepfakes —
AI - generated speech that mimics human voices , synthesized from text by training a state - of - the - art neural network on a large corpus of audio .
The videos are remarkable , pairing famous voices with unlikely dialogue : Bob Dylan singing Britney Spears , Ayn Rand and Slavoj Žižek dueting Sonny and Cher , Tucker Carlson reading the Unabomber Manifesto , Bill Clinton reciting “ Baby Got Back , ” or JFK touting the intellectual merits of Rick and Morty .
Many of the videos have been remixed by fans , adding music to create hilarious and surreal musical mashups .
Six U.S. presidents from FDR to Obama rap N.W.A. ’s , Fuck Tha Police , George W. Bush covers 50 Cent ’s In Da Club , Obama covers Notorious B.I.G.’s Juicy , and my personal favorite , Sinatra slurring his way through the Navy Seal copypasta , a decade - old 4 chan meme .
Videos Taken Offline
Over the weekend , for the first time , the anonymous creator of Vocal Synthesis received a copyright claim on YouTube , taking two of his videos offline with deepfaked audio of Jay - Z reciting the “ To Be or Not To Be ” soliloquy from Hamlet and Billy Joel ’s “ We Did n’t Start the Fire . ”
According to the creator , the copyright claims were filed by Roc Nation LLC with an unusual reason for removal : “ This content unlawfully uses an AI to impersonate our client ’s voice . ”
Both videos were immediately removed by YouTube , but can still be viewed on LBRY , a decentralized and open - source publishing platform .
Two synthetic Jay - Z videos remained online , in which he raps the Book of Genesis and the Navy Seal copypasta .
( Update : The videos were temporarily reinstated by Google .
See updates below . )
The video ’s creator announced the takedown in a creative way : using the voices of Barack Obama , Donald Trump , Ronald Reagan , JFK , and FDR .
Here ’s an excerpt transcript from the video :
“ Over the past few months , the creator of the channel has trained dozens of speech synthesis models based on the speech patterns of various celebrities or other prominent figures , and has used these models to generate more than one hundred videos for this channel .
These videos typically feature a synthetic celebrity voice narrating some short text or a speech .
Often , the particular text was selected in order to provide a funny or entertaining contrast with the celebrity ’s real - life persona .
“ For example , some of my favorites are George W. Bush performing a spoken - word version of “ In Da Club ” by 50 Cent , or Franklin Roosevelt ’s powerful rendition of the Navy Seals Copypasta .
“ The channel was created by an individual hobbyist with a huge amount of free time on his hands , as well as an interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies .
He would like to emphasize that all of the videos on this channel were intended as entertainment , and there was no malicious purpose for any of them .
“ Every video , including this one , is clearly labeled as speech synthesis in both the title and description .
Which brings us to the reason why we ’re delivering this message .
“ Over the past two days , several videos were posted to the channel featuring a synthetic Jay - Z rapping various texts , including the Navy Seals Copypasta , the Book of Genesis , the song “ We Did n’t Start the Fire ” by Billy Joel , and the “ To Be Or Not To Be ” soliloquy from Hamlet .
“ Unfortunately , for the first time since the channel began , YouTube took down two of these videos yesterday as a result of a copyright strike .
The strike was requested by Roc Nation LLC , with the stated reason being that it , quote , “ unlawfully uses an AI to impersonate our client ’s voice . ”
“ Obviously , Donald and I are both disappointed that Jay - Z and Roc Nation have decided to bully a small YouTuber in this way .
It ’s also disappointing that YouTube would choose once again to stifle creativity by reflexively siding with powerful companies over small content creators .
Specifically , it ’s a little ironic that YouTube would accept “ AI impersonation ” as a reason for a copyright strike , when Google itself has successfully argued in the case of “ Authors Guild v. Google ” that machine learning models trained on copyrighted material should be protected under fair use . ”
No Intent to Deceive
At its core , the controversy over deepfakes is about deception and disinformation .
Earlier this year , Facebook and Twitter banned deepfakes that could mislead or cause harm , largely motivated by their potential impact on the 2020 elections .
Though it ’s worth nothing that the use of deepfakes for fake news is largely theoretical so far , as Samantha Cole covered for VICE , with most created for porn .
( And , no , Joe Biden sticking his tongue is not a deepfake . )
In this case , there ’s no deception involved .
As he wrote in his statement , every Vocal Synthesis video is clearly labeled as speech synthesis in the title and description , and falls outside of YouTube ’s guidelines for manipulated media .
Copyright and Fair Use
With these takedowns , Roc Nation is making two claims :
These videos are an infringing use of Jay - Z ’s copyright .
The videos “ unlawfully uses an AI to impersonate our client ’s voice . ”
But are either of these true ?
With a technology this new , we ’re in untested legal waters .
The Vocal Synthesis audio clips were created by training a model with a large corpus of audio samples and text transcriptions .
In this case , he fed Jay - Z songs and lyrics into Tacotron 2 , a neural network architecture developed by Google .
It seems reasonable to assume that a model and audio generated from copyrighted audio recordings would be considered derivative works .
But is it copyright infringement ?
Like virtually everything in the world of copyright , it depends — on how it was used , and for what purpose .
It ’s easy to imagine a court finding that many uses of this technology would infringe copyright or , in many states , publicity rights .
For example , if a record producer made Jay - Z guest on a new single without his knowledge or permission , or if a startup made him endorse their new product in a commercial , they would have a clear legal recourse .
But , as the Vocal Synthesis creator pointed out , there ’s a strong case to be made this derivative work should be protected as a “ fair use . ”
Fair use can get very complicated , with different courts reaching different outcomes for very similar cases .
But there are four factors judges use when weighing a fair use defense in federal court :
The purpose and character of the use .
The nature of the copyrighted work .
The amount and substantiality of the portion taken .
The effect of the use upon the potential market .
There ’s a strong case for transformation with the Vocal Synthesis videos .
None of the original work is used in any recognizable form — it ’s not sampled in a traditional way , using an undisclosed set of vocal samples , stripped from their instrumentals and context , to generate an amalgam of the speaker .
And in most cases , it ’s clearly designed as parody with an intent to entertain , not deceive .
Making politicians rap , philosophers sing pop songs , or rappers recite Shakespeare pokes fun at those public personas in specific ways .
Vocal Synthesis is an anonymous and non-commercial project , not monetizing the channel with advertising and no clear financial benefit to the creator , and the impact on the market value of Jay - Z ’s discography is non-existent .
There are questions about the amount and substantiality of the borrowed work .
But even if the model was trained on everything Jay - Z ever produced , it would n’t necessarily rule out a fair use defense for parody .
Ultimately , there are two clear truths I ’ve learned about fair use from my own experiences : only a court can determine fair use , and while it might be a successful defense , fair use wo n’t protect you from getting sued and the costs of litigating are high .
Interviewing the Creator
As far as I know , this is the most prominent example of a celebrity claiming copyright over their own deepfakes , the first example of a musician issuing a takedown of synthesized vocals , and according to the creator , the first time YouTube ’s removed a video for impersonating a voice with AI .
( Previously , Conde Nast took down a Kim Kardashian deepfake by claiming copyright over the source video , and Jordan Peterson ordered a voice simulator offline . )
I reached out to the anonymous creator of Vocal Synthesis to learn more about how he makes these videos , his reaction to the takedown order , and his concern over the future of speech synthesis .
( Unfortunately , Roc Nation did n’t respond to a request for comment . )
How do you feel about the takedown order ?
Were you surprised to receive it ?
I was pretty surprised to receive the takedown order .
As far as I ’m aware , this was the first time YouTube has removed a video for impersonating a voice using AI .
I ’ve been posting these kind of videos for months and have not had any other videos removed for this reason .
There are also several other channels making speech synthesis videos similar to mine , and I ’m not aware of any of them having videos removed for this reason .
I ’m not a lawyer and have not studied intellectual property law , but logically I do n’t really understand why mimicking a celebrity ’s voice using an AI model should be treated differently than someone naturally doing an ( extremely accurate ) impression of that celebrity ’s voice .
Especially since all of my videos are clearly labeled as speech synthesis in both the title and description , so there was no attempt to deceive anyone into thinking that these were real recordings of Jay -Z .
Can you talk a little about the effort that goes into generating a new model ?
For example , how long does it typically take to gather and train a new model until it sounds good enough to publish ?
Constructing the training set for a new voice is the most time - consuming ( and by far the most tedious ) part of the process .
I ’ve written some code to help streamline it , though , so it now usually takes me just a few hours of work ( it depends on the quality of the audio and the transcript ) , and then there ’s an additional 12 hours ( approximately ) needed to actually train the model .
Are you using Tacotron 2 for synthesis ?
Yeah , I ’m using fine - tuned versions of Tacotron 2 .
I saw you ’ve struggled getting enough dialogue to fully develop some models , like with Mr. Rogers .
Have there been other voices you ’ve wanted to synthesize , but it ’s just too challenging to find a corpus to work from ?
Yeah , several .
Recently I tried to make one for Theodore Roosevelt , but there ’s only about 30 minutes of audio that exists for him ( and it ’s pretty poor quality ) , so the model did n’t really come out well .
The Crocodile Hunter ( Steve Irwin ) is another one I really want to do , and I can find enough audio , but I have n’t been able to find any accurate transcripts or subtitles yet ( it ’s very tedious for me to transcribe the audio myself ) .
How do you decide the voices and dialogue to pair together ?
I try to consistently have all my voices read the Navy Seals Copypasta and the first few lines of the Book of Genesis , since it ’s easier to hear the nuances of each voice when I can compare them to other voices reading the same text .
Other than that , there ’s no real method to it .
If I have an idea for voice / text combination that I think would be funny or interesting enough to be worth the effort of making the video , then I ’ll do it .
What do these videos mean to you ?
Is it more of a technical demonstration or a form of creative expression ?
I would n’t really consider my videos to be a technical demonstration , since I ’m definitely not the first to make realistic speech synthesis impersonations of well - known voices , and also the models I ’m using are n’t state - of - the - art anymore .
Mainly , I ’m just making these videos for entertainment .
Sometimes I just have an idea for a video that I really want to exist , and I know that if I do n’t make it myself , no one else will .
On the more serious side , the other reason I made the channel was because I wanted to show that synthetic media does n’t have to be exclusively made for malicious / evil purposes , and I think there ’s currently massive amounts of untapped potential in terms of fun / entertaining uses of the technology .
I think the scariness of deepfakes and synthetic media is being overblown by the media , and I ’m not at all convinced that the net impact will be negative , so I hoped that my channel could be a counterexample to that narrative .
Are you worried about the legal future for creative uses of this technology ?
Sure .
I expect that this technology will improve even more over the next few years , both in terms of accuracy and ease of use / accessibility .
Right now it seems to be legally uncharted waters in some ways , but I think these issues will need to be settled fairly soon .
Hopefully the technology wo n’t be stifled by overly restrictive legal interpretations .
It seems inevitable that , at some point , an artist ’s voice is going to be used for other uses against their will : guesting on a track without permission , promoting products they are n’t paid for , or maybe just saying things they do n’t believe .
What would you say to artists or other public figures who are worried that this technology will damage their rights and image ?
There are always trade - offs whenever a new technology is developed .
There are no technologies that can be used exclusively for good ; in the hands of bad people , anything can be used maliciously .
I believe that there are a lot of potential positive uses of this technology , especially as it gets more advanced .
It ’s possible I ’m wrong , but for now at least I ’m not convinced that the potential negative uses will outweigh that .
Thanks to the anonymous creator of Vocal Synthesis for their time .
You can subscribe to the YouTube channel ( for now ) for new videos , follow updates and remixes in the /r/ VocalSynthesis subreddit , and the video mirror on LBRY .
Update : I just heard from Vocal Synthesis ’s creator that the copyright strike was removed , and both videos are back on his channel .
I initially suspected that Roc Nation dropped the copyright claim , but Nick Statt at The Verge reported that Google reviewed the DMCA takedowns .
“ After reviewing the DMCA takedown requests for the videos in question , we determined that they were incomplete , ” a Google spokesperson tells The Verge .
“ Pending additional information from the claimant , we have temporarily reinstated the videos . ”
If Roc Nation provides the missing information to complete the DMCA requests , the videos will go offline again .
Or , given the press coverage , they may choose to let it go .
We ’ll see !

WASHINGTON  Advocacy groups and some legal experts told Congress on Wednesday that it was unreasonable for federal officials to search the laptops of United States citizens when they re-enter the country from traveling abroad .
Civil rights groups have said certain ethnic groups have been selectively profiled in the searches by Border Patrol agents and customs officials who have the authority to inspect all luggage and cargo brought into the country without obtaining warrants or having probable cause .
Companies whose employees travel overseas have also criticized the inspections , saying that the search of electronic devices could hurt their businesses .
The federal government says the searches are necessary for national security and for legal action against people who bring illegal material into the country .
Back in 2006 , Chris Bowers organized a “ Use it or Lose it ” campaign urging members who were safe and had large war chests to fork some over .
It was a new concept and caused some pushback , but it caught on .
This year , John Kerry , who is running against token opposition , has already stepped up :
Sen . John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) has made a $ 1 million contribution from his campaign to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ( DSCC ) , he told supporters in an e-mail Tuesday .
Kerry said the current financial crisis shows how important it is for Democrats to get to 60 seats .
“ It ’s time to push even harder to completely change Washington , ” Kerry wrote in an e-mail .
“ So I have an announcement : I just gave a million dollars from my campaign to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to try to make this happen . ”
To me , this is an indication that the Democratic Senators are hungry .
They want 60 .
Elected officials usually hoard money .
Might not be intentional , but it feels like John Kerry is sending a signal to his colleagues with war chests :
Fork it over .
[ O ] f the myriad mistakes made by McCain since he secured the Republican nomination from their confused field of empty GOP suits , the majority of newspapers urging readers to vote for Obama in two weeks cite the faux maverick 's choice of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate as a major executive decision that made them question his fitness for the presidency .
To be sure , the endorsements offer enthusiastic support for Obama and his platform for change but it's hard to miss how many of them use phrases like " clearly unqualified " to describe Palin and call McCain 's choice " reckless , " " appalling , " a " disaster " and " … an insult to the American people . "
" If elected , at 72 , he would be the oldest incoming president in U.S. history .
He 's in good health now , we 're told , although he has withheld most of his medical records .
That means Gov. Sarah Palin could very well become president .
" And that brings us to McCain 's most troubling trait : his judgment .
" While praiseworthy for putting the first woman on a major - party presidential ticket since Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 , his selection of Palin as a running mate was appalling .
The first - term governor is clearly not experienced enough to serve as vice president or president if required .
Her lack of knowledge is being covered up by keeping her away from questioning reporters and doing interviews only with those considered friendly to her views . "
[ T ]he fact that Palin 's numbers have faltered among the general electorate and that some in the conservative chattering class have soured on her only strengthens her profile among rank and file conservatives come 2012 .
In late September polling by the Post ( the last time we asked detailed questions of voter attitudes on Palin ) nearly nine in ten ( 87 percent ) Republicans and 84 percent of conservatives felt favorably toward her .
More than six in ten felt " strongly " favorable .
... Palin is clearly OF the conservative base in a real and meaningful way ; they view her as their first real spokesperson on the national stage in recent memory -- perhaps since Ronald Reagan .
It 's hard to imagine those feelings going away because she has not worn well with either moderate and independent minded voters of the conservative media .
And , for those who argue that questions of electability in a general election will dog Palin if and when she is a candidate for president , we say pish - posh ...
Like her or hate her , Palin remains VERY much in the mix as a 2012 candidate .
All the polls differ slightly but they are all pointing in the same direction : a big win for Obama and a massive repudiation of Republican governance ( unless you want to listen to far right loons who claim all the pollsters are conspiring against McCain ) .
Yesterday we referenced a Pew Poll that claimed " growing doubt about McCain 's judgment , age and campaign conduct " have led to a 52 - 38 % breakdown between the two campaigns .
That 's landslide territory .
And the gap is not closing ; it 's widening .
The new NBC News / poll is n't quite as dire for McCain -- but still plenty dire : a 52 - 42 % breakdown , fueled by growing Obama support from independents , suburban voters , Catholics and white women .
These voters are feelings towards Obama include " increased confidence in his ability to serve as commander in chief " and a belief that he will do a good job as president .
This is further reflected in a report from Editor & Publisher that more than 2 dozen newspapers that had backed Bush in 2004 , are already on board for Obama this year .
This included some influential powerhouses like the ( circulation 703,137 ) , the ( 541,663 ) , the ( 225,193 ) , the ( 494,131 ) , the ( 170,309 ) , the ( 54,315 ) , the ( 87,930 ) , the ( 72,613 ) and the ( 85,595 ) .
And keep in mind that neither thenor theendorsed in 2004 and both papers have come out for Obama this year .
Overall , Obama has been endorsed by four times as many newspapers as McCain .
Even before the news broke about how GOP campaign contributions were used for a $ 150,000 shopping spree for Palin and her family , Bob Geiger was pointing out that most of the newspapers endorsing Obama are basing that endorsement , at least partially , on McCain 's terrible judgment and cynicism in his selection of Sarah Palin as VP .
Theis a Republican newspaper in a Republican hellhole .
McCain is leading in Utah by an average of 35.7 % .
It 's the single most reactionary part of the country , a virtual 12th Century theocracy in the middle of the United States .
Yet even their biggest newspaper could n't help but notice that Theis just as Republican -- another paper that endorsed Bush in 2004 -- and they also were horrified by McCain 's adolescent and extremely dangerous choice of Palin .
Delusional far right extremists , on the other hand , are still cheering Palin as the best decision McCain has ever made .
Let 's pray they get their way and she 's the Republican nominee in 2012 .
As her approval ratings among normal people sink into oblivion , the far right of her discredited party still loves her .
A Palin candidacy should finish them off for another 2 generations .
Fingers crossed !
Labels : endorsements , McCain 's cynicism , McCain 's judgment
At the last debate , McCain attacked directly and sometimes he attacked sarcastically .
McCain fails , Obama is not rattled
HEMPSTEAD , N.Y. —
Debates should not be confused with trips to Lourdes : Few miracles are dispensed .
John McCain needed a miracle in his final debate with Barack Obama on Wednesday night , a miracle that would wipe away McCain ’s deficit in the polls and reenergize his flagging campaign .
Advertisement
He did not get one .
The clouds did not part .
Heavenly choirs were not heard .
Instead , the American public heard angry attacks from McCain .
Sometimes McCain attacked directly , and sometimes he attacked sarcastically , but he never stopped attacking .
And he never rattled Obama .
Obama answered every attack and kept his cool .
How cool ?
Obama was so cool that after 90 minutes under blazing TV lights , an ice cube would n’t have melted on his forehead .
McCain attacked him on everything from wanting to raise the taxes of Joe the Plumber — now the most famous plumber in America and at serious risk of becoming so wealthy his taxes will go up no matter who wins — to not traveling enough .
“ I admire so much Sen. Obama ’s eloquence , ” McCain sneered .
“ Sen. Obama , who has never traveled south of our border . ”
( This from a man whose running mate got her first passport last year . )
But McCain did n’t just attack , he also defended , including defending those people who attend his rallies and the rallies of Sarah Palin who have shouted nasty and threatening things when Obama ’s name is mentioned .
“ Let me say categorically that I am proud of the people who come to my rallies , ” McCain said .
“ I am not going to stand for anybody saying that the people who come to our rallies are anything other than patriotic citizens . ”
Obama responded to all this — what else ? — coolly .
“ I do n’t mind being attacked for the next three weeks , ” Obama said .
“ What the American people ca n’t afford is four more years of failed economic policies . ”
He never got off his game plan .
He never got shook up .
The biggest impact of the three presidential debates for Obama was not anything said or not said .
It was impressionistic : Obama simply did not appear to be the scary “ other ” that McCain needs him to be .
“ When people suggest that I pal around with terrorists , then we are not talking about issues , ” Obama said smoothly .
For McCain , the biggest impact of the debates was visual :
In the first debate he refused to look at Obama , in the second debate McCain appeared to careen around the stage , and in this last debate McCain would scribble furiously with his Sharpie as Obama was talking or else smirk in response to what Obama was saying .
Moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS often asked provocative questions that sometimes did not get provocative responses .
When Schieffer asked each man why the country would be better off if his running mate became president rather than the other guy ’s running mate , Obama said Joe Biden “ shares my core values . ”
John McCain said Sarah Palin is a “ reformer ” and “ she has united our party . ”
And McCain ’s desire to keep his party united behind him — because who else is ? — was very much on his mind , dipping deep into conservative Republican talking points .
McCain repeatedly accused Obama of “ wanting to spread the wealth ” around , which does n’t seem like all that bad an idea to people who are n’t wealthy .
But there was one place McCain would not go :
He did not bring up the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
It is a line McCain seems determined not to cross , even though some in his party are urging him to do so .
What McCain really needed is what he still needs : for Obama to make some huge gaffe , something that makes Obama look like the riskier choice between the two .
But Obama made no such gaffes Wednesday night .
“ The biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and same failed politics that we ’ve seen for the last eight years , ” Obama said .
The race is not over .
It would be wrong to write McCain off .
After all , there is still almost three weeks to go .
And in politics , anything can happen .
It usually does n’t , however .
Why is the Republican Party so racist ?
October 16 , 2008 by twitterpaters
by twit
via TPM , from the Press Enterprise on October 16 , 2008 :
The October newsletter by the Chaffey Community Republican Women , Federated says if Obama is elected his image will appear on food stamps — instead of dollar bills like other presidents .
The statement is followed by an illustration of “ Obama Bucks ” — a phony $ 10 bill featuring Obama ’s face on a donkey ’s body , labeled “ United States Food Stamps . ”
The GOP newsletter , which was sent to about 200 members and associates of the group by e-mail and regular mail last week , is drawing harsh criticism from members of the political group , elected leaders , party officials and others as racist .
But wait , there ’s more …
Via McClatchy on October 15 , 2008 :
Sacramento County Republican leaders Tuesday took down offensive material on their official party Web site that sought to link Sen. Barack Obama to Osama bin Laden and encouraged people to “ Waterboard Barack Obama ” – material that offended even state GOP leaders .

There has also been a racial undertone to the spin by Republicans and McCain about the causes of the current economic crisis .
McClatchy reports on October 11 , 2008 :
As the economy worsens and Election Day approaches , a conservative campaign that blames the global financial crisis on a government push to make housing more affordable to lower - class Americans has taken off on talk radio and e-mail .
Commentators say that ’s what triggered the stock market meltdown and the freeze on credit .
They ’ve specifically targeted the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which the federal government seized on Sept. 6 , contending that lending to poor and minority Americans caused Fannie ’s and Freddie ’s financial problems .
Federal housing data reveal that the charges are n’t true , and that the private sector , not the government or government - backed companies , was behind the soaring subprime lending at the core of the crisis .
When you hear McCain blame “ Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ” for the current economic crisis ( as he did in last night ’s debate ) , not only is he lying about the actual causes , but he is also appealing to the idea that “ poor and minority Americans ” are to blame .
And then there is this :
Via the LA Times on October 12 , 2008 :
Before McCain spoke , a Christian pastor offered a prayer that seemed to ask for divine intervention on his behalf .
“ There are millions of people around this world praying to their God — whether it ’s Hindu , Buddha , Allah — that [ McCain ’s ] opponent wins for a variety of reasons , ” Pastor Arnold Conrad said .
“ And , Lord , I pray that you would guard your own reputation , because they ’re going to think that their god is bigger than you , if that happens . ”

It ’s one of the great eye - rolling moments of life in New York : as subway riders try to jam onto a crowded train at rush hour , the conductor makes an announcement telling them to stay on the platform because “ there ’s another train right behind this one . ”
To which most straphangers respond : Yeah , right .
Now , New York City Transit aims to counter that skepticism with a novel experiment at the Myrtle - Wyckoff Avenues station on the L line in Brooklyn .
Beginning in December , officials will install a computer screen at each end of the platform showing a graphic representation of the entire L line and the location of every train on it .
Waiting passengers can watch the trains move along the tracks as the data is updated every 15 seconds .
That way , passengers can see for themselves if there really is another train “ right behind this one . ”
If the system works , and riders like it , it could be installed in other stations on the L line , said Greg Lombardi , the line ’s general manager , who helped create the system .
Ultimately it could be used on other lines as well .
“ There ’s no end to the possibilities , ” said Wilson M. Milian , a director of technology projects at the transit agency .
He said that the same information could some day be displayed on the Internet , so that riders could quickly check the location of trains before heading to the subway .

Thank God , Gospelr just solved that messy societal problem for you .
And what do you know , Christians are just as boring as everyone else .
A quick scan of Tweets on Gospelr , the Christian Twitter knockoff , reveals such minutiae as :
Adrian :
“ I had an awesome night at the KPC men ’s group here in Rogers . ”
and
Jesustxtswithu :
“ Checking out Gospelr , I must say glad to finally be able to “ follow ” people who Follow Him .
Greetings < 3 . ”
Jesustxtswithu’s sentiment is , of course , the ostensible reason for the site to exist .
But the thing about following people who follow Jesus is that , much like people who do n’t , they mostly post things like :
“ I have a newly opened bag of coffee on my bookshelf at work .
The aroma of the ground coffee is tempting me to brew another pot . ”
Christians have always promoted sites dedicated to Christians and the “ Christian lifestyle . ”
Faith - based Internet users can search and edit Christian Wikipedia , the Christian version of Wikipedia .
There ’s even Xianz , “ the Faith Based MySpace . ”
There ’s an obvious reason for this .
It actually makes a good deal of sense for Christian singles , for instance , wary of the pre-marital , homosexual , or just casual sex endorsed by many secular dating sites , to attempt to guide their dating life using Christian alternatives like ChristianCafe or ChristianMingle .
But does Twitter really need a Christian alternative ?
YouTube ( hence ChristianTube ) — makes more sense .
But until BangR really does exist or boring Tweets become a sin , Christians are safe with secular Twitter .

This is a great story about how such a young person can see the meaning of life so clearly through the eyes of his best friend .
Six - year - old Shane observed his beloved dog being euthanized after a long battle with cancer .
Shane ’s parents felt as though he might learn something from the experience .
Shane seemed very calm , petting the old dog for the last time , the adults wondered if he understood what was going on .
Within a few minutes , the dog slipped away peacefully .
The little boy seemed to accept his dog ’s fate without any difficulty or confusion .
Shane joined his parents and their vet in a small quiet room where they discussed the sad fact that humans tend to outlive their pets .
Shane , who had been listening attentively and quietly , piped up , “ I know why . ”
Startled , they all turned to him .
What came out of his mouth next stunned everyone .
They ’ve never heard a more comforting explanation .
He said , “ People are born so that they can learn how to live a good life– like loving everybody all the time and being nice , right ? ”
The six - year - old continued , “ Well , dogs already know how to do that , so they do n’t have to stay as long . ”
Please pause a moment and consider to ….
Live simply .
Love generously .
Care deeply .
Speak kindly .
Remember , if a dog was the teacher you would learn things like :
1 . When loved ones come home , always run to greet them .
2 . Never pass up the opportunity to go for a joyride .
3 . Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to
be pure ecstasy .
4 . Take naps .
5. Stretch before rising .
6. Run , romp , and play daily .
7 . Thrive on attention and let people touch you .
8. Avoid biting when a simple growl will do .
9 . On warm days , stop to lie on your back on the grass .
10 .
On hot days , drink lots of water and lie under a shady tree .
11 . When you ’re happy , dance around and wag your entire body .
12 . Delight in the simple joy of a long walk .
13 . Eat with gusto and enthusiasm .
Stop when you have had enough .
14 . Be loyal .
Never pretend to be something you ’re not .
15 .
If what you want lies buried , dig until you find it .
16 .
When someone is having a bad day , be silent , sit close by and
nuzzle them gently .
17 .
Be always grateful for each new day .
ENJOY EVERY MOMENT OF EVERY DAY !!!

Simris® Algae Omega - 3 .
Straight from the source in nature .
No fish , no harm .
If you ever wondered how low the opponents of medicinal marijuana could possibly stoop , just check out the 30 - seconds of vile propaganda above .
( I recommend having a strong anti-emetic handy . )
For those of you who may not know , even though I ’m NORML ’s Deputy Director I live in California .
Let me tell you that the claim that so - called “ pot smoking clubs [ are ] in every neighborhood ” is as false as it is absurd .
Fact is , the county I live in ( Solano County ) does n’t even allow for the establishment of dispensaries , nor has it — in four years since the passage of Senate Bill 420 — ever issued identification cards to state - authorized patients , as is required by law .
Numerous counties and municipalities have passed similar moratoriums on patient dispensaries , and many others continue to resist issuing ID cards to qualified patients .
By contrast , those California cities that allow for the not - for - profit patient dispensaries have enacted strict zoning policies regarding where they can operate ( “ Just blocks from schools ? ? ? ”
Please ! ) , and imposing limits on the number of collectives that may operate in a community .
( Just imagine if drug pharmacies like Walgreens were forced to endure similar restrictions . )
That is the reality in California , and that is why polls indicate broader public support for the legalized use of medical cannabis now than when Proposition 215 first passed in 1996 .
Of course , those who oppose Proposition 1 in Michigan and who condone arresting and jailing patients for their use of cannabis are well aware of these facts — just as they are aware that Prop.
1 , like the medical cannabis laws in eleven other states , does not even allow for the creation of licensed cannabis dispensaries .
Yet in order to continue to prosecute and cage their fellow citizens , regardless of whether they are healthy or dying , our opponents rely on lying and fear - mongering — the same tactics that brought us marijuana prohibition in the first place .
Will the scare - tactics work ?
They have n’t in past .
( Of the ten state medi - pot initiative campaigns since 1996 , nine have passed . )
Unfortunately , like in Massachusetts , the negative campaigning is clearly having an effect — with recent polls indicating a drop in public support from an estimated 66 percent to 54 percent .
Believe me , as one who bases his written words on science and facts , it pains me to say that .
That said , like in Massachusetts , I am confident that a majority of Michigan ’s voters will see through our opponents cynical and dishonest smoke - screen come Election Day , and will choose to make the ‘ land of 11,000 lakes ’ the thirteenth state to authorize the legal use of medical cannabis .
Why do I say this ?
I say this because for the first time in recent memory it ’s become apparent that our opponents are desperate .
They are desperate because they know they are losing — state by state , community by community , and voter by voter .
As Mahatma Gandhi said , “ First they ignore you , then they ridicule you , then they fight you , then you win . ”
Well , it ’s obvious that we are no longer being ignored , nor are we being ridiculed .
Finally , with their backs up against the wall , the defenders of prohibition have decided to fight .
And we all know what comes next .

Ben Bernanke apparently wants four more years as Federal Reserve Chairman .
At least that 's a reasonable conclusion after Mr. Bernanke all but submitted his job application to Barack Obama yesterday by endorsing the Democratic version of fiscal " stimulus . "
While the Fed chief said any stimulus should be " well targeted , " even a general endorsement amounts to a political green light .
Mr. Bernanke certainly knows that Mr. Obama and Democrats on Capitol Hill are talking about some $ 300 billion in new " stimulus " spending , while ...

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Carl , a Florida native now living overseas , is afraid to move back to the United States .
That 's because he can't afford to pay his student loans .
Carl ( who does n't want his last name used ) stopped making his $ 450 monthly payments after his family incurred some unexpected medical expenses , and his $ 55,000 private loans went into default .
That 's when the phone calls from debt collectors started , and Carl decided not to come back .
" It was made clear that if I ever came home , I 'm screwed , " says Carl .
Today , he estimates his private loans are more than $ 70,000 .
Though he hopes to move home one day , for now , staying abroad is the only option he can see .
" If it means I have to live in exile from friends and family ... well , that 's the breaks .
So be it .
But I wo n't put my family in a situation where they are afraid , " he says .
While most Americans are burdened with debt of some kind , student loan repayment can be a particularly scary prospect for young people struggling to start a career .
Payments are often higher than expected , and the loans can't easily be discharged .
Added pressure from debt collectors causes some grads to flee their loans by fleeing the country .
" These are people new to borrowing and they did n't understand what they were getting into , " says Mark Kantrowitz of Finaid.org , an online student loan information Web site .
" It 's a very sorry situation that it comes to students feeling they have no option than to leave the country , " he says .
" It 's a sign the system is broken . "
To date , there is about $ 60 billion in defaulted student loan debt according to Chris Lang of the New York - based debt collection agency , ConServe .
But while skipping town to avoid paying student loans is n't very common - Lang estimates that only about 2 % to 4 % of delinquent student loan debt is owed from students abroad - for some , it seems like the only way out .
International addresses make it more difficult to find people , and collection companies would usually need to hire an international counsel or a third party collector to recoup the debt , cutting into their profits and reducing their incentive to go after a debtor .
" It increases our expenses to go overseas , " says Justin Berg of American Profit Recovery , a debt collection agency in Massachusetts .
" Our revenues are cut by more than half , " he says .
Very little relief
Chris left the country to help pay his debt , not to avoid it .
But when that did n't work out , he saw his foreign address as the only way to escape .
Chris ( who does n't want his last name used ) graduated with about $ 160,000 in student loan debt with a master 's degree in music .
" At the time I thought I could handle it .
I thought the most I 'd be paying was $ 600 a month , " he says .
But his payments were $ 2,400 a month .
So Chris started looking for jobs overseas .
He thought he'd be able to earn more and pay off his loans .
But it did n't turn out that way .
His salary was even less than what he was making back home .
He realized there was no way he could make his payments , so he changed his address .
" They think I 'm living somewhere in Arizona , " he says .
His last payment was a year and a half ago .
" I am upset at myself .
I could have gone to a cheaper school , " Chris says .
" But I 'm most angry at the fact that for anyone who has debt that 's not student loan debt , there 's relief .
You can get into $ 150,000 worth of credit card debt and you can declare bankruptcy and you can go on with your life .
But with student loans , you 're being punished for being a better person . "
While getting student loans discharged through bankruptcy is no easy task , that does n't mean it can't be done .
" There 's a mythology that private student loans can't be discharged .
But sometimes they can and should , " says Kantrowitz .
To get your student loans discharged , you must file an undue hardship petition .
To qualify , you have to satisfy three conditions :
First , you must not be able to repay your student loan and also maintain a minimal standard of living based on your income and your expenses .
Second , your situation must likely persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the loan .
Finally , you must have made good faith efforts to repay the loans .
In about half of cases of people who do file for this hardship petition , debt will be partially or totally discharged , says Kantrowitz .
Lifting the burden
If you 're having trouble paying your student loans there are steps you can take , according to Kantrowitz .
If your income is n't sufficient to repay a federal loan , you can apply for an economic hardship deferment or forbearance which would suspend or reduce your monthly payments .
To find out if you qualify for these programs , check out the hardship calculator at http://www.finaid.org/.
If your money problems are longer term - say your career path does n't pay well - there are some alternate payment plans that you can explore .
An extended repayment plan could lower your payments .
But it also increases the life of your loan so you 'll wind up paying more in the long run .
If you have federal loans through the Direct Loan program , you may qualify for an income contingent repayment plan .
In this case your payments are based on your income and your debt load .
These steps must be taken before you default on your loan .
If your loan is already in default , you wo n't qualify for deferments or forbearances .
If you can't resolve an issue , contact the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman at http://www.ombudsman.ed.gov/ or call 1-877-557-2575 .
If you have defaulted on a federal loan , you can rehabilitate yourself .
It will require you to make nine to twelve full payments of some agreed - upon amounts within a certain time period to the Department of Education .
For more information on this , contact the Department at 1-800-621-3115 .
And there 's another way to get help if you 're buried under student loans .
Talk to a non-profit counselor .
The counseling session should be free of charge .
Make sure you ask if the agency works with student loans .
And in addition to helping you with your student loan payments , these agencies can work with you to manage your spending and your budget .
If you are put on a managed debt program , there is typically a small fee .
To find a non-profit credit counselor in your area go to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling at www.nfcc.org.
Are you saddled with huge student loan payments you can't afford ?
Have you defaulted on your loans and evaded creditors ?

John McCain would pay for his health plan with major reductions to Medicare and Medicaid , a top aide said , in a move that independent analysts estimate could result in cuts of $ 1.3 trillion over 10 years to the government programs .
The Republican presidential nominee has said little about the proposed cuts , but they are needed to keep his health - care plan " budget neutral , " as he has promised .
The McCain campaign has n't given a specific figure for the cuts , but did n't dispute the analysts ' estimate .

Courteney
Cox shows off her natural beauty - and her cleavage
After admitting she used Botox and hated it , Courteney Cox is embracing the ageing process .
The 44 - year - old actress looked years younger - and surprisingly busty - as she dined out at her favourite Los Angeles restaurant Il Sole .
The former Friends star showed off her cleavage in a low - cut white t- shirt as she joined husband David Arquette and friend Jennifer Meyer - the wife of Tobey Maguire - at the Italian eaterie .
Busting out : Courteney Cox shows off her impressive cleavage outside Il Sole
Earlier this week , Cox admitted she tried the face - freezing injection and hated its muscle - paralysing effects
Cox said losing her ability to make facial expressions seriously hampered her acting skills .
She told Marie Claire magazine : ' Botox ?
I think it 's fantastic and also horrible .
' I mean , they 've come up with this stuff that can make you not look angry .
But you have to use it sparingly .
' I went to this doctor once and he was like , " Oh , let me do it just here and here and here . "
And I was miserable .
' I mean , I 'm an actor , I 've got to be able to move my face .
Ageing naturally : Cox , pictured at the Elle magazine Women of Hollywood tribute on Monday , was unhappy with the effects of Botox
' When people start messing with their foreheads and can't lift their eyebrows , that 's weird .
' It 's not that I have n't tried Botox - but I hated it . '
Fortunately for Cox , she has found a down - to - earth husband in actor David Arquette , who is happy for his stunning wife to embrace the ageing process .
She enthused : ' He loves the ageing process .
He thinks it 's beautiful . '
Despite previous reports of trouble in their nine - year marriage , Cox insisted she was more in love than ever .
She explained : ' It 's weird , because I 'm so in love with David right now .
' I'm starting to really appreciate how ' there ' he is for me .
' But in any relationship , there are times that you 're disconnected .
' You can see how relationships end if you do n't work through it . '
The couple have a four - year - old daughter , Coco .
' So in love ' : Courteney is still crazy about husband David Arquette after nine years of marriage
The Tibet “ Autonomous Region ” of China borders , clockwise , Nepal , Uttarakhand state , Himachal Pradesh state , Indian Jammu and Kashmir , Aksai Chin ( an almost uninhabited area in northern Kashmir claimed by both India and China : see this post ) , the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China , Qinghai province , Sichuan province , Yunnan province , Burma , Arunachal Pradesh state , Bhutan , and Sikkim state .
Aksai Chin is shown in pale green here , but so is the other area China disputes with India , northern Arunachal Pradesh , which China calls South Tibet .
The Brahmaputra , Ganges , Indus , Yellow River , Yangtze , Mekong and Salween have their sources on the Tibetan plateau .
The Brahmaputra , also called Tsangpo - Brahmaputra , begins its journey in southwestern Tibet as the Yarlung Zangbo , and flows across southern Tibet , breaking through the Himalayas in great gorges and into Arunachal Pradesh , where it is called Dihang .
It flows southwest through the Assam Valley as the Brahmaputra and south through Bangladesh as the Jamuna .
There it merges with the Ganges at the head of the world ’s largest delta , the Sunderbans .
Calcutta is on a tributary of this system , the Hooghly , and part of the Sundarbans is in India .
The Ganges rises in Uttarakhand , not technically in Tibet , flows southeast through India , and joins the Brahmaputra in Bangladesh .
Its major tributary , the Jumna or Yamuna ( not to be confused with Jamuna ) , also rises in Uttarakhand , west of the Ganges , and joins the Ganges at Allahabad .
The Indus rises in Tibet , south of Aksai Chin , and flows into Indian Kashmir , and thence into Pakistan .
The Yellow River ( Huang He ) rises in Qinghai , not technically in Tibet , and flows east through China , emptying into the Bohai Sea .
The Yangtze rises in Qinghai , enters China in Sichuan , flows into Yunnan , and continues east until it reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai .
The Mekong rises in Tibet and flows through Yunnan , Burma , Thailand , Laos , Cambodia and Vietnam .
The Salween rises in Tibet , and flows south into Yunnan and then into Burma ( with a short passage in Thailand ) , where it enters the Andaman Sea .
The Ayeyarwady or Irrawaddy , not shown on the map below , flows entirely within Burma , and west of the Salween .
Its source , in Kachin state , is close to Tibet .

The head of the Canadian Olympic Committee says Canadians who are upset with their country 's lack of medal production at the Beijing Games should calm down and relax .
The fact Canadians have n't won a medal in the pool has sparked a heated debate among readers of CBC.
ca / olympics who are frustrated that Canada has been shut out so far in the Games that are now in Day 5 .
Chris Rudge , chief executive officer of the COC , told CBC's Heather Hiscox in China that " this is the time to support the athletes who are there . "
He says that after the Games are over , Aug. 24 , that all aspects of the entire Canadian contingent 's performance will be examined .
One CBC reader wrote " we are on the road to mediocrity , " while another said " [ it 's ] sad when you see these third world Countries at least winning a medal or two and a rich , large country like Canada has won ' squat . ' "
Rudge says more money is coming into the system in the next few months .
He also wishes Canadians would be more vocal about the Olympic team when the Games are n't being held .
He says that would help create the atmosphere needed to generate more funds .
Before the Games , the COC predicted Canada would be in the top 16 for medals .
He stands by that prediction , and says " you do n't throw in the towel yet . "
Silken Laumann , who won three Olympic medals in rowing for Canada , appreciates how fans feel , but she also echoed Rudge 's sentiment about getting behind the Canadian athletes competing in China .
" Canadians are expecting medals , we like to know we 're doing as well as countries like Australia , but I think we need to take a step back , " Laumann told CBC Newsworld .
" For instance , looking at what 's going on in the pool , sure we have n't won a medal yet , but there are a lot of our swimmers who have set Canadian records , who have had personal - best performances , and that 's worth something , and I think we should be proud of how our athletes are doing . "
I hate to say this , but looking at the plan as leaked , I have to say no deal .
Not unless Treasury explains , very clearly , why this is supposed to work , other than through having taxpayers pay premium prices for lousy assets .
As I posted earlier today , it seems all too likely that a “ fair price ” for mortgage - related assets will still leave much of the financial sector in trouble .
And there ’s nothing at all in the draft that says what happens next ; although I do notice that there ’s nothing in the plan requiring Treasury to pay a fair market price .
So is the plan to pay premium prices to the most troubled institutions ?
Or is the hope that restoring liquidity will magically make the problem go away ?
Here ’s the thing : historically , financial system rescues have involved seizing the troubled institutions and guaranteeing their debts ; only after that did the government try to repackage and sell their assets .
The feds took over S&Ls first , protecting their depositors , then transferred their bad assets to the RTC .
The Swedes took over troubled banks , again protecting their depositors , before transferring their assets to their equivalent institutions .
The Treasury plan , by contrast , looks like an attempt to restore confidence in the financial system — that is , convince creditors of troubled institutions that everything ’s OK — simply by buying assets off these institutions .
This will only work if the prices
Treasury pays are much higher than current market prices ; that , in turn , can only be true either if this is mainly a liquidity problem — which seems doubtful — or if Treasury is going to be paying a huge premium , in effect throwing taxpayers ’ money at the financial world .
And there ’s no quid pro quo here — nothing that gives taxpayers a stake in the upside , nothing that ensures that the money is used to stabilize the system rather than reward the undeserving .
I hope I ’m wrong about this .
But let me say it again : Treasury needs to explain why this is supposed to work — not try to panic Congress into giving it a blank check .
Otherwise , no deal .
CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) - A Japanese businessman who trained for a 10 - day flight aboard the International Space Station has sued to get his money back , claiming he was defrauded of $ 21 million by the U.S. firm that arranged the venture .
Space tourist Daisuke Enomoto of Japan , who is due to take off from the Baikonur cosmodrome this September , tries on his space suit at an undisclosed factory outside Moscow July 5 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Sergei Remezov
Daisuke Enomoto , 37 , had completed training in Russia and planned to fly to the station aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule in September 2006 .
But he was pulled from the three - member crew a month before liftoff , opening a seat for Dallas businesswoman Anousheh Ansari to fly instead .
Enomoto filed suit last month in the U.S. District Court in Alexandria , Virginia , against Virginia - based Space Adventures , the space tourism company that plans to send its sixth paying passenger to orbit next month .
In the lawsuit , which was posted on the Internet by Wired magazine , Enomoto says the medical condition cited for his removal from the crew -- kidney stones -- was well known by Space Adventures and the doctors who had monitored his health and suitability for space flight throughout the training .
Enomoto alleges he was pulled from the flight so Ansari , who had invested in Space Adventures , could fly instead .
Ansari also was the primary backer of the $ 10 million Ansari X Prize awarded in 2004 for the first privately developed manned space flight .
In a response filed on Wednesday , Space Adventures ’ lawyers said Enomoto ’s contract did not entitle him to a refund if he became medically disqualified .
“ That was a risk he undertook , ” they said .
“ Even if Enomoto could prove his unlikely claim that he was somehow misled , he suffered absolutely no damage from any misstatement because ... the cause of his failure to fly was medical disqualification , not lack of authority . ”
Enomoto claims Space Adventures persuaded Russian space officials to disqualify him under the pretense of medical issues .
“ Mr. Enomoto ’s ‘ medical condition ’ was no worse than it was just two weeks prior to his disqualification , when he was medically cleared by the Russian Government Medical Commission , ” the lawsuit said .
Nor was his health any worse than it was seven weeks before his disqualification , when Enomoto was cleared by the group of five doctors charged with approving private citizen travel to the space station .
They included doctors from the Russian Federal Space Agency , the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration , and other space station partners , the lawsuit said .
The complaint also alleges that Space Adventures promised Enomoto he could conduct a spacewalk while aboard the station and collected $ 7 million in deposits , though the firm never had an agreement with Russia for the outing .
In all , Enomoto paid Space Adventures $ 21 million over two years , none of which has been refunded , the suit claims .
Sadly , President Bush has allowed himself and the Department of Justice to be manipulated by the RIAA and MPAA .
On October 13th , he signed the PRO - IP bill into law , ignoring calls to veto it and pretty clear indications that the bill was promoted using completely fabricated statistics .
Any law described as " music to the ears " by the head of the RIAA is going to be trouble .
But just because the bill has passed does n't mean this issue is dead .
First , we should thank the representatives who stood up against the corrupting influence of the media companies and voted against the bill .
Public Knowledge has provided an easy way to do this .
Please edit the letter text there to remove the term " intellectual property " before you send it -- accepting that as the category for debate is accepting framing that is designed to obscure the issues and serve the interests of those behind bills like this one .
Second , we should keep the reps who voted for the bill on the hook .
Let them know that we are on to them and will be continually exposing their corrupt votes .
So , if your representative voted for the bill , look up what contributions they received from the entertainment industry and confront them with this information .
Third , the vote in the Senate was unanimous .
Let your senators know that you are very disappointed in their position and expect an explanation .
You can contact your representative at https://forms.house.gov/wyr/welcome.shtml, and your senators at http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm.
To those who supported the bill , you might say something like :
Be that as it may , the front - page coverage by The New York Times , a newspaper whose core audience consists of people who positively adore the witty foreign - films - lite of the type Allen once offered , was a watershed moment : in a sense , a long - delayed eulogy over a corpse that had been awaiting interment for years .
Nothing if not resilient , the feisty auteur trundled off to Britain in the hope of reviving his career .
The result was a glum trio of daft London films : the sycophantic , culturally benighted Match Point , the paleolithic murder mystery Scoop , and the lugubrious drama Cassandra 's Dream .
Allen , who had complained vociferously about Hollywood 's crass obsession with big - budget films , was hoping that his diehard European fans would flock to his latest offerings , thereby shaming his compatriots back home into revising their opinion of his recent work .
This tactic paid off with Match Point , a deceptively repugnant film that did shockingly well at the box office considering its shallow premise and asinine plot , but Scoop was not a hit .
The water having run dry at this particular oasis , Allen then moseyed along to Spain , where he began shooting Vicky Cristina Barcelona , which debuted at the Cannes Film Festival .
The cast includes Penelope Cruz , Javier Bardem and Scarlett Johansson , very possibly the only actor on the planet more annoying on screen than Allen himself .
Americans can be blamed for many things , but the perpetuation of Allen 's zombie - like career is one atrocity for which we refuse to be held accountable .
It is Europeans who are providing much of the money for these projects , Europeans who are welcoming the director to their communities , Europeans who are marching through the turnstiles in support of Allen 's interchangeably neurasthenic films .
Europeans are the ones paying the freight for Allen 's cavalcade of duds .
To those of us who have watched Allen 's two - decade decline into that cataleptic Eric Claptonesque state where an artist is revered as a god , but not by anyone who originally worshipped in his church , Allen 's Grand Tour of Europe is baffling .
I have seen Match Point three times now and cannot keep a straight face during Allen 's perplexing and in many ways offensive attempt to make a Mike Leigh movie .
The film is ostensibly about class : a penniless Irish former tennis star ( Jonathan Rhys Meyers ) is determined to rise above his station by reading Dostoevsky , attending La Traviata and Damien Hirst shows and marrying Emily Mortimer .
Unfortunately , Allen gets it all wrong : when you shoot a Mike Leigh movie , you are n't supposed to make Mummy and Papa and their grouse - shooting twit progeny the heroes .
And when you repeatedly show Mummy and Papa and Twitty and Tweedledum at Covent Garden going into raptures over Verdi , you can't then have Mortimer salivating at the prospect of attending Andrew Lloyd Webber 's The Woman In White .
It makes you look like an idiot .
Here , as in so many other Allen films , art , music and literature serve a phony , ornamental function ; you never really believe that any of his characters actually enjoy abstract art or have read Aristophanes .
It 's just an excuse for the college drop - out Allen to show off .
" Look , Mom !
I know who Modigliani is !
See , I can pronounce the word ' Proust ' . "
Match Point is like a dozen other Allen movies : Low - Fat High Culture ; Bergman for Beginners .
In the follow - up Allen made the disastrous decision to cast Johansson in the role that had previously been played by Louise Lasser , Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow - actresses who can actually act .
He made the equally disastrous decision to cast himself as her sidekick , a klutzy third - rate magician , after officially taking the hint and stopping casting himself opposite nubile young women in romantic situations where he got to paw them for a few hours .
Scoop has Allen and Johansson sharing the screen together most of the time , with the dapper male lead Hugh Jackman twiddling his thumbs off - camera .
In other words , Allen - who clearly has no idea how cadaverously gross he looks on screen at this juncture , who simply cannot accept that he is not the second coming of Groucho Marx - was back to his old tricks as The Dirty Old Man with a Heart of Gold .
The laughs seeming to have dried up , Allen next cranked out Cassandra 's Dream , a grim tale about two brothers who decide to begin second careers and become the most inept hitmen in the history of south London .
The film is essentially a meditation on the meaning of life , which raises the interesting question of why it is set in south London .
There is no law against making movies about amateur working - class hitmen , just as there is no law against making movies about shotgun - toting tennis stars masquerading as Notting Hill burglars who quote Sophocles to spectral apparitions .
But if people on that side of the Atlantic are going to keep funding this hokum , they 're going to have to accept the responsibility .
My greatest worry is that Allen will keep this European tour going for the rest of his life , dropping in on one gullible country after another , making a couple of locally financed films and then blowing town before the stench hits .
I can see a Zagreb - based Woody Allen film where the director plays a washed - up Serb stand - up comic whose career is suddenly revived by meeting a perky Bosnian - American exchange student played by Thandie Newton .
I can see a Polish Woody Allen film about a washed - up klezmer player whose career is revived by a chance encounter with a Santa Cruz forensic scientist ( Tina Fey ) investigating Chopin 's suspicious death .
I can see a Macedonian film about a social - climbing rag merchant who keeps getting visits from a ghost who claims to be Alexander the Great , but is actually a delusional Second Avenue deli counter man named Herbie Schlegel .
I can see this thing going on and on , year after year , forever .
Do n't blame us , Europe .
We warned you .

an optimizing compiler ,
a number of source code and compiler related tools ,
a set of standard library modules , and
a reference manual .
The flexible nature of the GSA code representation allows for efficient code improving transformations on the intermediate code .
Due to its special properties , it is quite easy to implement optimizations like constant propagation , copy propagation , procedure inlining , or common subexpression elimination , just to name a few .
The compiler front - end translates directly to GSA .
It is retargetable , that is , it can be adjusted to suit different target platforms .
A prototype back - end exists , using ANSI -C as the target language .
This back - end is used by OO2C , the generic OOC compiler for the Unix platform .
OO2C can use two add - on packages to expand its own capabilities : Hans - J. Boehm 's conservative garbage collector gc and GNU libtool .

2008 contests for White House and Congress add up to the most expensive
U.S. election in history
WASHINGTON — The 2008 election for president and Congress is not only one of the most closely watched U.S. elections in years ; it ’s also the most expensive in history .
The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics estimates that more than $ 5.3 billion will go toward financing the federal contests upcoming on Nov. 4 .
The presidential race alone will cost nearly $ 2.4 billion , the Center predicts .
Already the candidates alone have raised more than $ 1.5 billion since the election cycle ’s start in January 2007 .
This is the first time that candidates for the White House have raised and spent more than $ 1 billion , and this year ’s total is on track to nearly double candidate fundraising in 2004 and triple 2000 .
Weeks before Election Day , the 2008 cycle has already surpassed $ 4.5 billion , $ 300 million more than the $ 4.2 billion that had been raised by the conclusion of the 2004 cycle .
The overall estimated cost of the 2008 election would represent a 27 percent increase over the 2004 cycle .
Looking at each party ’s growth , however , Democrats will have collected 52 percent more money for their congressional and presidential efforts by the end of this election cycle , compared to four years ago .
Republican fundraising growth , however , has been a meager 2 percent since ’04 .
“ This election will blow through historic records on a number of counts , ” said Sheila Krumholz , executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics .
“ We ’ve marveled for years at the cost of elections , especially during presidential cycles , but this one is the first to cross the $ 5 billion mark .
At the same time , it ’s encouraging to see more Americans than ever participating and offsetting the traditional dominance of special interests and wealthy donors who might be expecting payback .
The only payback the small donor is expecting is a victory on Election Day .
And that ’s healthier for our democracy . ”
The Center , which operates the award - winning website OpenSecrets.org and has been tracking the money financing federal elections since the 1980s , based its prediction of the 2008 election ’s overall cost on fundraising reported to the Federal Election Commission as of Oct. 21 by all candidates for federal office , political party committees and federally focused 527 committees .
This conservative estimate also includes independent expenditures on advertising and get - out - the - vote efforts by outside political action committees to support and oppose candidates , and it includes public funding for presidential candidates and estimated fundraising by the host committees of the major parties ’ summer nominating conventions .
INDUSTRIES , COMPANIES SHOW THEIR STRIPES
The money paying for the election — the home - stretch advertising , voter mobilization and other campaigning — is coming largely from the same industries and interests that have funded past elections .
Topping the Center ’s 2008 list of big donors are contributors who list their occupation as “ retired ” ( accounting for at least $ 204.3 million ) , lawyers and law firms ( $ 180.9 million ) , the securities / investment industry ( $ 122.8 million ) , real estate ( $ 105.5 million ) and health professionals ( $ 69.6 million ) .
Business interests account for about 72 percent of all contributions , with ideological , labor and other interests making up the rest .
“ Among the big - giving industries , the Democrats ’ advantage is smaller than in the overall election , ” Krumholz said .
“ While lawyers remain strongly in the Democrats ’ camp and Wall Street favors them , too , some of the other top givers — retirees , real estate and doctors and other health professionals — are mostly split at this point between the two major parties .
Democrats have solid support in a number of traditionally supportive industries , of course , including the entertainment industry and among college professors and other educators , but Republicans can count on contributions from the oil and gas , pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries . ”
Viewed more broadly , the finance , insurance and real estate sector once again dominates in political contributions , exceeding $ 373 million in the Center ’s most recent analysis .
Democrats have a slight edge with the finance sector .
The top donors this cycle , based on contributions from their PACs and employees , is dominated by companies in the financial sector , and most of them favor Democrats .
After ActBlue , the online organization that directs individual contributions to progressive candidates , the top corporation in 2008 is once again Goldman Sachs .
The global investment bank ’s employees and PAC have contributed at least $ 5 million to the ’08 campaign .
Citigroup is next at $ 4.2 million , followed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. at $ 4.1 million .
The biggest - giving industry association is the National Association of Realtors , which has given nearly $ 3.2 million .
“ Wall Street and other industries in the financial sector do n’t seem to have tightened their belts — no signs of recession in their political giving .
Of course , their contributions may be part of a strategy to continue securing government assistance for their businesses as the economy heads further south , ” Krumholz said .
INCUMBENTS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE THE ADVANTAGE
All candidates for House and Senate have raised more than $ 1.5 billion , based on data available from the FEC on Oct. 21 .
Incumbents running for re-election continue to have a huge advantage , the Center found .
The average Senate incumbent has raised $ 8.3 million ( which includes money raised since the start of the six - year term in 2003 ) to the average challenger ’s $ 850,000 , an advantage of nearly 10 to 1 .
For candidates looking to claim an open Senate seat , the average is about $ 1.6 million and varies widely depending on the state ’s size and advertising costs .
The incumbent ’s advantage in the House is also lop - sided .
Members of the House have raised approximately $ 1.2 million through the 3rd Quarter of this year , on average , while their opponents have raised an average of $ 286,000 — a 4 to 1 edge for the seat - holder .
Open - seat candidates have collected about $ 497,000 .
Candidates for Congress in 2008 have spent nearly $ 95 million from their own pockets to get elected .
“ You ca n’t win a seat in Congress without being personally wealthy or knowing a lot of wealthy people who are willing to back you with their money , ” Krumholz said .
“ With Election Day coming up , it ’s important for candidates and citizens to remember that you ca n’t win without votes , either . ”
Democrats have outraised Republicans consistently throughout this election cycle , and overall it appears Democrats will end up collecting 59 percent of the money raised in ’08 .
In 2004 , there was a nearly even split between the parties .
“ The Democrats ’ takeover of Congress in the 2006 election quickly shifted the fundraising advantage to their side .
Money follows power , ” Krumholz said .
“ The Republican Party ’s longtime lead in the campaign finance game has been erased in this election , due to the Democrats ’ control of the congressional agenda and their side ’s more skillful use of online fundraising , especially in the presidential race . ”
If history is any guide , most congressional incumbents should expect to return to Washington next year .
In the last five elections , since the 1998 contests , an average of 97 percent of House incumbents have won re-election , as have 86 percent of senators .
Even two years ago , when control of Congress shifted to the Democratic Party , 94 percent of House members still won re-election , as did 79 percent of senators .
AFTER A LOUD DEBUT IN 2004 , 527s DIAL DOWN
The issue - advocacy groups known as 527 committees , which introduced themselves to voters in 2004 , appear to be playing a smaller role in 2008 .
Overall , 527s have reported $ 424 million in fundraising to the Internal Revenue Service in 2007 - 2008 , a 12 percent decrease from the equivalent point during the ’ 04 election .
The drop has been even steeper among 527s focused on federal races and issues : down 47 percent .
527s focused on nonfederal races and issues , however , have grown 19 percent over four years ago .
“ Fines of 527s by the FEC , court rulings and discouragement by the candidates at the top of the ticket seem to have made these organizations decide it ’s better to be safe than sorry , ” Krumholz said .
“ While some so - called issue groups have shifted to other arenas of political spending that are harder to track , other groups and wealthy individual donors are either playing politics through limited dollars funded through political committees , or they ’re sitting this one out . ”
INDIVIDUAL DONORS STILL REPRESENT TINY SLICE OF AMERICA
The Center has identified more than 1 million individuals who have made a contribution of more than $ 200 to federal candidates , parties and PACs , close to the 1.1 million individuals who showed up in FEC records in 2004 .
The total for 2008 ( and for 2004 , for that matter ) is far higher , however , as only contributors giving more than $ 200 must be disclosed by name to the FEC .
In 2008 , the number of itemized individuals still represents less than one - half of one percent of all adult Americans .
Analysts have estimated that , historically , no more than 4 percent of Americans make a contribution of any size to federal politics .
By comparison , about 10 percent of American taxpayers elect to dedicate $ 3 of their annual tax bill to the presidential public financing system .
“ Many new donors have been brought into the fold in 2008 , but participation in this element of our democracy is n’t representative of the electorate or the nation as a whole , ” Krumholz said .
“ The typical campaign contributor showing up in government data is still typically a lawyer , a Wall Street banker , a doctor , a CEO or a college professor at a major university .
For all their influence at the polls , guys like Joe the Plumber are n’t typically campaign contributors .
You ’re more likely to see John the Bond Trader bankrolling these campaigns . ”

Jeff Frederick , who took over as chairman of the Virginia Republican Party after the convention decision , told me : “ People statewide sometimes forget this  Tom Davis has been a team player .
Although he ’s sometimes in intense battles , when it comes time to close ranks , he closes ranks and fights for the team . ”
It may be that fighting for the team is what has taken such a toll on Davis .
The cost of loyalty  reconciling his own centrist , pragmatic instincts with the demands of a conservative party  seems to weigh on him .
“ You ’ve got to , quote , ‘ play the game , ’ ” he told me .
“ If you want advancement , you ’ve got to adhere to the party lines on a lot of issues . ”
During one of our conversations last month , I asked him whether it was a mistake to invade Iraq .
He stared at me intently without answering for quite a while , as if trying to decide whether to say what he really thought .
On my tape , it counts out to eight long seconds before he spoke , but at the time , it seemed longer .
Finally , he said softly : “ I do n’t want to go there .
We ’re where we are .
I do n’t think we need to revisit that issue .
Probably the facts speak for themselves . ”
Then he tried to explain his vote .
“ Our vote to go to war was a vote to give permission , ” he said .
“ It was n’t a vote to go to war .
It was n’t a declaration of war .
The president was trying to get inspectors in there and he said , ‘ Look , we ’re going to do this the hard way or the easy way . ’
And if you do n’t stand behind the president in those circumstances , you kind of pull the rug out from under him .
You know what I ’m saying ?
Now , if you knew it was going to come out this way , that ’s a different answer . ”
At the same time , he seems angry his team did not stand behind him , particularly on his effort to give the District of Columbia a full - fledged member of the House .
Davis tried to address longstanding Republican objections by balancing what would be a new safe Democratic seat by adding a safe Republican seat in Utah at the same time .
It passed the House , but Republicans filibustered in the Senate .
And he took it as a sign .
“ The party leadership , ” he said , “ has kind of signaled that since I was not a hard - core social conservative , any advancement was going to be over them , not with them . ”
For a smart , connected guy like Davis , doors will open .
After 29 years in public office , he said he wants to earn money before retirement , spend time with his wife and go to more baseball games .
He has started teaching .
I went to one of his first classes at George Mason University .
There was the boyish enthusiast I remembered from the 1980s , lecturing on cultural politics of the South and rattling off election results over the past century .
At one point , discussing voting rights for felons , he allowed that not all felons are Democrats .
“ There are a lot of Republican felons , ” he said .
“ I served with them in Congress . ”
But the students did not come alive until he threw the discussion open for questions and they asked about Sarah Palin .
“ The base hated McCain ; it was a marriage of convenience , ” Davis told them .
“ What are the negatives ?
What about her résumé ?
I got through it in about 10 seconds .
Does that hurt ?
He ’s the guy running on experience  ‘ 3 a.m. , I ’m the guy . ’
And she ’s a heartbeat away . ”
On the other hand , Davis said , Republicans can argue they would make history just as Democrats would with Barack Obama .
“ She helps on the change issue , does n’t she ?
She ’s sure change , is n’t she ? ”

Your difficult boss , customer , prospect , voter , student … probably not stupid , probably just uninformed .
There ’s a huge difference .
Every person makes decisions based on their worldview and the data at hand .
If two people have the same worldview and the same data , they ’ll make the same decision , every time ( unless they ’re stupid . )
So , there are plenty of times where a lack of information leads to a bad decision .
Plenty of times where an out of sync worldview leads to an out of sync decision .
When the board of directors embraces a fading old media model instead of embracing a strategy that leads to rapid growth , it ’s probably because each of them started with a worldview about the way things worked and were going to work .
Add to that little direct experience , and it ’s no wonder they decided what they did .
You would too if you were given the same resources to begin with .
Changing worldviews is very difficult and requires quite a bit of will .
Changing the data at hand is a lot easier , and that ’s where marketing can really help .
If you , as a marketer , can package data in a way that people with a certain worldview can accept , you move the conversation forward far more quickly than if you merely dismiss the non-customers or the doubters as stupid .
In my experience , a closed - minded worldview ( " I ca n’t read that book , I disagree with it " ) is the most difficult hurdle to overcome .
But a closed - minded worldview does n’t mean you ’re stupid , it means that you are selling yourself and your colleagues and your community short .
The easiest way to grow is to sell to people who share a worldview that endorses your position .
The most effective way to grow bigger than that is to inform those that disagree with your position –more data in a palatable form .
And , unfortunately , it turns out that the best way to change the world is to open the closed - minded .
Yep -- there it is .

The shouty CNBC ( poor ) stock picker — who as recently as last November was trumpeting " 10 Reasons to Be Bullish " ( " 1 .

But four of the congressional leaders present at the meeting say that ’s not true ; they never encouraged the White House to sidestep the objections of the attorney general and continue the program without his approval .
Investigators are skeptical of the notes because Gonzales did not write them until days after the meeting with the congressional leaders , and he wrote them after both Bush and Gonzales had together signed a reauthorization of the surveillance program .
Gonzales , who was White House counsel at the time he met with the congressional leaders , has told investigators working for the Justice Department ’s Office of the Inspector General that President Bush personally directed him to write the notes so that he could “ memorialize ” what the legislators had told him , according to a report made public by the Inspector General ’s Office on September 2 and sources close to the investigation .
It is unclear whether it was before the March 10 meeting that Bush directed Gonzales to write the notes , or after the meeting occurred .
The White House declined to comment for this story .
An attorney for Gonzales , George J. Terwilliger III , himself a former deputy attorney general , declined to comment as well .
The timing of when Bush directed Gonzales to write the notes is important : investigators say the fact that they were written after both the meeting and the reauthorization of the program might indicate that they were written in order to provide an after - the - fact justification for the signing of the reauthorization — and that that timing might have given Gonzales a motive to lie in the notes .
Stanley Brand , a Washington attorney who specializes in representing executive branch officials under investigation , said in an interview : “ Why would you want someone to take notes of a meeting days after the fact ?
If you wanted your notes to stand up , they are going to be more credible if you took them at the meeting itself or shortly after it occurred .
Any reputable lawyer would want to write them as soon as possible . ”
When the notes were written and when the president directed Gonzales to write them is “ extraordinarily relevant and would allow a person to draw a reasonable inference … that something funny was going on . ”
An investigating body , or a jury , Brand said , might “ infer there was a conspiracy afoot to obstruct with or without the participation of the president . ”
Brand adds :
“ The presumption is that the president told Gonzales to write truthful notes … That is the benign interpretation of what happened .
But when Gonzales is claiming to have had members of Congress telling him things they say they never said , a meticulous investigator would want to examine the president ’s role as well . ”
A senior career Justice Department official , not directly involved in the inspector general ’s investigation , comments : “ I think you would want to know whether the president was another person who Gonzales misled … or rather was someone who might have encouraged it .
Because Bush was a direct beneficiary of Gonzales ’s deception , you have to at least consider the possibility that he was a party to it . ”
Regarding the question of timing , the report says :
Gonzales stated that he drafted notes about the meeting in a spiral notebook in his White House Counsel ’s Office within a few days of the meeting , probably on the weekend immediately following the meeting .
Gonzales stated that he wrote the notes in a single sitting except for one line , which he told us he wrote within the next day .
According to the report , Gonzales says he relied upon these notes in preparing for congressional testimony about the surveillance program .
Steven Bradbury , another senior Justice Department official , backs this up .
The report says , “ Gonzales produced the notes to Bradbury and other Department officials ” so they could be used help “ prepare Gonzales for the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 24 , 2007 . ”
Melanomas like those suffered by Sen. John McCain are more lethal than other types of skin cancers because the pigment - producing melanocytes that produce them are actually not skin cells at all .
Though the basal cells and squamous cells that are responsible for the most common types of skin cancer are integral parts of the skin from the beginning , melanocytes are visitors -- nerve cells that are produced in the spinal column during infancy before migrating to the skin .
They are not bound to the skin in the same way that other skin cells are , so when they turn cancerous , they find it very easy to invade a blood vessel or lymph channel and travel to other parts of the body , said Dr. David Peng , director of the Pigmented Lesion Clinic at USC ’s Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center .
And it is not the primary tumor that kills a patient , but the metastasis , said Dr. Glen Justice , director of Orange Coast Memorial Hospital Cancer Center in Fountain Valley .
The key to curing melanomas is to catch and excise them before they have spread , he said .

If the tumors are caught early , surgery cures at least two - thirds of patients , experts said .
After the tumor has metastasized , chemotherapy and radiation may be attempted , but they are generally palliative , not a cure , Justice said .
Each year , about 50,000 malignant melanomas are diagnosed in the United States , and they account for about three - quarters of all skin cancer deaths .
The vast majority of deaths occur in the 20 % of patients whose tumors have already metastasized at the time of diagnosis .
McCain has had at least four melanomas .
The most common risk factors include fair skin , fair eyes , light hair , excessive sunburns and excessive exposure to sunlight -- all of which he has .
Genetics also plays a major role , but McCain has no family history of the disease that would make him more susceptible .
About 14 % to 18 % of melanoma patients have a second , unrelated tumor later , Justice said .
“ If [ McCain ] has had four , he ’ll probably have a fifth , ” he said .
“ But there is a superb chance it will be curable ” because it will most likely be caught early .

The physicians from the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale who cared for McCain emphasized that each of his four melanomas were independent tumors and not recurrences .
Melanocytes sit in the junction between the dermis , the outer layer of the skin , and the epidermis , the middle layer .
In a primary melanoma , pathologists can see the tumor growing out from the junction and be confident that it is not a recurrence .
All four of the melanomas McCain suffered displayed this characteristic , including the large tumor that was removed from his temple in August 2000 .
But buried in the nearly 1,200 pages of medical records released Friday was the fact that there were apparently two melanomas observed at the time , the large one that was the focus of the surgery and a smaller one at the same site that had very little involvement with the dermis .

“ It might have come from underneath , and might have been a micro-metastatic lesion , indicating it was a recurrence from a previous tumor , ” Peng said .
But because McCain has had no recurrence in the eight years since the surgery , Peng added , “ he is doing pretty well . ”

After the beta launch in early September , from the first wave of feedback , we realized that a large number of users were facing plugin compatibility issues in Google Chrome .
These included Adobe Flash videos not playing , as well as various browser performance issues with Adobe Flash and Adobe PDF document loading .
There was even an issue where the browser consumed 100 % CPU when users interacted with plugins .
This is exactly the kind of feedback we are expecting from a beta launch .
We have invested a lot of effort into automating compatibility testing for large number of web pages but there is nothing like actual user feedback .
We are impressed by the user response to the beta and the quality of bug reports filed .
Nothing more motivating than a lot of users waiting for your work . :)
One of the big issues was support for PDF Fast WebView , which is the ability for a webserver to byte serve a PDF document .
This allows a client to request specific byte ranges in the file while skipping pages that are not needed .
This is supported generically by seekable streams specification in NPAPI , which Google Chrome now implements .
This should improve performance with large PDF files or any other content served using Fast WebView .
We had a lot of fun fixing other issues too , and here are the stories behind a couple of them .
YouTube videos stop after six seek attempts :
We received several reports of YouTube videos failing to play .
Many reports indicated that this symptom had something to do with using the slider while playing the video .
However , we did n't have a reliable scenario to reproduce in this in - house .
Darin
Fisher observed that if you move the slider many times , the video stopped playing .
Furthermore , he found out that if the slider was moved exactly six times the video would stop playing .
This was interesting , because Google Chrome uses a maximum of 6 HTTP connections per host .
A quick check of the ' I / O Status ' in about : network revealed that all connections were active .
The question then became one of why the existing connections were n't canceled when the slider was moved .
Darin found that the Flash plugin would return an error when we supplied it data while the slider was moved .
In this case a browser is supposed to cancel the connection and that 's what fixed it .
Google Finance chart dragging :
This report was very interesting , due to the fact that it only occurred on single core machines .

In Google Chrome plugin windows live in a separate plugin process so a plugin has little or no influence on the browser thread , or so we thought .
After some inspection we found out that when a plugin is receiving mouse input , the browser main thread spins with 100 % CPU for sometime .
Now , the twist to the story is that since a plugin window is a child of the browser window , thread inputs of the browser and the plugin are attached .
We started looking at the browser message loop more closely .
Soon we discovered that MsgWaitForMultipleObjects / PeekMessage APIs behaved strangely when thread inputs are attached .
The MsgWaitForMultipleObjects API is typically used to block until an event or a windows message such as an input is available for processing .
In this case , we found that it was returning an indication that an input event was available for processing , while PeekMessage indicated no event was available .
This behavior is probably due to the fact that thread inputs are attached and GetQueueStatus , called internally by MsgWaitForMultipleObjects , returned an indication that input is available in the browser thread , while in reality it was intended for the plugin .
This caused the MsgWaitForMultipleObjects not do its intended function of waiting , and caused the browser thread to spin .
These are just a few examples of bugfixes we 've made to Google Chrome to address performance issues related to plugins .
We continue to look closely at the performance of Google Chrome , both as a whole and in relation to interaction with plugins , to make sure that users are getting the best browsing experience that we can deliver .

The lawyer for a death - row inmate says he is trying to break a " conspiracy of silence " in Texas over whether the district attorney and the judge who presided over his client 's 1990 capital murder trial were having a secret romantic relationship .
The inmate , Charles Dean Hood , is scheduled to be executed on Wednesday .
A Texas judge has ordered a hearing into the issue on Monday morning .
The judge has also ordered the former judge and former district attorney to be prepared to answer questions under oath about their alleged affair and potentially surrender any documentary evidence of a relationship .
The unusual twists and turns in the Hood case are attracting national attention and adding fuel to an already - heated debate over capital punishment in Texas .
Mr. Hood 's lawyer , Gregory Wiercioch , has been trying for months to persuade the Texas judiciary to investigate the alleged secret relationship .
He says former Judge Verla Sue Holland and former Collin County District Attorney Thomas O'Connell may believe that their private relationship did not taint Hood 's trial .
But , he says , it should not be up to a judge and prosecutor to secretly decide such an issue – particularly when the defendant was on trial for his life .
" No attorney knowing [ of this relationship ] would have allowed her to stay on and preside over this trial , " Mr. Wiercioch says .
" I would n't want her presiding over a parking ticket , let alone a capital murder trial . "
The lawyer says others in Collin County , north of Dallas , were aware of the affair but did nothing .
" There was this sense that we are going to keep it secret , and whoever their friends were that socialized with them – and knew of the relationship – those people kept it secret as part of a conspiracy of silence , " Wiercioch says .
Fairness of other trials at stake , too
The allegation has been swirling in Texas legal circles for years , but no formal investigation has been undertaken .
Judge Holland and Mr. O'Connell , both now retired , have declined to discuss the issue .
" It is a matter of Texas courts turning an absolute blind eye to a situation that is in plain sight , " says Steve Hall , director of the Standdown Texas Project , a criminal justice reform group .
" Legal ethicists have been outraged by the facts .
This should not even be a close call . "
If true , the secret affair would violate ethics regulations governing both judges and prosecutors , legal experts say .
In addition , these experts say , it would raise questions not only about the fairness of Hood 's murder trial but also of the fairness of every criminal case charged by O'Connell 's office and tried before Judge Holland during their alleged affair .
According to an affidavit by a former assistant district attorney in O'Connell 's office , the Holland - O'Connell relationship began prior to 1987 and lasted until 1993 .
Hood was convicted and sentenced to death in September 1990 for the shooting deaths of a man and woman in Plano , Texas , in 1989 .
The former assistant , Matthew Goeller , says in the affidavit : " It was common knowledge in the district attorney 's office , and the Collin County Bar , in general , that the district attorney , Mr. Tom O'Connell , and the presiding judge of the 296th District Court , Judge Verla Sue Holland , had a romantic relationship . "
Mr. Goeller is a past president of the county bar association and of the county 's criminal defense lawyers association .
He worked in the district attorney 's office from 1987 to 1996 .
One court rejected the complaint
Holland is n't some back - county judge .
From 1997 to 2001 , she served on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals , the state 's supreme court for criminal matters .
When Wiercioch brought the Holland - O'Connell affair issue to the attention of that court in June , the judges voted 9 to 0 to toss the complaint out as an abuse of the writ of habeas corpus .
The judges said Hood 's lawyers should have raised the matter in an appeal filed in 1999 .
The judges also voted unanimously to allow Hood 's scheduled execution to go forward on June 17 .
The death warrant , however , expired and the execution was postponed until Sept. 10 .
There is no indication in the court 's opinions that the case involved potentially serious allegations against a former colleague .
Holland had served with eight of the nine judges currently on the court .
The opinions are marked " Do not publish . "
The Holland - O'Connell affair allegations arose again in recent weeks after a Texas judge granted Wiercioch 's request for a hearing .
But that judge , Robert Dry , set the hearing date for Sept. 12 – two days after Hood 's scheduled execution .
In a letter to Wiercioch , Judge Dry told the lawyer he had waited too long to raise the issue .
He concluded his letter with a disclosure : " I know Judge Holland and Tom O'Connell .
It is likely that every local judge knows them .
If you are concerned about this , I will consider a motion to recuse . "
Dry later removed himself from the case .
The new judge , Greg Brewer , ordered the Monday hearing .
At the hearing , the judge will consider whether to order Holland and O'Connell to answer Wiercioch 's questions about the alleged affair .
A group of 500 former judges and prosecutors wrote Sept. 2 to Texas Gov. Rick Perry urging him to grant a 30 - day reprieve to allow an investigation into the alleged affair .
" If Mr. Hood 's claim is proven , we believe that his right to an impartial judge and a fair trial was violated and his conviction and sentence were unconstitutionally obtained , " the group writes .
" Under the United States and Texas constitutions , the right to an unbiased judge is fundamental to due process . "
The group includes William Sessions , former FBI director and a former federal judge and US attorney in Texas ; John Gibbons , former third circuit federal appeals court chief judge ; and Patricia Wald , former Washington , D.C. , appeals court judge .
" No court has addressed the merits of Mr. Hood 's allegations or permitted discovery of the facts , " they wrote .
Two days later , Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott announced that his office would be filing a friend - of - the - court brief to urge the judge to " fully review " the affair allegations .

Ok , so what is the consensus ?
Is talking over the cell phone harmful or not really ?
There have been a lot of suggestions that heavy cell phone use has a strong correlation with brain cancer .
However , there is no conclusive evidence to prove this link for sure .
But on the other hand do we really need conclusive evidence about this issue ?
I would think even if there were a small chance that cell phone usage and brain cancer are linked , we need to take the matter seriously .
So why do experts think that cell phones might cause cancer ?
First , cell phones are instruments that receive and emit radiofrequency ( RF ) waves .
These are low frequency radiations that could potentially penetrate body tissues and cause increase in cellular temperature .
Second , traditional cell phone use forces us to hold the instrument in such close proximity to the head ; it concentrates the radiation into the brain .
It is not known for sure if these radiations cause mutations in DNA or ions in the body fluid .
But at the same time , the long - term effects of the radiation on the body have not been studied .
In the 1980 ’s , there was a tremendous increase in the number of cell phone users .
This trend continued over the next decade and into the next millennium .
The number of cellular phone subscribers has more than doubled in the last 8 years ( from 110 million in 2000 to 255 million in 2008 ) .
Cell phones are used so frequently and for such prolonged time periods that it is highly important to conduct studies that throw some light on the cumulative effect of radiation exposure .
Another important area to focus on is children ’s cell phones and their effects .
Since the child ’s nervous system is still growing and developing , the cells are more susceptible to changes in structure .
This increases their risk of cancer .
Some of the other factors that determine cancer risk are size of the cellular phone , strength of connecting signal , proximity to the ear , and frequency of use .
Some people are already genetically predisposed to getting cancer ; and it is especially necessary for them to be extra cautious .
The vice - president of the American Cancer Society advises using headsets while talking over cell phones , using text messaging and using the speaker phone tool to greatly decrease risk .
The general consensus is also that extensive research that needs to be done on the long - term effects .
In today ’s wireless world , human beings are islands in a sea of radiation from every possible type of electronic device — from laptop machines to the complex gaming systems and phones that let you do a million things other than just talk !
In an environment such as this , do we really have to actually talk over the cell phone to tap into the radiations ?
Are n’t we already exposed to them radiations just by being outdoors , or near a satellite dish receiver or a digital recorder ?
We can eat foods that are rich in antioxidants ; we can refrain from smoking and drinking .
But what can we do about the millions of E - toxins flying around us in the form of lethal radiations ?

Sounds like a continuation of Bush ‘s idea of God ’s will in Iraq though I suspect if asked , Bush would also throw in a natural gas pipeline from Alaska as well just for good measure .
Speaking before the Pentecostal church , Palin painted the current war in Iraq as a messianic affair in which the United States could act out the will of the Lord .
“ Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right .
Also , for this country , that our leaders , our national leaders , are sending [ U.S. soldiers ] out on a task that is from God , ” she exhorted the congregants .
“ That ’s what we have to make sure that we ’re praying for , that there is a plan and that that plan is God ’s plan . ”
Religion , however , was not strictly a thread in Palin ’s foreign policy .
It was part of her energy proposals as well .
Just prior to discussing Iraq , Alaska ’s governor asked the audience to pray for another matter — a $ 30 billion national gas pipeline project that she wanted built in the state .
“ I think God ’s will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas line built , so pray for that , ” she said .
Google has just announced the addition of a valuable new feature for the Google Maps API ( the most popular API in our API directory ) : reverse geocoding .
If you are not familiar with geocoding , it is the process of converting an address into a latitude / longitude pair .
Likewise , reverse geocoding is the process of converting a latitude / longitude pair into an address .
Developers using the Google Maps API have had access to geocoding since its release in June 2006 , and geocoding has been integrated with many of the map mashups developed with this API .
Many mapping APIs offer geocoding , but access to reverse geocoding has been quite limited , especially with the Google Maps API .
Prior to the addition of this feature to the API , developers had to rely on third party reverse geocoding APIs and services as well as a JavaScript hack to the Google Maps API .
Pamela
Fox over at the Google Geo Developers
Blog gives a great summary of this new feature :
A much smaller ( but important ) percentage of developers will want to use a reverse geocoder to let their map users know the address for a particular point on the map , perhaps to help them fill in a form faster ( why type when you can click ? ! ) .
For those developers , we 're now pleased to offer address - level reverse geocoding support to both our HTTP service and the GClientGeocoder class .
To make it super easy to use , the interface for reverse geocoding is nearly the same as forward geocoding - the only difference is sending in a lat / lng instead of an address .
Reverse geocoding is available for all 70 countries for which the Google Maps API provides standard geocoding .
MeetWays , a site that calculates the halfway between two locations , uses the API to determine the nearest address for the halfway point ( and is our Mashup of the Day today ) :
The API documentation has been updated to include this new feature and there is some sample code available as well .
Our Google Maps API Profile includes additional information , including links to over 1,500 map mashups developed with the API .

 No party lines , no distortion , no spin political coverage  no show tackles tough issues like ' The Factor ' !
The U.S. Postal Service faces a serious financial shortfall that is accelerating reductions in its workforce and raising the possibility of the first - ever layoffs of career employees .
Reduced mail volume , rising costs , and a newly enacted cap on rate increases all have taken a toll on the Postal Service ’s finances .
A gradual shift to electronic communications and bill payment is shrinking the number of first - class letters , a mainstay of postal revenues .
And the current economic downturn has led to drops in advertising mail volume .
Increasing fuel prices have been a big factor in worsening postal finances , compounded by a legal restriction enacted two years ago against raising the price of most services beyond the rate of inflation .
The cap on rate increases was a major victory for the big mailing industry , but combined with rising costs , it has seriously squeezed the postal budget .
Unionized postal workers have not yet experienced layoffs , which have been confined to casual employees , a small percentage of the workforce .
But Postmaster General John Potter , after reporting losses of $ 2.3 billion in the fiscal year ending September 30 , informed the unions that 16,000 craft employees ( out of approximately 600,000 ) are not protected by contractual , seniority - based no - layoff clauses .
SUPPORT LABOR NOTES BECOME A MONTHLY DONOR Give $ 10 a month or more and get our " Fight the Boss , Build the Union " T - shirt .
The Postal Service is offering early retirement which , based on acceptance rates thus far , will have around 7,000 takers .
In early 2009 , when the number of early retirees will be known and income can be assessed for the traditionally profitable fourth quarter , there ’s a chance that the first layoffs of craft employees may occur .
DAY SHIFT ENDANGERED
Cost pressures are having other effects .
Most of the sorting and processing of mail already occurs between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m .
But , without notice to the affected unions , postal plant managers have been told to plan for ending day shift operations .
If implemented , this would force thousands of clerks ( represented by American Postal Workers Union ) and mailhandlers ( National Postal Mailhandlers Union ) out of the more desirable day - shift assignments .
The elimination of daytime jobs would disrupt the family lives and the physical health of those displaced , mostly high - seniority workers .
APWU President Bill Burrus has speculated that this action is partly aimed at pushing them to retire .
One proposal to recoup costs would be to ask Congress for an exception to the rate cap , pointing to the cost of fuel .
However , one union president has cautioned that too big an increase might further reduce business and drive the shift to e-communication .
The situation may encourage management , or the U.S. government , to push for more subcontracting or privatization , areas of longstanding battles with the unions .
For example , the Postal Service recently asked for bids from private companies to outsource work carried out by its network of bulk mail centers .
Unions have responded by pushing for favorable legislation , and by pointing out the disagreements on privatization between major - party candidates in the presidential and congressional elections .
Postal workers have been relatively immune from the concessions that have hit other industries .
We now face a set of circumstances , termed “ a perfect storm ” by Burrus , that will challenge the ability of the unions to protect postal jobs , pay , and working conditions .
David Yao is vice president of the Greater Seattle Area Local APWU .
Steve Chapman expresses the core reason for Obama 's success :
From the moment he vaulted into national consciousness with his inspiring speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention , this theme has lain at the heart of his approach and his appeal .
" We worship an awesome God in the Blue States , and we do n't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the Red States , " he reminded us then .
" We coach Little League in the Blue States and yes , we 've got some gay friends in the Red States .
" It is a message of fundamental unity and good will , at a time when politics often resembles Henry Adams ' mordant description : " the systematic organization of hatreds . "
It is what Reagan did as well .
And the great crushing blow of this campaign is to have watched John McCain run a campaign that is , at its worst , " the systematic organization of hatreds . "
My essay of a year ago on Obama 's potential to get us past the toxic , red - blue , boomer divide can be found here .
In trying to write my own endorsement of Obama these past couple of days , I realize I already said almost everything I wanted to say in that piece .
And the events of the last year - and the deepening darkness we are in - have led me back to Square One :
If you believe that America ’s current crisis is not a deep one ... if you believe that today ’s ideological polarization is not dangerous , and that what appears dark today is an illusion fostered by the lingering trauma of the Bush presidency , then the argument for Obama is not that strong ...
But if you sense , as I do , that greater danger lies ahead , and that our divisions and recent history have combined to make the American polity and constitutional order increasingly vulnerable , then the calculus of risk changes .
Sometimes , when the world is changing rapidly , the greater risk is caution .
Close - up in this election campaign , Obama is unlikely .
From a distance , he is necessary .
At a time when America ’s estrangement from the world risks tipping into dangerous imbalance , when a country at war with lethal enemies is also increasingly at war with itself , when humankind ’s spiritual yearnings veer between an excess of certainty and an inability to believe anything at all , and when sectarian and racial divides seem as intractable as ever , a man who is a bridge between these worlds may be indispensable .

NEW DELHI : Sachin Tendulkar became the highest scorer in Test cricket after surpassing West Indian legend Brian Lara in the ongoing second Test in Mohali on Friday .
( Watch )
After breaking Lara���s record , Sachin Tendulkar became the first batsman to reach 12000 - run mark in Test cricket .
The Master Blaster needed just 15 runs today to overtake Lara's Test match tally of 11,953 runs and establishing a fourth world record in his illustrious career .
The 35 - year - old batting maestro is already the world 's top - scorer in One - Day International ( 16,361 ) and has the most centuries in Test matches ( 39 ) and One- dayers ( 42 ) .
The Mumbaikar came close to surpass Lara 's milestone in the drawn first Test in Bangalore but he fell short of just 15 runs after playing a gritty knock of 49 runs in the second innings to help India seal a draw .
Sachin made his Test debut at the tender age of 16 against Pakistan in 1989 in Karachi .
From there on the little master of world cricket has never looked back .
The Mumbaikar came into limelight with his first Test century on a seaming Old Trafford track against a formidable English attack as he saved the match for India .
Tendulkar still remains the most admired cricketer from all quarters the world ranging from experts to cricket ardent fans despite not being in his best of form off late .
The body of the master blaster has taken its toll as he has been playing international cricket to close to two decades .
Though several injuries marred his playing career time and again during the last five years but his never - say - die attitude still makes him the heartthrob of cricketing world .
Congratulate Sachin Tendulkar .

Game On ! Biden , Palin Ready for VP Debate Expectations game begins in earnest as Biden , Palin head to Thursday debate .
Sept. 30 , 2008 -- Conventional political wisdom suggests it 's the top of the ticket not a vice presidential contender that wins or loses votes in a presidential election .
But 2008 has been anything but a conventional election .
Since the late additions of the vice presidential candidates to their respective party tickets last month , anticipation of their first meeting on the debate stage has been mounting .
On Thursday night in St. Louis it will reach culmination : Democratic vice presidential candidate and Washington veteran Sen .
Joe Biden squares off against his Republican counterpart , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , in their one - and - only debate of the election cycle .
One presidential debate and a weekend of analysis behind it , the political expectations game for the vice presidential matchup has begun in earnest .
The Obama - Biden campaign is trying to set the expectations bar low for its candidate while building up the debate face of its rival .
Downgrading Expectations
" I think that if you go back and look at the debates that Gov. Palin 's had as a candidate , she 's very skilled and she 'll be well - prepared .
I know she 's preparing this weekend , " said David Axelrod , chief strategist for the Obama campaign .
" As you saw at the convention , she can be very good , so I think it would be foolish to assume that this going is n't going to be a really challenging debate . "
Axelrod contends that Biden is n't headed into the debate " to go after Gov. Palin " but rather " to make the case for Sen. Obama . "
Biden spokesman David Wade played the expectations game to an even greater extreme , characterizing Palin as a formidable opponent .
" He 's going in there to debate a leviathan of forensics , who has debated five times and she 's undefeated in debates , " Wade said .
Palin Rallies , Prepares , Debates
At a joint rally with Sen. John McCain in Columbus , Ohio , Monday , the Alaska governor praised her running ticket 's Friday performance and promised the cheering crowd , " I 'll do my part in St. Louis this week . "
" I do look forward to Thursday night and debating Sen. Joe Biden , " Palin said before mocking the Delaware senator 's more than 30 years on Capitol Hill .
" I 'm looking forward to meeting him , too .
I 've never met him before .
But , I 've been hearing about his Senate speeches since I was in the second grade . "
The hit on Biden 's 36 years in the Senate was odd coming from the running mate of McCain , 72 , a man who has been in Congress for the past 26 years and whose age has been cited as a concern of many voters , according to the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll .
The McCain campaign has been short on details regarding the specifics of Palin 's preparation , though the Ohio rally was likely her last public appearance before heading to the Arizona senator 's Sedona ranch , where she 'll be joined by her husband , to spend Tuesday and Wednesday in intense preparation .
McCain 's top adviser Steve Schmidt traveled to Sedona with Palin ; McCain campaign manager Rick Davis worked with Palin in Philadelphia this weekend .
The team in Sedona is joined by by Mark Wallace , deputy campaign manager to President Bush in 2004 , and former Bush NSC staffer Steve Biegun who has been working as Palin 's lead foreign policy adviser .
Female Senators Advising Biden
Known for off - script moments and colorful remarks that can be interpreted as reckless and insensitive , Biden has been preparing for the Show - Me State showdown against the GOP 's first woman vice presidential nominee with advice from a number of prominent female Democrats in the Senate , Barbara Boxer , Dianne Feinstein and Hillary Clinton among them .
" They asked me if I could handle Sarah Palin ? " said Biden at a Sterling , Va. , rally in mid-September .
" I said try debating Barbara Mikulski . "
Earlier in the month in Wisconsin , Biden acknowledged certain pitfalls in perception " if two people with different genders or different races or different ethnicities debate one another . "
" You worry about , you may say something , either person may say something that comes off the wrong way , " Biden said .
To help Biden prepare , Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm joined the Delaware senator in Wilmington , acting as the primary stand - in for Palin , for at least two days of debate prep that started Monday morning .
" I do n't think anybody really looks forward to debate prep , " said Wade .
" It 's kinda like looking forward to homework . "
Still , part of the challenge for Biden in debating Palin is facing " someone who is largely unknown , " as Obama campaign manager David Plouffe put it .
Even Biden has stated that he does not know where Palin stands on major issues .
The McCain campaign has made the Alaska governor famously inaccessible to the press -- absent from the Sunday morning circuit , Palin gave her first press conference Sept. 25 at ground zero and has done sit - down interviews with ABC's Charles Gibson , Fox 's Sean Hannity and CBS ' Katie Couric .
Following her interview with Couric , Palin has encountered something of a backlash from a conservative blogosphere that once embraced her as it questions her credentials and ability to lead on issues of domestic and international policy .
On " Good Morning America " Monday , ABC News ' chief Washington correspondent George Stephanopoulos said " a major mistake , particularly on foreign policy , would be fatal to her candidacy . "
Stephanopoulos said the degree of difficulty will be high for the Delaware senator as well .
" It 's always difficult in these debates , particularly for someone like Biden , not to appear too aggressive or too boorish , and he 's got to be careful about that . "
Part of Palin 's strategy will be an aggressive attack on Obama as a liberal , McCain campaign officials told ABC News , putting him on the defensive so that Biden will have to answer for Obama .
Whatever tactics Palin employs , Biden remarked immediately following last Friday 's debate between Obama and McCain that he hopes his Alaska opponent comes to Missouri echoing McCain 's talking points .
" I hope that she makes the same arguments that John McCain made , " Biden told Fox News ' Chris Wallace .
" Are you going to have trouble not being condescending to her and pointing out that you 've been to all these places and she has n't ? "
Wallace asked the more experienced Biden , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee .
" No , no , no , I 'm not going to do what John did , " replied Biden , hitting out McCain 's treatment of Obama at their Ole Miss duel .
ABC News ' Ron Claiborne , Kate Snow and Jake Tapper contributed to this report .
There 's an old saying that circulates in more politically radical circles : " Protest is patriotism . "
In this post - September 11 world of paranoia and political expediency , however , protest , an essence of democracy , has morphed into something perfectly Orwellian : terrorism .
Two recent events demonstrate how easy it is for the government to dilute words and their meanings to close off opposition and dissent .
Last week , the Maryland state police disclosed that 53 nonviolent anti-war and anti-death penalty activists were tracked for 14 months in 2005 and 2006 under the state 's terrorism surveillance programme , and that their names had been added to the state 's and the National Security Agency 's database .
Who are these sinister terrorists ?
Two of the activists caught in the Maryland dragnet are Carol Gilbert and Ardeth Platte , Dominican nuns in the Roman Catholic Church who did indeed break the law in acts of civil disobedience .
On October 2 , 2002 , in response to the first anniversary of the war in Afghanistan , they broke into a missile silo in northeastern Colorado and painted bloody crosses on it .
Understanding that acts of civil disobedience carry grave consequences , Gilbert and Platte paid a hefty price for their protest : they went to prison .
Gilbert received 30 months in a federal penitentiary while Platte was sentenced to 41 months for injuring government property and obstructing national defence .
The nuns no doubt agree with Thoreau 's famous saying : " Under a government which imprisons unjustly , the true place for a just man is also a prison . "
But being labelled terrorists is too much for them .
They say they protest in pursuit of peace and truth .
" We 're Dominicans .
Our mission is ' veritas ' , which is truth , " Gilbert told the Washington Times .
They are n't even sure how their names were included in the Maryland state police 's database , since they say they were n't involved with the protests the state police say they monitored .
The surveillance programme has been shut down , and police superintendent Terrence Sheridan admitted to the Maryland Senate last week that " The names do n't belong in there .
It 's as simple as that . "
The activists have been notified that they can review their files before they are purged from the databases .
Farther to the north , another state is experimenting with a far more audacious assault on democracy .
In 2002 , Minnesota liberalised the legal definition of terrorism , according to the Associated Press , to include actions " intended to interfere with the conduct of government or the right of lawful assembly . "
Essentially , it 's Minnesota 's version of the US Patriot Act .
Ramsey county police used the statute to break up an anarchist group called the RNC Welcoming Committee that planned to carry out direct action protests , including roadblocks , to prevent delegates to the Republican national convention from entering the Xcel Center in Minneapolis .
Eight leaders of the organisation were arrested before a protest was even launched .
They face seven and a half years in prison if convicted .
No doubt these actions are crimes , but as Stephen Vladeck , associate professor at American University Washington College of Law , told the AP : " One of the biggest concerns among scholars who debate the definition of terrorism is that an overbroad definition would both dilute the real sense of terrorism and punish conduct that has traditionally been a far more minor offence . "
What 's frightening about these recent incidents is twofold .
First , the Maryland police programme raises the question of how extensive this devolution of surveillance from the federal government to individual states has become .
We already have the national security state .
Must Americans worry that state and municipal governments will also increasingly monitor peaceful people who participate in political activities ?
Second , the terrorism charges brought against activists like Gilbert and Platte and the members of the RNC Welcoming Committee have , in effect , criminalised protest .
This is all the more serious because Minnesota had the audacity to not only revise the terrorism statutes to hamper acts of civil disobedience but also to bring such draconian charges against the group 's members before they even committed a criminal act .
Seven and a half years for planning to block entrance to the Xcel Center , spray police and delegates with urine and even spread marbles on the ground a la Animal House is excessive and ridiculous .
Again , there 's no doubt that these actions would get the protesters arrested , possibly even charged in earlier times with a felony , but to suggest this is terrorism says much about our society .
Those in charge will not tolerate a vibrant culture of dissent - a novel irony in such an overwhelmingly Christian country whose saviour found himself on a cross for his civil disobedience in the temple .
The group 's activists have no illusions about what Ramsey county is up to .
" Conspiracy charges serve a very particular purpose - to criminalise dissent , " the RNC Eight wrote to their supporters .
" They create a convenient method for incapacitating activists , with the potential for diverting limited resources toward protracted legal battles and terrorising entire communities into silence and inaction . "
It 's startling to think that in the US we even have the pretension to argue about the merits of exporting democracy when such blatant authoritarianism continues to run rampant here at home .

Highlights and full text of Friday 's coup d'etat
If one looks at this bill , even at a glance , then you have to conclude that what went down earlier last week was all staged dog and pony show .
this bill was ready and waiting to go through .
and no other bill was ever going to go through .
but here is the evidence that the bill was never about a bailout ( many of the financial institutions have started rejecting it !! ) it was about tyranny of government and financial sectors and bolstering of " mental health " programs financially to further assist in the dumbing down of America and minimization of resistance and " blowback " now and in the future .
Do something that Congress did n't do ...
READ the bailout bill ( or at least browse its 403 pages as I did .
Here are interesting tidbits that I found )

Three Kingdoms is a Chinese " novel " written in the 12th century based on the events of the so - called " Warring States " period of Chinese history ( that is , the 3rd century ) .
It is extremely famous in China , in fact , the Rough Guide to China claims pretty much every Chinese knows the story .
Personally , I 'd never heard of it before I started preparing for a holiday there in 2004 .
( Yes , this is also a posting that 's been sitting around and suddenly got posted now . )
The Chinese clearly take a long view of history , and you can see this right from the famous first sentence of the book , which ( in the translation I read ) goes : " Long united , the empire must divide .
Long divided , it must unite . "
There you have it ; the ebb and flow of Chinese history through the millennia , captured in two brief sentences .
The eternal pattern of Chinese history is the establishment of a strong dynasty , which slowly decays over the generations , until the empire breaks apart into smaller , squabbling kingdoms .
Eventually , some strong figure emerges to unite the kingdoms into a new empire , and the cycle starts over .
( There is nothing specifically Chinese in this ; you can see it elsehwere , too . )
The story begins at the end of such a cycle , as the empire is falling apart under a weak emperor .
Palace eunuchs rule through intrigue , and peasant rebellions threaten .
The novel follows a bewildering profusion of characters over two - three generations until the empire is secured under a new emperor .
The consequence is that by the time you are two thirds through the book , all the initial characters are dead , which makes it a little hard to decide who might be the main character .
Most of the way through the book the focus is on Liu Bei , a nobleman who swears an oath to unite the empire together with two friends at the beginning of the book .
He eventually establishes a kingdom of his own , which after his death swallows the rest of the empire , and Liu Bei then becomes known as founder of the new dynasty , and , the author implies , the cycle is ready to start over .
I find it curious that while I thought Liu Bei was the main character , and Cao Cao simply one villain among many , my hosts in Beijing considered Cao Cao the main character .
Given that they are Chinese and have a Chinese education they probably reflect the Chinese consensus much better than my opinion after a single read of the book .
The book is an interesting read in many different ways , both as a story in its own right , and because of the light it sheds on ancient Chinese culture .
For the most part , this light is indirect , in the sense that the author clearly assumes that the reader is a contemporary ( ie , 12th century ) Chinese , with often startling results for present - day readers .
To take one example , at the beginning of the book , one of the eunuchs responsible for the current misrule is fleeing from a revolt , and winds up spending the night with a farmer who has no food to give him .
Desperate to serve this high official the farmer slaughters and cooks his own wife , and serves her to the eunuch .
This is , as far as I can tell , considered highly laudable by the author , though modern audiences might feel differently .
Another thing that stands out very clearly is the military sophistication of the Chinese compared with , say , contemporary Europe .
The plot is full of complicated tactical stratagems , high - tech weaponry , and the reader is clearly expected to have some understanding of the logistics of contemporary warfare .
In fact , good tacticians and advisors were clearly highly prized in 12th century China .
At the same time it must be admitted that this is not exactly a realistic history .
In at least one case , a single person ( one of Liu Bei's two friends ) scares away an entire army simply by shouting very loud ...
Anyway , the book is highly recommended , even though it is definitely a substantial read ( my edition is 2400 pages ) .
I liked it enough to try buying Water Margin , another " novel " in the same vein , and apparently Mao 's favourite book , during my last visit in Beijing .
It 's about as long as Three Kingdoms , and I could only find a 6 - volume hardback edition which had alternating Chinese and English pages .
This is useful for those who want to learn Chinese ( or English ) , but would have messed up my luggage allowance on the flight home completely , so I had to leave it .
McCain Advisers Freaked Out by Al Qaeda Preference for McCain
Created : October 22 , 2008 12:35 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
I just got off a conference call held by the McCain campaign to deny that Al Qaeda , contrary to reports in the AP and the Washington Post , is rooting for their man .
To describe the call as panicked would be an understatement .
Jim Woolsey , the former CIA director who publicly connected Iraq to the 9/11 attacks without any evidence in 2001 , and senior foreign - policy adviser Randy Scheunemann spent more time whining about the Washington Post ’s standards of fairness than on the logic of why Al Qaeda might prefer Sen.
John McCain .
“ An amazing piece of journalism , and I use journalism in quotation marks , ” Scheunemann said , going on to list barely approving quotes of Sen. Barack Obama from Hamas , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad and Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi , which he said he was n’t going “ to characterize . ”
Woolsey , for his part , peered into the mind of what he called “ one individual Islamist blogger from one terrorist Islamist blog ” and determined that he was “ clearly trying to damage John McCain ” and “ not speaking from his heart . ”
What was absent from the call , oddly enough , was any discussion about why Al Qaeda might want McCain to win .
And there the case is simple enough .
Al Qaeda prefers an indefinite U.S. occupation of Iraq and a bellicose U.S. all across the Muslim world to radicalize Muslims to its terrorist cause and drain the U.S. of its financial wealth — what Osama bin Laden calls his “ bleed to bankruptcy ” strategy .
Hence , the reason why , as the CIA eventually concluded , Bin Laden tried to help George W. Bush ’s reelection in 2004 by releasing a late - October tape .
McCain pledges basic continuity with Bush on the Iraq war .
As Scheunemann put it , “ John McCain will spend what it takes to win . ”
Yet the idea of Al Qaeda preferring a U.S. strategy that strengthens it confounded the McCain camp .
“ It is ridiculous to believe that in its heart of hearts , Al Qaeda wants John McCain to be the president , ” Woolsey said .
“ It ’s ludicrous . ”
But the only thing that ’s ludicrous is Woolsey ’s expectation that the American public will keep falling for this sort of misdirection by the same blinkered analysts who blundered the U.S. into Iraq in the first place .
Update : More from Greg Sargent & Eric Kleefeld at TPM and Dave Weigel at Reason .
The highest jump in two whole weeks !
( But , yes , still quite impressive ) .
AP : It 's been another astounding day on Wall Street , with the Dow Jones industrials soaring nearly 900 points as investors scooped up stocks that were pounded lower in recent sessions .
Analysts said some investors were buying in anticipation that the Federal Reserve will cut its fed funds rate by half a point to 1 percent on Wednesday .
Others said the market had just fallen too far , with the Dow having dropped more than 500 points , the previous two trading days .
Still , the day was remarkable because investors brushed off a big drop in consumer confidence reported by the Conference Board .
The Dow is up about 889 points at the 9,065 level .
That was its second - largest point gain , coming after the 936 points the Dow jumped on Oct. 13 .
No , I ’m not kidding .
In August , you may recall , I wrote a post titled “ Why I ’m Donating to Kay Hagan “ .
This post concerned the U.S. Senate race in North Carolina , where Democratic candidate Kay Hagan is running against the Republican incumbent Elizabeth Dole .
The focus of my post was a press release from the Dole campaign attacking Hagan for attending a fundraiser held by Wendy and Woody Kaminer , who are politically active atheists .
In this press release , the Dole campaign pandered to religious bigotry in the most blatant and shameful way , seeking to demonize not just her opponent but all American atheists .
At the time , I had some harsh words for politicians like Dole who build their campaigns on exploiting prejudice and fear :
It ’s about time we saw atheists taking a greater role in American political life , and I ’m not about to stand by and watch while we ’re dragged through the mud by self - righteous demagogues who slander us in order to appeal to the ignorant and prejudiced .
If we ’re going to have an influence on American civic life , we need to flex our political muscles .
Kay Hagan ought to be rewarded for inviting nonbelievers onto her platform …
Now , that the Dole campaign has put out a new ad attacking Hagan .
Far from abandoning her earlier appeal to bigotry , this one doubles down on it , dredging up the most contemptible and pathetic lies imaginable about the goals of atheists and about Hagan ’s associations with us .
In the ad ( potentially NSFW language ) , Dole claims that atheists want to “ remove any reference to God in the public arena , including eliminating the Christmas Holiday ” , and calls us “ the most vile , radical liberals in America ” .
And on the last page of this flier , we find this :
Oh yes : the Dole campaign quotes my actual post and gives the URL to this site .
I ’m speechless .
Apparently , Daylight Atheism has now become part of the U.S. Senate campaign for North Carolina .
I ’m not upset about this .
In fact , I ’m thrilled .
I could n’t be happier .
Let the Dole campaign send traffic to my site ; I regret nothing , and I stand behind everything I ’ve written on this matter .
With any luck , some of her supporters will come here , read for themselves what I ’ve written , and see for themselves the falsehood of Dole ’s ugly , bigotry - baiting claims .
Frankly , I think this is a sign of desperation .
Recent polls have shown Hagan with a genuine lead .
Trying to mobilize the religious right by appealing to hatred of atheists may well be the only hope Elizabeth Dole has left .
So , I think we should cut that hope off at the pass .
Let ’s send the religious right a strong message that atheists are a force to be reckoned with in American politics , and that they stoop to smearing us at their peril .
I ’m not saying that the Democrats are perfect , far from it .
As a party , they pander to religion much more than I ’d like .
But at the very least , they have a greater respect for the separation of church and state and are more likely to appreciate the importance of including all Americans in their coalition .
By contrast , Republicans in general , and Elizabeth Dole specifically , have perfected the art of pitching their campaigns to an increasingly narrow sliver of the electorate .
They pander to the worst instincts of their would - be supporters , stirring up prejudice and fear , rather than promoting substantive and rational governance .
They seek only to represent the rigid views of right - wing Christian fundamentalists , rather than building a broader coalition of Americans of all kinds .
Senator Dole , by your words and your actions , you have shown yourself unfit for elected office .
You are supported to represent all the residents of your state , yet by your repeated and shameless appeals to prejudice , you have proven that you are not the representative of the 10 % of your state ’s residents who are non-religious .
I take pleasure in battling bigotry of all kinds , yours no less than others .
If you want a fight , then bring it on .
It ’s about time that American atheists , as well as all tolerant and progressive people of good will , took a stand against the venomous and divisive politics of the Christian right .
Postscript :
If you want to punish anti-atheist bigotry and help Kay Hagan win , please consider donating to her campaign , and leave a comment letting us know .
Let ’s show the religious right that they can’t push us around without paying the consequences !
UPDATE ( 11/4 ) : Good riddance , Elizabeth Dole … welcome , U.S. Senator Kay Hagan !
NEW DELHI  India launched its first unmanned spacecraft to orbit the moon early Wednesday , part of an effort to assert its power in space and claim some of the business opportunities there .
The Indian mission is scheduled to last two years , prepare a three - dimensional atlas of the moon and prospect the lunar surface for natural resources , including uranium , a coveted fuel for nuclear power plants , according to the Indian Space Research Organization .
The spacecraft will not land on the moon , though it is supposed to send a small “ impactor ” probe to the surface .
The launching of Chandrayaan - 1 , as the vehicle is called  roughly translated as Moon Craft - 1  comes about a year after China ’s first moon mission .
Mathematics becomes more than the stuff of SAT nightmares in Fermat 's Room , a tense thriller screened last night at the Imagine Science Film Festival in New York City .
When four skilled mathematicians solve a puzzle and are invited to a secluded conference , they 're promised the world 's greatest enigma .
Instead , they find themselves in a slowly shrinking space , with less than an hour to figure out how they 're connected and who wants them dead — or the giant hydraulic presses will finish the job .
Only by correctly solving the mathematical mind - twisters delivered via PDA can they buy a little time .
Fermat 's Room , from Spanish directors Luis Piedrahita and Rodrigo Sopeña , manages to turn math into a deadly , mysterious game .
Everyone assembled in the room has secrets , of course , and motivations they are hiding .
But as the walls literally close in on the characters , increasing desperation forces them into confrontation .
As they try to unravel who is behind the crime , they must solve various " enigmas " to keep back the walls ( though some of the problems are a bit too familiar , like the " Light Switch Puzzle " ) .
Math is presented throughout as almost a magical skill , wielded by experts who treat its pursuit as something worth stealing and dying for .
It has already brought some of them fame and fortune .
Like superheroes , they 've all been given special identities to wear : Pascal , Galois , Oliva , and Hilbert .
At the same time that it is concerned with theorems and numerical traps , the movie looks at the ways technology can be programmed to work independently against us .
Only raw mortal reasoning can stave it off .
Fermat 's Room also explores some very human failings of conscience , and yields a high level of drama between its characters .
When there is little room left , paranoia and accusation rage in a way reminiscent of The Twilight Zone 's best tension .
It is rare that cinematic heroes get to be pure mathematicians , but here that knowledge is essential for survival , front and center .
With the terror of encroaching walls — an effective scene - setter in everything from Star Wars to that other people - in - a - box - with - math thriller , 1997 's Cube — the plot is always pushed forward and does its best to keep you guessing , even if the revelations are n't always earth - shaking .
This is a fine , fluid production , well - cast and visually appealing .
It 's definitely the best film you 'll see about sexy angst - laden imperiled math geniuses this year .
You can watch the trailer below .
The Imagine Science Film Festival is running a rich and varied program of events until October 25th around New York City .
All screenings are gloriously free , and all of the movies find an inspirational spark in science .
As sporting glories continue in Beijing with the Paralympics taking up where the Olympics left off , many of us have marvelled at the architecture almost as much as at the sporting achievements .
One of the Olympic venues , the National Aquatic Centre , lives up to its name of the Water Cube .
It seems to be sliced from a giant foam of bubbles , an effect that is enhanced when it glows blue against the night sky .
The Water Cube at night .

To achieve this appearance of foam , the engineers at ARUP and architects at PTW based their design on the work of two Irish physicists , Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan .
In 1993 Weaire and Phelan found a new solution to the Kelvin problem : what is the most efficient way to divide a space into cells of equal volume , but with a minimal surface area ?
Kelvin 's proposed solution was a structure made up of truncated octahedrons
This may sound complicated , but in fact every time you do the dishes the foam of soap bubbles you froth up demonstrates some of the properties of this structure .
Soap bubbles and foams have the mathematical property of minimal surfaces — they take the structure which has the least amount of surface area to enclose a given volume .
Lord Kelvin proposed a solution to the foam problem in 1887 : he suggested that each cell was a truncated octahedron , a 14 - sided solid formed by cutting the corners off a familiar three - dimensional diamond .
Kelvin did not provide any mathematical proof that his foam structure was in fact the one with the least surface area possible , but no better solutions were found for over a century until Weaire and Phelan 's discovery .
Their structure is made up of two types of irregular polyhedra — a wonky looking dodecahedron with pentagonal faces ( that is , it has twelve faces each with five sides ) and a wonky looking tetradecahedron with two hexagonal and twelve pentagonal faces ( so it has fourteen faces , two with six sides , and twelve with five sides ) .
In fact , just to make things more wonky , due to the laws of foams , both the Kelvin structure and the Weaire - Phelan structure have faces that are slightly curved .
The Weaire - Phelan foam ( left ) is made up of wonky dodecahedrons with pentagonal faces ( top right ) and tetradecahedrons with 2 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal faces ( bottom right ) .
" We soon found a curious feature about this foam .
In spite of its complete regularity , when it is viewed at an arbitrary angle it appears totally random and organic , " said Arup Fellow Tristram Carfrae , when he explained why they based the Water Cube 's design on the Weaire - Phelan structure .
" We realised that a structure based on this unique geometry would be highly repetitive and buildable whilst appearing very organic and random .
Indeed such space filling patterns are regularly observed in biological cells and mineral crystals , they are probably the most common structures in nature .
Also the ductile space frame that is generated from this geometry is ideally suited to the seismic conditions found in Beijing . "
So we have the mathematics of Weaire and Phelan to thank for such an unusual and beautiful building , the structure of which appears to be made of the same water contained within .
And although Weaire and Phelan showed that their foam has a smaller surface area ( you can think of this as using less soap ) than Kelvin's , they did n't manage to prove that it has the least surface area possible .
So that 's something else you can think about next time you are doing the dishes , or training for the 2012 Olympics .

Advertisement A Canadian Conservative Party speech - writer has resigned after Prime Minister Stephen Harper was accused of plagiarism in a speech he made in 2003 .
Owen Lippert admitted he had been " overzealous in copying segments " of a speech in support of the invasion of Iraq by then Australian PM John Howard .
Mr Lippert said neither his superiors nor Mr Harper , who was opposition leader at the time , had been aware .
The accusation comes half - way through a general election campaign .
Mr Harper , who has led a minority government since January 2006 , called the snap election for 14 October last month , hoping to obtain a parliamentary majority , for which he needs to win 28 more seats .
Opinion polls suggest the conservatives are within striking distance of doing so , having maintained a near 10 - point lead over the Liberals .
Context ' even worse '
The speech by Mr Harper was originally made on 20 March 2003 as the House of Commons in Ottawa held an emergency debate at the beginning of the US - led war in Iraq .
In the debate , Mr Harper urged Canada and the Liberal government to join the so - called " coalition of the willing " .
COMPARE THE SPEECHES 2003 speeches by John Howard and Stephen Harper [ 120 KB ]
Source : Liberal Party of Canada
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here Five years later at a campaign stop on Tuesday , a Liberal MP for Toronto , Bob Rae , accused the prime minister of plagiarism .
Mr Harper 's 2003 speech had been made almost word - for - word two days before in Canberra by his former Australian counterpart , John Howard , he said .
To prove the allegation , portions of the speeches were played side by side .
" In the interests of world peace and regional security ...
The community of nations required Iraq to surrender , " Mr Howard said in his speech .
" In the interests of peace and regional security ...
The community of nations required Iraq to surrender , " Mr Harper said two days later .
Mr Rae said the discovery was made by accident almost two months ago by Liberal strategists who were looking for similarities between Mr Harper 's government and that of US President George W Bush .
The Liberals said they did not release the information until Tuesday because they had been waiting to receive a videotape of Mr Howard 's speech from Australia .
Liberal leader Stephane Dion said Mr Harper ought to be " expelled " by his party , and that the context in which the plagiarism had occurred made it " even worse " .
" It 's about Stephen Harper saying that Canada should go with the war in Iraq , " he said .
" He 's unable to choose his own words , " he added .
" Canadians want their country [ to ] speak with its own voice on the world stage . "
' Pressed for time ' Conservative campaign spokesman Kory Teneycke initially refused to discuss the allegations of plagiarism .
Mr Harper has been depicting himself as honest ahead of the election " I 'm not going to get into a debate about a five - year - old speech that was delivered three parliaments ago , two elections ago , " he told the CBC .
But eventually Mr Lippert , who describes himself as an expert in intellectual property , apologised and announced his resignation .
" Pressed for time , I was overzealous in copying segments of another world leader 's speech , " he said in a statement .
" Neither my superiors in the office of the leader of the opposition nor the leader of the opposition was aware that I had done so . "
The BBC's Lee Carter in Toronto says the revelation comes during an election campaign that has focused heavily on leadership , with Mr Harper depicting himself as honest and dependable , contrasting himself to Mr Dion , who has been criticised for poor leadership and communication skills .
The two men are to face each other shortly in two vital televised debates - one in French on Wednesday and another in English on Thursday .

NAACP , Voting Rights Coalition Demand Paper Ballots If ' Majority ' of Voting Machines Fail
Sec. of the Commonwealth Had Previously Decreed Paper Only Necessary if ALL Voting Machines Break Down in a Precinct ...
Brad Friedman Byon
10/23/2008 , 2:47 pm PT
Finally !
A lawsuit [ PDF ] has finally been filed today in federal District Court in Pennsylvania , against the Democratic Secretary of the Commonwealth , Pedro A. Cortes and the Commissioner of the state 's Election Commission , Chet Harhut , over Cortes ' recent directive that paper ballots only need be given out to voters in the event that every voting machine in a precinct breaks down .
That stunning decree was in opposition to PA 's state law which allows election officials the discretion to give emergency paper ballots to voters if even a single machine breaks down in a precinct .
That neither Obama nor the DNC have said a word about this in the month or so since Cortes issued his directive has been maddening , and should be an outrage to voters of all parties in the Keystone State , sure to be another battleground state this November .
The lawsuit was finally filed today by the state 's NAACP in concert with the 866 - MYVOTE1 Election Reform Network .
While the complaint should call for paper ballots to be made available to any voter who wishes one , or , at a minimum , to be given out if just one machine breaks down in a precinct , or even if the wait time in line is longer than 30 minutes , unfortunately , the suit calls very conservatively for emergency paper ballots to be given out if 50 % or more of the voting machines in a precinct break down .
But at least it 's something , we guess , particularly in lieu of Obama and / or the DNC taking any action at all here , given they have the most to lose by the ridiculous action from state Democrats .
Pennsylvania uses unverifiable Direct Recording Electronic ( DRE , usually touch - screen ) machines across most of the state , and saw machine failure after failure , as we documented in detail during their April primary this year .
The failures resulted in untold numbers of disenfranchised voters , as noted in news reports , and logged by calls to the 866 - MYVOTE1 hotline ...
" Voters should not be forced to wait hours in line in order to exercise their fundamental right to vote , " said John Bonifaz , legal director for VoterAction.org and co-counsel for the plaintiffs in a statement issued today .
" While the use of electronic voting machines continues to pose a separate threat to the integrity of the vote - counting process , federal court intervention is necessary to ensure that voters will not be disenfranchised by long lines on Election Day in Pennsylvania , when these machines become inoperable . "
In a declaration filed with the suit , J. Whyatt Mondesire , the president of the NAACP State Conference of Pennsylvania , notes : " One of the major impediments to members exercising their right to vote is the long lines frequently encountered on election day ... Thousands of members have faced serious delays in voting when machines have broken down in the past and this problem will be much more severe this year when unprecedented numbers of voters will be coming to the polls . "
[ DISCLOSURE : John Gideon of VotersUnite.org , a frequent contributor to The BRAD BLOG has also filed a declaration to the court in the case . ]
The 23 - page complaint filed today in federal court , in PA 's Eastern District is available for download here [ PDF ] ...
The plaintiffs 37 - page " Memorandum of Law " may be downloaded here [ PDF ] ...
Some weeks ago Mary Ann Gould , an election integrity advocate from the Coalition for Voting Integrity , and host of Philadelphia 's " Voice of the Voters " radio program notified The BRAD BLOG about the order from Secretary Cortes as she began trying to raise awareness of the issue on her radio program , and via email .
She compared the the state statute , versus the directive from Cortes in an email , which noted , in part :
( b) " If any electronic voting system or any component thereof being used in any election shall become inoperable during such election , it shall , if possible , be repaired or another machine substituted by the custodian or county board of elections as promptly as possible , for which purpose the county board of elections may purchase as many extra systems or system components as it may deem necessary , but in case such repair or substation cannot be made , paper ballots , either printed or written and of suitable form , may be used for registering votes . "
Statute in the election code ( 3031..20 ) Section 1120 - A which says : VERSUS recently issued Directive ( directive are guides NOT law ) " if all electronic voting machines in a precinct are inoperable , " paper ballots , either printed or written and of any suitable form , " for registering votes ( described herein as " emergency back - up paper ballots " ) shall be distributed immediately to eligible voters pursuant to section 1120 - A( b ) of the Election Code . "
The " Nature of the Case " opening of the complaint filed today , details the " perfect storm " expected by plaintiffs --- and we heartily agree with them about what is likely to occur this November 4th --- leading to their demand for emergency paper ballots if % 50 or more of machines fail .
And again , why the Democratic Secretary of the Commonwealth has n't demanded that there be enough paper ballots for every voter --- and why neither Obama nor the DNC have said or done a thing about it --- remains well above our paygrade , apparently ...
NATURE OF THE CASE 1 .
This civil rights action is brought to enforce the most fundamental right secured by the United States Constitution : the right to vote .
2 . In Pennsylvania this year , an unprecedented interest in voting , a record number of newly registered voters , and a well - established history of widespread electronic voting machine failures have converged to create a perfect storm that , left unaddressed , unquestionably will result in the disenfranchisement of substantial numbers of citizens .
Fortunately , the remedy for this grave threat to the franchise is simple and places only the slightest of burdens on the State : the provision of emergency paper ballots when half or more of the voting machines in any precinct simultaneously fail .
3 . In the face of the extraordinary stresses that our election apparatus will face this year , the new rule promulgated by the Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth directing the use of emergency paper ballots only when all of the voting machines in a precinct fail is nothing short of perverse .
It rests on the specious proposition that remedial action is only required in the most dire of circumstances when no machines work at all and that no remedy whatsoever is appropriate where , as here , the record demonstrates an overwhelming likelihood that substantial numbers of precincts will have half or more but not all of their electronic voting machines fail .
4 . Although state officials generally have wide discretion to administer elections in the manner they see fit , this is the rare case in which the Secretary is playing with fire to a constitutionally intolerable degree .
Given the certainty that electronic voting machines will fail recognized by the states own certification expert and given the dramatic impact that every failure has on the affected precinct because the vast majority of precincts have no more than two or , at most , three machines this Court should direct the Secretary of the Commonwealth to ensure that local election officials provide voters with paper ballots if 50 % or more of the voting machines in a precinct become inoperable .
This modest intervention will allow all of those who wish to vote the opportunity to do so in a timely manner and without undue delay , while imposing only a negligible burden on the State and local election officials .
In this historic year , and given the gravity of the threat to the franchise , surely the Constitution requires this minimal safeguard .
Mr. Obama opposes extending President Bush ’s tax cuts .
Instead , he proposes various tax breaks , including a $ 500 tax credit for each person in a household who works , a larger child care tax credit , a $ 4,000 tax credit each year for the first two years of college , and eliminating all income taxes for those over 65 with income less than $ 50,000 a year .
To reduce the deficit and inequality , he would raise the tax rate for single households with incomes of $ 200,000 or more and for families with incomes over $ 250,000 .
He would also raise taxes on capital gains and dividends .
The median household income nationwide is $ 50,233 , according to the Census Bureau .
The Tax Policy Center found that , for married couples with incomes of $ 50,000 , two children and both parents working , income taxes would be cut by $ 284 more under Mr. Obama ’s plan  by $ 1,005 , compared with $ 721 under Mr. McCain ’s plan .
Deloitte also examined such a couple and found similar benefits ; a $ 700 cut under Mr. McCain ’s plan and $ 1,000 under Mr. Obama’s .
For married couples with incomes of $ 500,000 with two children and both parents working , the Tax Policy Center found that Mr. Obama would raise income taxes by $ 3,363 , from $ 110,955 now , while Mr. McCain ’s plans would leave taxes unchanged .
Deloitte found that a $ 500,000 - a- year couple would pay $ 3,100 more under Mr. Obama , with no change under Mr. McCain .
Clint Stretch , Deloitte ’s managing principal of tax policy , said most families would benefit under Mr. McCain ’s plan because of an increased exemption for each child .
That , he said , would reduce taxes for low - income families by about $ 230 per child and for high - income families by about $ 800 .
To help low - income families in particular , Mr. Obama would give a “ Making Work Pay Credit ” equal to 6.2 percent of a worker ’s first $ 8,100 in wages .
That would yield a tax credit of $ 500 for a single person , and $ 1,000 for a couple in which both adults work .
As a result , a low - income couple now paying no income taxes might receive a $ 1,000 refund .

CNN 's Campbell Brown complains about Barack Obama 's switch on financing .
( CNN ) --
You may have heard that Wednesday night Barack Obama will be on five different TV networks speaking directly to the American people .
He bought 30 minutes of airtime from the different networks , a very expensive purchase .
But hey , he can afford it .
Barack Obama is loaded , way more loaded than John McCain , way more loaded than any presidential candidate has ever been at this stage of the campaign .
Just to throw a number out :
He has raised well over $ 600 million since the start of his campaign , close to what George Bush and John Kerry raised combined in 2004 .
Without question , Obama has set the bar at new height with a truly staggering sum of cash .
And that is why as we approach this November , it is worth reminding ourselves what Barack Obama said last November .
One year ago , he made a promise .
He pledged to accept public financing and to work with the Republican nominee to ensure that they both operated within those limits .
Then it became clear to Sen .
Obama and his campaign that he was going to be able to raise on his own far more cash than he would get with public financing .
So Obama went back on his word .
Watch Campbell Brown on Obama 's campaign financing »
He broke his promise and he explained it by arguing that the system is broken and that Republicans know how to work the system to their advantage .
He argued he would need all that cash to fight the ruthless attacks of 527s , those independent groups like the Swift Boat Veterans .
It 's funny though , those attacks never really materialized .
iReport.com : Your chance to ask Obama a question
The Washington Post pointed out recently that the bad economy has meant a cash shortage among the 527s and that this election year they have been far less influential .
The courageous among Obama 's own supporters concede this decision was really made for one reason , simply because it was to Obama 's financial advantage .
On this issue today , former Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska , an Obama supporter , writes in The New York Post , " a hypocrite is a person who puts on a false appearance of virtue -- who acts in contradiction to his or her stated beliefs or feelings .
And that , it seems to me , is what we are doing now . "
For this last week , Sen. Obama will be rolling in dough .
His commercials , his get - out - the - vote effort will , as the pundits have said , dwarf the McCain campaign 's final push .
But in fairness , you have to admit , he is getting there in part on a broken promise .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown .

Is John McCain throwing the election ?
( Vanity )
Posted on by TexasGunRunner
Is John McCain deliberately throwing the election ?
I am not convinced either way , but there are points to consider :
1 ) Campagain Suspension -
He could have stopped campaigning and returned to DC , but he stopped his entire campaign - hundreds of paid staff and thousand of volunteers were idled .
He had no plan when he arrived in DC and said little at the meeting .
If it were his dime , maybe , but that was our our donations , and the tax dollars of those foolish enough to check the box on their tax return .
2 ) Failure to respond to democrat accusations " Republicans are responsible " for sub - prime debacle - He knows the truth , he sponsored legislation to address it .
Yet , given two opportunities in the debate , he did n't say anything .
Worse , he effectively muzzled Sarah Palin so she could n't call Biden on it last night .
To have the moxie to promise to name names , and then take a pass on naming names for the greatest scandal in the history of the Republic is inexplicable .
3 ) Failure to respond to defeatist democrats - Again , Barack Obama said twice nobody was talking defeat , and McCain missed an incredible opportunity to hang defeatism around Obama 's neck .
Sarah Palin could n't let that one go , she lobbed it back at Biden .
This is arguably just McCain debate preparedness or an opportunity that slipped through the cracks .
I 'm no fan of McCain .
I did n't donate any money to him until he picked Palin .
I 'm also not a fan of conspiracy theories ( this just involves him though ) .
I am cynical , and I remember very clearly his interview with Michael Reagan in 2000 and who he blamed in 2000 .
Is it plausible ?
Could he really be doing all this just to " get even " with conservatives ?
It is totally at odds with his pre ' 78 life and how his friends describe him .
Still , how can you join a man who says " fight with me " and then literally stops fighting ?
Two weeks ago , he was " beating [ Obama ] like a drum " .
Then an issue - government corruption and pork barrel politics - that is right up his alley derailed him .
Can it really be that simple : he missed the curve ?
You may ask then , why choose Sarah Palin ?
She clearly ignited the campaign - he was doing as poorly before the Palin pick as he is doing now .
Surely he did n't look for the most promising rising conservative star with the malicious intent to taint her ( or Bobby Jindal ) with defeat ?
Either one would be constrained by his self - improsed restrictions , undermining who they are and weakening their future chances nationally .
That seems too dark , too vengeful , and only Obama is egotistical enough for something like that .
The optimist counter - theory is they are deliberately leading them in ... letting them repeatedly attack the Republicans and their philosophy of the best government , governs the least .
Maybe they are just waiting for the proper time to spring this on them .
That cunning seems very un -McCain also .
I wish I believed that .
Unfortunately , it is probably just his senatorial " my learned colleague " style and penchant for viciously attacking Republicans while not sparing praise for democrats .

Yes , it did strike me that the McCain handlers must have firmly warned her not to attack Obama for his role in bringing on the subprime crisis .
There were several openings there for her to go for the jugular , and she passed them up — I think because she is being loyal to McCain and his campaign .
I do n’t think it ’s deliberate on McCain ’s part .
I think maybe he just does n’t quite understand how “ reform ” works .
In her relatively shorter career , Sarah has managed to throw out quite a number of important pork - guzzlers of both parties , and confront yet work with Big Oil .
McCain ’s idea of “ reform ” was McCain - Feingold .
I do n’t know that he is actually malign .
I think he just needs some educating .
Meantime , I sure think we need to keep Obama out of the White House , and electing McCain no longer means that we are destroying the party , with Palin in the wings .

If you read some of my earlier posts you will find similar concerns .
It is my belief , one not shared by many on FR , that McCain ’s victory was defeating the conservatives and the Republican establishment in the primaries .
He has done that .
Now he has one last thing to clean up , i.e , the destruction of the party and the tainting of one the party ’s rise stars .
Then he can return the loving arms of his Liberal Democrat friends in the Senate and hope to get his maverick credentials reinstated by the DBM by attacking Repubs and conservative their .
It either is that or he is the worst , most incompetent candidate we have ever fielded .
Either way it sucks does n’t it .

Sarah is Fantastic !
Too bad that the top of the ticket is not .
I ’m not really sure why John decided to run against his friends .
This election would already be over if Mitt were on the ticket with Sarah .
But it was not to be and unless John decides that he can’t win this by bashing Republicans and playing nice with the Dims ?

“1) Campagain Suspension ” Country first .
Sect Paulson begged Lindsey Graham to get McCain to DC to help sway members of Congress , and Sen Reid put the burden on McCain , saying if he didnt support the bill , it would fall apart .
McCain did what he thought was right to get this off the dime .
In the end , his role was constructive in at least getting the House GOP and their ideas back in the game .
Part of the House GOP idea , insurance , and FDIC increases and Mark - to - market suspension , are all in the bill now .
And of course the horrible cr*p like ACORN payoffs were taken out .
2 ) “ Failure to respond to democrat accusations “ Republicans are responsible ” for sub - prime debacle “ That was a trap that would lead him to defend the Bush administration .
Obama would love that - McBush .
McCain , correctly , has surmised that he will emphasize his maverick go - it - his - way country - first approach .
McCain has alrady brought up how he advocated reform of Fannie Mae and Democrats blocked it .
3 ) “ Failure to respond to defeatist democrats - Again , Barack Obama said twice nobody was talking defeat , and McCain missed an incredible opportunity to hang defeatism around Obama ’s neck . ”
Last night Sarah Palin called the Obama plan the ‘ white flag of surrender ’ , and last Friday McCain said that Obama ’s plan had it been enacted would have lost the war .
They are making the point that Obama ’s policies are dead wrong .
I think your comments are off - base .
He has had a surprisingly capable campaign .
Some misses , but many hits .
And John McCain is behind but still in the game .
If you want John McCain to win , carry the message that Obama will do all those bad things you speak of to the media - letters to editor etc .

“ Yes , it did strike me that the McCain handlers must have firmly warned her not to attack Obama for his role in bringing on the subprime crisis . ”
Someone speculated that maybe McCain is waiting for the bill to pass the House , and then will unleash .
That ’s possible , because its a ( good ) campaign strategy of theirs that they go a bit soft first and then unleash the full volley after initial softening up .
“ Meantime , I sure think we need to keep Obama out of the White House , and electing McCain no longer means that we are destroying the party , with Palin in the wings . ”
Correct .

“ The President needs to turn the lights back on in the Oval Office and address the nation in short order , \ " Rep. Rahm Emanuel said .
Dems accuse Bush of hiding
After eight years of jabbing at President Bush , House and Senate Democrats have seized on a new theme :
He ’s hiding behind Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in pushing the bank bailout plan .
“ An economy in crisis can not be led by a silent president , ” Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill. ) , the fourth - ranking Democrat in the House , said in a statement labeled “ President Bush ’s Lack of Leadership . ”
“ The president needs to turn the lights back on in the Oval Office and address the nation in short order . ”

Paulson , a former Goldman Sachs chairman , remains popular on Wall Street .
Bush has kept an extremely low profile since markets tumbled a week ago .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) took a similar approach with a statement over the weekend .
“ I call on the president to better explain to the public the severity of the threat all Americans face , and why he believes his approach is needed , ” Reid said .
By undermining Bush , Democrats are able to put some distance between themselves and the administration without directly attacking a plan that the nation ’s financial leadership has said is necessary to avoid a credit meltdown .
Just when it seemed that contaminated vegetables posed a bigger risk of food poisoning than eating meat , along comes a pathogen that will only attack those of us who are carnivores .
The bacterium – a strain of Escherichia coli – makes a toxin that does its worst by latching onto a sugar molecule that humans do n’t have naturally .
We can , only acquire it by eating red meat or dairy products .
“ This toxin originally evolved to attack cattle or some other animals , ” says Ajit Varki , an expert in molecular medicine at the University of California , San Diego , who was involved in the study .
By eating the toxin ’s intended target we made ourselves vulnerable too , he says .
When unlucky meat - eaters ingest this particular E. coli strain , its toxin kills the cells that line the gut , eventually causing bloody diarrhoea , Varki says .
It also heads for blood vessels and the kidneys .
Advertisement
Along with colleagues in Australia , Varki has discovered that the bacterium has a penchant for a particular version of a type of sugar called sialic acid .
All animals adorn their cells with different sialic acids , which are important for cell - to - cell communication .
Bacteria have evolved to recognise the sugars , and use them as gateways for injecting their toxins .
A perfect fit
Varki ’s team discovered that one E. coli toxin attaches best to a sialic acid called GC .
Molecular mapping of the toxin showed that it fits snugly with the sugar molecule to ease entry into the cell .
Our ancestors lost the genes to produce GC some 2 million years ago , perhaps as a defence against an ape version of malaria .
This leaves meat and dairy as the only source , Varki says .
To demonstrate that humans could add the sugar to their own cells , Varki consumed some pure GC .
“ It showed up in my urine and got incorporated into my facial hair , ” he says .
“ I stopped eating red meat after that . ”
He estimates that the average American ingests about 20 milligrams of GC each day .
This could be enough to give the bacteria a pathway into the cells lining our gut , though Varki has n”t tried that test on himself .
He has , however , shown that human cells grown in the lab become far more sensitive to the toxin when GC is included in their growth medium .
From this he reckons that people who eat red meat and dairy products will be about 10 times more susceptible to infection by this strain of E. coli than those who do n’t .
“ It ’s a sort of worst of all worlds if you ’re a human and you eat some of this stuff , ” says Paul Crocker , who investigates the biological role of sugars at the University of Dundee , UK .
Animals that produce GC naturally have the sugar in blood serum , where it mops up the toxin and keeps it out of the gut .
Varki suggests that other ailments could also be due to GC from meat and dairy as the immune system mounts a response against it .
“ We think other diseases associated with red meat – cancer , heart attack and autoimmunity – may be explained by this ongoing reaction . ”

But mostly , they are targeting the Republicans who they thought were their friends .
Who could ever imagine the US Chamber of Commerce targeting Republicans ?
This only shows how far out of the mainstream the GOP has become with a little help from John McCain .
When the $ 700 billion Wall Street rescue plan went up in smoke on Monday , House Republicans who opposed it immediately got a threatening e-mail — from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
“ KEY VOTE ALERT ! ” the headline read in GREAT BIG PRINT .
“ Make no mistake : When the aftermath of congressional inaction becomes clear , Americans will not tolerate those who stood by and let the calamity happen , ” it continued .
“ The Chamber will score votes on , or in relation to , this issue in our annual How They Voted scorecard , ” read its closing , underlined and bold - printed final sentence .
The implicit threat : A bad rating on that scorecard could mean a loss of campaign cash , direct mail and any other help the deep - pocketed Chamber can deliver to lawmakers in tight races .
To be fair , the alert was delivered to all lawmakers .
But it carried its biggest sting in the Republican caucus , which has long relied on the Chamber for political support .

Six people have died in a gun battle outside the US consulate in the Turkish city of Istanbul .
The city 's governor , Muammer Guler , said three policemen and three attacking gunmen were killed .
No injuries were reported to staff inside the consulate .
The US ambassador to Turkey condemned it as " an obvious act of terrorism " aimed at the US .
A fourth gunman and the driver of a vehicle that dropped off the attackers at the consulate reportedly escaped .
One of them approached a policeman while hiding his gun and shot him in the head
Yavuz Erkut Yuksel
Al - Qaeda ' linked to attack '
Reports quoted police sources as saying the suspects belonged to a Turkish Sunni Islamic fundamentalist group , says David O'Byrne in Istanbul .
The Great Eastern Islamic Raiders Front is thought to have links to al - Qaeda , says our correspondent .
The consulate was moved from the centre of Istanbul to a hill on the northern outskirts of the city following the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US .
' Cowardly and dastardly ' A witness to the attack , Yavuz Erkut Yuksel , said the attackers had initially emerged from a car and surprised the police officers guarding the building .
" One of them approached a policeman while hiding his gun and shot him in the head , " he told CNN - Turk .
Governor Guler said : " There is no doubt this was a terrorist attack . "
The US ambassador to Turkey , Ross Wilson , said : " It is enough to say they are terrorists who carried out a cowardly and dastardly attack . "
Turkish President Abdullah Gul said : " Turkey will fight to the end against those who are behind them . "
Turkey has seen armed attacks from a variety of groups in recent years .
The most deadly was in November 2003 , when 58 people were killed by Islamist militants in suicide bombings outside two synagogues , the British consulate and a British bank in Istanbul .
The Kurdish rebels of the PKK have also been blamed for several attacks , including a car bombing that killed six people in the city of Diyarbakir in January .

IXs Research has developed a talking robotic teddy bear that not only gives you directions , it 'll tell you when you 've had too much to drink .
The prototype navi - bear features an alcohol - detection sensor embedded in its neck .
If it catches a whiff of the one you had for the road , it 'll ask , " You have n't been drinking , have you ? "
Accelerate too hard or brake too quickly and it yells , " Watch out ! "
That would be enough to warrant tossing navi - bear straight out the window , but it 's got one thing going for it – not only does it tell you how to get where you 're going , it points the way .
According to the U.S. distributor , KumoTek , Teddy Bear Robot incorporates a Fujitsu navigation system that provides voice guidance .
TomTom already offers celebrity voices ranging from Mr. T ( " I pity the fool who do n't turn right ! " ) to Dennis Hopper .
But this is the first time anyone 's had a teddy bear tell you where to go .
Providing you do n't tell it where to go first .
The prototype has six joints in its arms and neck so it can point the way and make gestures while giving you directions and screaming things like " Watch out ! "
Pat it on the head and it'll tell you where you are .
It 's even got optical sensors to remind you that it 's dark and you should turn on your headlights .
KumoTek says the bear will be available in Japan soon , and the head of iXs Research says the company would like to offer robotic navigation systems " in other shapes and characters . "
No word yet whether any of them will wag a finger in your face when you 've had one too many or flip off that driver who cut you off .

Investigators found 82 instances of former security officers whose uniforms were not returned or could not be accounted for .
• TSA employee identification cards were not adequately monitored .
WASHINGTON 
The agency overseeing security at the nation 's airports failed for years to track security passes and uniforms of former employees , creating widespread vulnerability to terrorists , says a government watchdog report obtained by USA TODAY .
The Transportation Security Administration lacked centralized controls over the secure passes issued to some of its employees , according to Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Richard Skinner .
The passes grant people access to the most sensitive areas of an airport , such as where baggage is screened or planes are parked .
Investigators found numerous cases in which former employees retained their passes long after they had left the agency .
The investigation also found that TSA uniforms were frequently not collected when employees left or were transferred .
People using improper badges , IDs or uniforms — particularly in combination — " could significantly increase an airport 's vulnerability to unauthorized access and , potentially , a wide variety of terrorist and criminal acts , " the report said .
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson , D - Miss. , said the findings confirm his fears that there is inadequate oversight of who gets into airports .
" The risk of unauthorized access to the secure areas of our airports is unacceptable , " Thompson said in a statement .
Thompson supported legislation that increased scrutiny of airport workers after employees were caught smuggling weapons and drugs into secure areas .
TSA chief Kip Hawley says the agency agrees with most of the inspector general 's findings and began following the recommendations from investigators before the report was completed .
The agency is tightening oversight of security passes , requiring collection of passes from officers who leave the agency and improving tracking of employee uniforms .
" While we believe the … report overstates deficiencies as well as any potential associated security risk , we share the interest in improving our processes , " Hawley wrote in response to the report .

She says her kids ask , ' Why are Shrek and Fiona married and you 're not ? ' "
Angelina Jolie says that her priorities have changed from career to motherhood since giving birth to twins in July .
“ The kids are my priority , so it ’s possible that from now on I will make fewer movies .
I may even stop altogether , ” Jolie tells the Italian edition of Vanity Fair .
“ I no longer have the ambition I had in my 20s . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Jolie , 33 , who spoke to the magazine while promoting her new movie Changeling , says that as she has had more children , she ’s come into her own as a mother .
“ In reality my life is a lot more chaotic and adventurous now .
Brad [ Pitt ] and I pilot airplanes , we travel non-stop , we go to difficult places and we have chosen to do it taking all of the kids with us , ” said the mother of six .
“ I feel a lot braver now than when I was an angry young woman . ”
Out of Shell
Of her past , she says , “ I knew little about the world and I was completely self - absorbed .
It was only when I came out of my shell and started taking care of others that I found the real Angelina . ”
Jolie says her children have inherited her taste for globe - trotting .
“ Sure I am still restless , but do you know that my kids are the same way ?
We were in France these last few months and after a while they started asking when we could get back on a plane . ”
That curiosity about the world is a value she wants her kids to maintain throughout their lives .
“ I want them to be able to walk through a marketplace in Adis Ababa and not bat and eye , not think it is dirty and ugly , but that it just represents another part of the world and humanity . ”
Altar - Bound ?
Asked if she plans to make an honest man out of Brad Pitt , the actress hints that they may end up tying the knot – under pressure from the kids .
“ Usually people fall in love and everything revolves around the ritual of marriage , children are an afterthought .
We did everything backwards , ” says Jolie .

Still , said Ken Doctor , a newspaper analyst at Outsell Inc. , most newspapers cannot give up paper .
Print editions still bring in 92 percent of the overall revenue , according to the Newspaper Association of America .
“ If that much revenue is tied up in the print product , if tomorrow these companies dropped those editions , they would have 90 percent less revenue , ” Mr. Doctor said .
While getting rid of costs like printing plants and delivery trucks would help a little , he said , it would not make up for the lost revenue .
Mr. Yemma said that print did bring in money at The Monitor , but most of that was from subscriptions , not advertising .
Subscriptions account for about $ 9 million of The Monitor ’s revenue , while print advertising makes up less than $ 1 million .
Web revenue is about $ 1.3 million , he said .
He is projecting that circulation revenue will drop , but he expects the magazine format will appeal to print advertisers .
He is planning cuts , too .
Mr. Yemma said he was planning some layoffs on both the 100 - person editorial side and the 30 - person business side .
“ I ’m not sure the same number of people will be needed , ” he said , but “ there ’s certainly nothing like a draconian cut coming . ”
Under the new system , reporters will be expected to file stories to the Web and update them a few times a day , and write longer pieces for the weekend magazine .

The new online focus will allow the paper to keep eight foreign bureaus open .
Mr. Yemma said he hoped to establish CSMonitor.com as an essential place for international news .
The site now gets about three million page views a month , according to comScore , and Mr. Yemma said he wanted to increase that to 20 million to 30 million a month in the next five years .
Even if he can fill the site only with remnant , cheap ads , he said , if visits grow as he is projecting , “ that ’s a sustainable model . ”

GAP Projects
In studying abstract algebra , the process of experimentation , conjecture , and proof is strongly inhibited by a lack of data .
While it is true that a good textbook will contain many well - known examples , those examples are usually introduced in the context of a single specific topic .
Exploring an example in more depth or in a different context typically requires a prohibitive amount of computation .
What follows are six computer - based projects designed to enhance student exploration and understanding by making examples , data , and computations more accessible to students .
The projects were used as a supplement to a first - semester Abstract Algebra course .
They rely on the software package GAP ( Groups , Algorithms , and Programming ) , a freely distributed program designed to handle large computations within and relating to groups .

Google has put itself in charge of policing Android devices .
The search giant is retaining the right to delete applications from Android handsets on a whim .
Unlike Apple , the company has made no attempt to hide its intentions , and includes the details in the Android Market terms and conditions , as spotted by Computer World :
Google may discover a product that violates the developer distribution agreement ... in such an instance , Google retains the right to remotely remove those applications from your device at its sole discretion .
But the existence of the capability opens more questions about the platform .
The clause only covers applications distributed through the Android Market , but the whole point of Android is that anyone can distribute any applications they like .
Mobile publisher Handango has already stated it will be selling Android applications through its web site .
So will Google be able to remove applications installed by someone else ?
We 've asked Handango and the Open Handset Alliance ( nominal owners of Android ) , but have n't heard back as yet .
Such a mechanism also implies that Android devices will be regularly reporting back to Google to download the latest list of unapproved applications .
Quite how that will operate is n't clear , but we 've asked the questions and look forward to letting you know exactly how much control Google will be exerting over the G1 once we hear back . ®
Ruby DSLs : instance_eval with delegation
I saw the warning issued on Ola 's blog : do n't overuse instance_eval .
JEG II blogged about a compromise , and why had an idea .
But I like variation of Jim Weirich's MethodDirector .
how instance_eval works
If you 're not familiar with instance_eval , it evaluates a block of code with self set to the object that 's receiving the instance_eval call .
Here 's an example .
add_two = Proc .
new { self + 2 } puts 1 . instance_eval ( & add_two ) puts 2 . instance_eval ( & add_two )
Here 's a second example using an implicit method receiver .
call_reverse = Proc .
new { reverse } p " abc " . instance_eval ( & call_reverse ) p [ " x " , " y " , " z " ] . instance_eval ( & call_reverse )
the problem with instance_eval
Ola described it really well , so I 'm just going to quote him and then show an example .
So what 's the problem with it ?
Well , the problem is that blocks are generally closures .
And you expect them to actually be full closures .
And it 's not obvious from the point where you write the block that that block might not be a full closure .
That 's what happens when you use instance_eval : you reset the self of that block into something else - this means that the block is still a closure over all local variables outside the block , but NOT for method calls .
I do n't even know if constant lookup is changed or not .
Using instance_eval changes the rules for the language in a way that is not obvious when reading a block .
You need to think an extra step to figure out exactly why a method call that you can lexically see around the block can actually not be called from inside of the block .
Here 's an example .
Let 's take a look at a quasi migration using create_table and _not_ using instance_eval .
class MyMigration < MigrationExample def self .up create_table " people " do | t | t . string " first_name " , " last_name " end end end
To implement this , we could need t to reference a TableDefinition class that would be used to build up columns .
But we could get rid of t if we were to use instance_eval .
Because instance_eval could change self to reference the TableDefinition , we could use the implicit method receiver and change the migration to look something like this .
class MyMigration < MigrationExample def self .up create_table " people " do string " first_name " , " last_name " end end end
But let 's take a look at the consequences of this approach .
Here 's a little fake migration class that just prints output .
class MigrationExample def self .
create_table ( table_name , & block ) table = TableDefinition .
new table_name table .
evaluate & block table .
create end end class TableDefinition def initialize ( table_name , & block ) @table_name = table_name @columns = [ ] end def evaluate ( & block ) instance_eval & block end def string (* columns ) @columns << columns end def create puts " creating the ' #{@table_name} ' table with columns : #{@columns.join ( " , " ) } " end end
So here we 're using instance_eval to evaluate the block passed to create_table .
And if we run the migration , we 'll see that the table gets created .
MyMigration.up # => creating the ' people ' table with columns : first_name , last_name
But what happens if we want to use a little helper method in our migration ?
Let 's try it by doing something completely trivial and extracting a name method .
class MyMigration & lt ; MigrationExample def self .up create_table " people " do string name ( " first " ) , name ( " last " ) end end def self .
name ( which ) " # {which} _name " end end
And now if we run the migration ...
MyMigration.up # NoMethodError : undefined method ' name ' for #< TableDefinition:0x89e18 @columns= [ ] , @table_name= " people " >
Ouch .
Because self is set to the TableDefinition class while instance_evaling the block , our method call to name was sent to the table definition object instead of our migration class .
Here 's one approach to solve this problem .
instance_eval + delegation
So the problem is that instance_eval hijacks self , making our method call to name fail .
But what if we can get the name call sent back to the object that it would have gone to if we did n't change self ?
We can accomplish this by capturing what self is before we change it with instance_eval .
Then if our class does n't respond to a method , we 'll assume it was meant for the original receiver .
class TableDefinition def evaluate ( & block ) @self_before_instance_eval = eval " self " , block .
binding instance_eval & block end def method_missing ( method , * args , & block ) @self_before_instance_eval .
send method , * args , & block end end
Looking at the create_table block again ...
create_table " people " do string name ( " first " ) , name ( " last " ) end
The call to string will be called on TableDefinition .
But the name method call will hit method missing and be delegated back to the migration .
Here 's the output if we run the migration again .
MyMigration.up # creating the ' people ' table with columns : first_name , last_name
We 've removed the need for the block local variable t , but also preserved the capability to use local helper methods .

This is a great article by Thom Hartmann .
He is one of the most well - reasoned , logical , well - versed - in - history , deep thinkers I have listened to .

For Grover “ Drown Government In The Bathtub ” Norquist , this bailout deal will work out very well .
At a proposed cost of $ 4,780 per taxpayer , it ’ll further the David Stockman strategy of so indebting us that the next president wo n’t have the luxury of even thinking of new social spending ( expanding health care , social security , education , infrastructure , etc. ) ; taxes will even have to be raised just to pay for the bailout .
It ’ll debase our currency , driving up commodity prices and interest rates , which will benefit the Investor Class while further impoverishing the pesky Middle Class , rendering them less prone to protest ( because they ’re so busy working trying to pay off their debt ) .
It ’ll create stagflation for at least the next half decade , which can be blamed on Democrats who currently control Congress and , should Obama be elected , be blamed on him .
But there ’s another way : Create an agency to fund the bailout , loan that agency the money from the treasury , and then have that agency tax Wall Street to pay us ( the treasury ) back .
It ’s been done before , and has several benefits .
In the United Kingdom , for example , whenever you buy or sell a share of stock ( or a credit swap or a derivative , or any other activity of that sort ) you pay a small tax on the transaction .
We did the same thing here in the US from 1914 to 1966 ( and , before that , we did it to finance the Spanish American War and the Civil War ) .
For us , this Securities Turnover Excise Tax ( STET ) was a revenue source .
For example , if we were to instate a .25 percent STET ( tax ) on every stock , swap , derivitive , or other trade today , it would produce – in its first year – around $ 150 billion in revenue .
Wall Street would be generating the money to fund its own bailout .
( For comparison , as best I can determine , the UK ’s STET is .25 percent , and Taiwan just dropped theirs from .60 to .30 percent . )
But there are other benefits .

Sweaty , hot , and gross after biking to work ?
Cyclists in Minneapolis now have a better option than sponge baths in the restroom : The Freewheel Midtown Bike Center , where riders can take a shower , access lockers , lock up their bikes , and enjoy discounts on tune - ups and rentals .
A shower costs $ 3 per day , or cyclists can shell out $ 110 to join the Commuter Club , which covers all costs and gives them priority access to lockers and showers , as well as 24 - hour bike - storage benefits .
Freewheel , located right on the Midtown Greenway , was inspired by a city - run enterprise in Chicago .
The Minneapolis effort was spearheaded by small - business owner Kevin Ishaug , who opened the center as the second outpost of his five - year - old Freewheel Bike Shop .
His timing could n't have been better : Traffic on the bike path spiked 30 % in the first half of 2008 .
" We are the first private company to provide these kinds of services for bikers , " says Ishaug , who anticipates revenues of $ 400,000 for the center 's first six months .
" During the first week we opened , we had 67 people sign up in one day . "
Even Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak regularly frequents the depot for his morning coffee and energy bar .
" We all love bikers , but we do n't always love the way they smell , " he says .
" The new center has been extraordinarily successful , especially because it opened right as we came into the summer of soaring gas prices , causing the biking population to go off the charts . "

The crown jewel of Greenpeace ’s naval arm , the Rainbow Warrior , pulled in to the harbor alongside the Kingsnorth coal - fired power plant today before six activists stormed the facility to prepare to project video of impacts of global warming onto the plant ’s giant smokestack.[social_buttons ]
The action comes mere months after a jury acquitted Greenpeace protesters who had vandalized the same smokestack .
The court ruled that the activists were acting in the public ’s interest because the power plant will cause property destruction in the future due to its release of climate - changing greenhouse gases .
So far , Greenpeace says there have been no arrests .
The activists hope to prevent the owners of the plant , E.ON , from going through with their plan to build another coal plant nearby .
Greenpeace says the new plant would spew as much greenhouse gas as the world ’s 30 least - polluting countries combined .
To symbolize this , 30 volunteers carried the flags of those countries into the power plant .
Two of the protesters were among the original ‘ Kingsnorth Six , ’ who were acquitted of all wrongdoing amid controversy this summer .
Police have not reported whether the activists will face charges for today ’s action .
You can follow any developments through Greenpeace UK ’s website .

He did n’t talk much , at home , about what he did “ in theatre . ”
On one tour , his unit was assigned to guard the United States Embassy , a task that included searching Baghdad , both on foot and in mechanized patrols , for insurgents launching attacks on the Green Zone .
On another tour , in 2005 - 06 , his unit spent seven months fighting in Saqlawiyah , northwest of Falluja , in Anbar Province .
Mike Tucker , an embedded writer and former marine who went on patrol with Twiggs , wrote , in “ Ronin , ” a book published last January , that Twiggs was “ regarded in the U.S. military as one of the best combat trackers alive . ”
His men adored him , Tucker said .
Travis never doubted the wisdom of the war , Kellee said , and he was frustrated by the press coverage it got .
“ He could see how it was helping people .
But all they showed were the bad things .
His thing was , everybody flew flags after 9/11 for seven , eight months .
Then it got ‘ old . ’
He was pissed about that .
Americans did n’t appreciate the military .
Then , after his third tour , we ’d be watching the news and there would be some horrible American shit going on — some adoption - fraud scam , or some people who threw a baby into a lake in a garbage bag .
And Tebeaux would just start crying and shouting , ‘ What the fuck am I fighting for ? ’ ”
Kellee said , “ Nobody even noticed it in Two - Six ” — Travis ’s battalion — “ but I did .
He got so twitchy , it became impossible to cuddle with him .
He loved movies , but he could n’t sit still to watch one .
You could just see the wheels turning .
You wanted to keep him busy , keep him talking about things so he would n’t start talking about other things .
He ’d get upset when people asked him stupid things , like did he kill anybody , and he would n’t talk , but other times he ’d start talking about I.E.D.s , and how horrible they were , how they put soap in them , so it sticks to you , and how they can detonate them with anything — a cell phone , a walkie - talkie .
He ’d hear a car coming up our gravel road here and he ’d just hit the floor , just bam , because the tires crunching sounded like machine - gun fire to him .
Or he ’d just go sit upstairs and watch for lights — watch for Iraqis , because that ’s what he used to do in Iraq .
I ’d call his name , get him back to bed , and the only way I could get him to sleep was to put him in a bear hug and rock him .
Then he ’d sleep .
But as soon as I moved he ’d wake up . ”
Travis started drinking heavily , and having trouble concentrating .
“ His therapy was to cut the grass , with his iPod on , ” Kellee told me .
“ He did that a lot . ”
It was dark now , with a full moon rising .
Kellee had n’t touched her food .
“ He volunteered , ” she said .
“ We volunteered .
He did what he did because he was fucking awesome , and he kicked ass because he loved his country .
And when he got sick , got saddened , his government , his Marine Corps , let him down . ”
She started to cry .
“ He was so beautiful , ” she said .
It has been called by different names — shell shock , battle fatigue — in different eras , but P.T.S.D. , in its combat form , has been around for as long as war has .
Odysseus and his men had it .
Although Twiggs used the word “ paranoid ” to describe his mood when he was Stateside , the more accurate term , used by P.T.S.D. researchers , might be “ hypervigilance ” — a normal adaptive strategy for surviving combat , except that the “ on ” switch is not easily turned off .
Dr. Jonathan Shay , a P.T.S.D. specialist , thinks that even calling it a disorder is misleading : P.T.S.D. is an injury .
There are degrees of damage , ranging from standard combat stress , which can be treated with a few days ’ rest , to full - blown complex P.T.S.D. , which is very difficult to treat , let alone cure .
It is best understood , though , as a psychic wound , one that can be crippling , even fatal , in its myriad complications .
Compared with other American wars , the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan seem to be producing victims at a high rate .
A recent RAND Corporation study estimated that three hundred thousand veterans of America ’s post - 9/11 wars — nearly twenty per cent of those who have served — are suffering from P.T.S.D. or major depression , and many more cases are expected to surface in the years ahead .
This elevated rate is generally attributed to the rigors of a long war being fought without conscription : multiple deployments and heavy use of National Guard and reserve units .
And on the ground , at unit level , the discouragement of anyone with stress symptoms from asking for help is intense .
The same RAND study found that , mainly because of the stigma still attached to P.T.S.D. , only half of those afflicted have sought treatment .
The suicide rate among veterans and active - duty military personnel has been rising as well .
The number of soldiers who killed themselves last year was the highest since the Army began keeping records , in 1980 .
When Dr. Ira Katz , the Department of Veterans Affairs chief of mental services , learned earlier this year that preliminary internal reports suggested that a thousand veterans in V.A. care were attempting suicide each month , he sent a colleague an e-mail saying , “ Shh ! . . .
Is this something we should ( carefully ) address ourselves in some sort of release before somebody stumbles on it ? ”
Another e-mail , written in March , 2008 , by Dr. Norma J. Perez , a P.T.S.D. program coördinator in Texas , said , “ Given that we are having more and more compensation seeking veterans , I ’d like to suggest that you refrain from giving a diagnosis of PTSD straight out . ”
Robert Gates , the Secretary of Defense , is said to be considering making some P.T.S.D. sufferers eligible for the Purple Heart .
Wounded veterans are symbolically popular figures , if individually painful , and sometimes frightening .
Certainly , most politicians want to be associated with their cause .
And yet the difficulty of maintaining the troop levels necessary for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has placed the Bush Administration at odds with veterans ’ groups .
All such organizations supported what became known as the New G.I. Bill , which would provide increased education benefits .
The Administration opposed it , on the ground that the appeal of a college education might sap troop levels .
John McCain , himself a veteran , agreed .
Ultimately , at the end of June , President Bush signed a modified version of the bill .
In the Marine Corps , the Wounded Warrior Regiment , created in 2007 , marks a step toward the assumption of longer - term institutional responsibility for casualties , both physical and mental .
“ Used to be , we met them at the hospital door , shook their hand , thanked them for their service , gave them a discharge , and said goodbye , ” Colonel Greg Boyle , the regiment ’s commander , told me .
“ Now it ’s marine for life . ”
Boyle did not mean that there would always be a place , a job , for disabled marines but that his regiment would track them and offer support throughout their post - discharge lives .
P.T.S.D. victims are among those for whom the regiment is designed .
It was Boyle who decided to send Travis Twiggs to the White House .
“ Nice guy .
I liked him , ” Boyle said .
Travis Twiggs did n’t announce his P.T.S.D. at first .
When he returned from Iraq in 2006 , after his third tour there , he was transferred to the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory , at Quantico .
His superiors believed that his extensive field experience would be useful in the evaluation of new weapons systems and equipment .
But without his beloved combat platoon , Kellee said , Travis was bereft : “ He felt like he was n’t in the Marines anymore . ”
And , at his office job in Virginia , his P.T.S.D. quickly became impossible to ignore .
His sergeant major recognized the symptoms , and , in June , sent him to a physician ’s assistant , who prescribed the antidepressants Zoloft and trazodone .
Antidepressants and antipsychotics are the main drugs used to control P.T.S.D.
But , while his medications were being evaluated and adjusted , Twiggs was , by his own account , blunting their effect by mixing them with alcohol .
He told Kellee that he could n’t stand to look in a mirror .
He was racked with guilt , in particular over the deaths of two young lance corporals in his platoon .
The only thing that really helped , he wrote , was returning to Iraq .
He went , in late 2006 , on a weapons - testing mission for the Warfighting Lab , and , once again , his symptoms vanished .
He was n’t fighting , but at least he was in theatre .
He was also good at his job .
But once he was home , in January , 2007 , “ he went batshit , ” Kellee said .
His P.T.S.D.— anger , sadness , drinking , flashbacks — took a toll on their marriage .
She went to counselling for P.T.S.D. spouses — sessions led by Travis ’s therapist .
“ I did n’t really see the point , ” she says now .
“ I mean , a twenty - two - year - old girl gets up and says , ‘ He ’s got guns all over the house , including a 9 - mm .
he puts between the mattress and the box spring .
And one night I woke up and he had the gun up to my head , calling me an Iraqi .
So I had to talk him all through that , and get him to put the gun down . ’
How long do you think that marriage will last ? ”
Travis soon landed in a locked ward at Bethesda Naval Hospital .
“ At Bethesda I was not exactly a model patient , ” he wrote in his article .
“ I was experiencing psychosis where I would fight my way through the hallways and clear rooms as if I were back in theater .
The hospital police would have to be called in to secure me . ”
He was later transferred to a veterans ’ hospital in West Virginia , where he saw several doctors , “ and it seemed that each one had a different medicine .
I often wondered if they ever talked with each other . ”
At one point , he wrote , he was taking twelve different medications a day — Kellee recalls the number reaching nineteen , and says that the drugs turned her husband into “ a zombie ” — “ and I was experiencing visual and audible hallucinations that I firmly believe were a direct result of being overmedicated .
On any given day I was sad , mad , or depressed .
I often felt that I was weak and not worthy of calling myself a Marine anymore .
I slept covered in sweat every night and constantly shook uncontrollably .
I got to the point where I believed PTSD was nothing more than an acronym created for weak Marines . ”
This was raw , vivid stuff for the Marine Corps Gazette .
Twiggs went on to describe his recovery , through therapy and reduced medication , and wrote , “ I am back doing what I do best and what brings me the most enjoyment — training Marines and sailors . ”
He offered bullet - point advice to policymakers and P.T.S.D. sufferers , and included his e-mail address in case anyone in trouble wanted to contact him .
But the article was primarily confessional : “ My only regrets are how I let my command down after they had put so much trust in me and how I let my family down by pushing them away . ”
His P.T.S.D. was “ not completely gone , ” he wrote , but “ life with my family is wonderful again . ”
Twiggs was sought after as a motivational speaker , and he became the Wounded Warrior Regiment ’s P.T.S.D. poster child .
His symptoms , however , returned .
He became impossible to live with .
He was sent back to Bethesda Naval Hospital and was once again , Kellee thinks , overmedicated .
The experience that continued to cut Travis Twiggs most deeply was the loss of Jared Kremm and Robert Eckfield , Jr. , the young lance corporals in his platoon .
They were killed at Saqlawiyah , on October 27 , 2005 .
Golf Company ’s firebase was an old Baath Party hotel near a main supply route to Jordan and Syria .
The hotel compound was taking daily rocket and mortar attacks from Al Qaeda in Iraq and from the Black Flags Brigades , a Sunni insurgent group .
Twiggs was leading foot patrols through villages and along the banks of the Euphrates , searching for insurgents and for weapons caches .
He was in his element .
But some of the facilities at the hotel were poorly secured .
There was no running water , and portable toilets had been set out in tents in the compound .
These outhouses were vulnerable ;
Twiggs later told Kellee that he thought that the toilets should not have been outside at all , but in some downwind corner of the sprawling hotel — the stench would be worth the increased security .
But he was not the commanding officer on the base .
Still , experienced noncommissioned officers regularly let their superiors know what they should be doing .
His unit had been at Saqlawiyah for only a month when Kremm and Eckfield took a direct mortar hit in the rest - room tents .
Twiggs was one of the first on the scene .
Kremm had been hit in the face ;
Twiggs watched him die .
Eckfield was alive but had severe head wounds .
Eckfield was transported to a hospital near Falluja , and died that night .
Kremm was twenty - five .
He was from Hauppauge , Long Island , where he had been a high - school football star .
Eckfield was twenty - three , and from Ohio .
Twiggs had trained them both at Camp Lejeune , where they had been regulars at his and Kellee ’s house .
The Defense Department announced that they had died “ from an indirect fire explosion , ” and gave their families uninformative explanations .
Christopher Lowman , who was one of Twiggs ’s closest friends , and who was also a staff sergeant in Two - Six — he is now a gunnery sergeant , and back in Iraq — told me , “ When you train these boys , you tell them every day , ‘ You do what I tell you , exactly what I tell you , and I will get you home . ’ ” Mike Tucker talked to Twiggs the night that Kremm and Eckfield died , and later wrote , in an e-mail , “ Something broke in Travis . . . .
That night , he told me , ‘ I feel responsible for their deaths . ’ ” On a tribute Web site , FallenHeroesMemorial.com , Twiggs wrote , “ I wish that I could erase that horrible day from my memory . . . but I can ’t . ”
Travis ’s family , most of whom live in and around New Orleans , remained largely unaware of his struggles .
His brother Will was an exception .
Will came to Bethesda and spent a week at Travis ’s bedside in March .
In a journal that he kept on Navy Lodge stationery , Will wrote , “ My loyalty has unequivocally been to Tebeaux .
I hope God does n’t take him away from me too . ”
“ Will thought of Tebeaux as a hero , ” Kellee said .
“ And it really bothered him when he realized how bad he was hurting . ”
“ Everybody was crazy about Will except Will , ” Nancy Twiggs said .
She is Will and Travis ’s stepmother .
She and Douglas reared them both , for the most part , in Ama , Louisiana , twenty miles upriver from New Orleans .
They still live there , in a one - story brick house with a big yard backing onto a patch of woods .
Nancy put on a video of Will , eleven years old and flaxen - haired , competing in a citywide spelling bee .
He gets “ aphasia ” right , then wins it with “ ineluctable . ”
Travis , age nine , rushes onto the stage and hugs his brother .
After the video ended , we sat in silence for a minute while Douglas and Nancy composed themselves .
“ It ’s like they ’re still here , ” Nancy said .
“ We thought Will might be a sportswriter , ” Douglas said .
Nancy and Douglas Twiggs are hospitable , heartbroken people .
Will , they say , was a devoted , protective older brother .
He and Travis were especially close .
Each could mimic the other ’s voice , and , even as adults , they liked to trick people over the phone , pretending to be the other .
Will was disappointed , they thought , when Travis , in high school , suddenly decided to go live with their mother , in Miami .
It was the first big decision he had made without consulting Will .
Will joined the Navy out of high school .
In a snapshot taken aboard a ship in San Francisco , he looks , in Navy whites , very young and frail , like a bird that has left the nest too soon .
The physical contrast with Travis , who was six inches shorter but many pounds of muscle heavier , is stark .
Will did not last long in the Navy .
He went to work for a German - owned ship - chartering company in New Orleans , where Douglas , too , worked at the time .
Will did logistics , and seemed to do well , but he turned down the company ’s offer to send him to Hamburg for advanced training .
“ He did n’t want to leave New Orleans , ” Douglas said .
“ Both of his friends lived here . ”
He smiled faintly at the old joke .
A car carrying visiting UK diplomats has been attacked by Israeli settlers in the West Bank town of Hebron .
The armoured car , also carrying a driver and guide , was briefly attacked and kicked , although no - one was hurt .
Israeli police intervened and , according to the guide , the vehicle had been kept in the area for an hour .
Hebron is a flashpoint in the occupied West Bank , having a substantial settler presence living among a larger Palestinian population .
The British Consulate General is now assisting Israeli police investigators .
Hebron is the scene of tensions between Jewish settlers and peace group tours .
A consulate spokesman said three diplomats had been being shown around Hebron by a former Israeli soldier now working for a peace group , Breaking the Silence .
The attack happened in a part of the town considered off - limits to Palestinians .
Increasing tension
A consulate statement said : " The Israeli police intervened and we are assisting them with their investigation of the incident . "
The BBC's Wyre Davies says Hebron , in the south of the West Bank , has seen " increasing tension between peace groups and settlers who live in the central , historic part of the town " .
" The peace groups say they 're trying to show the negative impact of the Israeli occupation on local Palestinian residents , " he said .
" For the settlers , Hebron , and its ancient sites , is inherently Jewish and is somewhere they have vowed to remain . "
About 500 mostly hardline Israeli settlers live in an enclave in the city of about 150,000 Arabs .
Israel occupied the West Bank along with East Jerusalem during the 1967 war and has since settled more than 400,000 of its citizens there .
The area is also home to about 2.5 million Palestinians .
EFi-X is the latest commercial product to allow PCs to boot Mac OS X .
A company called Psystar made headlines in April when it introduced its " Open Computer " which was built from generic PC parts and also allowed users to boot Mac OS X Leopard .
Psystar advertised the computer as an affordable alternative to an official Apple Mac.
Psystar would install a modified version of Mac OS X on their computers to allow them to boot into Apple 's operating system .
Apple has since sued the company citing copyright infringement .
EFi-X takes a different approach by offering a hardware add - on that allows you to install an unmodified Mac OS X onto certain PC configurations .
EFi-X is offering it as a tool for enthusiasts , and not necessarily for those looking to save money :
EFI -X is not for everyone .
It is not for who wants to save money , at all .
It is for enthusiasts that put expandability and extreme performances before anything else in their computing needs .
We heard those voices , and we answered .
Only specific hardware configurations are supported , but if your PC fits those specifications , the EFi - X add - on promises headache free installation and upgrades .
Gizmodo reviews the EFi - X device and finds it lives up to its promises .
Well , I used it to turn my gaming PC into a Mac Pro over the weekend , and I 'm somewhat amazed to say this , but it works perfectly .
I grabbed all the updates straight from Appleincluding 10.5.5 last night , so you do n't have to wait for a hacked patch like you would running a typical Hackintoshinstalled a whole bunch of software and have been using it for several days .
It runs beautifully , just like a real Mac Pro .
The installation requires you to plug the device straight into the motherboard , and upon boot does slow down the Leopard boot process ( up to 2 minutes ) , but once up and running the experience is described as seamless .
The product sells for $ 155 and is now shipping .
The Lone Ranger McCain Unleashes the Attack Dogs
The mudslinging is starting to get serious in the US election .
John McCain is getting more and more open in his efforts to discredit his rival through dubious accusations .
Hang in there Obama , argues SPIEGEL ONLINE blogger Peter Ross Range .
Breaking : Obama Demands Special Prosecutor Investigate GOP Voter Fraud Activities
Created : October 17 , 2008 15:13 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Charging that the FBI probe of ACORN represents an “ unholy alliance ” between Republican operatives and potentially illegal conduct by law enforcement targeting voter fraud , the Obama campaign demanded Friday that the U.S. special prosecutor looking into the U.S. attorneys scandal investigate the matter .
General counsel Bob Bauer sent a letter to Atty .
Gen. Michael Mukasey charging that coordinated “ misconduct ” by McCain campaign representatives and GOP officials were relevant to the special prosecutor ’s work , because the activities may relate to the dismissal of seven U.S. attorneys in late 2006 .
The letter requests that the special prosecutor ’s inquiry “ include a review of any involvement by Justice Dept. and White House officials in supporting the McCain - Palin campaign [ and RNC's ] systematic development and dissemination of unsupported , spurious allegations of vote fraud . ”
To advance the effort , the Obama campaign convened a conference call with national reporters , though Friday afternoon is not a time that campaigns usually push priority messages .
She was born in High Wycombe , raised in Germany and now her scandalous novel about sex , personal hygiene and almost every conceivable part of the female anatomy has taken the Teutonic literary world by storm .
Charlotte Roche found the inspiration for it while sitting on the loo in a girlfriend 's flat .
Even the cover makes it pretty obvious that her book is designed to provoke .
Its jacket is coloured shocking pink and the title is picked out in the sort of pseudo Gothic script , normally associated with German neo -Nazis .
Above it is a piece of medical sticking plaster , which looks as if it can be pulled off the cover by hand – but in fact forms part of the jacket .
In German the novel is called Feuchtgebiete – a title which will be translated into English as Wetlands when the book is published in Britain and America early next year , although the term really means the moist areas on the female body .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It is the unashamedly shocking aspect of Wetlands that has turned the book into Germany 's current runaway literary success .
Since the novel was published in February this year it has topped the best - seller fiction lists , with well over a million copies sold .
It has become the only German book to top Amazon.com 's global best - seller list , was recently translated into Dutch and is now doing almost as well in Holland .
The novel is both an assault on the sexual and behavioural taboos that inhibit young men and women and an at times excruciatingly explicit account by the female narrator of how she goes about systematically breaking them .
Granta even suggested earlier this year that the work evoked Germaine Greer 's The Female Eunuch but several German critics have dismissed it as pornography .
The saga opens in a hospital ward where the heroine , 18 - year - old Helen Memel , is about to undergo surgery after badly botching an attempt to shave around her haemorrhoids .
Graphic accounts of masturbation , menstruation and lesbian encounters with prostitutes fill the novel 's pages from then on .
Yet Memel never leaves the confines of the hospital as she reflects on female sexuality .
Roche , a successful 30 - year - old television presenter , says that Memel is her alter ego .
She was born in the home counties to British parents .
But the family moved to Germany when she was young after her father was given the job of setting up a Mars bar factory in the state of North Rhine - Westphalia .
She was educated in Germany and went on to present and write programmes for the Viva , Arte and ZDF television channels .
She speaks fluent English , with the tiniest hint of a German accent .
She was given a sizeable advance for a novel , while still working as a presenter , but admits that she never found the inspiration to write anything until she slipped into the lavatory in her best girlfriend 's flat in the very Catholic city of Cologne .
" When I 'm on the loo , I end up reading the blurb on every product I find in there to pass the time , " she told The Independent .
" On this occasion , I picked up a tube of soap and was shocked to discover that it was designed specially for cleaning the vagina .
I began to think – my God , am I the only person left who does n't use pussy soap ? "
She came to the conclusion that a lot of women of her age must have a very messed - up attitude towards their own bodies and had become hygiene - obsessed .
Wetlands is her counter - attack .
It is the debunking of what Roche perceives as the sanitised , Americanised cleanliness rules that millions of women obey daily without even a thought .
On the face of it , it is strange that this kind of social criticism has emerged in Germany , the country renowned outside its own borders for its apparent sexual tolerance , its mega brothels , and penchant for naked bathing .
Not so long ago it was German women above all who foreigners sniggered at for having hairy armpits and legs .
" Not any more , " insists Roche , " I know people of my age who wo n't sleep with each other unless they have removed all the hair from their bodies apart from what 's on their heads , " she adds .
She cites the recent furore that erupted when the Hollywood actress Julia Roberts was pictured exposing a hairy armpit , as a classic example of US hygiene oppression .
A lot of young German women appear to agree with her views .
On a wet evening last Wednesday , Roche appeared on stage in a converted slaughterhouse in the provincial German town of Soest to read from her novel .
The auditorium was packed , mainly with young women in their twenties .
Roche , who is disarmingly small and sometimes speaks with a little girl 's voice , asked those who had read her book to put their hands up – nearly all of them had .
" So you 've turned up to hear the filth all over again and first hand – well you wo n't feel like having supper after listening to this , " she exclaimed to fits of giggles .
Susanne Ahlers , a 25 - year - old trainee teacher , agreed with everything in the book .
" Charlotte Roche is so right – we live in a world in which even having sex has become commercialised and controlled .
Most women are n't even aware of it , but it makes me sick , " she said .
The novel 's explicit descriptions were the reason behind Roche 's failure to sell her manuscript to the German publishers Kiepenhauer and Witsch who had commissioned the novel .
" They told me they could not possibly print it because it was pornography , " she recalled .
So she took it to the Dumont publishing house in Cologne which snapped it up .
After successfully marketing Wetlands in Holland , a decision was taken to publish in Britain and America .
A specialist has been called in to translate all the terms that Roche has invented for parts of the female anatomy she describes in such detail ; " Cauliflower " for piles and " pearl trunk " for clitoris are just a couple of examples .
The author is desperate to avoid " hard words " that might offend the squeamish Brits .
Her guiding principle ?
" When it comes to sex and sexuality – I think virtually every kind of taboo is wrong , " she maintains .
Two major UK ISPs have been ordered by the High Court to hand over the identities of several thousand alleged file - sharers .
BT has confirmed it is involved while Virgin Media was less direct in admitting that lawyers Davenport Lyons , working with Topwear Inc. , are about to start threatening thousands more people .
US game developer Topware Interactive , the people behind the now infamous ‘ Dream Pinball ‘ affair , are about to turn up the heat .
Operating through London lawyers Davenport Lyons , they have managed to convince the High Court to send out an order demanding that ISPs in the UK start to hand over the details of “ several thousand ” alleged pirates .
According to Samknows , BT , one of the UK ’s largest ISPs and like many , currently caught up in the middle of a Davenport Lyons versus P2P battle , confirmed it had been ordered to hand over details of alleged copyright infringing file - sharers .
It could not confirm whether they had already handed over the details or not .
However , BT was surprised at the “ strong arm ” tactics being employed by the games industry , in contrast to the fairly civilized warnings currently touted by the BPI , which were toned - down under duress .
“ It does seem a much more strong arm approach compared to the music industry , ” said the BT spokesman .
“ However , it is only one company pursuing a limited number of miscreants at the moment .
I doubt the music industry will follow suit as the potential numbers are too great , but who knows . ”
Virgin Media was a little more slippery in its response but reading between the lines it seems obvious they are involved too .
While noting that they take the privacy of their customers very seriously , if faced with a court order to hand over names and addresses , they simply have to comply .
Virgin Media also indicated that it prefers the ‘ educational ’ approach , i.e the compromise reached between ISPs and the BPI recently .
Virgin media spokesman told Samknows :
“ We certainly prefer the education route we pioneered with the BPI because you ca n’t assume people are guilty of anything , so we do n’t , we let them know of what might have happened and give information on how to ensure they enjoy legal downloads .
This would definitely seem to be a very different approach from a different industry . ”
I ’m sure it ’s just a slip by the Virgin spokesman but the entire ‘ games industry ’ is n’t taking this aggressive approach against alleged file - sharers .
It is actually just Topware Interactive , and in the other active cases , Atari , Codemasters , Techland and Reality Pump , just a handful of developers .
As a gamer of more than 25 years I agree with the boss of EA Sports , Peter Moore , that it ’s not particularly clever to start taking legal action against your customers .
In a superb article , Rob Fahey over at GamesIndustry .
biz says that he believes the losses claimed by the industry are a ‘ complete crock ‘ and he ’s not on his own .
In any event , if you take a look at the games being ‘ protected ’ in these actions , with the possible exception of Codemasters titles , they ’re mostly second rate and did n’t sell many anyway .
The developers would have everyone believe this is due to file - sharing but people know otherwise .
The suspicion in the file - sharing community is that this is n’t about protection of copyright at all , but a way to make poor games pay .
Any revenue stream in a storm , eh ?
( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain told CNN
Thursday his running mate Sarah Palin will perform well in Thursday night 's vice presidential debate against Democratic rival Joe Biden .
Sen .
John McCain will shift resources from Michigan to other key states , according to campaign aides .
" The fact is she 'll do fine tonight .
She has experience , talent , leadership .
She has great inner strength .
She has -- an ability to lead that 's been proven , taken on her own party , " he said .
" Joe Biden and Barack Obama have never taken on the leaders of their party on any issue .
She 's stood up for what 's right for the people of Alaska .
And she will stand up for what 's right for America . "
The comments come after Palin has faced criticism for her performance during recent interviews with Katie Couric .
In the two separate interviews , Palin had trouble defending McCain 's record on regulation issues , discussing the economic bailout , defining her foreign policy credentials , naming her preferred sources of news , and naming a Supreme Court case she disagrees with .
Asked if Couric 's questions were fair , McCain said he would let the American people decide .
Watch CNN 's Bill Schneider weigh in on the VP debate »
" I know that there have been attacks on Sarah Palin that have been remarkable to me in many ways , but I have total confidence in her .
She 's very comfortable in her own skin , " he said .
Meanwhile , a senior McCain adviser confirms to CNN that the campaign is " shifting resources " from Michigan to Ohio and Pennsylvania , and " opening up an offensive front " in Maine .
Michigan was always a long shot for McCain , who lost the state to native son Mitt Romney in the Republican primary .
A Republican presidential candidate has n't won there in two decades , since George H.W. Bush 's 1988 victory .
But McCain had a surprisingly close showing in some polls , and he made a significant time investment campaigning in the state this year .
Macomb County -- home of the original Reagan Democrats -- was one of the first stops for McCain and his running mate on their post - convention tour of battleground states ; they held a town hall in Grand Rapids two weeks ago .
Local Republican officials told CNN they were thrilled to have Palin on the ticket , saying her accent and love for guns made her someone independents and Democrats uncomfortable with Obama could relate to .
But nowhere does the economy loom larger as an issue than in this hard - hit industrial state , suffering from a decade - long slump .
The Obama campaign has tried to capitalize on the Democratic nominee 's polling advantage on the issue , running ads in the state that accuse McCain of not doing more to protect Michigan jobs .
As the campaign pulls resources from Michigan , it is ramping up its efforts in Maine , where Republican Sen .
Susan Collins is beating national trends in her re-election bid , holding a healthy double - digit lead and running a strong organization in the state .
A second McCain aide said that their polling showed that " Michigan is n't even a long shot " -- but the campaign is hoping to capture at least one of Maine 's four electoral votes , which are designated by congressional district .
This year , " every electoral vote will count , " the aide said .
Also Thursday , McCain jokingly said that Obama 's poll numbers are rising as the economy seems to sink " because life is n't fair . "
" He certainly did nothing for the first few days , " McCain told Fox News on Thursday .
" I suspended my campaign , took our ads down , came back to Washington , met with the House folks and got on the phone , and also had face - to - face meetings . "
New CNN / Time / Opinion Research Corporation polls of several key battleground states released Wednesday found Obama has made gains across the board -- either taking statistically significant leads or erasing McCain advantages -- over the past few weeks .
Since the financial crisis began in mid-September , Obama has taken and held a lead over McCain in the national CNN poll of polls .
But the Republican nominee said the economic anxiety - fueled poll swing was probably a blip .
" Well , first of all , you know very well that these are temporary things , '' he said on MSNBC's Morning Joe .
" The focus was on the fiscal crisis we were facing .
I understand that .
I understand there are going to be ups and downs in campaigns .
I 'm happy where I am ... "
McCain , appearing on CNN's American Morning on Thursday , also said the economic bailout bill will get passed by the full Congress , and he continued to take a swipe at his Democratic rival 's efforts on the bill .
McCain also praised his efforts in getting House Republicans to come together .
The bailout package , which was backed by both the Democratic and Republican congressional leadership , as well as President Bush , failed in the House by a vote of 228 to 205 .
Both McCain and Obama , his Democratic rival , voted Wednesday night in favor of the bill .
It passed 74 to 25 .
The bill now goes to the House for a vote .
McCain said he was " proud of the work that I did , particularly engaging the House Republicans who have been completely shut out of any negotiations .
It 's now going to be a bipartisan and bicameral result . "
Watch more of McCain 's comments »
" I came back and suspended my campaign and got the House into the negotiations at the table , which they had not been before .
We were able to get a large increase in the number of Republicans who voted for it .
We were able to make significant changes in the bill , which improved it rather dramatically .
And I 'm confident it will go through the House of Representatives . "
McCain said Obama 's approach was to " phone it in " -- in regards to working with congressional leaders .
" That 's the difference .
I suspended my campaign and put my country first .
And even if I had failed , it was still the right thing to do .
We did n't fail .
It 's going to pass . "
But McCain himself spent much of weekend speaking on the phone with congressional members in his Arlington , Virginia , campaign headquarters .
Obama , meanwhile , was in Michigan on Thursday , focusing on the economic crisis -- and his solutions to fixing it -- while also criticizing his rival .
" He 's talked a lot about getting tough on Wall Street .
But over the past few decades , he 's fought against the very rules of the road that could have stopped this mess , " he said at a rally in Grand Rapids .
" Just two weeks ago , John McCain said the fundamentals of the economy were strong .
... I do n't know what yardstick Sen.
McCain uses , but where I come from , there 's nothing more fundamental than a job , " he added .
Watch more on the Senate 's Wednesday night vote »
Obama also urged the House to pass the bailout bill .
" These are the quiet storms that our families have been facing for months , if not years .
These are the storms that will only get worse if we do n't act and act now to pass the rescue plan that 's before the House of Representatives , " he said .
CNN 's Dana Bash , Ed Hornick , Alexander Mooney and Rebecca Sinderbrand contributed to this report .
All About John McCain • Barack Obama • U.S. Presidential Election
Wow .
Did n’t see this coming .
Yesterday : FOX News VP John Moody said that “ If the incident turns out to be a hoax , Senator McCain ’s quest for the presidency is over , forever linked to race - baiting . ”
Today : Police : McCain volunteer made up robbery story .
There you have it , in black and white ( as it were ) .
But still , McCain ?
Race - baiting ?
I declare , I just might faint .
* ahem *
The George Wallace McCain camp issued an official statement yesterday , before Ashley Todd confessed , saying , “ We ’re shaken up by this .
It ’s sick and disgusting . ”
However , while it was important for Jesse Helms McCain to get these sympathetic and responsible words to the press , it apparently was n’t all that important that Lester Maddox ’s McCain ’s Straight - Talkin ’ Maverick Express get the word out to , you know , his own campaign mouthpieces .
While everybody with an ounce of perspective was calling bullshit ( and I mean this literally – within two hours I had seen the woman ’s story picked apart about ten different ways ) , Strom Thurmond ’s McCain ’s PA campaign comm director was out in front of the press pimping this little minstrel show like a monkey on crack .
Oops .
We have historically taken the FOX News claim to “ fair and balanced ” with a measure of skepticism , but today , at least , they have stepped to the plate , knocked the mud off their cleats and smacked a belt - high gopherball into the parking lot .
We salute FOX News and look forward to eight more years of honest , good faith journalism from them .
In honor of Halloween , and our love of Beer , we have put together this collection of Drunk Pumpkins .
Whoever came up with this idea originally is a genius .
It was n’t us , but we did try our best at executing it last Halloween ( photo to the right ) .
Alas , many have done it before us , and done it much better than us , so we figured we should show you the fruits of their labor .
As they say , imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , so pretty much everyone below is imitating some genius of the pumpkin that came generations before us .
It would appear by the sheer number of pumpkins we have that are intoxicated , that we have an epidemic on our hands !
The first step to recovery is admitting they have a problem , we need to get these Pumpkins into rehab .

Since Sarah Palin joined John McCain on the Republican ticket in late August , news outlets , as well as nonprofits and private citizens , have besieged her office with public records requests , seeking all sorts of documents related to her tenure as Alaska ’s governor .
Some have requested access to her calendar and travel records .
Others have asked for emails and memoranda concerning the firing of Alaska Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan or a controversial ballot measure that would have placed new restrictions on mining companies , along with a number of other state matters .
One news outlet asked for documentation to the “ remodeling and / or redecorating of the governor ’s offices and / or state - owned mansions in Anchorage ” during Palin ’s governorship .
Mother Jones filed several of its own public records requests ( see David Corn ’s article for more on that ) , including one for all of the records requests that were submitted between August 29 and September 23 , 2008 .

Atheism is a lack of belief in god(s ) .
Theists often claim that atheism is a belief .
They use this characterization to claim among other things , false premises such as :
It takes just as much faith to not believe in god as it does to believe in god
Wrong .
It takes no faith to not believe in something .
Do you know what the definition of faith is ?
It is believing in something in the absence of evidence .
In other words , it 's the opposite of coming to a conclusion based on something real and tangible .
The non-existence of something is not a belief .
It 's merely a base or fallback position one naturally comes to in the absence of contrary evidence .
Is there a large pink elephant sitting on the toilet in the bathroom at your home right now " ?
No ?
Why not ?
So you take it on faith that there is n't a large pink elephant sitting on the toilet in your bathroom at home ?
Do you think your lack of belief in this concept requires faith , or maybe it 's the other way around ?
You only require faith to believe IN something that defies the laws of logic .
Atheists have no morals or world view or any behavioral guidelines , and if they do have any , they must be supernaturally given so they 're not really atheists in the first place because morality comes from a higher power
Hogwash .
This claim , which is very often made by theists is insulting to all intelligent people .
First and foremost , as was mentioned earlier , atheism is a lack of belief , which theists often compare in the same terms as they do their beliefs , which do constitute a World view .
The problem is , atheism is not a " world view " .
It 's not a set of rules , regulations , dogma , scripture , beliefs or any other idea that is universally accepted among people .
There is no atheist bible .
There are no rules which all atheists are expected to follow .
The lack of belief is not indicative of a recommended way of living ones ' life .
Atheists do have world views ; they do have a sense of morality ; they do have ideas on what is and is n't acceptable and moral behavior .
However , these " beliefs " are not derived from theology , nor are they derived from any atheist manifesto , nor are they consistent among all those who choose not to subscribe to religious mythology .
There are many other sources for world views and morality , not the least of which is Humanism which is typically embraced to one extent or another by all people regardless of their faith or lack thereof .
We wo n't even get into the ludicrous assumption that god has any consistent idea of what is and is n't moral behavior .
That 's an exercise in hypocrisy best left to its own section , which you can find in the Theological Criticisms area .
The bottom line is that regardless of what magical sky fairy you do or do not believe in , there is ample evidence to indicate there are basic moral guidelines that all humans have an instinctive nature to follow .
The most obvious involves avoiding unnecessary harm to other creatures .
By doing so , we reduce the likelihood of unnecessary harm being inflicted upon ourselves , and you do n't need to believe in god to recognize that pain and discomfort is something worth avoiding wherever possible .

Daily Show depicts RNC as Superdome during Katrina David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday September 3 , 2008
Print This Email This The Daily Show turned its attention on Tuesday to those who have been most devastated by Hurricane Gustav -- the delegates to the Republican National Convention .
" This week is n't a party for everyone , " Jon Stewart explained somberly .
" There 's a sizable group of people who 've been left out and left behind . "
Senior correspondent John Oliver took up the melancholy tale .
" While the Republican leadership raced to the Gulf Coast to demonstrate their empathy this week , their delegates were left abandoned in the Xcel Center -- tired , hungry , and desperate . "
" When you look upon the sea of white faces down there , " continued Wyatt Cenac , " you realize it 's a whole different country , invisible to most Americans , who are unaware of the grinding prosperity just miles away from where they live . "
One Republican delegate lamented to Jason Jones , " I was real excited until we decided to cancel the convention to placate the liberal media .
... I do n't understand why it is that all of a sudden you can't tell the truth about Barack Obama because some people are getting rained on . "
" Outside , National Guard troops and helicopters kept order , " Oliver noted .
" But inside , panic began to set in .
The merlot , gone .
Cabernet sauvignon down to the last few cases .
The situation is bad and getting worse . "
" We 're making grilled salmon today , " a convention chef told Oliver .
" We 're topping that with a lemon - basil pesto . "
" Everybody 's asking , ' Where 's the president at a time like this ? ' "
Cenac stated .
He posed the question directly to one delegate , " Do you think the president will arrive here ? "
" I do n't know , " she replied .
But when Cenac followed up with , " Would you like to see him here ? " she could only open and close her mouth speechlessly .
" Clearly George Bush does n't care about George Bush 's people ! " a despairing Jason Jones cried out to a passing Karl Rove , who simply turned his back and continued along the corridor .

I often wonder what it 's like to live in the simplistic black - and - white world of your typical Republican bobblehead .
Are their brains truly this unable to process nuance ?
Take , for example , Rep. Heather Wilson ( R - NM ) who is only too happy to categorize ( with host Bob Schieffer 's enabling , bless his Republican - loving little heart ) Barack Obama as unpatriotic .
Why ?
Because at his speech in Germany , he acknowledged that there have been errors in America 's foreign policy .
SCHIEFFER : Well , that sounds like you ’re saying that he ’s somehow unpatriotic , which seemed to be the underlying theme of what she said yesterday , Congresswoman .
WILSON : Well , he has talked down about America and you know , we ’ve always had this history of saying , well , politics ends at the waters ’ edge .
And it did n’t for Barack Obama .
He ’s been critical , not only of the President , but of American policy and has kind of a negative view of the American world .
That ’s not unusual , frankly , among liberals in kind of post - Vietnam America to say that America is the problem .
I think Sarah Palin believes that America is part of the solution .
We are an exceptional country , we are a force for good and we need to talk about the good things we do .
Sigh .
Look , I love my kids more than life itself .
I think they are incredible , beautiful , smart children that make me proud to be their mom everyday .
But even that primal , ferocious love I have for my kids does n't prevent me from seeing that they are also impatient , impulsive and occasionally bratty .
It does n't blind me to their failings and I 'm not a terrible mother if I acknowledge the areas in which they could improve when they have done wrong .
But apparently , in Heather Wilson 's ( and Bob Schieffer , let 's not forget he is the one framing this as such ) world , what I should do is let my kids be monsters outside the house and then ignore others who suggest that they could exercise restraint , blaming them for not recognizing their inherent goodness .
Tell me , how is that acting in their best interests ?
And this is what Heather Wilson thinks the President ought to do on a national scale ?

This is one of a family of mild sweeteners known as sugar alcohols , or polyols .
Typically derived from natural carbs , they lack the harsh , metallic taste of calorie - free sweeteners .
Sugar alcohols are absorbed very slowly ( or not at all ) in the intestines , so they do n't cause spikes in blood - sugar level — hey diabetics , go nuts !
And since oral bacteria can't digest them , they wo n't rot your teeth .
Why is n't everything sweetened this way ?
Well , for one thing , that slow intestinal absorption can cause bloating , diarrhea , and flatulence .
Sorbitol
More sugar alcohol .
Here , a simple glucose molecule ( C6H12O6 ) is broken apart and two extra hydrogen atoms are added ( making C6H14O6 ) .
The result is about half as sweet as the original compound .
Sorbitol can also be found in peaches , plums , and other fruit .
Gum Base
Know why soft racing tires are called gum balls ?
Because they are !
Chewing gum used to be made from the sap of manilkara trees ; now the chew often comes from styrene - butadiene , the same petrochemical used to make car tires .
Wrigley wo n't divulge its recipe but claims to still use some natural ingredients in its gum base — like , oh , boiled pine sap .
Glycerol
The sugar alcohols keep on coming .
This clear , syrupy liquid , also known as glycerine , is a favorite in pharmaceuticals and personal care products for its smooth texture and moisturizing properties .
A byproduct of biodiesel production , glycerol is now flooding global markets .
Plans are afoot to turn it into ecofriendly antifreeze .
Aspartame
This stuff was being used in the development of an anti-ulcer drug in 1965 when a Searle researcher absentmindedly licked his fingers .
About 200 times more potent than sugar , here the calorie - free additive compensates for the modest sweetness of sugar alcohols .
A synthesis of two naturally occurring amino acids , it breaks down into small amounts of toxic chemicals like methanol and then formaldehyde in the body .
The FDA is n't worried , so why should you be ?
Acesulfame K
Geeky hip hop name ?
No , the K stands for potassium .
This is another cloyingly intense calorie - free sweetener .
It 's rarely used alone , since it packs a particularly bitter aftertaste .
Unlike aspartame , Ace K is totally artificial , so the body does n't even try to metabolize it — in layman 's terms , you just piss it away .
Sodium Bicarbonate
Orbit
White 's unique selling point is that it 's supposed to help whiten your unsightly chompers .
Enter sodium bicarbonate — good old baking soda — a plaque inhibitor and gentle abrasive that cleans teeth without damaging the enamel .
Boo -yah !
We can finally stop brushing our teeth .

Sharp criticism has rattled African - American institutions for their deep reluctance to generate conversation about HIV / AIDS – a leading cause of death for middle - age adult African - American men and women .
Because social stigma has precluded open , healthy face - to - face discussion on the issue , the vital role of community as a support system has crumbled .
Now , the Internet is picking up the slack and getting the conversation started .
Community support – including the ability to discuss and address issues that threaten survival – is critical to us as social beings .
Stable communities share three important components : a home ( first place ) , a work place ( second place ) , and an informal public gathering location ( third place ) , such as a church , cafe , community center , or even barbershop .
If one of these is missing or fails to provide a place for discussion on life - threatening issues , the stability of the community is in jeopardy .
Such an absence of a " third place " in the face of HIV / AIDS poses a serious threat to African - Americans .
Thankfully , technology 's far reach means the Web is emerging as a powerful third place where traditional institutions and communities have failed .
Evidence shows that members of the African - American community have resorted to forming social bonds within the vibrant online community nicknamed the " Blackosphere " as an alternative way to connect with like - minded individuals .
These virtual communities , such as Black America Web , are created by , and are principally for , African - Americans .
Through news , commentary , blogs , and discussion , they help empower members to mobilize around causes and issues that are critical to the black community .
These sites are proving to be part of the new front line in the fight against HIV / AIDS .
They provide a type of social setting for African - Americans to gather en masse and discuss the disease openly when it 's still taboo to discuss the issue face to face .
Within the framework of computer - mediated communication , individuals dealing with HIV / AIDS can rebuild aspects of social support that may be lost due to stigma and reach out to those who may not have had access to such support in the first place .
And through casual acquaintances online , individuals can reach beyond their established real - life social networks , to access informal networks that may have information to which their own home and workplace networks may not be privy .
According to sociologist Ray Oldenburg , in times of crisis or of social upheavals , the seeds of change are often planted and watered in community locales ( or third places ) .
For example , the laws against workplace segregation in the 1960s were the result of assembly of African - Americans in churches all over the South .
The labor solidarity movement , which emerged in many communities after workers met in local cafes to discuss their common problems and realize their collective strength , enabled them to effectively plan transformative strikes and other strategies that made sweeping change .
The same is proving true in these virtual public spaces in the fight against HIV / AIDS .
Analysis of conversations within the Blackosphere gives valuable insight into how seriously members of the African - American community take the HIV / AIDS epidemic .
It highlights what they personally perceive as factors that aid in the spread of the disease .
It lets them voice anger and frustration at established institutions that are deemed to be inactive or ineffective on the HIV / AIDS issue .
It offers preventive tips to others online , treatment options , personal testimonies , expectations on what they believe the future holds for community , and allows posting of germane articles on myths and realities in the spread of the disease .
Blogs are ideally suited for this community building .
They represent a single place , outside large social gatherings , where people can engage in real - time conversations on a grand scale .
And unlike in tête - à - tête discussions , people are empowered by the relative cloak of anonymity online , freeing them from the fear of social sanction .
Never before has a medium existed that can connect and enable conversations among people who are so geographically dispersed , or so culturally and ethnically diverse , with the potential for everyone to contribute to the discussion and be heard .
This new frontier on the ongoing fight against HIV / AIDS in the African - American community is a hopeful sign of a massive grass roots mobilization .
An old commercial once said , when it comes to AIDS , silence kills .
African - Americans are silent no more .
• C. Frank Igwe is a fellow at Harvard Kennedy School .
This essay is based on his PhD dissertation .
Sarah Palin embarrassed herself pretty badly when she practically admitted on national television ( in her first serious interview ) that she had no clue what the Bush Doctrine was .
Last night on the Late Show with David Letterman , BillO showed that he 's just as brain dead as the Alaska Governor .
The only difference is that he spent much of the last eight years actually defending the overarching premise of Bush 's foreign policy .
" The Bush Doctrine ?
Remember that , when Charlie Gibson went , ' what 's the Bush doctrine ' ?
You got the nose with glasses on and all that .
I 'm sitting at home going ' what Bush Doctrine ' ?
Is that the doctrine where I go to Crawford Texas five times a year ?
What Bush Doctrine is that ?
I do n't know what that is .
That was just ridiculous .
It 's all gotcha gotcha gotcha . "
Is he serious ?
I could care less if Bill O'Reilly knows what the Bush doctrine is , even if he has been defending it for years now .
But I certainly expect someone who could easily be the President in three months to have an opinion on whether or not it 's right for the United States to attack countries that we think may present a threat to us sometime in the future .
Call me an elitist , but things like that matter .
Editor 's note : Join Roland S. Martin for his weekly sound - off segment on CNN.com Live at 11:10 a.m. ET Wednesday .
If you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you .
A nationally syndicated columnist , Martin has said he will vote for Barack Obama in November .
He is the author of " Listening to the Spirit Within : 50 Perspectives on Faith " and " Speak , Brother !
A Black Man's View of America . "
Visit his Web site for more information .
Roland Martin says the McCain campaign is launching desperate attacks to derail Obama .
( CNN ) -- Watching Sen. John McCain and top Republicans swing wildly in their attempts to slam Sen. Barack Obama , with less than two weeks ago to go before Election Day , is like watching an old fighter -- clearly out of gas , his legs turned to rubber , and all he can do is grab , hold , punch behind the back , just anything to try to win .
McCain 's campaign is no longer about issues .
He and his supporters want to bring up anything and everything to derail Obama , and nothing is sticking , so they just keep returning to their old bag of tricks .
In the past two weeks , we 've seen Minnesota Republican Rep. Michelle Bachmann make one of the most audacious statements ever , suggesting that Obama holds anti-American views , that other members of Congress have the same views , and that the media should launch a widespread investigation to ferret them out .
No , seriously , she said that on MSNBC's " Hardball . "
It did n't take long for the folks on the left to get ahold of her comments .
After the video spread like wildfire , Democrats across the country pumped $ 700,000 into the campaign coffers of her opponent .
The normally talkative Bachmann is now on lockdown , not granting any interviews , as she has to work hard to hold onto her seat .
Then you have former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich , who was caught suggesting that if Obama wins , he is going to put in place the policies of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
Now , Gingrich has absolutely no clue what policies Wright advocated , but he wants to scare the dickens out of voters by literally making stuff up about Obama .
Cindy McCain , who has barely moved her lips during this campaign , is now accusing the Obama campaign of running the dirtiest campaign ever , and lighting up the New York Times and others for their viciousness .
Never mind what 's happening in her own backyard with all of the false and outlandish comments coming from her husband , his running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin , and their supporters .
They are now in full blame - the - media mode .
Then you have both McCain and Palin slamming Obama for essentially being a socialist .
We should n't be surprised that it 's come to this because we already had radio hosts like Lars Larson , Glenn Beck and others trying to paint Obama for months as being a Marxist .
Now the junior senator from Illinois is a student of Lenin !
This has totally gotten out of hand , but instead of trying to castigate Obama and tar and feather him , the Republicans should look inward and look at how their actions have seriously harmed this nation .
The Republicans ran Congress for six years .
The Republicans have held the White House for the last eight years .
The Republicans have advanced the deregulation agenda that played a major role in creating the financial mess we are currently in .
The Republicans have led the foreign policy we have in place that has destroyed the moral authority we once held .
Their president is one of the most unpopular in history , so bad that he and Vice President Dick Cheney can't even come out of the White House to campaign on behalf of McCain because they are so reviled by Americans .
Can someone please remind these folks of this ?
Every campaign says they want the election to be about the issues , but when McCain 's campaign manager Rick Davis made it clear that they want it to be about character and not issues , well , we should have realized we would get to this point .
That 's why we 're hearing so much about Bill Ayers .
That 's why they 've spent more time blasting out statements about ACORN than real policy points .
It 's pretty sad , really .
It 's sad that instead of making it about a vision for America , they want it to be about the castigating of a good man .
It 's sad that McCain can't fully articulate an economic plan that encompasses all Americans , instead of redistributing income upwards to the super rich .
It 's sad that his only answer to the economy is tax cuts , when we need a much broader answer .
Much can happen over the next 13 days .
I 've seen campaigns won and lost with less time on the clock .
McCain will continue to throw jabs , swinging wildly , ignoring the game plan he came into the fight with , hoping something -- anything -- connects against the jaw of his younger , more fluid opponent .
And like any aging fighter , as the rounds tick away , he could get even more desperate and fearful .
So hold on to your seats .
Lord knows what will come out of the GOP side over the next 13 days .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin .

If you thought the future of TV looked as dry and lifeless as a desert , look again : Sony 's new Bravia XDV - W600 not only makes channel surfing lively again , it 's portable so you can surf WHILE you surf !
The advanced features built into the XDV - W600 show that Sony expects television to remain a viable media venue that will attract new viewers .
For one thing , the attractively designed set is fully compatible with Japan 's " One - Seg " digital TV standard .
It also packs a hefty 2 gigabytes of memory , allowing users to record up to 10 full hours of digital TV programs .
When it comes time to play 'em back , the XDV - W600 does n't disappoint - the set will operate for 23 hours on a fully - charged internal battery .
The most interesting feature of this set is that it 's waterproof .
Not " water resistant " like my old watch which did n't survive a dive into the deep end , officially waterproof with a JIS IPX6 and IPX7 rating .
What that means is you can watch Seahunt , The Sea Hunters , even Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea for a half hour with the XDV - W600 sitting 3 - feet underwater .
C'mon , you know you want to !
As for specs , here they are ... the XDV - W600 costs $ 370 , not bad for its size - this is n't a monster 60 inch plasma TV .
Pretty much the opposite ; the li'l Bravia has a 4 - inch , 16.7 million color LCD screen .
It weighs 302 grams ( almost 11 ounces ) and measures 145×42×98 mm or around 6 - inches wide by 4 inches tall .
Oh , one more thing - the set also has an on - board AM - FM stereo tuner so you can soak away to the sweet sounds of the radio .
Remember radio ?
Anyway , Sony 's XDV - W600 will find the pool already occupied by a competitor from Panasonic once it goes on sale this coming October 30th .
Seems there 's still a market for boob tubes after all , at least ones that function underwater .
Maybe the XDV - W600 's cute design and the choice of pink , blue or white cases will give it an edge over Panasonic 's rival offering , being as it'll only be available in Japan .

When I was a child , I used to love seagulls .
My sister once introduced me to a very special seagull named Oscar .
Oscar was a very ordinary herring gull , but for some reason Oscar took a liking to me .
He would show up everywhere I went , sometimes travelling hundreds of miles just to see me .
He was my little squawking shadow .
You might think that he would get lost in a crows of dozens of birds that looked virtually identical , but my sister always seemed to be able to spot him and would reassure me , “ Of course that ’s Oscar ! ”
She was older and wiser and I never questioned this .
In that spirit , I present today ’s picture of Brian .
( It ’s probably actually Brian ’s younger brother , or cousin , but Brian is really more of a grand idea than any one particular animal , right ? )

Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones , 1949 - 2008
The Associated Press is reporting that Ohio Congresswoman Rep. Tubbs Jones died today at 6:12 p.m. , in Cleveland .
She stood up for America in 2004 , by courageously challenging the seating of Ohio's electors in the U.S. House of Representatives .
She will be greatly missed .
UPDATE : Friend of The BRAD BLOG Matthew Segal of the Student Association of Voter Empowerment ( SAVE ) was among those students at Kenyon College in Knox County , OH , where the last vote was not cast in 2004 until well after 2 am .
He sent us a video of an Election Integrity event that both he and Tubbs Jones spoke at just weeks ago in Ohio , and noted , " Her discussion of the Ohio election ( and electoral vote certification ) was riveting . "
The clip is longer than the YouTube - allowed 10 mins , but we 'll try to get it posted somewhere .
With the video , he emailed the following personal thoughts this afternoon while we were on the road , and as the Congresswoman was still clinging to life ...
Stephanie Tubbs Jones is not only my political hero but has also been both a friend and mentor to me .
I met her back in 2004 after the disastrous voting situation in Ohio .
Her office called me and asked me to speak at a rally in Cleveland to endorse her " Count Every Vote " legislation with Senator Clinton .
From there , we have kept in touch closely and she has gone out of her way to support the efforts of SAVE and to help empower young voters through legislation .
She is a giant in the election reform movement and has fought courageously for a more accessible , transparent and participatory democracy .
I have the deepest respect for her .
Matthew Segal
Executive Director
Student Association for Voter Empowerment
[ UPDATE : Matthew now has more at HuffPo ...]
She was a hero .
Congress ( and America ) could use another 534 like her .

Obama 's Fannie Mae ' Connection '
By Michael Dobbs
" Obama has no background in economics .
Who advises him ?
The Post says it 's Franklin Raines , for " advice on mortgage and housing policy . "
Shocking .
Under Raines , Fannie Mae committed " extensive financial fraud . "
Raines made millions .
Fannie Mae collapsed .
Taxpayers ?
Stuck with the bill . "
-- McCain video release , September 18 , 2008 .
An already nasty presidential election campaign is getting nastier .
The meltdown on Wall Street has touched off frantic attempts by both the McCain and Obama camps to secure political advantage and indulge in guilt by association .
Over the past 24 hours , both campaigns have issued video press releases ( let 's not call them ads until they actually air somewhere ) attempting to show that the other side 's " advisers " are somehow responsible for the crisis .
The latest McCain attack is particularly dubious .
The Facts
The McCain video attempts to link Obama to Franklin Raines , the former CEO of the bankrupt mortgage giant , Fannie Mae , who also happens to be African American .
It then shows a photograph of an elderly white woman taxpayer who has supposedly been " stuck with the bill " as a result of the " extensive financial fraud " at Fannie Mae .
The Obama campaign last night issued a statement by Raines insisting , " I am not an advisor to Barack Obama , nor have I provided his campaign with advice on housing or economic matters . "
Obama spokesman Bill Burton went a little further , telling me in an e-mail that the campaign had " neither sought nor received " advice from Raines " on any matter . "
So what evidence does the McCain campaign have for the supposed Obama - Raines connection ?
It is pretty flimsy , but it is not made up completely out of whole cloth .
McCain spokesman Brian Rogers points to three items in the Washington Post in July and August .
It turns out that the three items ( including an editorial ) all rely on the same single conversation , between Raines and a Washington Post business reporter , Anita Huslin , who wrote a profile of the discredited Fannie Mae boss that appeared on July 16 .
The profile reported that Raines , who retired from Fannie Mae four years ago , had " taken calls from Barack Obama 's presidential campaign seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters . "
Since this has now become a campaign issue , I asked Huslin to provide the exact circumstances of the quote .
She explained that she was chatting with Raines during the photo shoot , and asked " if he was engaged at all with the Democrats ' quest for the White House .
He said that he had gotten a couple of calls from the Obama campaign .
I asked him about what , and he said 'oh , general housing , economy issues . '
( ' Not mortgage / foreclosure meltdown or Fannie - specific , ' I asked , and he said ' no . ' ) "
By Raines 's own account , he took a couple of calls from someone on the Obama campaign , and they had some general discussions about economic issues .
I have asked both Raines and the Obama people for more details on these calls and will let you know if I receive a reply .
The Pinocchio Test
The McCain campaign is clearly exaggerating wildly in attempting to depict Franklin Raines as a close adviser to Obama on " housing and mortgage policy . "
If we are to believe Raines , he did have a couple of telephone conversations with someone in the Obama campaign .
But that hardly makes him an adviser to the candidate himself -- and certainly not in the way depicted in the McCain video release .
( About our rating scale .
The 2008 Paralympics wrapped up over the summer , but we 're only just today learning about some of the awesome stories to come out of this amazing tech - assisted sporting event .
We 've covered these bionic athletes before , with some help from the Big Picture , but today 's story out of Germany shows just how much goes into helping these young men and women compete .
A previous sporting injury left Wojtek Czyz without a left leg and the ability to long jump .
The ESA , using materials developed for space , helped him get to the Olympics and vault into the record books .
The work on Czyz 's leg started four years ago , when the ESA 's Technology Transfer Programme broker MST Aerospace met with the athlete and his trainer for a pre-screening .
What they developed over the following few years focused on the " L - bracket , " or connection angle , between the knee joint and foot prosthesis .
" In collaboration with the German company ISATEC , we developed a new L - bracket using materials originating from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) , an instrument that will be mounted on the International Space Station to study extraterrestrial anti-matter , matter and missing matter , " said Dr. Werner Dupont , MST Aerospace Managing Director .
For real space and physics geeks , you can geek out a little more with this ESA - supplied bit on the AMS .
It turns out the materials used in this track and field - come - space flight device are going to do a lot more than just break earthbound records :
The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) is a particle physics experiment that is to be mounted on the International Space Station designed to search for various types of unusual matter by measuring cosmic rays .
It is an international collaboration involving 500 scientists from 56 institutions and 16 countries .
Final assembly was done at CERN and thermal / vacuum testing was performed by ESA before its shipment to the Kennedy Space Center .
AMS is planned to be delivered to the ISS by the Space Shuttle in 2010 .

The government is testing drugs with severe side effects like psychosis and suicidal behavior on hundreds of military veterans , using small cash payments to attract patients into medical experiments that often target distressed soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan , a Washington Times / ABC News investigation has found .
In one such experiment involving the controversial anti-smoking drug Chantix , the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) took three months to alert its patients about severe mental side effects .
The warning did not arrive until after one of the veterans taking the drug had suffered a psychotic episode that ended in a near lethal confrontation with police .
James Elliott , a decorated Army sharpshooter who suffers from post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) after serving 15 months in Iraq , was confused and psychotic when he was Tasered by police in February as he reached for a concealed handgun when officers responded to a 911 call at his Maryland home .
For photos , video of James Elliott , official FDA documents and more , visit the interactive site for the Disposable Heroes report .
Mr. Elliott , a chain smoker , began taking Chantix last fall as part of a VA experiment that specifically targeted veterans with PTSD , opting to collect $ 30 a month for enrolling in the clinical trial because he needed cash as he returned to school .
He soon began suffering hallucinations and suicidal thoughts , unaware that the new drug he was taking could have caused them .
Just two weeks after Mr. Elliott began taking Chantix in November , the VA learned from the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) that the drug was linked to a large number of hallucinations , suicide attempts and psychotic behavior .
But the VA did not alert Mr. Elliott before his own episode in February .
In failing to do so , Mr. Elliott said , the VA treated him like a “ disposable hero . ”
“ You ’re a lab rat for $ 30 a month , ” Mr. Elliott said .
One of the nation ’s premier medical ethicists said the VA ’s behavior in the anti-smoking study violated basic protections for humans in medical experiments .
“ When you ’re taking advantage of a very vulnerable population , people who have served the country , and the agency that ’s responsible for their welfare is n’t putting their welfare first , that ’s a pretty serious breach of ethics , ” said Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania .
In all , nearly 1,000 veterans with PTSD were enrolled in the study to test different methods of ending smoking , with 143 using Chantix .
Twenty - one veterans reported adverse effects from the drug , including one who suffered suicidal thoughts , the three - month investigation by The Times and ABC News found .
Mr. Caplan , who reviewed the consent and notification forms for the study at the request of The Times and ABC News , said the VA deserved an “ F ” and that it has an obligation to end the study , given the vulnerability of veterans with PTSD and the known side effects of Chantix .
“ Continuing it does n’t make any ethical sense , ” he said .
The VA continues to test Chantix on veterans , even as reported problems with the drug increase and have prompted at least one other federal agency to take action .
On May 21 , the Federal Aviation Administration banned airline pilots and air traffic control personnel from taking Chantix , citing the adverse side effects .
The VA responds
VA officials defend their use of veterans in medical studies , saying that helping PTSD sufferers to stop smoking would prolong their lives .
As for the three - month delay in notifying its patients about the Chantix problems , the VA said bureaucracy slowed down their warning because the alert letters had to be issued through an Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) that oversees the experiment at each VA location .
“ We do n’t have the authority to just send directly to patients material that has not been approved by the IRB sites , ” said Miles McFall , director of the VA ’s programs for PTSD sufferers .
“ We did sense urgency .
And we respond to that urgency doing just what we did here , which was , I think , incredibly quick response for a governmental institution .
“ We believe that we took responsible action by informing the clinicians who are the people most in touch with the patients to be on the lookout for any potential side effects and to respond appropriately , ” he said .
While Mr. Elliott blames Chantix for his mental breakdown and confrontation with police , VA officials said they can not be sure .
“ We do n’t know that Chantix was the cause of this , first of all .
And it ’s presumed that that ’s the case .
We do n’t know that to be a fact , ” Mr. McFall said .
Mr. McFall said the veterans with PTSD in the anti-smoking study “ are at high risk to use tobacco ” and the goal of the experiment is to determine how best to deliver treatment - through a mental health counselor or a smoking clinic .
Chantix was one of several options tested on the veterans .
“ FDA approved , and that drug is available to help individuals stop smoking and VA makes that drug available , ” Mr. McFall said .
“ It does not deny access to them . ”
Asked about adverse reactions now linked to the drug , Mr. McFall said : “ We are certainly aware of FDA warnings and we took all precautions … so it can be used safely .
All drugs have side effects or potential side effects . ”
Dark history of medical tests
The government has a controversial history of using military personnel as human research subjects .
Mustard gas was tested on the military during World War II , radiation during the early Cold War period , LSD in the 1960s , herbicide in Vietnam and Panama , and chemical and biological warfare drugs during the Gulf War , according to Senate testimony given by the Vietnam Veterans of America ( VVA ) on July 10 , 2002 .
In most of those cases , few if any military test subjects were informed of the potential health consequences of the exposure .
“ We have a phrase to describe this phenomenon - the disposable soldier syndrome , ” said Richard Weidman , former VVA director of government relations .
The most infamous government experiment is the Tuskegee Syphilis Study conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service from 1932 through 1972 , which used 400 poor and uneducated black male sharecroppers who carried the sexually transmitted disease .
The men were purposely undiagnosed and untreated for a disease that already had progressed to late stages , and were studied through autopsy .
The government effectively blocked the unwitting participants , who also were drafted in 1940 to serve in WWII , from receiving medical treatment for symptoms they were told were caused by “ bad blood . ”
Of the participants , 28 men died of the disease , 100 others died from complications brought on by syphilis , and the disease spread to 40 wives and 19 children .
Ongoing tests with vets
The VA has extensive screening of veterans who enroll in medical experiments and requires detailed consent forms to ensure patients know about the potential complications and benefits .
Currently , the VA and other federal agencies are conducting nearly 300 clinical studies involving veterans with PTSD .
Most studies are behavioral , including one that tests the effects of yoga on PTSD sufferers .
Twenty - five , however , are testing drugs on 4,796 veterans , more than half ( 2,488 ) of whom are just returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , according to clinical trials filed with the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) and reviewed by The Times .
One study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health is using virtual - reality exposure - sights , sounds and smells from the Iraq battlefield , along with a drug called D - Cycloserine that reduces fear .
Other studies are testing drugs on veterans with PTSD , including the antidepressants paroxetine , mirtazapine and citalopram - all carry warnings of suicidal side effects .
“ Over 150,000 soldiers are currently deployed in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) and 12 percent of returning OIF veterans have PTSD , ” said one study that is using the drug paroxetine on 160 veterans “ who have returned from the Iraq theater within the past six months . ”
Warnings about taking paroxetine include “ suicidal thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning to trying to do so ” among young adults up to 24 years of age , according to NIH .
Another study on the use of mirtazapine for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan is testing the efficacy and tolerability of the drug on 100 veterans .
Citalopram is being tested on 300 veterans “ exposed to high levels of combat stress . ”
The NIH warning for paroxetine also applies to mirtazapine and citalopram .
The VA has not revealed how many veterans are registered in an experiment to study the effects of divalproex in the treatment of PTSD , but the FDA warned health care professionals on Jan. 31 it had received reports of suicide and suicidal thoughts linked to the anticonvulsant drug .
Smoking study ’s fine print
Mr. Elliott was one of 940 veterans with PTSD who participated in the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program ( CSP ) # 519 , “ smoking - cessation treatment for veterans with post traumatic stress disorder ” ongoing at 10 VA clinics .
The CSP studies date back to the 1940s , when 10,000 veterans suffering from tuberculosis were recruited into VA studies to test different drugs to treat the disease .
The smoking - cessation study uses nicotine replacement products like gum and patches as well as Chantix - a drug that is supposed to block certain brain receptors that make smoking pleasurable .
The $ 11 million taxpayer - funded study was approved in 2004 , two years before the FDA approved Chantix for prescription use .
The FDA says that nearly 40 suicides and more than 400 incidents of suicidal behavior have since been linked to Chantix .
Mr. Elliott began taking Chantix on Nov. 6 .
Two weeks later , on Nov. 20 , the FDA issued its first alert that it had “ received reports of suicidal thoughts and aggressive and erratic behavior in patients who have taken Chantix , ” also known as varenicline .
“ A preliminary assessment reveals that many of the cases reflect new - onset of depressed mood , suicidal ideation , and changes in emotion and behavior within days to weeks of initiating Chantix treatment , ” the November FDA alert said .
“ The role of Chantix in these cases is not clear because smoking cessation , with or without treatment , is associated with nicotine withdrawal symptoms and has also been associated with the exacerbation of underlying psychiatric illness .
However , not all patients described in these cases had pre-existing psychiatric illness and not all had discontinued smoking , ” the FDA said .
On Jan. 18 , the drug manufacturer Pfizer revised its warning label to state “ patients who are attempting to quit smoking with Chantix should be observed for serious neuropsychiatric symptoms , including changes in behavior , agitation , depressed mood , suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior . ”
On Feb. 1 , the FDA held a news conference to announce that new health risks have been associated with the drug .
VA officials started addressing the FDA alert on Nov. 26 and Dec. 4 with conference calls among government officials “ to inform prescribers about these potential problems and advise patients accordingly , ” according to a timeline agency officials provided The Times .
On Feb .
4 , VA officials were told to “ formulate and approve an action plan , ” and on Feb. 13 , a second consent form and letter was submitted for approval by VA officials .
The letter received by Mr. Elliott and other veterans was dated Feb. 29 , more than three weeks after he already had suffered his mental breakdown and confrontation with police .
VA letter watered down ?
While the alerts from Pfizer and the FDA clearly mentioned suicide and suicidal thoughts as possible side effects , the VA ’s letter to its veterans used no such language .
“ Scientists have recently learned that varenicline can sometimes have serious side effects in some people , ” the VA letter said .
“ These side effects may include an increase in psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety , nervousness , tension and depression as well as untoward changes in behavior . ”
Asked why the letter omitted the most significant side effect , Mr. McFall said “ the more verbiage you use , the more difficult and lengthy it becomes , hard to read .
It ’s more likely veterans wo n’t pay attention to it if you overdo . ”
However , a secondary research consent form sent with the letter that participants are now being asked to sign cites “ changes in behavior , anxiety , nervousness , tension , depression , thoughts of suicide , and attempted and completed suicide . ”
Mr. McFall said the serious side effects were included in the secondary consent form , and not the notification letter , because “ it ’s better to have the letter be brief ” so that it is not a “ burden for people who sometimes have problems reading . ”
“ They have eyesight problems , ” Mr. McFall said .
“ Many of our veterans are getting elderly , so we ’re trying to keep things simple and to the point , while at the same time pointing them to the most important document , which is the consent form . ”
Veterans who are participating in the smoking - cessation program are carefully screened to ensure they are not suicidal , psychotic or homicidal , Mr. McFall said .
According to the VA research consent form Mr. Elliott initially signed , he would be required to fill out questionnaires “ about some war zone events that you may have experienced ” and interviews “ regarding symptoms of other psychiatric disorders and your use of drugs and alcohol . ”
“ Has there been a time in the past month when things were so bad that you were thinking a lot about death or that you would be better off dead ? ” is one example question listed on the consent form .
Mr. Elliott filled out monthly checklists on the extent to which he had nightmares about his military experience or flashbacks , became “ super alert ” or on guard , and whether he had a “ feeling as if your future will somehow be cut short . ”
Chantix debate
New York Magazine writer Derek De Koff detailed the nightmares and suicidal behavior he suffered while on Chantix in a Feb. 10 article , and said that at one point he felt like throwing himself in front of a tour bus or crashing his head into a computer screen .
“ All this seemed logical , but also weirdly funny , even at the time : I could see how crazy these impulses were , I could recognize them as suicidal cliches .
But I could n’t make them go away , ” Mr. De Koff wrote .
In September , musician Jeffrey Carter Albrecht was shot by a neighbor who mistook him for a burglar .
The guitarist and keyboardist who once played with Edie Brickell & New Bohemians went on a rant that friends say was fueled by alcohol and the drug Chantix .
A spokesman for Pfizer could not be reached after three calls seeking comment .
However , in full - page ads published May 29 in several newspapers including USA Today , Dr. Joseph Feczko , Pfizer chief medical officer , said the company is “ committed to patient safety ” and “ furthering our knowledge of Chantix . ”
The FDA has declined to pull Chantix from the market , citing the health benefits of smoking cessation .
“ This actually is a very important drug , ” Dr. Celia Winchell , team leader for the FDA division of anesthesia , analgesia and rheumatology , said during the February teleconference announcing the new warning .
“ Although we are getting these reports , there ’s also a lot of anecdotal reports out there where this drug has worked when no other drug would , ” Dr. Winchell said .
“ Smoking itself has very serious consequences .
And so I think it ’s important to try to manage the risk associated with the drug , also realizing that it has a lot of benefits for some folks , ” Dr. Winchell said .
More than 5,000 people were treated with the drug in preliminary trials before it was approved for prescription use .
However , patients with serious psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia , bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder did not participate in those tests .
Ethics of future VA tests
Mr. Caplan , the bioethicist , said that using veterans with PTSD in clinical trials carries a “ high risk ” that must be addressed by the VA .
“ Researchers have a special obligation to vets with PTSD since they are a vulnerable population somewhat prone to threats or even violence against themselves or others , ” he said .
“ They need to keep a hawklike eye on subjects involved in high stress experiments and make sure that families and friends are involved and on board any research projects to help monitor subjects . ”
“ I am not against research to try and improve the health of those with PTSD but only if it is done with the highest levels of consent , transparency , supervision and accountability , ” he said .
Mr. Caplan recommended several steps the government should adopt before allowing future testing on vulnerable veterans , including more participation by families and veterans on committees that review and approve research proposals .
Future studies that involve veterans with PTSD also should receive special approval from the VA secretary .
And a clear policy should be established that prohibits drugs reported to have serious side effects be tested on populations at risk of those side effects , including veterans with PTSD , he said .

I ’ve just finished reading the latest installment the New York Times Reckoning series ;
This look at the current financial crisis has given rise to some queer intuitions on my part when held up against another brilliant article in The Chronicle about how the best historical example of the current crisis is not 1929 , but rather 1873 .
The latter article suggests a much more probable cause for the current mania ; namely that a certain combination of economic forces and fear have given us our current situation .
The question in this situation is when the bottom of both fear and the rapid revaluation of our economy will occur .
The second question is who stands to profit most when this time comes .
The silly thing about the Times article just linked is that it question - begs .
It tries to inculcate the reader into thinking that things have bottomed out , and will only get better soon ( read : “ Buy stock , for gods sake !
We need your cash ! ” )
What then , to make of the panic of 1873 ?
The author of the article in the Chronicle claims that the crisis of 1873 preceded a westward - shift of power ; he draws the hazy conclusion that power will continue to shift west , to China : this is an impossibility .
Enough has been made of China ’s political and social problems , but their economy is predicated on exports to such an extent that a slowdown in the West will surely have negative repercussions in Beijing .
Where does this leave us ?
I ’m inclined to say that we are headed towards a period of general decline , probably no longer than the Great Depression itself was .
Commodity prices are already plummeting , leaving the petro- fascists out in the cold , along with most other ‘ developing ’ ( 3rd - world ) countries that had depended on high commodity prices for economic growth .
In this sense , Iraq will probably jump to the fore once again , because it is of little doubt that the current spate of stability has little to do with the increased presence of US troops but $ 100 / barrel oil prices .
Where , are we left ?
It ’s a question I ’ve been having some trouble answering .
There exists some third variable and presence beyond investor fear and a burst housing bubble .
This is no correction .
It ’s a massive redaction .
Interesting times , to be sure .
Who Is Joe the Plumber ?
If you watched last night ’s debate , you heard the question :
What will you do in your first term to reduce our dependence on foreign oil ?
[ social_buttons ]
Did either candidate actually answer the question ?
Not really .
But here ’s why McCain ’s answer of offshore - drilling - nuclear - power - wind - solar - geothermal - natural - gas is completely bogus :
1 . Offshore drilling wo n’t do anything for 10 years .
And then it still wo n’t do anything .
Even the Department of Energy says oil from those areas wo n’t arrive anytime soon .
It projected last year that with the ban in place until 2012 , new drilling would produce only 7 % more oil in 2030 , and the impact on oil prices would be “ insignificant . ”
Despite McCain ’s adamant endorsement of offshore drilling as a solution , no new oil would be produced from new wells anytime soon .
Even if we started drilling tomorrow , it would have zero effect on gas prices for the next 10 years , and then after that still probably would n’t affect them .
The proposal that offshore drilling is somehow a solution to foreign oil dependence is such crap , I ’m almost convinced we should start drilling everywhere so we can prove definitively how little difference it ’s going to make .
Hell , let ’s drill in ANWR too while we ’re at it and maybe we can drop the price of a barrel of oil a few cents by 2025 .
At least then we can prove how stupid even the Department of Energy thinks this entire proposition is :
Drilling in ANWR makes perfect sense , since it would supply 876,000 barrels of oil per day to a country that consumes 20,687,000 barrels of oil per day .
To put that in perspective , 876,000 barrels is about 1 hour worth of oil , or over the course of a year amounts to about 15 days of US oil consumption .
Win / Lose ? : LOSE
2. Nuclear power will not do anything to solve our dependence on foreign oil .
The first new nuclear power plant would not be finished until well after John McCain ’s ( God forbid ) second term as president .
Even if we started building new nukes tomorrow , the only way they could replace the 12,036,000 barrels / day of petroleum we import ( NET ) would be to turn it into electricity or hydrogen .
Even if you think this is a good idea , you ’d have to believe in black magic to think this in some way is going to power the millions upon millions of gasoline and diesel - powered trucks already on the road .
Win / Lose ? : LOSE
3. Wind , Solar , and Geothermal Power will not do anything in the short term to solve our dependence on foreign oil .
Natural Gas wo n’t either .
I do n’t think electricity sources like wind / solar / geothermal not replacing liquid fuels needs no more explanation .
I ’ve written about natural gas and natural gas vehicles before :
Taking a look at data from the Energy Information Administration , the US uses about 21.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas per year , most of which is produced domestically ( 18.5 trillion cubic feet ) with the difference being imported ( 4.2 trillion cubic feet ) .
Proved natural gas reserves in the US amount to about 211 trillion cubic feet .
If my math is correct , without taking into account any increase in demand , the US only has about 11.5 years of natural gas left .
After that , we ’re back to square one : importing natural gas from Russia , Qatar , Iran , and Saudi Arabia * *
If you have government / university data that contradicts it , please comment .
Even if natural gas vehicles are a good idea , they still are n’t going to replace all the cars and trucks already on the road .
Win / Lose ? : LOSE
To sum this up : McCain ’s plan as he stated it in the debates would do absolutely nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil or reduce gas prices at the pump .
Sorry Joe .
The alternative : How do we really cut petroleum usage ?
The only actual mention of options that have the near - term potential to reduce our dependence on any oil source came from Obama .
The two things he mentioned beyond pandering to the drill - baby - drill crowd were a ) biodiesel and b ) rebuilding our auto industry to start building fuel efficient cars .
Let ’s look at each of these :
1. Biodiesel
I ’ve written extensively about biodiesel before .
Optimistically , biodiesel can in fact replace a small percentage of our total petroleum usage .
Unfortunately , how it ’s grown and produced is key to how beneficial it is .
What really needs to be incented are the advanced feedstock technologies that increase productivity and are n’t made from food crops , like biodiesel made from algae and other alternative feedstocks .
Win / Lose : Depends on how it ’s implemented .
2. Fuel efficient cars
Boosting production of fuel efficient cars in a way that would create millions of new jobs and pump money into the US economy is a great idea .
While this may not be something that has an immediate effect , it could be accomplished faster than any kind of transition to other fuels .
Obama wants to provide $ 7,000 tax credits for advanced fuel and efficient vehicles and put 1 Million Plug - In Hybrid Cars on the Road by 2015 .
Win / Lose : WIN
What Both Candidates Missed Completely
If you want to pump money into the short term solutions for reducing our consumption of petroleum , there are only a few ways to do it :
Ultimately ,
We only have 3 options for reducing our dependence on foreign oil :
1. Reduce consumption .
2. Provide a direct replacement .
3 . Develop technology that does n’t need oil .
If we work hard , we might be able to cut 1/3 of our consumption with each .
Obama has already pledged to work towards these , but I do n’t understand why he did n’t take the opportunity to seal the deal in these debates : tell the American people that we have already developed the technology to produce a $ 2 per gallon gasoline - replacement , we can grow it from sources that do n’t affect food prices , and the money created goes back into the American economy .
It ’s called cellulosic ethanol – WAIT !
– the type not made from corn !
The type that has about 15 potential technologies to produce it that are almost ready for primetime .
The type that has the potential to replace 30 % of our total petroleum usage !
The type that could actually sequester carbon , and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95 % !
The type that Obama has already pledged to support :
Obama will invest federal resources , including tax incentives , cash prizes and government contracts into developing the most promising technologies with the goal of getting the first two billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol into the system by 2013 .
2 billion gallons is n’t going to solve our oil addiction , but it ’s a hell of a good start , and it ’s really the only option for a directly replacing oil that we ’ve got .
Combined with drastically cutting consumption and rapidly implementing new technologies like plug - in hybrids , it ’s our best bet to actually change the game now .
Win / Lose : WIN

“ Armstrong left a monumental mark on our lives and our culture , ” said Whitaker , who portrayed jazz great Charlie Parker in “ Bird . ”

It ’s been twenty years since Forest Whitaker first got under the skin of a true jazz great , with his wonderful turn as Charlie Parker in ‘s “ . ”
The film will be called “ What a Wonderful World ” based on Armstrong ’s well known song and will chronicle the musician ’s life from his impoverished early days in New Orleans to his death in 1971 following a long career over which he transformed jazz and popular music as a whole .
Whitaker ’s last outing behind the camera was on the forgettable family comedy , “ . ” That was before he won an Oscar for “ , ” of course – and it looks like he ’s using his newfound clout well , by directing a true passion project .

Barbara Bradfield has lived to see dramatic changes in breast cancer .
When she was diagnosed in 1989 , Bradfield 's tumor — which produced an overabundance of a protein called HER2 — was considered especially deadly .
Today , women with tumors like hers have some of the best survival rates in breast cancer .
Experts say the drug that has kept Bradfield healthy for so long , Herceptin , has changed the nature of breast cancer and helped doctors better understand what causes the disease .
In the 10 years since it was approved , doctors say Herceptin also has encouraged the development of a growing arsenal of new therapies that target cancer cells but spare patients from many of the grueling side effects of traditional chemotherapy .
Bradfield , who received chemo before and during her Herceptin therapy , developed permanent hearing loss and numbness in her fingers because of those older drugs .
YOUR HEALTH : Breast reconstruction no easy choice
BETTER LIFE :
More cancer news and studies
Yet critics say researchers have n't made as much progress as many had hoped and note that high prices threaten to limit access to promising technologies .
For decades , doctors treated breast cancer as if it were one disease , says Bradfield 's doctor , Dennis Slamon , who helped develop Herceptin .
Today , Slamon says , doctors recognize that breast cancer is actually a group of seven distinct diseases fueled by different processes inside cells .
Herceptin is designed for the 25 % of tumors that make too much HER2 , says Slamon , director of clinical / translational research at UCLA 's Jonsson Cancer Center .
Herceptin , a man -made antibody , turns off the signals that fuel these breast tumors .
In the future , Slamon says , doctors will increasingly prescribe drugs that are specially tailored to each of these subtypes .
" The old ' one size fits all ' approach , which really dominated clinical trials for four decades , that needs to go away , " he says .
Works even in early stages
At the time Bradfield was being treated , Slamon had trouble finding support for his research .
His struggle will be depicted Saturday in a Lifetime movie , Living Proof ( 9 p.m. ( ET / PT ) .
Today , few companies are developing conventional chemotherapies , says Brian Druker , head of the cancer institute at Oregon Health & Science University .
But companies have at least 200 targeted drugs in their pipelines .
Doctors also have changed the way they use drugs such as Herceptin .
In the beginning , doctors focused on patients such as Bradfield , who had the most advanced disease .
Though Herceptin did n't cure most patients , combining it with traditional chemo helped women live a median of 25 months , compared with women who received only chemo , who lived a median of 20 months .
In a 2005 study in The New England Journal of Medicine , researchers showed that Herceptin works even better in women with early tumors , reducing relapses by half .
Louise Cooper , 55 , was one of the first to get Herceptin as preventive therapy .
Ten years later , she 's cancer - free , has climbed the highest mountains on four continents and is training to run a race in Antarctica .
" I feel blessed , " Cooper says .
" How can you complain when you were supposed to die ? "
Now , doctors are testing Herceptin with other targeted therapies , such as Avastin , to see whether the drugs work even better in combination , Slamon says .
The Food and Drug Administration also has approved a second - generation drug , called lapatinib or Tykerb , that keeps cancers in check after Herceptin stops working .
There are drawbacks
Yet some say that Herceptin 's promise has n't been realized .
Although Herceptin itself causes no side effects , it 's only partly effective when given alone .
Combining it with chemo makes Herceptin work better .
But that means that women are n't able to escape chemo - related side effects , says Fran Visco , president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition .
Herceptin also amplifies the heart damage caused by certain chemo drugs , Slamon says .
And even with chemo , Herceptin helps only half of women whose tumors overproduce HER2 , according to UCLA .
Herceptin also set a new standard in price .
It can cost up to $ 40,000 for a 12 - month course , according to manufacturer Genentech .
Newer cancer drugs cost even more .
Avastin , for examples , sells for $ 55,000 a year .
Cooper says the total cost for care — including Herceptin — was $ 350,000 .
Although her insurance covered almost all of it , many patients struggle to pay for care .
" The goal was to save lives and make sure everyone has access to it , " Visco says .
The prices of new cancer drugs , she says , " are mind - boggling . "
I feel a bit like the heroine in '' Legally Blonde , '' but with different hair color , and of course dialing back on all that fuchsia :
Thanks to my knowledge of shopping , I busted this case wide open !
Over the weekend , Governor Sarah Palin was backing away from Wardrobegate like , well , like an Alaskan moose backing away from the barrel of a 30 - 06 Winchester .
She was back to wearing her own clothes , Palin said pointedly .
And she had bought a lot of them from her favorite store , a resale shop in Anchorage called '' Out of the Closet . ''
That name ....
It rings a bell in Southern California ears , does n't it ?
" Out of the Closet ' ' is a chain of nonprofit thrift stores operated by and for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation .
Liz Taylor has donated stuff to it .
So have Carol Burnett and Aaron Spelling and the makers of " The X Files ' ' and " Buffy the Vampire Slayer . ''
I raised questions about this in an earlier blog post on the subject because the OOTC shop in Anchorage , beloved of Palin , makes no mention of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation on its website .
OOTC 's AIDS charity status is a huge selling point for the California stores .
So I posed the question , " Trademark lawyer alert ? ''
Question answered .
At a press conference today , the AIDS Healthcare Foundation did two things .
One , it invited Palin to donate that notorious $ 150,000 makeover wardrobe to the nonprofit " Out of the Closet . ''
After news of the Saks - Neiman 's - Bloomingdale 's dress - the - candidate shopping spree got out , the campaign tried to recover the PR high ground and said the clothes were always destined for the charity pile anyway .
It did n't specify which charity might get them , but now the AIDS Healthcare Foundation has stepped up and offered to take the whole Valentino - Tahari - Kate Spade - Cole Haan embarrassment off the Republicans ' hands .
And two , the foundation 's lawyers are pressing the trademark infringement issue against the Anchorage OOTC , sending off a ' ' cease and desist ' ' letter about the name that 's been above the doors of the foundation 's AIDS benefit shops since 1990 .
" Out of the Closet ' ' is a federal trademark , and yes , that means Alaska , too .
As Palin herself noted rather indignantly in a Katie Couric interview , ``Alaska is n't a foreign country , where it 's kind of suggested , `Wow , how could you keep in touch with what the rest of Washington , D.C. may be thinking when you live up there in Alaska ? ' ''
Exactly , governor .
Alaska should have no problem keeping in touch with what Washington , D.C. is thinking and doing -- and that includes the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office .

Well , that 's the best pun I could come up with but EasyGUI looks like the missing link that makes Python my first choice where I tended to use Bash .
For all of recent history , I have used dialog for basic interaction with users .
Dialog is a program callable from the shell that produces an assortment of not pretty but functional interaction boxes .
Anyone who has installed Debian or any of its derivatives knows what they look like .
On the other end of the spectrum is QT , the GUI builder behind KDE .
It is pretty , elegant , adaptable and , well , something that requires you to write ( or generate ) C++ code .
While Python tends to be my language of choice , it has always been a pain for tasks I have done with dialog and shell scripts .
The reason is that the standard Python tools for doing GUIs do more than I generally want .
Tkinter is a good example .
It will do what I want but it requires writing an event - driven program and knowing more about Tk than I really want to know .
Well , enter EasyGui .
If you are familiar with using dialog , the best description of EasyGui is that it is dialog except it is activated by Python calls rather than shell commands .
For the rest of you , this is from the EasyGui web page .
EasyGui provides an easy - to - use interface for simple GUI interaction with a user .
It does not require the programmer to know anything about tkinter , frames , widgets , callbacks or lambda .
All GUI interactions are invoked by simple function calls that return results .
I was going to write some of the typical stuff like how to write Hello World using EasyGui but this stuff is all pretty obvious .
It is , well , easy .
Where to use EasyGui , however , is worth mentioning .
In the past few years I have written web applications to perform a task because it is relatively easy to put together a form for user input and produce decent - looking user output .
In many cases , however , I had no need for the web interface — the application was running locally .
While the application was easy to write , the need for a web server and telling the user that they needed to use a browser to run the program was an unnecessary complication .
EasyGui seems to be the perfect " right way " to write these types of applications .

The Cactus Kid advert was in the style of an American road movie A television campaign for a fruit drink which showed a girl running away from home with her new " cactus " boyfriend has been ordered off the air .
The Advertising Standards Authority , which received 32 complaints , said the commercials for Oasis fruit drink were " offensive " and " irresponsible " .
Viewers complained the adverts condoned teenage pregnancy and under - age sex .
The drink 's manufacturers , Coca - Cola , said the commercials were removed from reality and were cleared for broadcast .
It also said that the advert had been scheduled away from children 's programmes .
The two commercials featured a character called The Cactus Kid , who was green , covered in spikes and did not like water .
His pregnant girlfriend was shown having a row with her mother before the couple sped away in a car in the style of an American road movie .
It was irresponsible and could discourage good dietary practice
Advertising Standards Authority
The end - slogan was : " Oasis - for people who do n't like water . "
But the ASA said the two commercials broke its code and must not be shown again in their current form .
The ASA said although Cactus Girl was not under-age , many viewers may have regarded her as being in her early teens .
It said : " We also considered that the combination of her youthful appearance and the reference to her pregnancy meant [ the advert ] could be interpreted to condone under - age sex and teenage pregnancy . "
' Adult audience '
The ASA noted the advert " was intended to promote choice and to use humour to depict Cactus Kid's preference for Oasis " .
But it added : " Because Oasis contained added sugar and the ad suggested water was being rejected by a young girl who drank Oasis as a replacement , we concluded it was irresponsible and could discourage good dietary practice . "
A spokesman for Coca - Cola GB said : " We are disappointed that the complaints against the Oasis Cactus Kid campaign have been upheld by the ASA as the content - rich campaign has been a huge hit with the target audience .
" We ensured that advertising standards were met as we planned the campaign and the ads were approved by Clearcast , in line with their guidelines .
" The subsequent media buying was highly targeted towards an adult audience and fell within Ofcom restrictions . "

We never really understood the appeal of paintball fights .
Laying in the mud for four hours so one of your friends can come along and shoot you in the ass with a highly - pressurized ball of goo is not our idea of a relaxing weekend .

Money quote from a photographer :
By the time I realized I was at the center of the conflict it was too late .
The bombs and tear gas were exploding all around me and cops were screaming at everyone to go south toward the bridge .
I yelled to one cop " I 'm media !
Where do I go ? ! " but he pointed his rubber bullet gun at me and yelled " Go to the fucking bridge ! "
It was utter chaos .
The police were throwing gas and bombs in between the bridge and people being told to go to the bridge .
Poor aim ?
Amid the mayhem I managed to click away a few frames , but I could n't help but notice what was going on .
They had surrounded the area and were corralling what seemed like 300 people , including a large number of media and legal observers , onto the bridge for a mass arrest .

Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research and Technology Thomas Killian has one word for you : " nanobot . "
He 's thinking about how to sell that idea - along with many other potential methods of futurewar - to futurearmies , and the answer may be at Army Experience Centers , which introduce young people directly to the technology they 'll use to protect America or rescue Cortana from the Covenant to recruit a new generation of soldiers .
We take you into Killian 's mad laboratory , where yesterday 's superhero movie becomes the soldier of tomorrow .
Killon 's focus on robotics has been a consistent aspect of his tenure as the Army 's No. 1 scientist :

" [ W ] e 're now seeing a generation of soldiers who are very comfortable with that technology .
They do n't have a second thought about the fact that they 're using a robot to perform a task .
They think that 's just the way business is done .
And that 's how the future will be .
They 'll think of robots as collaborators or partners or members of their squad , and it wo n't be unusual for them anymore , like it would be for us , because we come from a prior generation .
And that 's important — that level of comfort and confidence is critical . "

The Army 's Acquisitions , Logistics and Technology ( ALT ) department has grown considerably under Killion 's watch .
He continues to think outside of the box : at a recent panel , he discussed the research of sensors that monitor brain functions , which could lead to enhanced prosthesis control .
The Army demonstrated its experiments with exoskeletons as recently as last year .
The development of a material that would help matters is also ongoing :
“ We ’re trying to develop new fabrics ” that could make combat uniforms tough as steel , [ director for research and laboratory management for the Army , John A. ] Parmentola says .
The answer is in nanotechnology .
At the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies , scientists are trying to grow single carbon nanotubes to about a foot in length .
“ Once we start getting them in length , the hope is that we ’ll be able to spin them into fabric , ” he says .

Army Scientists in Pursuit of the Extraordinary [ National Defense Magazine ]
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Some 170 wedding banquet guests were rushed to hospital in north China when powdered rust remover was added to the pot instead of salt after they all decided it needed added flavor , Chinese media said .
In a bizarre coincidence , 61 wedding guests were taken to hospital with similar symptoms a day earlier after a duck - and - donkey - meat banquet in northwest China .
In the rust remover case , the bride ’s proud father invited 170 friends and relatives to the wedding banquet at a village in northern Hebei province on Friday , the night before the nuptials , the Beijing News said .
“ All food was stewed in a big pot but after dinner started , all of them felt the taste was too bland , ” the newspaper said .
Someone added what he or she thought was salt -- several times .
An hour later , the guests were being rushed to hospital .
“ When I arrived at the hospital , the observation room was packed with people vomiting , with stomach pains and with diarrhea , ” a doctor was quoted as saying .
The symptoms were short - lived and all the victims were released by the next day .
A day earlier , 61 wedding guests suffered food poisoning at a banquet in impoverished Gansu province , local authorities said .
“ Currently , 17 people have been discharged but 44 are still in the hospital .
No one has died , ” Xinhua news agency quoted an official as saying .
Duck , donkey meat , chicken and shrimp were the main dishes served at the dinner .
China has been hit by a series of food - safety scares in recent years , most recently when thousands of infants fell sick from contaminated milk powder .
At least four died .
Introduction
It is always fun to see how the latest and greatest hardware performs , but not all gamers have cutting - edge machines or the means to upgrade every time a faster graphics card hits the streets .
Many gamers want to know how to best squeeze more life out of their rigs — or whether it ’s even possible .
Very affordable PCI
Express gaming cards are all over the place now , but are any worth putting into an aging machine ?
Will that upgrade alone allow you to play the latest popular games at high details ?
How much CPU do you need ?
Does a single - core CPU still have what it takes ?
Will any dual - core chip suffice , regardless of its clock speeds ?
We try to answer every single one of these questions as we take an aging — yet hopefully capable — gaming box , put in a couple of affordable graphics cards , and test its performance in some modern games with an older single - core CPU and with two dual - core processors .
Our main focus today is on AMD Athlon 64 systems , built on a Socket 754 , Socket 939 or Socket AM2 motherboard , but anyone with a system that is now a couple of years old and starting to show its age stands to benefit from our little blast from the past .
Lets see if it ’s time to retire that once - mighty gaming system altogether or if a graphics upgrade can extend its useful life a while longer .
During the credit crisis , the Dow has seen an astonishing number of days when it has finished up or down several hundred points , once swinging 1,000 points in a single day .
That does n't bode well for a stable investing environment .
The recession may be worse than feared .
See video at left .
" We can't have these monstrous swings up or down on a daily basis , " says Richard Sparks , senior analyst at Schaeffer 's Investment Research in Cincinnati .
" That does n't create any foundation for future buying and does n't create a situation where people would want to put their money at risk . "
But on the positive side , Sparks points out that the VIX on Monday closed below its 10 - day moving average , which it has n't done in a month .
" When that 's happened , when it 's traded a number of days above the 10 - day moving average then moved below that , it 's a pretty positive sign for the market , " he says .
But even a low VIX does n't necessarily mean a turnaround .
The barometer stayed low for much of the market 's run downward , spiking only recently during the latest wave of bad banking news and subsequent government bailout plans .
For investors
" When the VIX gets down to about 40 , which was the previous high , then that means that everyone 's become complacent again , " says Peter Miralles , president of Atlanta Wealth Consultants .
" The question is , are they complacent for good reasons ?
The pendulum has swung and we 're seeing high volatility .
Unfortunately the volatility all came at one time toward the downside . "
Credit
When the stock market began falling off its October 2007 highs , it was a precipitous drop in the banking sector that brought the major averages down .
A few months later , oil prices began to soar as a hedge against falling stocks .
Soon , the two began marching in reverse lockstep -- when oil prices rose , stocks fell , and vice versa .
Now it is lending rates , particularly the London Interbank Offer Rate , or Libor , that seems to have Wall Street 's ear .
If Libor is up , stocks are generally down , though that was n't the case Tuesday .
Analysts say getting banks to loosen their purse strings and put money back out on the street again is pivotal towards stabilizing the stock market and the economy .
" Any kind of loosening up of the noose on the credit markets would free up individuals to do some spending , it would free up corporations to do some spending , " says Rick Pendergraft , head of the Investor 's Daily Edge newsletter .
" If we can see a little better increase in spending both at the consumer level and the corporate level , then I think we could get a better idea of where this economy is heading for the next six months . "
Miralles says the credit freeze has begun to thaw , but it 's still unclear as to how long it will take stocks to benefit and how much credit concerns will continue to weigh on the economy .
" Is the second shoe going to drop as far as the economy goes ? "
Yes , but is it already factored into the market ?
That 's the big question , " he says .
" We do n't know that . "

Metta : Hi !
Ashin , my name is Ashin Mettacara .
I am blogging and spreading news to world about Burma .
I heard that you escaped from a junta prison .
Please can you share your prison experiences with us .
What is your full name and code - name ?
Panna :
Why not .
My full name is Ashin Pannasiri and I use Mettananda and also Upakkha as code -names .
Panna : I was a spokes - monk for the Saffron Revolution , especially for foreign media .
I had interviews with Al Jazeera , AFP dung the uprsing .
Metta : I heard you have a close relationship with U Gambira who was a spokesmonk for the Saffron Revolution ?
Metta :
When were you arrested ?
Panna : I was arrested at an internet café , in Monywa on October 18 , 2007 .
Metta :
Can you speak about your experiences during interrogation ?
Did they use violent methods ?
Panna : Soon after I was in the interrogation center , I was forced to do squatting and standing .
They asked many questions ,
After every one question I was punched in the face .
If they were not satisfied with my answer , they stamped on my toes with their boots .
They kicked me in my face and chest .
Their biggest question was about NLD party members and 88 generation students .
I spent 6 days in the interrogation center after which I was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment for possessing foreign currency .
After seven months in Monywa prison , I was sent to Lin Tan hard labor camp in Chin state .
Metta :
What was life like in the hard labor camp ?
Panna : Prisoners had to work with their feet in chains from 7a. m to 11 am and then again from 1 pm to 5 pm .
I had to do work I had never done before .
Mostly I had to carry heavy logs on my shoulders , dig ditches and mend roads .
We were sometimes forced to eat rice mixed rat feces and stones .
It was horrible .
Many prisoners die because of lack of medical care .
Metta :
This is a sad story and you look so tired !
Thank you so very much for giving of your time and answering my questions .

Ubisoft : All In - house Games to Be Designed for the Hearing Impaired
Far Cry 2 will be the first game released by the French publishing firm to include subtitles , followed by Prince of Persia and Shaun White Snowboarding later this year .
Far Cry 2 : Now with Subtitles ( not shown )
Ubisoft also runs a charity known as AbilityTogether , which will partner with non-profit organization Handicap International to launch a game called Handigo .
The game is a set of educational mini-games which " puts the player in the shoes of someone with a physical disability , a sensory disability , or learning difficulties , " in order to educate the public about accessibility issues .
Blake : Ubisoft is n't the first game company to add subtitles or closed - captions to its games , but it is among the first to make it a policy .
I know virtually no one disabled , but I do welcome a concerted move for greater accessibility and so should all gamers .
Likewise , if Ubisoft intends to keep using French voice actors for English dialogue in a game taking place in Japan , I 'll be taking advantage of the new policy myself .

Presenter , Analysis , BBC Radio 4
The dollar is becoming more of a problem for the US , Prof Woods argues .
We are living in economic chaos .
Banks , homes , jobs , and businesses are at risk .
Yet curiously , the one thing that seems stable is the dollar .
It is a symbol - and a lever - of American power and leadership , itis the standard unit of account for much of the world 's economic activity .
And in times of crisis , it has often seemed a safe haven .
But in the longer term , some experts believe this crisis could mark a turning point in the dollar 's fortunes , hastening a fall from power which has seen its value decline over several years before its recent rally .
" I think today 's financial crisis is going to hasten the end of the dollar as the world 's reserve currency " , says Avinash Persaud , chairman of Intelligence Capital Limited .
" For the first time ever we 're now seeing that in the financial markets it costs money to guarantee you against a US government default . "
' Exorbitant privilege '
For the American government there is simply no such thing as living beyond its means .
With the rest of the world demanding dollars , all the US has to do is to keep printing them
Prof Ngaire Woods
Dollars and dominance Listen to the programme
He wonders whether the combined cost of foreign wars and domestic bail - outs is being seen as " a burden too far " for the US .
But for the dollar to lose reserve currency status would end what has been in many ways a huge bonus for the US .
It is sometimes described as the ability to write cheques that no - one ever cashes .
So for the American government there is simply no such thing as living beyond its means .
With the rest of the world demanding dollars , all the US has to do is to keep printing them .
This makes possible things that no other government could imagine - a power that America 's rivals have historically denounced as an " exorbitant privilege " .
In the early 1970s , US Treasury Secretary John Connally even told the outside world , brutally , that the dollar was " our currency , but your problem " .
Euro reluctance
Since then , Europe has developed its own currency , the euro , which has taken on a global role .
As it grew in strength against the dollar it challenged some of the dollar 's glamorous reputation .
Supermodels in New York started asking for contracts in euros rather than dollars .
But European leaders are far from keen on seeing their currency become the world 's reserve money .
Chinese exports have helped it build up huge dollar reserves " Europe has got a much less vast set of ambitions than America has ever had " , says David Marsh , a banker who is just finishing a book charting the birth of the euro .
Adopting the currency , he adds , was a " flight into a lack of ambition " .
Potential to undermine
So might a rising economic power like China supply the dollar 's eventual global successor ?
At present , China lacks the open markets or institutions to support that role .
But Avinash Persaud points out that similarly dismissive things were said about the US a century ago .
We are emerging into is this very hazy and slightly worrying state of affairs where there is n't going to be any single country leading the world in the way the US has done and with it no single currency either
Jim O'Neill
Goldman Sachs
The US did not have a Central Bank until 1913 , yet within a few decades the dollar was challenging sterling for world domination .
For now , China has a huge stake in what happens to the dollar , as it has built up well over a trillion dollars ' worth of assets in the US currency thanks to its recent export boom .
That gives China a vested interest in a strong dollar .
But it also gives
Beijing the power to undermine the US currency should it choose to move its money .
This has been called by one former US Treasury Secretary the " balance of financial terror " .
" It 's like the idea of mutually assured deterrence " says leading US political scientist Barry Eichengreen .
" We hope that everybody becomes respectful of the financial power of the other side , but that such destructive power wo n't be deployed . "
Balancing act
So a new kind of American economic diplomacy has to emerge , particularly with the Gulf States .
They 're not only holding dollars , but pricing their oil in " petrodollars " .
The US government is torn .
Dollar - rich foreign states may demand a strong US currency , but that is bad for American exporters .
A strong dollar makes US exports expensive
It makes every American car or computer sold abroad more expensive .
That is why the dollar has been quietly let slide over the last six years - and the weaker dollar has boosted American exports .
Jim O'Neill , Head of Global Economic Research at Goldman Sachs , believes " we are emerging into is this very hazy and slightly worrying state of affairs where there is n't going to be any single country leading the world in the way the US has done and with it no single currency either " .
So the next American President has a delicate balancing act ahead .
If dollar - rich foreign countries do n't like what 's happening to the US currency , they may look for alternatives .
And everyone knows that , down the line , the power of the dollar has to decline as the global balance of economic power changes .
So the dollar is no longer their currency and everyone else 's problem .
It is now the world 's currency - and mostly America 's problem .

Tascam US1641 USB 2.0 Audio/ MIDI
Interface With sixteen inputs , the TASCAM US - 1641 is the ideal choice for musicians to record the whole band to a computer .
Tweak : Surprisingly well - endowed with 8 preamps , selectable phantom power and impedance , MIDI i/o and s/ pdif .
That 's a lot for the price .
USB 2.0 Audio Interface
Comparison Chart
Soundcards and Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6
How to Read this Chart
This chart is for USB 2.0 audio interfaces .
These interfaces require a USB 2.0 port on your computer for optimal performance .
The chart attempts to cut through some of the confusion caused by the inconsistent definitions manufacturers often use .
Manufacturers may count inputs and outputs differently .
This chart is an attempt to fairly compare the above devices , based on an interpretation of what constitutes a discrete audio channel .
Analog i/o refers to actual analog input and output channels , not necessarily how many input and output jacks are on the device .
The first number is the number of input channels and the second number is the number of output channels .
This number includes the mic preamps but does not include headphone outs .
If a Mic preamp and a line input share the same channel , that channel is only counted once .
This is to give you a true idea of how many analog input and output channels the box has .
Likewise if the main output pair has " main outs " and " monitor outs " these channels are only counted once , as they " share " the same channels .
How many analog inputs you need depends on how many sources you want to record at the same time .
Also , if you have a synthesizer or drum machine you need inputs through which to record and monitor these .
How many outputs you need depends on how much gear you have that you want to send audio to .
If you want to use an FX box , you need to use an output to send it audio and you need two inputs to get it back .
If you want to mix your song on an analog mixer you need a lot of outputs .
If you are mixerless and are mixing in your software you only need 2 outputs -- those to which you connect your monitors .
S / pdif i/o is either yes or no .
This is a stereo digital pathway , and may be either coaxial or optical .
S/ pdif is useful for connecting digital audio devices , like external a/d converters , effects processors , CDR recorders , even some preamps and keyboards that have digital outs .
Preamps refers to the number of microphone preamps the interface has .
Usually these can double as instrument inputs ( guitar , bass , etc . )
But check on that before you buy .
Also some interfaces ( but not all ) will have insert jacks or send outputs for connecting compressors and other processors .
You might want to check on that too when evaluating an audio interface .
ADAT refers to an 8 channel digital input and output .
It is useful for connecting more mic preamps , a second audio interface or computer , a digital mixer , or can be used to add more analog i/o through an 8 channel ad / da converter .
When you see ADAT x2 in the chart that means the device has two ADAT ports in and out or 16 channels in and out .
( Sometimes two ADAT ports may be used for eight channels at a high sample rate like 96kHz )
MIDI i/o refers to the number of 16 channel ports there are on the interface .
1/2 means it has one MIDI input and two MIDI outputs .
MIDI inputs and outputs are used to connect a MIDI synthesizer , keyboard controller , drum pad controller , and some control surfaces .
You need one port for every device you want to connect to the computer .
You can always add more via separate MIDI interfaces .
Headphones refers to the number of stereo headphone jacks on the unit .
Word Clock refers the presence of a BNC connector through which word sync signals can be sent to other digital devices .
It is important that all digital devices connected through s/ pdif or ADAT share the same word sync .
For simple setups that may have two digital devices , having a word clock connector is not usually necessary .
Sync can be sent along through the s/ pdif or ADAT connection .
It becomes important in rigs where there may be multiple digital devices where it is impossible to send word sync to all devices .
Prices and specs may change from when this chart was made .
You can check the product descriptions at the manufacturers websites for up to date details .

Bailed - Out but Still Giving Bonuses Questions loom over how much cash Wall Street firms are still paying executives .
Oct. 23 , 2008  --
Fear that Wall Street firms receiving billions of taxpayer dollars in aid might still go ahead with hefty executive bonuses has led one U.S. congressman to start investigating compensation packages .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , who is chairman of the Domestic Policy subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , said he plans to ask banks and brokerages to detail their employee pay packages .
How Is the Economy Treating You ?
Tell ABC News
Kucinich voted against the $ 700 billion bailout package , saying that he " had great suspicions " that the money would n't help stop the flood of foreclosures .
Reining in excessive executive compensation was promised as part of the bailout plan .
Now it appears , Kucinich said , that such promises are n't coming true and that some firms might even be using the cash from the federal bailout to reward employees .
" That raises questions about the legitimacy of the bailout and we really need to find out how widespread this is , " he told ABC News today .
Kucinich 's concerns stem from a recent report by London 's The Guardian that more than $ 70 billion in bonuses might be paid out by Wall Street banks this year .
The firms named by the British paper include Citigroup , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley .
" This is a disgrace , " Kucinich said , adding that some additional congressional action may be warranted .
" The bailout continues to be perverted by those who led us into the problem to begin with and who stand not to just profit in a corporate sense but to profit personally through bonus packages . "
Kucinich does not have confirmation of The Guardian 's report but hopes to get some answers .
" No one is denying that this is happening , " he said .
" That AIG took action confirms that it 's happening .
We just have to see the extent of it . "
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo yesterday announced that AIG had agreed to freeze $ 19 million in compensation for its former chief executive and another $ 600 million that was set aside for other executives .
The New York - based insurer has sought more than $ 120 billion in aid from the Federal Reserve so far .
" We really have to get a grip on this , " Kucinich said .
" This is something that homeowners must find intolerable as they are struggling to pay their mortgages . "

Kucinich said it could be some time before his staff gets the requested information -- if it gets what it seeks -- and gets a clear picture of what exactly is going on inside these firms .
" We need to go deeply into this financial crisis , " he added , " find out to the extent there 's been criminal misconduct , hold people accountable and change the way that we regulate these concerns . "

Baroness Neville - Jones , Conservative security spokesman and former chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee , said : " The information about a possible link between extremism and child pornography potentially provides useful insight into three things : the methods that extremists use to communicate ; the methods they use to target vulnerable people in society ; and the techniques they seek to use to conceal their online activities . "
SACRAMENTO —
With state finances deteriorating in sync with the national economy , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders met Wednesday to discuss how to avoid running out of money within weeks — and how to handle a looming multibillion - dollar deficit in the months to follow .
The unusual meeting , coming during the Legislature ’s annual recess and in the thick of the fall election season , underscored the seriousness of the state ’s financial outlook .
It occurred just two weeks after the governor signed a budget , a time when state spending usually recedes to the background .
Schwarzenegger and the legislative leaders spent much of the afternoon session focused on the immediate problem of how to pay the state ’s day - to - day bills .
Typically at this time of the year , the state obtains short - term loans — known as revenue anticipation notes — to tide itself over until more tax revenue arrives in the spring .
But the frozen national credit market has complicated that borrowing this year .
Without an infusion of several billion dollars , the state is on track to run out of money at the end of October .
Schwarzenegger and the lawmakers emerged from the roughly hour - and - a - half session confident that would not happen .
“ Hopefully the credit market will loosen up and we ’ll be able to get that ” loan , Assembly Speaker Karen Bass , D - Los Angeles , said .
“ We do believe it will . ”
Officials received some encouraging news on that front Wednesday , when Massachusetts successfully sold $ 750 million of the type of short - term bonds that California is looking to sell .
Next week , the state Treasurer plans to go to the market with a $ 4 billion offering .
“ It hopefully bodes well for us , ” said Tom Dresslar , a spokesman for the California treasurer , Bill Lockyer .
As a backup , last week Schwarzenegger notified U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that California may need an emergency $ 7 billion loan from the federal government .
The state treasurer ’s office has also recently explored borrowing money from the state retirement system or directly from banks , although that last option would probably carry a higher interest rate .
Although it ’s likely the state will secure the money somehow , that ’s just the beginning of its problems .
The $ 103.4 billion budget that Schwarzenegger signed last month is already more than $ 1 billion in the red , a figure that officials expect to grow to $ 3 billion during this fiscal year , which ends June 30 .
That may force lawmakers to return to Sacramento — they ’re scheduled to be in recess until December — to resume the seemingly never ending battle over taxes and spending .
Schwarzenegger Wednesday held off calling a special session of the Legislature to address the budget .
The governor said he and legislative leaders would continue to meet weekly to assess the state ’s finances .
The recently enacted budget used a mix of accounting maneuvers and budget cuts to close a $ 15.2 billion deficit .
Several provisions simply accelerate the collection of taxes , to boost this year ’s numbers at the expense of future years .
Critics said the plan did little to fix the ongoing $ 6 billion - $ 8 billion “ structural ” gap between spending and income .
That criticism could make a new legislative session on the budget even more contentious .
During this summer ’s record 85 - day budget impasse , Republicans blocked attempts by Democratic legislators and Schwarzenegger to raise taxes , taking advantage of a rule requiring a two - thirds vote to raise taxes .
At the same time , the majority party came under withering criticism from advocates for schools , health care and other typically Democratic constituencies for agreeing to the cuts they did .
Compounding the state ’s problems is a national economy that appears to be worsening by the day .
The tailspin in the stock market could be especially painful because California ’s tax structure relies heavily on taxes on stock - related capital gains .
Those revenues shoot up in good times but can drop precipitously in bad times .
On top of everything else , U.S. District Court Judge Thelton Henderson on Wednesday ordered the state to prepare to turn over $ 250 million to the federal receiver charged with improving health care in the state ’s prisons .
Altogether , the receiver is seeking $ 8 billion .
Henderson ordered state officials to spell out at a hearing later this month how and when they will transfer the $ 250 million down payment to the court - appointed receiver .

THE scenery is breathtaking .
Sandwiched between two seas and home to Europe 's highest mountains , the Caucasus has always been an alluring and darkly mysterious region .
Its reputation rose during its long , slow conquest by imperial Russia in the 19th century .
The Caucasus features prominently in the poetry of Pushkin and the fiction of Tolstoy .
A classic Russian figure , the “ superfluous man ” who is powerless and does n't fit in , first appeared in the character of Pechorin in Lermontov 's novel , “ A Hero of Our Time ” , set in the Caucasus .
Russian readers were also enthralled by the exploits of the Caucasian resistance hero , Imam Shamil .
Now the Caucasus is at centre - stage again .
The restive north Caucasus republics in the Russian federation are always in the news .
After two bloody wars with the Russians , Chechnya is more or less at peace under the thumb of its strongman president , Ramzan Kadyrov , but could easily flare up again .
Dagestan has become an increasingly lawless place .
Worse , Ingushetia is in a state of near - anarchy , with Russian security services using the same brutal methods as armed Ingush rebels .
But it is the three countries of the south Caucasus — Georgia , Azerbaijan and Armenia — that are the bigger story now , for they are the cockpit in a new clash between Russia and the West .
The main reason these tiny countries matter , despite a combined population of only 16 m or so , is geographical .
Perched next to Turkey , north of Iran and south of Russia , this is a place where empires have long met — and clashed .
Russia never reconciled itself to losing control of the Caucasus when the Soviet Union broke up in 1990 - 91 .
Moscow has been visibly fretful about rising Western influence .
The Russians have been especially hostile to Georgia 's president , Mikheil Saakashvili , who swept to power after ousting Eduard Shevardnadze in the “ rose revolution ” of 2003 .
Indeed , the icy personal relations between Mr Saakashvili and Russia 's Vladimir Putin have clouded the whole region .
The Russians have kept up a trade and travel embargo on Georgia .
They were incensed by NATO 's decision in April that Georgia should one day be a member , even if the country was not offered an immediate “ membership action plan ” .
Russia is less neuralgic about the other two Caucasus countries , where its influence is stronger .
Yet in many ways Azerbaijan matters more than Georgia , as it has lots of oil and gas ( Georgia and Armenia have plenty of minerals , but little energy ) .
The whole area is crucial for existing and planned pipelines , especially for gas , that can supply Europe while bypassing Russia ( see map ) .
Pipelines go a long way towards explaining why the Caucasus is now such a critical theatre in Russia 's face - off with the West .
The third reason why the Caucasus matters is that it harbours several simmering conflicts left after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
Indeed , most of the fighting then took place in the Caucasus .
Georgia was left with two regions , Abkhazia and South Ossetia , that broke free of Tbilisi 's control in two wars in the early 1990s .
As became clear in August , Russia sustains their independence from the irritating Mr Saakashvili .
Azerbaijan has the autonomous region of Nagorno - Karabakh , over which it fought and lost an even bloodier war with Armenia in 1991 - 94 .
Today Armenia controls not only Nagorno - Karabakh but also seven villages in Azerbaijan proper , and soldiers are frequently killed along the ceasefire line .
Marching through Georgia
It was on August 7th that the world woke up to the dangers of the Caucasus 's territorial conflicts .
For months the Russians had done their utmost to provoke the Georgian president , who has a reputation as a hothead .
Bombs were dropped , drones sent over Georgian territory , invasion exercises staged .
The Americans insist they were urging restraint on Mr Saakashvili , but some observers claim the signals were mixed .
After all , Mr Saakashvili had promised to restore Georgia 's territorial integrity ; and he also seized a smaller rebellious enclave , Ajaria , in 2004 .
He may have banked on doing the same in South Ossetia without either American objections or a determined Russian response .
Tension rose steadily during the week leading up to August 7th .
Indeed , Paata Zakareishvili , a close observer of the enclaves , believes that war could have broken out on any day that week .
Yet what actually happened on August 7th remains a matter of fierce dispute — and may be the subject of an international inquiry that Mr Saakashvili says he would welcome , and claims he was the first to call for .
The Georgian version of events goes like this .
After several days of skirmishes with South Ossetian forces , Mr Saakashvili announced a ceasefire , which he says was violated by the Ossetians .
But he decided to shell and then invade Tskhinvali , the South Ossetian capital , only once Russian troops and tanks started pouring in from North Ossetia through the Roki tunnel on the evening of August 7th .
The Russians insist that no troops entered the tunnel and that the attack on Tskhinvali was unprovoked ( monitors from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe , trapped in Tskhinvali , say that they heard no Ossetian shelling before the Georgians opened up ) .
At the time the Russians also asserted that 2,000 people had been killed in the city and talked wildly of genocide ( the true number seems to be little more than 100 ) .
The Russians responded with massive force .
Although they took heavy casualties from the Georgians as their columns drove south , sheer numbers eventually told and the Georgians were pushed back before abandoning the fight .
The Russians then occupied swathes of territory around the enclaves and briefly threatened Tbilisi before declaring a ceasefire .
Yet for weeks after they first promised the European Union that they would withdraw from Georgia proper , the Russians kept their troops and checkpoints on the thin excuse of taking “ security measures ” .
These forces smashed up Georgian bases , ports , railways and roads .
The Russians have just declared that they have fulfilled their most recent promise to the EU to pull out of Georgia proper by October 10th .
Yet their troops are in places where they were not before August 7th , and there are far more of them .
Georgian villages in and near South Ossetia have been subjected to brutal ethnic cleansing .
And the Abkhaz have taken back the Kodori gorge from Georgian forces .
This is a long way from restoring the status quo before August 7th .
The short August war has also left Georgia with the burden of as many as 60,000 refugees .
The EU has now deployed some 200 ceasefire monitors , but the Russians will not let them into the two enclaves , which they have unilaterally recognised as independent states .
Talks over the enclaves ' status began in Geneva this week but broke up almost immediately , when the Russians walked out .
Agreement was clearly impossible .
The Russians think they won the war and should reap the rewards .
The Georgians can not let go of the enclaves .
Even Nino Burjanadze , a former speaker of the Georgian parliament who is now an opponent of Mr Saakashvili's , says this would be like cutting off one 's arms and legs .
One effect of the war was to dampen Georgia 's soaring economy .
Real GDP rose by over 12 % in 2007 , thanks to a surge in foreign investment , a liberalisation programme and a curbing of once - endemic corruption .
Mr Saakashvili says that , if the war had happened just two years ago , the economy would have collapsed .
Now , he notes with satisfaction , Russian financial markets have suffered the bigger falls .
Admittedly , growth looks like lapsing to 5 % or less this year , not least because of a bleaker world economic outlook ; but reconstruction work and a promised inflow of foreign aid should push it up next year .
The political prospects in Georgia are murkier .
Although Mr Saakashvili likes to say that the best response to Russia 's aggression is more democracy , he has yet to translate his words into action .
He did himself no favours by crushing opposition protests in Tbilisi last November .
He was re-elected president in January , and his party won the parliamentary election in May .
But the opposition is regrouping .
Ms Burjanadze plans to form a new party .
More critics of Mr Saakashvili's warmongering venture into South Ossetia and his autocratic instincts are emerging : Georgia 's ombudsman recently called for “ real democracy ” to replace authoritarianism .
Ironically it is the Russians , who most want to get rid of Mr Saakashvili , who are now his biggest prop : since the war , his popularity rating has risen to over 75 % .
Even today , Mr Saakashvili claims to regret nothing ; he maintains that he had no alternative and that the war was not really about South Ossetia and Abkhazia at all .
Indeed , he barely accepts that Georgia lost .
As he sees it , the Russians already controlled both enclaves ; his government has not fallen ; vital pipelines across Georgia were undamaged despite Russian bombing ; and the economy is holding up .
And he revels in the world 's attention .
When Georgia was overrun by bigger neighbours in the past , he says , nobody paid any heed ; this time , leaders from all over Europe flocked to Tbilisi to show their support .
The oil - and - gas game
The August war has profoundly affected Azerbaijan and Armenia too .
Neither is anywhere near as democratic as Georgia , both are friendlier to Russia ( Armenia , in particular , is a close ally ) and neither aspires yet to join Western clubs like NATO or the EU .
Yet , in the war 's aftermath , both are looking to the West more than before .
Azerbaijan 's president , Ilham Aliev , predictably won re-election on October 15th , in part because most opposition candidates boycotted the poll on the ground that it was neither free nor fair .
An autocratic government can appear to create stability .
Yet the younger Mr Aliev is widely seen as a weaker leader than his father Heidar , who bequeathed him the presidency in 2003 , and some think he is in hock to the country 's most powerful business oligarchs .
Opposition leaders like Eldar Namazov claim that there is even less freedom now than before .
What is certain is that Azerbaijan 's oil - fired economy has been booming .
As one diplomat says , it feels and looks a bit like a slightly seedy Gulf emirate .
The Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline is now shipping 1 m barrels of oil a day ; gas is flowing to Georgia , Turkey and Russia .
Baku is smothered in petrodollars , with glitzy new buildings and horrendous traffic jams .
It is less clear that ordinary citizens are benefiting .
Many complain about inflation , which is running anywhere between 16 % ( officially ) and 30 % ( say some economists ) .
The government talks up its programme of economic liberalisation , which has been praised by the World Bank .
Yet Azerbaijan also has a reputation for corruption .
There is a big downside to the oil boom : it crushes the non-oil economy .
One economist says that oil and gas now account for half of GDP and over 90 % of exports .
The real exchange rate has appreciated sharply , one reason why Baku is so expensive .
Worse , oil and gas reserves in Azerbaijani territory are finite .
Bill Schrader , head of BP Azerbaijan , notes that the real game for the future will be to try to tap into the Turkmenistan side of the Caspian , which has huge reserves of gas .
Azerbaijan 's energy wealth is naturally of interest to the Russians , who want it to sell more oil and gas northwards .
Russia 's energy giant , Gazprom , is desperate for more gas .
But the government is having none of it : it supplies Georgia with gas against Russia 's wishes , for example , and it is enthusiastic about pipelines to the West ( including the planned Nabucco pipeline ) .
Officials see big advantages in not depending on a single buyer .
Looking for allies
Another big cloud on the horizon is Nagorno - Karabakh .
Negotiations over the Armenian - controlled territory continue fitfully in the so - called Minsk group led by Russia , America and France .
Until the war in Georgia , observers were worried that a newly rich Azerbaijan , which is spending heavily on defence , might again resort to force .
Ordinary Azerbaijanis , angry that one - seventh of their country is occupied by Armenia , remain belligerent .
But after Georgia a new war looks less , not more , likely , not least because the Russians would not allow Armenia , their ally and host to two big military bases , to be beaten .
Yet the Armenians are not complacent .
Russia 's war with Georgia made this tiny landlocked country feel highly vulnerable .
Its eastern border with Azerbaijan has been blocked by the aftermath of the 1991 - 94 war , and the Turks sealed their western border in 1993 in sympathy with their Azeri cousins .
Some 80 % of Armenia 's trade goes through ports in Georgia , many of which were damaged by the Russians .
Not surprisingly , the Armenians are looking around for more friends in the neighbourhood besides Russia .
A new gas pipeline from Iran is planned , for instance .
Armenia is hardly less autocratic than Azerbaijan .
The election in February that brought Serzh Sargsyan into the presidency was criticised by most Western monitors .
Worse , the opposition leader ( and former president ) , Levon Ter -Petrossian , who says roundly that the election was stolen , took his followers on to the streets .
The result was the most violent protests Yerevan has ever seen , put down by the government with the loss of eight lives .
As many as 74 opposition demonstrators remain in jail , although Mr Sargsyan blandly assures interlocutors that there are no political prisoners in Armenia .
Reuters
Saakashvili , shaken but not stirred
As in the rest of the Caucasus , the economy has done well in recent years , although it is over - dependent on raw materials , construction and diamond - trading , plus remittances from the large Armenian diaspora .
It is also the diaspora that bangs the drum most loudly against a diplomatic settlement of Karabakh or any improvement of relations with Turkey .
Yet Mr Sargsyan is being bolder than his predecessor - turned - critic , Robert Kocharian .
Both men come from Nagorno - Karabakh , so they are hardly likely to let go of the Armenian - populated enclave .
But Mr Sargsyan is readier to negotiate and to give back most Armenian - controlled territory in Azerbaijan outside Nagorno - Karabakh .
Even that may not be enough to settle the dispute , for this would require Azerbaijan to accept the de facto independence of Karabakh .
The other two reasons for mild hope concern Turkey .
Mr Sargsyan bravely invited the Turkish president , Abdullah Gul , to a football match in early September .
Talks between the two foreign ministers took place in New York three weeks later .
The aim , as Edward Nalbandian , the Armenian foreign minister , puts it , is to achieve “ total normalisation ” of relations with Turkey .
On the Armenian side , that means dropping all preconditions , including demands that Turkey accept that there was an Armenian genocide in 1915 .
Mr Sargsyan has gingerly expressed support instead for a Turkish idea that the subject should be looked at by a joint historical commission .
The push to reopen the border with Turkey is clearly driven in part by Georgia 's war with Russia .
But there is a long way to go before inhabitants of Yerevan can cross the border to their sacred Mount Ararat .
As always , some businessmen benefit from its closure .
Moreover , Karabakh will be a continuing sore : on the Armenian side , some may prefer stasis on Karabakh to normal relations with Turkey , while the Azerbaijanis , who have great influence in Turkey , will do their utmost to upset friendlier links between Turkey and Armenia .
A Western opportunity
To outsiders , the Caucasus often seems a hotbed of devilish intrigue , power games and insoluble ethnic conflict .
The war in Georgia confirmed the worst suspicions of many .
Yet both in Georgia and in its two neighbours , it could also have created an opportunity for change .
For all his bravado , Mr Saakashvili was clearly shaken .
He should now be more amenable to the line that the best way to promote Georgia 's integrity is to foster a genuinely liberal democracy — so that , one day , the enclaves might choose to return .
A similar argument could carry some force in Azerbaijan and Armenia as they look for friends beyond Russia .
If the West is to be consistent , however , it should support these countries only in so far as they take steps , however slowly , in the same democratic direction as Georgia .
Two keys could help to unlock this process .
The first is to dangle the prospect , however distant , that all three countries might one day qualify as members of the EU .
As experience in eastern Europe has shown , this is the best way to lure countries towards reform .
The EU may offer a better route than NATO membership , which is both more problematic and further off after Georgia 's war .
The second key is to work with Turkey , which as the only NATO country in the region is well - placed to offset Russia 's influence .
Shortly after the war , Turkey launched a proposed “ Caucasus Stability and Co-operation Platform ” , which even the Russians applauded .
Turkish companies are active in the region , conspicuously so in Georgia and Azerbaijan and ( in disguise ) even in Armenia .
If the Turks can improve relations with Armenia , including opening the border , they could play a more constructive role in the Caucasus than the Russians have ever done .
But both Turkey and the three Caucasus countries will need encouragement .
That could start with a firm EU decision to back the Nabucco gas pipeline .
It would also help if the Caucasus countries were less nationalist and better at working together .
Paradoxically , Georgia 's war with Russia may enhance the chances of peaceful progress in the whole region .

Scientists at the University of Sheffield have shown how bacteria could be used as a future fuel .
The research , published in the journal Bioinformatics , could have significant implications for the environment and the way we produce sustainable fuels in the future .
Like all living creatures , bacteria sustain themselves through their metabolism , a huge sequence of chemical reactions that transform nutrients into energy and waste .
Using mathematical computer models , the Sheffield team have mapped the metabolism of a type of bacteria called Nostoc .
Nostoc fixes nitrogen and , in doing so , releases hydrogen that can then potentially be used as fuel .
Fixing nitrogen is an energy intensive process and it was n't entirely clear exactly how the bacterium produces the energy it needs in order to perform .
Now the new computer system has been used to map out how this happens .
Until now , scientists have had difficulties identifying bacteria metabolic pathways .
The bacterial metabolism is a huge network of chemical reactions , and even the most sophisticated techniques can only measure a small fraction of its activity .
Dr Guido Sanguinetti , from the University 's Department of Computer Science , who led the study , said : " The research uncovered a previously unknown link between the energy machinery of the Nostoc bacterium and its core nitrogen metabolism .
Further investigation of this pathway might lead to understanding and improvement of the hydrogen production mechanism of these bacteria .
It will certainly be some time before a pool of bacteria powers your car , but this research is yet another small step towards sustainable fuels . "
He added : " The next step for us will be further investigation into hydrogen production , as well as constructing more mathematical models capable of integrating various sources of biological data . "
The Sheffield research is the result of an interdisciplinary collaboration of computer scientists and chemical engineers in a new discipline called Synthetic Biology .
A major goal of Synthetic Biology is to understand which pathways of the bacterial metabolism are responsible for important functions , and then genetically engineer organisms that can perform the desired function more effectively .
The research , which was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) and the Biomodular EU - FP6 project NEST , has been published in the journal Bioinformatics .
Karl Rove 's op - ed on polls this morning in the WSJ reminds me of something I 've been meaning to write for a few days .
I often get emails asking why I 'm not posting this poll favorable to Obama or that poll that shows McCain closing .
Thanks to Drudge 's cherry - picking , these are increasingly coming from Republicans who are looking for a glimmer of hope in what is shaping up to be a tough year .
First off , I 'm not very interested in national polls at this point .
Yes , they can be broadly instructive to show trends .
And , indeed , some have shown McCain moving up in recent days .
But the presidency is n't decided by a national vote .
So it 's state polls that are most relevant , and especially in those battleground states that will decide the race .
In these places , I look to and tend to post those surveys from papers and pollsters that have a track record of work in states year after year , in downballot races and the presidential campaign .
Examples include , but are not limited to , the Iowa poll , the UNH Survey Center in New Hampshire , Franklin & Marshall in Pennsylvania , the Washington Post and Mason Dixon in Virginia , the St. Louis Post - Dispatch in Missouri .
As Rove notes , there are a lot of outlets now polling both nationwide and in key states .
I put the most stock in state polls from reliable outfits .
One last note : McCain 's campaign is pointing to public polls and their own internal surveys to make the case that this race is fluid and that the trend lines are moving their way .
I asked McCain 's chief pollster Bill McInturff to share data about what their state polls were showing , knowing that they 're in the field every night and often have fresher numbers than the public outfits .
He declined , saying that was too specific .

This map shows areas on the globe where there are disturbances in the Earth 's magnetic field .
Here , red indicates a stronger magnetic tug , and blue a weaker one ( white lines are the edges of tectonic plates ) .
As you can see , disturbances are fairly regularly distributed , but that does n't stop UFO enthusiasts from saying aliens have a hand in these magnetic fluctuations .
Science , however , has a slightly different explanation for why certain objects ( including submarines ) create a shift in the magnetic field .
According to the Geological Survey of Finland , which created the map out of years of survey research :
This map is the first global compilation of the wealth of magnetic anomaly information derived from more than 50 years of aeromagnetic surveys over land areas , research vessel magnetometer traverses at sea , and observations from earth - orbiting satellites , supplemented by anomaly values derived from oceanic crustal ages .
The objective is to provide an interpretive dimension to surface observations of the Earth 's composition and geologic structure .
Metamorphism , petrology , and redox state all have important effects on the magnetism of crustal materials .
The magnetic anomalies represented on this map originate primarily in igneous and metamorphic rocks , in the Earth 's crust and possibly , uppermost mantle .
Magnetic anomalies represent an estimate of the short - wavelenght ( < 2600 km ) fields associated with these parts of the Earth , after estimates of fields from other sources have been subtracted from the measured field magnitude .
In most places the magnetic anomaly field is less than 1 per cent of the total magnetic field .

Dems : Selfish Lieberman the " Barry Bonds " of D.C .
Sure , Democrats are furious with Joe Lieberman 's decision to salute John McCain from the podium of the Republican National Convention -- but his tie - breaking role in the Senate means they can't exact revenge anytime soon .
" If you 've been in Washington too long like he has the world gets turned upside down -- your opinions become firm but your principles become flexible , " said Illinois Rep.
Rahm Emanuel , the architect of the 2006 Democratic takeback of the House , speaking of Lieberman .
Endorsing McCain was one thing , Emanuel said , but accepting a hero 's welcome in the belly of the GOP beast is " something different . "
" Hey , I 'm all for having friendships regardless of party labels , but I 'm also for my principles , " he added .
" And Joe has fundamental differences with McCain on the environment , a woman 's right to choose ...
What you can't do anymore is just roll your eyes and say , ' Oh , that 's just Joe . '
Lieberman knows what he 's doing and there are consequences . "
Jim Manley , spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , said Lieberman " can speak to whatever group he wants but that does n't change the fact that John McCain is a flawed candidate . "
In private , members of the Democratic caucus talk openly , and with relish , about making Lieberman pay -- but his Senate colleagues have been far more reluctant to cry for his scalp in public .
Democrats on the outside stopped just short of slapping the traitor tag on Lieberman , who was forced to run as an independent after being bested in the 2006 Democratic primary by anti-war candidate Ned Lamont .
" Ned Lamont was right , " quipped Howard Wolfson , Hillary Clinton 's former communications director and top strategist .
" Joe will be very happy in the Republican party where the dominant ethic is selfishness -- he 's just like Barry Bonds when it comes to selfishness , " said former Bill Clinton adviser Paul Begala .
" If you 're hanging off the edge of a cliff by a rope , you do n't want to look up and see Joe Lieberman ...
I 'm sure he 'll be just as loyal to the Republicans as he was to us . "
Yet despite widespread disdain for Lieberman as a turncoat -- Senate Democrats have been reluctant to strip Lieberman of his position as chairman of the homeland security committee or even say anything too nasty about him in public .
The Obama campaign declined comment .
James Carville , Begala 's compadre on the 1992 Clinton campaign , say 's he not " shocked or angry " -- and is more upset at Lieberman for his oversight of the Hurricane Katrina cleanup first as ranking member of the committee , then as its head .
" I just wish he had been as passionate about FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers as he is about John McCain , " said the Lousiana native , speaking from New Orleans .
" Hopefully he 'll tell the convention wat a great job he did on overseeing [ former FEMA cheif ] Michael Brown . "
Still , Carville ruefully admitted there was nothing Democrats could do to punish Lieberman without huge wins in November that render Lieberman less relevant .
" They are being smart , they can't touch him yet , It 's just arithmetic , buy a calculator , " he added .
A source close to Reid said the leader has told his advisers , " We 'll take another look at things after the election . "

At first glance , several provisions in a newly reissued Defense Department Instruction seem to offer a surprisingly forthcoming public disclosure policy to curb the steadily increasing secrecy of recent years .
But on closer inspection , that is probably not the case .
“ Declassification of information shall receive equal attention with classification so that information remains classified only as long as required by national security considerations , ” according to DoD Instruction 5200.01 , entitled “ DoD Information Security Program and Protection of Sensitive Compartmented Information ” ( pdf ) , October 9 , 2008 .
This DoD requirement that declassification and classification should receive “ equal attention ” does not appear anywhere in the President ’sexecutive order on classification or in its implementing directive which allow agencies to prioritize declassification as they see fit .
Similarly , the new DoD Instruction dictates that “ The volume of classified national security information and CUI [ controlled unclassified information ] , in whatever format or media , shall be reduced to the minimum necessary to meet operational requirements . ”
No such policy on reducing the volume of secret information to the minimum is specified in the executive order or in the President ’s May 2008 policy on controlled unclassified information .
On second glance , however , it turns out that both of these requirements have been on the books at the Pentagon for over a decade ( except for the reference to the new CUI category ) in the previous version of DoD Directive 5200.01 , even as secrecy has grown by leaps and bounds .
In other words , these provisions have proved to be mere rhetorical gestures that do not actually constrain official secrecy policy .
In an effort to combine two of my favorite things , Halloween and real estate , I give you The Spookiest Homes in the U.S. !
First up , the house at 112 Ocean Ave , Amityville , NY .
Okay , we all know the story behind this one .
You know , the house from the novel and movies ?
The facade of the structure and the street number have been changed since the Lutz family ran for their lives after their long 28 day occupation .
The Grant - Humphreys Manson at 770 Pennsylvania Street , Denver , CO was built by James Grant , Colorado ’s 3rd governor .
It ’s said to house no less than 5 ghosts .
A major cause of all this spooky activity is the blame of a city worker who unearthed nearby graves–mixing up the ‘ parts ’ and breaking them up to fit into convenient - sized smaller boxes -- to make way for what is now Cheesman Park .
The Reed House of Asheville , NC was built in 1892 by Samuel Reed , a lawyer for George Vanderbuilt .
Reed ’s life was one of sadness as 5 of his children died young .
Six months after his wife passed away , Mr. Reed joined her .
In 1973 the home was sold and turned into a B & B known as the Biltmore Village Inn .
Guests claim to hear the sounds of heavy , booted footsteps and ghostly games of pool .
The Hale House is located in Coventry , Connecticut .
It was built in the mid-1700 's by Nathanial Hale ’s father .
A friend of a subsequent owner , George Seymour , claims to have come face to face with the apparition of none other than Deacon Hale himself .
Several of Deacon
Hale ’s offspring are also said to haunt the home as are several servants .
The home has been since turned into a museum and is open seasonally to tours .
Strawberry Hill , now a museum and cultural center , is located in Kansas City , KS .
This 40 bedroom behemoth was an orphanage in the early 1900's .
It is spirited by the Lady in Red and a cranky fellow who does n’t like people coming to the third floor , which he considers ‘ his ’ .
The Stranahan House was built in 1901 by the Frank Stranahan , the ‘ father of Fort Lauderdale ’ .
Noted as the oldest house in the city , anchors RiverWalk .
Mr. Stranahan killed himself during the Great Depression .
Ghost hunters have experienced cold spots and unexplained voices .
One claims to have smelled cigar smoke .
Ghost tours are offered every October .
Franklin Castle in Cleveland , OH is said to be the state ’s most haunted house .
Why ?
A pile of babies skeletons was discovered under a back room , victims of a quack doctor , according to forgottenohio.com .
To top it off , a group of Nazi ’s was gunned down on the property in a political dispute .
It ’s no wonder babies can be heard crying in the midst of German Socialists ’ voices .
Madrona Manor at 1001 Westside Road in Healdsburg , CA is now a B & B. Guestroom 101 is haunted by a woman in black .
The woman ?
Probably Hannah Paxtron , wife of John Paxtron who built the house in 1880 .
Upon John ’s death , Hannah had him placed in a lead - lined glass coffin , which she kept in the house until her own death .
Their son Charles killed himself at the residence after his wife ran off with another man .
The Winchester Mystery House in San Jose was the child of Sarah Winchester , wife of William , of Winchester Repeating Arms Co. Even without ghosts this place would be creepy .
The 160 room house has 40 bedrooms , 40 staircases ( many of which lead to nowhere ) , 47 fireplaces and 1 , 257 windows ( one built into the floor ) .
Why all this oddity and excess ?
One story says that a medium once told Sarah if she stopped construction , she would die .
Another says that her excessive building was a way to atone for all those lives lost by Winchester rifles .
And finally , what some people think is Spook Central , U.S.A. , the Whaley House .
Located in San Diego , the Whaley House is haunted by Yankee Jim Robinson , a thief who was ‘ hanged on a gallows off the back of a wagon ’ upon the site which the house now stands .
Even though he witnessed the hanging , Thomas Whaley bought the land anyway and started building .
Soon after construction was completed , Mr. Whaley could hear the footsteps of a heavy man .
Later , visitors claimed to see visions of Thomas himself and his wife Anna , a girl who , according to legend , ‘ accidentally broke her neck on a low - hanging clothesline ’ in the yard as well as spectral animals , including a spotted dog that looked like a fox terrier .
When they lived there , the Whaley ’s had a fox terrier .
Her name was Dolly Varden .

A New Politics of the Public Good
Harvard professor Michael J. Sandel is a world - renowned political philosopher .
This summer he was asked by the BBC to give four lectures on the prospect of a new politics of the common good .
In this electrifying presentation ( he 's that good ) at George Washington University Prof .
Sandel makes the case for a moral and civic renewal in democratic politics .
Here 's his lecture : A New Politics of the Public Good :
http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b00lb6bt
If you do n't have time for a full lecture , this lecture is broken up into 5 minute nuggets :
Prof .
Sandel 's latest book , Justice : What 's the Right Thing to Do ? is available this September 17th .
This is the most racist I ’ve seen McCain supporters act to date .
Talking about “ putting a monkey in the White House . ”
Talking about wearing turbans .
About Obama being a communist .
People , this is what the Republican party has been turned into .
Does anyone , Republican or Democrat , really want to be associated with these people ?
Judging by the growing number of senior Republican leaders , and now even top McCain supporters , abandoning McCain and endorsing Obama , the answer is apparently no .
Just watch these people .
What a sad spectacle .
What an embarrassment .

All species are special , including humans .
As average Americans , we all have an amazing story that starts long before this country was founded .
My ancestors came to America in the 1700's and 1800's .
They worked , farmed , settled and helped moved the country 's quest for manifest destiny forward , ending up mostly in Oregon & California .
Going back further , it 's believed that one family branch is descended from Magnus Maximus , a Roman Ruler , who also ruled England in 381 – 383 AD .
But a couple thousand years is nothing , compared to the history of our species .
There has been a continual thread of life from each of us , back to a time when life first arose on Earth , around 3.5 billion years ago .
Life has been passed from generation to generation all these years without interruption , for you to exist .
The amount of suffering and cruelty must have been enormous during these evolutionary years , from single celled organisms to the eventual rise of mammals , but somehow life persisted .
I 'd like to discuss more in - depth the stages we have taken through the billions of years , but will suffice it to say that the cruelest of all creatures to ever evolve , is man .
No other species seem capable of the mass extermination of both their own species , and their fellow species .
This slaughter is unheard of in the animal kingdom .
It is a sad abomination .
If my family tree history is correct , or even if it is n't , my ancestors have done some pretty cruel things in the past several thousand years .
Magnus slaughtered who knows how many .
I do n't know if my U.S. ancestors fought the Native Americans , but they took their land regardless .
I 'm glad my family was on the West Coast and did n't get involved in slavery .
But my point is that these abominations have always persisted , and the present is certainly no exception .
It is the responsibility of every individual to work towards abolishing these cruel abominations , which are perhaps a carry - over from our evolutionary necessity to be mean “ Sons Of Bitches ” , throughout history , in order to survive .
Now more than ever , the pen is indeed mightier than the sword … and much more moralistic .
We , as a species , need to rise above our instincts and herd mentality , and use our advanced intellect to make positive changes in our society .
The first step is for people to open their eyes and see what is really going on in the world , and our country .
Remove the rose colored glasses .
Step away from the mainstream media and think about right and wrong .
Think independently and rationally .
One of the problems with today 's society is that everyone does only his / her specific job .
The division of labor is now so great , that all people need to think about is their specific niche .
Everyone takes responsibility for only their job , without realizing that they are perhaps one link in a chain that connect them to an abomination of some kind .
I 'm not suggesting everyone should be unemployed , I just think that we all have a responsibility to look at the end result of our actions , or the action of our efforts , with a moralistic approach .
With the recent economic situation , we are working more and are too busy running our personal lives , to have time to think about the entire picture .
Complacency of the citizens , however , is not an option for a successful democracy .
It is our job to keep our elected officials shaking in their boots , if they do n't act in a way that suits the general public .
We have the voting power , however , who 's shaking in their boots ?
The American public is , because they think there minds are so feeble , that only the politicians can know what 's best for the citizens and the world .
We 've probably all heard about the Roman Emporer who suggested that all slaves wear white armbands , “ No ” said a wise Senator , “ then they will see how many of them there are ” .
By not paying attention to the issues and not voting , complacent citizens are buying into this “ ruling elite knows best ” mentality .
By becoming a sheep , and allowing yourself to be herded , you are disrespecting billions of years of past life forms ( your ancestors ) , who struggled for survival and a better world .
We are all perhaps more special than we know .
Hopefully , we can intellectually come together and work towards voting for life , liberty and justice for all .
During the DNC , I had the opportunity to sit in on a climate messaging discussion with several VIPs from various environmental organizations .
During the discussion , there was a great deal of hand wringing over what was and was not possible , what was going to happen on oil drilling legislation once Congress was back in session , and so on .
But the thing I remember the most was what Leslie Robinson of Rifle , CO said :
“ You ’ve got 15 seconds to get a potential voter over to your side . ”
What do you say to that undecided voter in 15 seconds that is simple enough that you know they ’ll get it , but that is also powerful enough to at least get them to do a double - take and ask you to explain what you mean ?
After all , everyone understands “ Drill , baby !
Drill ! ” .
So how do you counter that simple message with an equally powerful and yet simple message ?
The announcement of launch of the Green Jobs Now campaign this week is an excellent start , and one that was mentioned during the DNC discussion .
With concerns about job security , outsourcing , and energy in the forefront of voters ’ minds , this seems like a great approach .
But there ’s one flaw – what the hell is a “ green job ” ?
Because so many people do n’t understand what a green job is , you wo n’t get as many double - take moments as you ’ll need to oppose “ drill here , drill now , pay less ” et al .
So while it ’s certainly better than nothing , and the list of partnered organizations impressive , it ’s not going to be enough to counter an oil drilling partisan .
To counter folks like that , you need something more direct .
Something that , instead of totally changing the conversation from gas prices to jobs ( a very useful thing to do , I must admit ) , knocks the entire drilling argument on its head .
Next time you hear someone say that drilling more will drop oil prices , here ’s your response :
“ That ’s a lie . ”
( Use this one if you ’re faced with an oil exec or someone who otherwise knows better )
- or-
“ Big oil is lying to you about that . ”
( Use this one if you ’re trying to convince a fellow citizen they ’re wrong )
Telling someone that they ’ve been lied to , or that they ’re lying , is n’t polite .
That ’s OK – what big oil has done – lied – on the drilling is n’t polite either , and the longer you let the people around you spew or parrot lies , the longer it ’ll take to shut down the stupid “ drill drill drill ” meme that ’s going around .
The only thing you have to do is make sure that you ’ve got your facts straight once you ’ve got their attention .
If they say that they can get the oil to market fast , tell them that the Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) say ’s they ’re wrong and that it ’ll take 10 years at a minimum to get outer continental shelf ( OCS ) oil to market .
And if they quibble , point out that the EIA is officially non-partisan but still part of the Bush Administration .
Do n’t forget to point out that a ) there ’s not enough deep sea drilling rigs to punch more holes in the OCS for something like 5 years , b ) you ca n’t just build more deep see drilling rigs because every single shipbuilder capable of building new rigs is already booked solid and it takes 2 - 4 years from order to deliver of a new rig anyway .
So no “ two years from lifting the OCS ban to new oil production ” for them … .
If they say that oil shale will save us since there ’s trillions of barrels of oil , tell them that a RAND Corporation study says that the savings from making shale - based oil available is only 3 - 5 % and that it ’ll be 2020 at the earliest before any oil could be available from shale projects ( and 2028 before 1 million barrels per day would be exceeded – 2038 for 3 million barrels / day ) .
And ask them where all the water needed for refining shale kerogen into useful oil products will come from – the water rights of local farmers and ranchers , or the downstream water rights of places like California , New Mexico , Nevada , and Arizona .
If they say that drilling in ANWR can get oil to market fast because the pipeline is already there , point out that the pipeline has a little extra capacity , but not enough to make a dent in the lower 48 ’s oil demand .
And this does n’t even factor into account the fact that the EIA says that 25 % of all proven U.S. crude oil reserves are non-producing ( not being pumped and / or drilled ) .
If the reserves are proven , then why are n’t oil companies already pumping out of them , hmmmm ?
Oh , and let ’s not forget that every existing on - shore drilling rig is already busy punching holes in the ground , it takes 1 - 2 years to build new ones , and all the new rigs being built are already spoken for for at least the next 3 years .
And finally , the EIA estimates that even at full capacity , opening ANWR will drop the price for oil by about $ 1.27 per barrel , which at today ’s closing price on the NYMEX , ~$ 104 / barrel , would be about 1.2 %
Or you can print out this great graph from Architecture 2030 that I found via SolveClimate.com :
Sure , it only applies to the outer continental shelf , but the basic trend line is similar for oil shale , only worse .
Perception is reality in politics , and Big Oil has repeated these lies enough that people are starting to perceive them as true even though they are n’t .
That ca n’t be allowed to continue .
And I can think of no better way to stop it than to call the lies what they are – lies .
Big Oil is lying to you .
“ Drill here , drill now , pay less ” is a lie .
“ Drill , baby , drill ” is a lie .
“ All of the above ” is a lie .
And anyone telling you otherwise is either lying to you or does n’t know that they ’ve been lied to .
Practice that until you can say it in less than 15 seconds .
And then go out and say it every time you hear someone else repeat the lie .
Campbell Brown received a lot of attention with her " Free Sarah Palin " rant , and on - air sparring with Tucker Bounds .
So is Brown , the straight - laced , NBC News veteran , adapting to cable news punditry by upping the commentary ( and volume ) on " Election Center ? "
From the NY Times :
The challenge Ms. Brown faces in her newfound outspokenness , though , is in distinguishing it from the loud advocacy of Mr. Olbermann ( who often argues from the left in “ special comments ” ) and Bill O’Reilly ( who is typically more comfortable leaning right in his opening “ talking points ” ) .
CNN , after all , has sought to build a brand for its journalism by positioning itself as objective , which would seem hard to reconcile with Ms. Brown ’s increasingly expressing opinions of her own .
In an interview in her CNN office , wearing jeans , her laceless Converse All - Stars tucked beneath a desk as seemingly cluttered as the cable landscape , Ms. Brown went to some pains to try to separate her approach from that of her cable competitors .
“ They ’re partisans , ” she said of Mr. O’Reilly and Mr. Olbermann in particular .
“ You ’re not going to see me ever be partisan .
I ’ll never take a position on a candidate or an issue . ”

During the last Presidential debate , John McCain delivered this line about his opponent with withering contempt :
[ Obama ] voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects , including , by the way , $ 3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago , Illinois .

I 'm already tired of hearing these guys talk , but that caught my ear .
A $ 3 million projector ?
What does that even look like ?
Gearlog did some digging and found out that the appropriation was requested by the planetarium to replace an awesome ( but obsolete ) 40 - year old Zeiss Mark VI star projector with a newer model ( pictured above ) .
Anyone with a planetarium in town will remember the Mark VI from school field trips : the 2.5 ton , 1350 watt giant ( pictured below ) can project a dynamic image of thousands of stars and constellations onto the ceiling of a massive dome for the viewing pleasure of a reclined audience .
Its replacement would have been much more impressive , had it been granted : the Universarium Model IX , which is a $ 3.5 million astronomical projection unit capable of accurately representing a night sky in full color and motion .
The proposal never got anywhere for a variety of reasons , but politics aside , that 's not exactly your school 's transparency projector .
You can check out the spec sheet at Zeiss 's official site .

NEW YORK — Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , meeting with several dozen American peace activists here Wednesday night , said that Iran was not seeking a nuclear bomb and asserted that the Bush administration was not in a position to launch military strikes to stop Iran from carrying out its nuclear activities .
" I really believe the American government is not able to start another war for the next decades to come .
This is good news for the entire world , " he declared .
He was referring to the financial crisis that may trigger a historically expensive public bailout to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars .
He very likely also had in mind the long U.S. military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan — a theme he has struck on other occasions .
Ahmadinejad 's New York visit to speak before the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly and to conduct a media blitz has become an annual ritual .
His appearance here usually draws angry protests , denunciations for his alleged support for terrorism and the destruction of Israel , and tough questioning .
But this meeting was decidedly different , with a friendly tone that seemed to please the Iranian leader .
" It is definitely a very unique meeting as a whole , " he said .
The gathering was sponsored by the Fellowship of Reconciliation , America 's oldest interfaith peace group .
The few news media representatives permitted to attend were not allowed to ask Ahmadinejad questions .
Ahmadinejad said of Iranians , " We are opposed to war , " adding , " the Iranian nation loves the American people . "
As for Americans , he said , " I 'm certain that the American people are opposed to war . "
He said he would try to encourage nongovernmental exchanges between Iranians and Americans as well as the granting of more visas to American peace activists .
" On the Iranian side , I will prepare the conditions for more talks and exchanges , " he said .
He asked U.S. officials to do the same for Iranians .
He did not , however , directly address a question pointing out that some Iranians involved with exchanges have been accused of attempting to overthrow their government .
Some have been arrested and others harassed , according to news reports .
Despite a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency last week that charged Iran was stalling on answering key questions on its nuclear drive , Ahmadinejad argued that " the IAEA and others know all our activities are peaceful . "
He added , " We do n't believe in the Bomb . "
And despite U.S. and allied findings to the contrary , the Iranian president contended that Iran had helped improve matters .
" We 've really helped security in Iraq .
Iraq 's security is our security , " he said .
Ahmadinejad 's remarks seemed to impress the activists who gathered .
" He made it absolutely clear where the threat comes from — it comes from the United States , " said Sara Flounders , coordinator of the Stop War on Iran Campaign .
" He 's always distorted in the media as hateful .
You can see he 's not . "

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times , director David Zucker said distributor Vivendi Entertainment did not screen " An American Carol " in advance for reviews because ' those ( who ) do n't like the politics will tend to label the film as ' not funny . '
" The implication , of course , is that movie critics are a pitchfork - and - torch mob of raging leftist liberals who will tear down anything that opposes their personal ideologies .
But I can't imagine anyone - Democrat or Republican , liberal or conservative , red - state or blue - state , earthling or E.T. - finding " An American Carol " anything other than " not funny . "
And idiotic .
And demeaning .
And aggressively , persistently crummy .
Bad enough to earn a rare spot on my hallowed list of " The Worst Movies I 've Ever Seen , " " An American Carol " is testament that the country 's culture wars are raging just as strongly within Hollywood as anywhere else .
That is the only way to explain the presence of so many famous actors ( including Kelsey Grammer , Jon Voight , James Woods and Dennis Hopper ) in a movie that I suspect even they will never watch in its entirety . [...]
" An American Carol , " too , is so hell bent on getting its message across that it becomes a turn - off .
Belligerence is rarely funny , and when Zucker dares to exploit the smoking World Trade Center ruins as an argument for silencing those who choose to protest war , " An American Carol " crosses the line into stupefying offensiveness .
There was a very famous episode of " Seinfeld " in which a co-worker insulted George Costanza , who was unable to formulate a comeback in time .
After giving it significant thought , he eventually came up with an ill - conceived retort to use on his tormenter at the earliest available opportunity : " The jerk store called .
They want you back . "
The new comedy An American Carol is the cinematic equivalent of George 's " jerk store " insult .
Directed and co-written by David Zucker ( of Naked Gun and Scary Movie fame ) , the film is openly intended to be a dig at liberals , aimed at conservative audiences who feel that modern movies too infrequently reflect their own political views .
However , the humor here is so mild and so ineffectual that it has no bite whatsoever .
Forget politics :
An American Carol sucks simply because it 's ridiculously , painfully unfunny .
[...]
Other times , the satire is just hard to grasp .
At one point , Patton defends the need to occasionally take up arms by showing Malone what the world would be like had Abraham Lincoln not freed the slaves .
Turns out that Malone would have been the biggest plantation owner in the country , with Gary Coleman working as his personal car washer .
Excuse me but , Huh ?
Yeah , is n't that hilarious ?
And if you were wondering how Zucker managed to use 9/11 , take a look at this .
( Potentially triggering )
Where Zucker goes almost unforgivably off the tracks is when the ghost of George Washington ( Jon Voight ) takes Michael to the church he used to worship at in Manhattan -- St. Paul 's Chapel , which also happens to be next to the World Trade Center .
Washington opens the chapel doors and shows Michael the wreckage of Sept. 11 , 2001 , driving home the point that America is in dire straits and must fight against the enemy .
Using images of an annihilated , still dusty Ground Zero in a comedy would be one thing if the intention were to be as taboo and offensive as possible -- if the filmmaker KNEW he was crossing the line and was doing it on purpose , in other words .
But Zucker does n't seem to have that attitude .
He seems to think it 's OK because , underneath the comedy , he has such a Serious Point to make .
He 's dead wrong , though , and this scene is uncomfortable ( not in the funny way ) and appalling ( not in the intentional way ) .
Surely this gross misappropriation of 9/11 is as self - serving and inexcusable as any of the " anti-American " behavior he accuses Michael Moore of .
A sequence on a college campus is perhaps the most astute .
A student " demonstration " is defined as " when students show what they do n't know by repeating it loudly , " and then there 's a musical number in which the professors harmonize on how they 're the same America - hatin ' liberal hippies they were in 1968 , and how useless universities are now ( " You 'll get extra credit if you 're poor , black , or gay ! " they sing ) .
Now , while I 'm saying that my disdain for the picture has nothing to do with politics , we have to delve into them for a second so that I may explain why the attempt to skewer the liberal worldview does n't work .
Political satire absolutely requires some element of truth in order to be effective .
Without at least a kernel of honesty , all you 're left with is propaganda .
Perhaps the biggest mistake An American Carol makes - other than not being funny - is that it tries to root its attacks in concepts that are fundamentally bogus .
For example , it takes the position that only conservatives care about our troops serving in Iraq , which is just blatantly not true .
Being against the war is not the same as apathy toward the men and women serving overseas .
There is also a repeated suggestion that anyone who does n't think America is perfect is nothing less than a traitor .
To suggest that this great nation can't be improved upon is not patriotism , it 's blindness .
Because so many of the " jokes " are based on these inaccurate ideas , they consistently fall flat .
doomed
There are two faces of this film : the film ’s entertainment value and also its obvious conservative agenda .
Airplane !
director David Zucker both writes and directs this film , something he has n’t done in a while , and while it may be his passion for the subject , it ’s easily more entertaining than either Scary Movie 3 or 4 .
Scary Movie
No shit .
And just in case if you were wondering if this film only lampoons Moore and the " liberal elite : " Let it be said , here and now : Conservatives and the Right Wing are simply .
Not. Funny .
They are incapable of humor , and their attempts fail miserably .
It 's very simple : humor , cruelty and hatred just do n't go hand - in - hand .
As one reviewer put it I would also add that when all of your humor is based on " Ha , Ha , He 's fat !
Watch fatty eat ! " and slapping a liberal in the face , you are fucking
Of course , this is n't stopping conservatives from blaming that goddamned liberal Hollywood for this dismal failure , or even , Jebus help us , teenage movie theater ticket - takers Frankly , I can't imagine a worse statement than this one ( ironically found in a semi- positive review ) :
The boiled egg I ate for breakfast was more entertaining than either3 or 4 .
Epic fail .
Some 1.5 million people a year receive calls that are not welcome A device which claims to alleviate the problem of cold calling has been launched by two British inventors .
The TrueCall device acts as a buffer between the phone and the outside world and learns to distinguish between welcome and unwelcome callers .
It is estimated that the British public receive 1.5 billion silent calls and 1.5 million malicious calls each year .
According to a recent Ipsos MORI survey , 70 % of UK phone owners say they have been victim of a phone scam .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Both rely on getting through to speak to a person , which gave inventors and ex-telemarketers Steve Smith and John Price the idea for a blocking device .
" TrueCall is designed to give people control of their landlines , " said Mr Price .
" You can bolt the door and close the curtains but your landline is the weak link in your privacy , " he said .
The system basically intercepts all calls .
If it recognises them as a friend or a member of the user 's family - numbers on the so - called star list created by the user - it lets them through as normal .
If the caller 's number is on a zap list - numbers of telemarketers or other nuisance callers - the device answers it , and all future calls from that number , with an automated message which means the phone does not ring at all .
If the system does n't recognise the caller 's number , or the caller withholds their number , it asks them who they are , puts them on hold and then rings the user 's phone .
The user has the option of taking the call , having the system take a message , or they can reject the call and add the number to the " zap " list .
Users can add callers to their " star " list by pressing the star button on their phone at any point during a call .
In future , there are plans for the device to be able to download a list of blacklisted numbers from a central database , which can be dialled into via a modem inside the box .
This will transmit information about each call that was made , if this is requested by the user .
But there are " legal issues " that need to be resolved before this " telephonic neighbourhood watch " can be put into action , said a spokesman for the company .
Malicious calls COMBATTING NUISANCE CALLS
Phone companies have teams that can advise on nuisance or malicious calls
They may put a trace on your line if you receive a large number
You may also be offered call rejection , but it could reject legitimate calls , for example from overseas Registering with the Telephone Preference Service makes it illegal for companies to call you for marketing purposes
It takes 28 days for the TPS calling ban to take effect David Hickson is a veteran campaigner on the issue of silent calls and , was , partly , the inspiration for the system .
" The device is a great idea for people who are bothered by a lot of nuisance calls and want to have a virtual receptionist in their home to manage their calls , " he said .
But he does n't think it alone will solve the problem .
" There is a lot more that Ofcom can do .
It has powers but it could use these much more effectively , " he said .
Ofcom is tackling the problem and recently fined Barclaycard £ 50,000 for silent calling thousands of people .
It fined Abbey National earlier in the year and said that other investigations were ongoing or pending .
But , said Mr Hickson , more needs to be done to make sure the technology behind silent calling is used more responsibly .
Robo-calls Some 60 % of UK households are signed up to the Telephone Preference Service , set up to reduce the number of nuisance calls received .
But telemarketers are finding new ways of getting around the service with so - called robo-calls which use automated system to deliver millions of pre-recorded messages .
Most silent calls are caused by such systems and it is estimated that the public receive 1.5 billion silent calls per year .
" We welcome anything the industry does on its own initiative to reduce the problem of silent , abandoned or malicious calls , " said a spokeswoman for Ofcom .
The TrueCall device is available from the maker 's website for £ 99.99 .

American financier kills his family and himself after losing fortune in credit crunch
Tragedy : A coroner 's assistant brings out a body
A businessman gunned down five members of his family then shot himself after seeing his family 's fortune wiped out by the stock market collapse .
Karthik Rajaram , 45 , who had made almost £ 900,000 on the London stock market , shot his wife , three children and mother - in - law in the head before turning the gun on himself at the family home near Los Angeles .
He was found with the gun still in his hand .
In a suicide note to police , he blamed the killings on financial hardship brought on by a collapse in shares .
Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Michael Moore said : ' The source of it appears to be a financial state , a crisis that this man became embroiled in that has unfolded over the past weeks .
' We believe he has become despondent recently over financial dealings and the financial situation of his household and that this is a direct result of that .
' This is a perfect American family behind me that has absolutely been destroyed , ' he added .
' It is critical for us to step up and recognise we are in some pretty troubled times . '
Using a handgun bought on 16 September , Rajaram went from room to room , picking off the family one - by - one .
Police found his mother - in - law , Indra Ramasesham 69 , dead in bed on the first floor .
Upstairs , they found his 19 - year - old son , Krishna , who was studying business economics , murdered in his bed .
Rajaram 's wife Subasri , was found in another room , also apparently shot while sleeping .
In an adjoining room , his 12 - year - old son , Ganesha , was dead on the f loor , and his brother , Arjuna , seven , was killed in bed .
Their father 's body was in the room with the gun in his hand .
All had been shot in the head .
They were murdered some time between Saturday night and yesterday morning .
The alarm was raised when Mrs Rajaram failed to turn up for work at a local chemist .
Mr Rajaram , originally from India , left two suicide notes as well as a will at the home in Sorrento Pointe , a gated community in the Santa Susana Mountains .
Rajaram wrote of two options : committing suicide or killing himself and his entire family .
" He talked himself into the second strategy , " said Mr Moore , " That would be the honourable thing to do . "
Los Angeles investigators walk to a news conference in front of the slain family 's home
A source said Rajaram had acted after seeing ' his finances wiped out by the stock market collapse ' .
In 2001 , Rajaram had received £ 875,000 for an initial £ 12,500 stake in an internet company he co-founded and subsequently floated on the London stock market .
He had previously worked in LA for London - based PricewaterhouseCoopers and spent five years at Sony Pictures .
Police said he had been jobless for several months , but would n’t specify what type of financial problems he was having .
PricewaterhouseCoopers spokesman Steven Silber said Karthik Rajaram last worked for the company in 1999 .
The deaths are thought to have happened on Saturday night at the family home in Sorrento Pointe , a gated community tucked in the foothills of the Santa Susana Mountains in Porter Ranch , about 23 miles northwest of Los Angeles .
The family rented the home , according to the owner , who did not want to be identified .
She said the family is of Indian descent .
' They were a very nice family , ' she said .
' We had no indications anything was wrong . '
Neighbours were stunned at the tragedy .
‘ It 's very quiet here , ’ said Ryan Ransdell , who lives across the street .
‘ That 's what 's so shocking about this .
You 'd think someone would have heard it .
You can hear a car door shut at night . ’
Many people have lost their jobs in recent month in the United States which , like many other countries , is struggling with a growing financial crisis .
A government report last week said American employers cut 159,000 jobs in September , a ninth straight month of falling employment .
The tragedy just came days after a 90 - year - old Ohio woman tried to commit suicide because the home she had lived in for nearly 40 years was being repossessed .
On the evening of September 4th , 2008 — the final day of the RNC — peaceful protesters ( including the Impeach for Peace organizer narrating this video ) were denied access to the free speech zone , harassed , herded onto the Marion Street Bridge , and arrested .
Someone threw bricks through the glass door and a window of the Colorado Democratic Party headquarters in west Denver early this morning .
No one was inside the office at 777 Santa Fe Drive when the incident happened .
Police said they received the first call about the damage at about 2 a.m .
Sherry Jackson , executive director of the Colorado Democratic Party , was the first person to arrive at work this morning and found the front door boarded up .
A Denver police officer who responded to the destruction arranged the boarding , Jackson said .
“ There was no entry — nobody was able to get in , ” she said .
“ We found two bricks on the floor of the office . ”
The projectiles did not have any notes or messages attached to them , she said .
“ We cleaned up the glass , and we did n’t stop working , ” Jackson said .
“ We just kept going . ”
A glass company has assessed the damage , and preparations for permanent repairs are underway , Jackson said .
The office , which has been at the location for more than five years , has , like other nearby businesses , been tagged by graffiti in the past .
It has not had any windows broken or other deliberate damage before , Jackson said .
The property destruction has not yet resulted in an arrest , police said , and a motive in the case is n’t clear .

In ' U.S. sees six disruptive technologies by 2025 , ' Computerworld reports that the National Intelligence Council ( NIC ) is preparing a report about disruptive technologies expected to have a major impact on the world .
The NIC defines as disruptive 'a technology with the potential to cause a noticeable -- even if temporary -- degradation or enhancement in one of the elements of US national power ( geopolitical , military , economic , or social cohesion ) . '
According to a preliminary version of this report , the list of these disruptive technologies should include biogerontechnology , energy storage materials , biofuels and bio - based chemicals or service robotics .
But read more for additional details about biogerontechnology ...
This ' Global Trends 2025 ' report will be delivered to the next U.S. president in December 2008 .
It has been prepared by SRI Consulting Business Intelligence ( SRIC - BI ) for the National Intelligence Council ( NIC ) .
You can see above the process used by SRIC - BI to select these potentially disruptive technologies .
( Credit : SRIC - BI / NIC )
The Computerworld article contains several comments made by Thomas Fingar , deputy director of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence during a speech given this month in Orlando , Florida .
Here is what he says about climate change .
" By 2025 , 'it is not a good time to live in the Southwest because it runs out of water and looks like the Dust Bowl .
It is not a good time to be along the Atlantic Seaboard , particularly in the South because of the projected increase and intensity and severity and frequency of severe weather -- more hurricanes , more serious storms , and so forth , ' Fingar said . "
Now , let 's look at a preliminary version of the ' Global Trends 2025 ' report released online by the NIC in April 2008 under the title " Disruptive Civil Technologies . "
Here are two links to an a text version and a PDF one ( 48 pages , 602 KB ) of this preliminary report .
The illustration above has been extracted from this report .
Of course , this report is very interesting to read -- and some of you will read it in its entirety .
But let 's focus here on this relatively new concept of biogerontechnology ( only 42 references by Google as I 'm writing this post ) .
But what is it ?
" Biogerontechnology offers the means to accomplish control over and improvement in the human condition , and promises improvements in lifespan .
The advancement of the science and technology underlying the biological aging process has the potential to not only extend the average natural lifespan , but also to simultaneously postpone many if not all of the costly and disabling conditions that humans experience in later life , thereby creating a longevity dividend that will be economic , social and medical in nature . "
Why is this a potential disruptive technology ?
Here are some answers from the report .
The disruptive potential comes in the form of new treatment modalities , shifts in the cost , and resulting allocation and use of health care resources .
Nations will be challenged as a result of changing demographic structures , new psychologies , activity patterns of aging yet healthy citizens , and the resulting requirement to formulate new national economic and social policies .
This report -- which is quite long -- gives more details about why biogerontechnology is potentially disruptive .
" Since the start the twentieth century , when the average natural lifespan in the United States was 47 years of age , gains in life expectancy have been impressive thanks to a combination of medical interventions , lifestyle choices , and behavior modifications .
In 2005 , the average human life expectancy in the United States was 78 years , with life expectancy for women approximately five years longer than for men .
The US Census Bureau estimates that life expectancy will increase by another six years by 2050 .
Biogerontechnology , which offers the means to accomplish control over and improvement in the human condition , promises even greater longevity gains .
The advancement of the science and technology underlying the biological aging process has the potential to not only extend the average natural lifespan forecasts but also to simultaneously postpone many if not all of the costly and disabling conditions that humans experience in later life , thereby creating a longevity dividend that will be economic , social and medical in nature .
The disruptive potential will also come in the form of new treatment modalities , and shifts in the cost , allocation and use of health care resources .
Nations will be challenged as a result of the changing demographic structures and new psychologies , behaviors and activity patterns of aging yet healthy citizens and the concomitant need to formulate new national economic and social policies . "
For much more information , please read this very instructive report before the final version is delivered to the next U.S. president .

It weighs less than a bottle of Coke , is smaller than an A5 pad and is so cheap the odd one left on a bus would n't break the bank .
A lightweight laptop , hailed by self - confessed techno - geek Stephen Fry as the future of computing , has found an unexpected market : schools .
The computers , inspired by attempts to design a cheap laptop for the developing world , are being plugged into school networks , then given to pupils to take home in their satchels to do their homework .
Ministers have backed a pilot scheme in which the laptops are sold to year groups in eight schools ; 1,600 pupils are taking part , with parents contributing to the cost of the computers , and discounts for children who receive free school meals .
RM , the company supplying the Minibook computer to schools , sold out its first order of 6,000 within weeks , and is now projecting school sales of 30,000 by the end of the year .
They are attracting the attention of IT teachers , and with them a multimillion - pound market in school computing so far dominated by Microsoft , the Goliath to RM's David .
" The kids like them just because they are small .
There 's a cute factor , " said Noel Potter , IT technician at St Mary 's primary school in Grangetown , Middlesbrough .
The school brought in 25 Minibooks when its ICT suite was lost to a fire last autumn , and has decided to stick with them .
" They are small and portable , but robust .
They feel solid and not like a toy .
They are certainly a laptop .
We thought about getting them Palm Pilots but they are too different and would n't help the kids learn to use other PCs .
They 've even got some games - but educational games , basic maths and literacy . "
Hardware is VAT - free to schools , which get each Minibook at the knockdown price of £ 169 .
Some are signing multi- purchase deals , paying them off at £ 1.60 a week per laptop .
Secondary schools typically spend £ 90,000 a year on ICT .
For the price of a computer suite , whole year groups could be given their own laptop .
They can handle internet , simple word files and email but their memory is too small at 4GB for children to load them up with computer games .
Crucially , they slip inside a schoolbag and are less likely to make a child the target of muggers on the way home from school .
The government is separately seeking deals with companies to make internet access available in every child 's home and has met Microsoft , BT , Sky , Virgin and RM to discuss proposals .
A home internet access taskforce is due to report this spring .
Last year the government spent £ 801 m on IT equipment for schools .
Microsoft has the lion 's share of the market , but the Minibooks circumvent this iron grip by using Linux open source software instead of Microsoft Windows Vista .
However , the David and Goliath battle with Microsoft will end in a few months ' time when RM produces a new Minibook with its software .
" The product is an exciting new format .
It 's clearly ultra-portable , low - cost and it will soon be available in Microsoft software , " said Steve Beswick , head of education at Microsoft .
" There 's significant demand out there .
They want the device but with Windows on it . "
Although quite pleased with my last experiment getting a web interface working I wanted to make it more powerful .
I decided the best way to go to avoid complexity was to parse input from the user so you could enter a date or a date range in any format you wanted , and the program would hopefully understand what you meant .
To do this I started to learn how to basic language parsers work , and it seemed quite simple , so I gave it a go .
It turned out to be a good challenge .
I think I now finally ‘ get ’ Lisp macros now as well thanks to the guys in #lisp .
It ’s working pretty well .
You can give it stuff like “ next week ” or “ last month ” or “ 16th September 2008 to today ” or “ 12 03 2009 ” etc .

One thing I ’m especially proud of is the way you make rules , you give the macro some regexp , a “ name ” symbol and some code to run and it returns to you a function which can then be called on a string to return any tokens found .
It ’s nifty and lets you use pretty much the full power of the language inside each rule .
Later on , I will be able to add rules so that it can handle stuff like “ A week ago last Thursday ” thanks to this power .
I ’m now trying to figure out what makes it run so slowly ( it takes a few seconds to come back with tokens on a reasonably fast computer ) .
I think it ’s to do with how I check for clashing tokens and remove them , but I ’m not sure exactly what the cause is .
I have tried to use SBCL ’s profiling tools , but I have yet to make much sense of the output .
If anyone has any feedback on the code , or how I can make it run faster I ’d appreciate it .
Edit :
Thanks to the guys in #lisp ( especially H4ns and rsynott ) I have now fixed the speed issue .
CL - PPCRE works by creating a ‘ scanner ’ function for each regexp which works really fast , but this takes a little time to create .
The idea being you create all the scanners at compile - time and then use them at run-time .
The problem was with the way my rule creating macro worked it did n’t do this properly .
Now the make - rule macro returns the code to create the scanner and then return the function using this scanner , and the problem is solved .
A massive speed increase with one extra line of code , not bad going !

Would n't it be great if , instead of ' Mozilla Firefox ' , the browser window used random names such as ' Firebadger ' , ' Spacebeagle ' or ' Hypnotoad ' ?
Er , no , which is probably why developers Cosmic Cat have n't bothered to update Firesomething for Firefox 3 .

Though it may be a bit outside of our norm to discuss politics on Angry Web , the bottom line is that we are a month away from voting in a new president into office .
This will not only affect the country but will affect the world .
Though I am not personally excited about either candidate , the bottom line is that either Obama or McCain will be elected .
With the final debate tonight , McCain seems to be feeling the pressure of defeat .
This letter was sent to me in the mail in which McCain is asking for emergency contributions from his supporters .
It displays a sense of urgency on his part showing that if drastic measures are n’t taken , this election will go to the Democrats .

UC San Diego computer scientists have built a software program that can perform key duplication without having the key .
Instead , the computer scientists only need a photograph of the key .
" We built our key duplication software system to show people that their keys are not inherently secret , " said Stefan Savage , the computer science professor from UC San Diego 's Jacobs School of Engineering who led the student - run project .
" Perhaps this was once a reasonable assumption , but advances in digital imaging and optics have made it easy to duplicate someone 's keys from a distance without them even noticing . "
Professor Savage presents this work on October 30 at ACM 's Conference on Communications and Computer Security ( CCS ) 2008 , one of the premier academic computer security conferences .
The bumps and valleys on your house or office keys represent a numeric code that completely describes how to open your particular lock .
If a key does n't encode this precise " bitting code , " then it wo n't open your door .
In one demonstration of the new software system , the computer scientists took pictures of common residential house keys with a cell phone camera , fed the image into their software which then produced the information needed to create identical copies .
In another example , they used a five inch telephoto lens to capture images from the roof of a campus building and duplicate keys sitting on a café table more than 200 feet away .
Kai Wang , a UC San Diego computer science graduate student and an author on the key duplication paper , points to the roof where researchers photographed keys that at his table .
The computer scientists subsequently decoded the keys using the new software program .

" This idea should come as little surprise to locksmiths or lock vendors , " said Savage .
" There are experts who have been able to copy keys by hand from high - resolution photographs for some time .
However , we argue that the threat has turned a corner — cheap image sensors have made digital cameras pervasive and basic computer vision techniques can automatically extract a key 's information without requiring any expertise . "
Professor Savage notes , however , that the idea that one 's keys are sensitive visual information is not widely appreciated in the general public .
" If you go onto a photo - sharing site such as Flickr , you will find many photos of people 's keys that can be used to easily make duplicates .
While people generally blur out the numbers on their credit cards and driver 's licenses before putting those photos on - line , they do n't realize that they should take the same precautions with their keys " said Savage .
As for what to do about the key duplication threat , Savage says that companies are actively developing and marketing new locking systems that encode electromagnetic secrets as well as a physical code .
" Many car keys , for example , have RFID immobilizer chips that prevent duplicated keys from turning the car on . " he says .
In the meantime , he suggests that you treat your keys like you treat your credit card , " Keep it in your pocket unless you need to use it . "

How it works
The keys used in the most common residential locks in the United States have a series of 5 or 6 cuts , spaced out at regular intervals .
The computer scientists created a program in MatLab that can process photos of keys from nearly any angle and measure the depth of each cut .
String together the depth of each cut and you have a key 's bitting code , which together with basic information on the brand and type of key you have , is what you need to make a duplicate key .
The chief challenge for the software system , called " Sneakey , " is to adjust for a wide range of different angles and distances between the camera and the key being captured .
To do so , the researchers relied on a classic computer vision technique for normalizing an object 's orientation and size in three dimensions by matching control points from a reference image to equivalent points in the target image .
" The program is simple .
You have to click on the photo to tell it where the top of the key is , and a few other control points .
From here , it normalizes the key 's size and position .
Since each pixel then corresponds to a set distance , it can accurately guess the height of each of the key cuts , " explained Benjamin Laxton , the first author on the paper who recently earned his Master 's degree in computer science from UC San Diego .
The researchers have not released their code to the public , but they acknowledge that it would not be terribly difficult for someone with basic knowledge of MatLab and computer vision techniques to build a similar system .
" Technology trends in computer vision are at a point where we need to consider new risks for physical security systems , " said Kai Wang , a UC San Diego computer science graduate student and author on the new paper .
Wang is a computer vision researcher working on the creating systems capable of reading text on product packaging .
This is part of a larger project on creating a computerized personal shopping assistant for the visually impaired from the lab of computer science professor Serge Belongie .
As a computer security expert , Savage said he particularly enjoyed working on a project with computer vision students .
" UC San Diego is very supportive of interdisciplinary work .
There are many opportunities for students and faculty to get their hands dirty in fields they may not know much about a lot at first , " said Savage .

Watch Oprah Winfrey as she interviews and showcases several New Age luminaries ; but when a Christian woman in the audience asks Oprah , “ What about Jesus ? , ” Oprah insists Jesus “ ca n't possibly be the only way ” to God ...
And the sparks fly !
Modern NEW AGE is a revival of the ancient pagan Babylonian religion of polytheism ( worship of many gods ) .
The Bible prophecies that the coming Antichrist will worship “ the God of forces ” ( Daniel 11:38 ) .
Please note that the book of Daniel was written by Daniel himself while in Babylonian captivity .
It was during the Jew 's 70 - years of captivity in Babylon that the prophecy of the coming Antichrist was given to us by God , the divine Author of the Bible .
When I was in Alaska last month , several people told me they were afraid to speak about Sarah Palin on the record , lest they invite retaliation from the governor 's office or , God forbid , from the next vice - president .
At the time , I did n't take such worries too seriously .
As abominable a candidate as Palin is , it was hard for me to imagine vice - presidential staffers trying ruin the lives of private Wasilla citizens just because they had displeased her .
But reading the official report of the investigation into the Palin abuse - of - power scandal known as Troopergate , it seems that perhaps her critics were being more prudent than paranoid .
As scandals go , Troopergate is absurdly picayune .
According to the report , released Friday by the bipartisan legislative council that authorised the investigation , Palin and her husband tried to use their political power to have her sister 's ex-husband , state trooper Michael Wooten , fired from his job and investigated for workers compensation fraud .
They also pressed authorities to prosecute him for a moose shooting that was unlawful because of a technicality ( the permit had been issued to his then - wife , who was with him at the time , rather than to Wooten , who pulled the trigger ) .
The governor then fired Walt Monegan , the public safety commissioner , because he refused to get rid of Wooten , something he could not legally have done .
This stuff is so ridiculously small it seems silly to even be writing about it , especially at time of multiplying global emergencies .
Yet given that there is still a chance - albeit a diminishing one - that Palin could soon be in a position of national political power , it 's worth looking at how she has exercised power in the past .
As a window into how Palin might rule , Troopergate 's very pettiness is what makes it so troubling .
We 're used to politicians who do favours for campaign contributors , who are too cozy with lobbyists and who resort to underhanded tactics against political foes .
What we are not used to are politicians who use their offices to intervene in family quarrels and punish their relatives ' personal enemies .
For the last eight years , we 've suffered under an administration that sees no difference between politics and governing .
Palin is something arguably worse , a person who sees no difference between her private life and her public duties .
Even Dick Cheney , after all , has n't used his office to torment disfavoured former in - laws .
Though Palin claims the report has exonerated her , that 's an outright lie .
It is true that it concluded that she was within her rights to fire Monegan , since the governor is allowed to replace department heads without cause .
But it also found that Palin " abused her power " by violating the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act , which holds that any " effort to benefit a personal or financial interest through official action " is a violation of the public trust .
More interesting than the report 's conclusion , though , are its pitiful little details .
There are endless haranguing phone calls to people throughout the bureaucracy demanding action against Wooten , even after the Palins are warned that their actions could get them in legal trouble .
There are scenes of Todd Palin , who apparently spent a great deal of time working in no official capacity out of his wife 's office , presenting Monegan with dirt on Wooten unearthed by a private investigator .
We see Todd trying to bust his ex-brother - in- law for dropping his kids off at school and then at church in a patrol car ( both times , it turns out Wooten had permission to use the vehicle for personal business ) .
We learn that the judge presiding over Wooten 's divorce from Palin 's sister weighed the Palin family 's vendetta against him in splitting up their assets , ruling that Wooten is likely to earn less in the future because his ex-wife 's family " have decided to take off with the guy 's livelihood " .
This is not , of course , the only case in which Palin has behaved like Gossip Girl 's Blair Waldorf , mobilising her minions against those who 've fallen from her good graces .
One of the people enlisted against Wooten was Palin 's legislative director John Bitney , a friend of hers since junior high school .
Bitney later angered Palin by having an affair with Debbie Richter , who at the time was separated from Todd Palin 's best friend .
He was summarily fired .
( Debbie Richter has since become Debbie Bitney ) .
All this is , of course , pretty trivial stuff .
But how terrifying to think of a vice - president - or a president - wielding the power of her office to settle such personal grudges .
The Bush administration has famously been described as the reign of the Mayberry Machiavellis .
Palin promises something tawdrier still .
Again , bad prime - time soap operas offer the best analogy .
Could America survive the rule of the Mayberry Carringtons ?

Democratic Presidential Nominee Sen. Barack Obama ( IL ) participates in the second presidential debate , moderated by journalist Tom Brokaw , at Belmont University in Nashville , Tennessee , on October 7 , 2008 .

WAUKESHA , Wis. , Oct. 10 ( UPI ) -- Supporters in Wisconsin urged John McCain to get tougher on Democratic rival Barack Obama , but McCain chided a woman for calling Obama an " Arab . "
During a joint town hall meeting , Republican presidential nominee McCain and running mate Sarah Palin heard supporters vent frustration about the financial crisis and concerns that Obama is not being scrutinized for his congressional record and associations with questionable people , The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Friday .

" I am begging you , sir .
I am begging you .
Take it to him ! " radio host James Harris told McCain during a Waukesha event .
Another supporter called the Illinois senator , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , and other Democrats " hooligans , " adding he " I 'm really mad . "
Criticizing Obama 's record and his 1990s association with 1960s anti-war radical William Ayers , McCain and Palin used their joint appearances in Waukesha and Mosinee to charge that Obama is a risky choice .
McCain called Obama 's voting record on abortion " radical far left , " and termed his record on crime issues " very , very weak . "
However , at a subsequent rally , a woman told McCain : " I do n't trust Obama .
I have read about him and he's an Arab . "
Some in the crowd booed when McCain told the woman Obama is " a decent family man " and a " citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues . "
Then there was some applause when McCain said , " That 's what this campaign is all about . "
A statement from the Obama campaign said McCain would " rather launch angry , personal attacks " than discuss the economy or his plan that calls for the treasury secretary to buy bad mortgages and renegotiate them at new - home values that would be more affordable .
ONE morning early last month , long after that frantic hour between 7 and 8 when most New York City parents were hustling their 4- , 5 - and 6 - year - olds out the door and into their first day of kindergarten , Benny Rendell , the 5 - year - old son of Joanne Rendell , a novelist , and Brad Lewis , a New York University professor , lay sprawled asleep in his bed , enjoying what his mother described as his first day of unkindergarten .
Benny stayed asleep , as is his habit , until well past 11 a.m. , while his mother , whose first book , “ The Professors ’ Wives ’ Club , ” was just published by NAL Accent , worked on her new novel .
When Benny awoke , he and his mother slowly made their way to a friend ’s house in Brooklyn , with Benny reading the subway stops out loud on the way , and counting out change at a vegetable stand .
They spent the afternoon in a Fort Greene backyard ; while Benny played with his pals in the mud , the grown - ups looked on , and shared a cold one .
Ms. Rendell , 34 , and Mr. Lewis , 51 , are no slouches in the academic department  with two Ph.D. ’s and an M.D. between them , the two fell in love at an academic conference and Mr. Lewis is now a faculty in residence in one of N.Y.U. ’s only residential colleges .
Nonetheless , they have made the semi-radical ( for New York , anyway ) and anti-academic choice to keep Benny out of the school system , for now .
They are part of a community of like - minded parents who are opting to enrich rather than formally educate their not - yet - school - age children ( 6 is the age that New York City law requires parents to register their children as home - schooled ) .
They discovered one another through the New York City Home Educators Alliance ( nychea.org ) , a home - schooling bulletin board .
Man Creates Homemade Biodiesel from Algae
October 16th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Plenty of companies are working on creating biodiesel from algae , but this is the first I ’ve heard of an individual making homemade algae - based biodiesel .
Australian Charlie Trafford has been making biodiesel from cooking oil for many years , but he recently decided to switch over to a more sustainable source — algae .
So Charlie , a friend , and a biochemist set out to grow algae comprised of 10 to 40 percent oil .
Eventually , the crew actually succeeded in building a unit that can produce a few liters oil a day .
In the process , they supposedly created a technique to grow and harvest enough algae to make it commercially viable for biodiesel .
Now the retirees are looking for financial assistance to develop their technology .
Of course , they ’ll have plenty of competition from existing companies .
But whatever the outcome of their commercial aspirations , Trafford and co. deserve kudos for their do - it - yourself success .

NextEra Energy Inc. recently made a takeover approach to Duke Energy Corp. , according to people familiar with the matter , testing the waters for what would be a $ 60 billion - plus combination of two Southern utilities .
Los Angeles police officers are far more likely to stop , search and arrest minorities than they are whites -- even after statistics were adjusted for high - and low - crime areas -- according to a nongovernmental report released Monday .
The report by Yale Law School professor Ian Ayres for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California found that once stopped , African Americans were 29 % more likely to be arrested than whites .
Latinos were 32 % more likely to be arrested in an identical category .
The percentages were far higher when minorities were stopped on the street or ordered out of their vehicles ( blacks 166 % and Latinos 132 % more often than whites ) , frisked ( blacks 127 % and Latinos 43 % more often than whites ) or subject to nonconsensual searches ( blacks 81 % and Latinos 77 % more often than whites ) .
At the same time , the report found that LAPD officers were less likely to find weapons or drugs on blacks or Latinos than whites when they frisked them or subjected them to consensual searches .

Police Chief William J. Bratton said he strongly disagreed with the report ’s findings .
Among other criticisms , Bratton said the study was flawed because it used data collected four years ago and did not reflect the department ’s current practices .
Tim Sands , president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League , also took issue with the report , calling it a misguided attempt to read the minds of all officers during traffic stops .
“ Dr. Ayres ’ conclusions completely misread situations that are not nearly as black and white as he would want them to be , ” Sands said .
“ It ’s an exercise that might work on a spreadsheet at Yale but does n’t work on the streets of Los Angeles . ”
Union officials noted that the LAPD is a “ majority minority ” department , mirroring the demographic trends of Los Angeles , and that most officers work in pairs that represent more than one race .
Advertisement
They also pointed out that traffic stops often start at a distance , where race “ is unknown to the officers . ”
But the LAPD acknowledged it needed to adjust its policies after it was reported in The Times that the department found that none of the 320 complaints of racial profiling against its officers had merit .
That marked six consecutive years that all allegations of racial profiling against LAPD officers had been dismissed .
The Los Angeles Police Commission voted in August to approve changes to training that would allow officers to be more sensitive to the issue and to more rigorously investigate complaints .
Commissioners also sought to redefine racial profiling to include claims based on race , religion , gender or sexual orientation .
Advertisement
In the report , Ayres recommended that the inspector general be given oversight of investigations into racial profiling complaints .
It also urged the LAPD to further overhaul the complaint process , as well as the implementation of an early - warning system to determine if officers were engaging in racial profiling .
The report found that complaints of racial profiling should trigger mandatory analysis of the patterns of the officer , unit or station so that supervisors could determine if extra training was necessary .

Al Qaeda ’s Voter Survey
Created : October 29 , 2008 12:31 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Three of Sen. John McCain 's endorsements , some more desirable than others .

So far , this election cycle has yielded the usual presidential endorsements from the usual special - interest groups .
The League of Conservation Voters ( Sen. Barack Obama ) .
The National Rifle Assn. ( Sen. John McCain ) .
The AFL - CIO ( Obama ) .
The National Right to Life Political Action Committee ( McCain ) .
But the organization that has most affected American politics over the last eight years is one whose endorsement no candidate would ever seek : the Al Qaeda terrorist movement .
To the degree it seeks to play a role in the 2008 election , Al Qaeda ’s candidate appears to be McCain , according to many former intelligence officials and terrorism experts .
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
Last week , a posting on an Al Qaeda - aligned jihadist message board , al - Hesbah , embraced the Republican presidential nominee .
Al Qaeda ’s goals require “ the presence of an impetuous American leader such as McCain , who pledged to continue the war till the last American soldier , ” according to the anonymous post .
“ Then , Al Qaeda will have to support McCain in the coming elections so that he continues the failing march of his predecessor , Bush . ”
The McCain campaign , in a conference call the next day , understandably distanced themselves from the jihadist forum .
After all , Republicans have argued for the past three national elections that electing Democrats would be tantamount to giving Osama bin Laden an invitation to the Lincoln Bedroom .
Perhaps most famously , Sen. Saxby Chambliss ( R - Ga. ) unseated Max Cleland , a triple - amputee Vietnam veteran and a Democrat , by running an ad featuring Cleland ’s face along with those of bin Laden and Saddam Hussein .
Indeed , on the call , Randy Scheunemann , a senior foreign - policy adviser to McCain , linked Obama to the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas .
TWI ’s Matthew DeLong has reported seeing signs near McCain rallies that place images of Obama and bin Laden side by side .
But interviews with intelligence officials and other experts on the international jihadist movement back the assessment of al - Hesbah ’s anonymous extremist .
“ Al Qaeda would like McCain to come to power and see an extension of Bush ’s policies , ” said Rohan Gunaratna , head of Singapore ’s International Center for Political Violence and Terrorism Research , one of the world ’s most respected anti-terrorism institutes .
“ They would prefer a McCain victory , ” agreed Paul Pillar , a former lead analyst at the CIA ’s counterterrorism center and the intelligence community ’s chief Mideast analyst from 2000 to 2005 .
Despite the Republican effort to portray Democrats as the useful idiots of terrorists and themselves as stalwart defenders of freedom , Washington ’s mishandling of the war in Afghanistan and the occupation of Iraq have energized and magnified Al Qaeda , demonstrating the counterproductive aspects of U.S. bellicosity .
Bin Laden himself has straightforwardly described his strategy as one designed to provoke the far - more - powerful United States into a series of bloody , expensive and futile military expeditions .
McCain has mocked Obama ’s rejection of the Bush administration ’s militarism as a disqualification from office .
“ Bin Laden surely would vote for McCain , ” said Jonathan Stevenson , a professor of strategic studies at the U.S. Naval War College .
“ Bush , whose foreign policy McCain pretty much supported , has been a recruiting sergeant for Al Qaeda and its kin . ”
Ironically , bin Laden outlined his strategy in a manner designed to bring it about .
The weekend before the 2004 presidential election , the leader of Al Qaeda released a videotape excoriating Bush and explaining Al Qaeda ’s efforts at “ bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy . ”
Author Ron Suskind reported in “ The One Percent Doctrine ” that the CIA assessed the tape was designed to aid Bush ’s reelection by infuriating American voters .
Pillar recalled that while he did n’t see any classified assessments , bin Laden indeed intended to ensure Bush would get another four years in office .
“ He had a clear preference for Bush , ” Pillar said .
The items atop Al Qaeda ’s metaphorical voter scorecard are “ just the opposite what of what some would think , ” said a retired senior CIA operative who requested anonymity .
First and foremost , he said , Al Qaeda would prefer Washington to continue its war in Iraq , as McCain has promised and Obama has rejected .
While the Sunni Awakening and the U.S. troop surge have dealt serious damage to Al Qaeda ’s affiliate in Iraq , the retired operative said , “ the long term view will be more complicated , ” as the Shiite - led Iraqi government fails to reconcile with disenfranchised Sunnis .
“ It would be in their interests for U.S. troops to leave , but it ’s also not bad for them if they stay , ” the retired operative continued .
“ It ’s the best of both worlds .
The more they view us as occupiers , the better it is for them . ”
A continued U.S. occupation of Iraq has additional benefits for bin Laden , Stevenson said .
“ Primarily , it would bog down the U.S. military and make it easier for Al Qaeda to secure physical space in tribal areas of Pakistan , and prevent [ the U.S. from ] refocusing on Afghanistan , as Obama wants to do , ” he said .
“ Secondly , it would continue to give Al Qaeda a new training ground for aspiring jihadists .
…
From a political point of view , it plants a large U.S. presence in a very important Arab and Muslim country .
It tends to perpetuate and stoke Muslim grievances . ”
Additionally , Al Qaeda would like to see the next U.S. administration adopt a “ hard line on not engaging with the governments of Muslim countries , including Syria and Iran , ” Pillar said .
Obama ’s pledge to negotiate with the Iranians has fueled a consistent McCain attack for weeks , but not to do so “ would aid [ Al Qaeda 's ] message , ” as would “ continued uncompromising , unflinching support for Israeli positions ” in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , Pillar added .
In Afghanistan and Pakistan , “ continued , if not expanded , use of military force in northwest Pakistan ” by the U.S. “ would be welcomed ” by Al Qaeda , Pillar said , highlighting a position that Obama has , under certain conditions , entertained embracing .
But the retired senior CIA operative said “ the one thing that would give [ Al Qaeda ] a problem ” in the region would be for the U.S. to negotiate a separate peace deal with the Taliban , thereby depriving Al Qaeda of critical logistical , tactical and moral support .
Negotiations with the Taliban were recently embraced , however tentatively , by Obama in a recent interview with Time Magazine ’s Joe Klein , and by Gen. David Petraeus , the soon - to - be commander of all U.S. troops in the Middle East and South Asia .
What Al Qaeda would most probably least like to see a new administration do is to reconcile with a suspicious Muslim world .
While McCain has pledged to work with moderate Muslims , Obama has vowed to deliver a major address in an Islamic capitol city during his first year in office .
“ Use of soft power by Obama will weaken support and sympathy for Al Qaeda and its associated groups and self - radicalized homegrown cells , ” Gunaratna wrote in an email from Egypt .
“ Since Iraq , jihadism is moving from the periphery to the centre of the Muslim world !
Although Americans are the most generous people on earth , the U.S. under President Bush has lost tremendous international goodwill .
[ McCain's ] understanding is very similar to Bush . ”
Still , the question remains whether , as in 2004 , bin Laden will attempt to sway the election by releasing a videotape in the race ’s final days .
The many experts interviewed for this piece were unwilling to predict that either bin Laden , his deputy Ayman al - Zawahiri or another Al Qaeda communique would do this .
“ I think the odds are less and less each day , ” Pillar said .
But even if Al Qaeda does release a communique in the next seven days , Stevenson was unsure it would have much impact .
“ I do n’t think foreign policy is the primary election issue this year , whereas it certainly was in 2004 , ” he said .
“ And we have gone another four years without a major attack in the U.S .
“ Even if Al Qaeda sounds threatening and suggests an Obama presidency would make America more vulnerable , ” Stevenson continued , “ it might have a crying - wolf effect to it .
This year , ‘ it ’s the economy , stupid . ’ ”
By now you 've all seen it :
[ W ] hen there was a vacancy at the top of the State Division of Agriculture , [ Palin ] appointed a high school classmate , Franci Havemeister , to the $ 95,000 - a- year directorship .
A former real estate agent , Ms. Havemeister cited her childhood love of cows as a qualification for running the roughly $ 2 million agency .
Her childhood love of cows .
The Wasilla High School yearbook archive now doubles as a veritable directory of state government .
Ms. Palin appointed Mr. Bitney , her former junior high school band - mate , as her legislative director and chose another classmate , Joe Austerman , to manage the economic development office for $ 82,908 a year .
Mr. Austerman had established an Alaska franchise for Mailboxes Etc .
Her former junior high school band - mate .
A franchisee for Mailboxes Etc .
Now , look .
There 's a refreshing lack of concern for establishment gatekeeping here , no doubt .
But it 's not supposed to be a sit com .
Here , again , is another illustration of how incredibly dangerous it could be to install Slick Sarah Palin in the Vice Presidency that Dick Cheney built .
And by the way , just as an aside , if her provincialism causes you to question the " Slick Sarah " moniker , consider this :
In the middle of the primary , a conservative columnist in the state , Paul Jenkins , unearthed e-mail messages showing that Ms. Palin had conducted campaign business from the mayor ’s office .
Ms. Palin handled the crisis with a street fighter ’s guile .
" I told her it looks like she did the same thing that Randy Ruedrich did , " Mr. Jenkins recalled .
" And she said , ‘ Yeah , what I did was wrong . ’ " Mr. Jenkins hung up and decided to forgo writing about it .
His phone rang soon after .
Mr. Jenkins said a reporter from Fairbanks , reading from a Palin news release , demanded to know why he was " smearing " her .
" Now I look at her and think : ‘ Man , you ’re slick , ’ " he said .
I do n't know Paul Jenkins .
I did n't put those words in his mouth .
That 's an on - the - ground , contemporary assessment of Palin .
S - L - I - C- K. A deft backbiter since day one .
She may be ignorant of the finer policy points -- or even bedrock central tenets , such as the Bush Doctrine -- but you do n't have to know policy to deliver an icepick to the temple .
But back to the dangers of marrying Cheneyism to Palinism .
We already know , if only partially , the extent to which Cheney 's extraordinary secretiveness allowed him to put his own partisan operators in place to execute the " administration 's " most daring extralegal experiments .
( That 's a euphemism for " perpetrating impeachable offenses , " in case you were wondering . )
It was Cheney 's intimate knowledge of the levers of power that move official Washington that allowed him to do so mostly unchallenged and under the radar .
As a result , the operatives he installed were able to work in near total secrecy , with Cheney ( so far ) successfully flouting federal law requiring that he provide even the numbers , names or salaries of his staffers .
If there 's anything redeeming at all that can be said about they way Cheney in particular perpetrated this anti-democratic abuse of the federal government , it 's that while his henchmen and hires were almost universally subversive of the Constitution in both their views and their actions , they were at least arguably competent to the governmental roles to which they were ostensibly assigned .
Palin , however , is the Tom DeLay to Cheney 's Newt Gingrich .
Relatively speaking , the guileless thug who inherits a carefully orchestrated , if essentially groundless ( or in the case of Cheney , outright illegal and unconstitutional ) " governmental " construct , but who lacks the patience and finesse to keep investigators and oversight committees at legal arm 's length .
And so we may well expect from a Palin Vice Presidency not only the ill - considered and impatient grasping at the trappings of power ( and the accompanying disregard for the safeguards against corruption represented by power 's official levers and mechanisms ) embodied by DeLay , but also -- still more frighteningly -- the use of Cheney 's secrecy precedents to hide the whole debacle from view .
What really stings about the Times ' article is that it exposes Palin 's cronyism and irresponsibly provincial worldview , not to mention McCain 's own shocking irresponsibility in selecting her .
Imagine the dangers to the country and the Constitution of being able to appoint childhood friends , already perhaps in above their heads just in trying to govern 670,000 person Alaska , to high federal office and to use the legacy of Cheney 's secrecy to conceal it all from the public .

According to a recent
Time magazine , you could :
Give each person in the U.S. $ 2,300
Pay the income tax of every American making less than $ 500,000
Fully fund the Defense , Treasury , Education , State , Veterans Affairs , and Interior Departments – as well as NASA
Buy gasoline for every car in the U.S. for 16 months
Buy every NFL , NBA , and MLB team , build each a new stadium , and then pay the players $ 191 million a year
Or , you could pay off 7 % of the $ 9.8 trillion national debt .
Sure puts that made up number in perspective , no ?
I am so glad that it failed , but I imagine they will just reword it and give the same amount away later this week .

When Gawker published a selection of emails from Sarah Palin 's hacked Yahoo !
account , we got tons of psychotic ( and anti-Semitic ! ) hate mail full of " Do n't drop the soap in prison " jokes ; Bill O'Reilly said we should go to jail forever ; and cesspool blogger Michelle Malkin called Gawker " a cesspool blog . "
But now the real villain in all this being asked to answer for her villainy .
An Alaskan activist — a Republican activist — is taking Sarah Palin to court to find out why she was using personal email accounts to conduct government business in the first place .
In a lawsuit filed in Alaska Superior Court , a Republican activist seeks to force Gov. Sarah Palin to produce copies of official correspondence she sent and received on private e-mail accounts .
Andrée McLeod filed the suit Wednesday and publicized it in a news release today .
" Rather than using her state e-mail account , throughout her two - year tenure as Governor of Alaska , defendant Sarah Palin , as a matter of routine , has used , and , on information and belief , continues to use , ( at least ) two private e-mail accounts ... to conduct official business of the State of Alaska , " the suit alleges .
The suit is the latest front in a battle McLeod is waging over Palin 's e-mail .
In June , she filed an open - records request and received four boxes of redacted e-mails .
But more than 1,100 others were withheld , an action Palin justified by claiming executive privilege .
McLeod appealed that claim last month before going to court last week .
McLeod has questioned whether Palin was using private e-mail accounts to conduct state business in a manner that would skirt open - records laws .
In one notable e-mail , a Palin aide apologized for discussing state business on a public account .
" Whoops ! " Palin aide Frank Bailey wrote , after addressing an e-mail to the governor 's official state address .
" Frank , this is not the Governor 's personal account , " a secretary reminded him .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Prosecutors in Russia want to ban the award - winning satirical U.S. cartoon South Park , calling the series “ extremist ” after receiving viewer complaints , a spokeswoman said Monday .

South Park , a cartoon aimed at adults and featuring a group of nine - year olds in a Colorado ski town , has courted controversy from its 1997 debut , parodying celebrities , politicians , religion , gay marriage and Saddam Hussein .
Basmanny regional prosecutors office spokeswoman Valentina Titova said investigators filed a motion after deciding an episode broadcast on Moscow television station 2x2 in January “ bore signs of extremist activity . ”
“ In accordance with the conclusions made by experts from the court investigations committee , a claim has been filed against 2x2 for its broadcast of an episode of South Park , ” Titova said .
South Park has won two Emmy Awards and was first shown on the U.S. Comedy Central network .
It is dubbed into Russian and rebroadcast on local networks , including 2x2 , a channel which broadcasts animated series in Moscow and St Petersburg .
A representative for 2x2 was not immediately available for comment .
The Russian Union of Christians of Evangelical Faith had asked prosecutors to ban South Park after it said 20 experts had studied the show for its effect on young viewers .
The group ’s leader , Konstantin Bendas , said “ South Park is just one of many cartoons that need to be banned from open broadcast ... as it insults the feelings of religious believers and incites religious and national hatred . ”
“ Our complaint is against a lot of cartoons , but this one was from South Park season three , episode 15 , ” he said .
The episode , called “ Mr. Hankey ’s Christmas Classics ” on the cartoon ’s website www.southparkstudios.com, first aired in December , 1999 , and features the cast singing Christmas carols .
“ It ’s one thing if they are on cable TV and viewers pay money and make a conscious choice .
But young children should not be able to turn on the TV after school and watch this .
They need to be defended , ” Bendas said .
Russia passed a 2006 law widening the definition of extremism to include “ the abasement of national dignity ” and “ inciting religious and national hatred , ” which backers say was needed to stem a wave of violence aimed at ethnic minorities .
Last month ( how time flies ) we were talking about how fun it was to write code for the graphical Processing library using Scala inside the Processing Development Environment .
Well look , it has gotten even more fun !
This browser does not have a Java Plug-in .
Get the latest Java Plug - in here .
Thanks to a tip in the comments , the applet has been reduced to a disturbing 19,992 bytes with Pack200 compression .
This applet weighs in at 56 KB , smaller than a lot of JavaScript libraries and even some big boring old jpegs .
The secret of its slimness is the ProGuard class optimizer which the Scala fork of the Processing environment , Spde , invokes as a final step in exporting an applet .
The code itself is a fairly straight translation of Daniel Shiffman ’s Flocking example for Processing .
( It has been formatted to fit this screen . )

Every click creates a new bird — it ’s a fun little simulation !
Learning Processing
Shiffman recently wrote a book about Processing that seems to be selling rather well — Amazon ca n’t decide if it ’s in stock or out .
Learning Processing begins with a very appealing description of itself :
This book tells a story .
It ’s a story of liberation , of taking the first steps towards understanding the foundations of computing , writing your own code , and creating your own media without the bonds of existing software tools .
This story is not reserved for computer scientists and engineers .
This story is for you .
Yayyy .
That is what this weblog is all about ( and also , hello , why Apple ’s Cocoa Touch DRM has been a disgusting idea from the beginning ) .
The next section goes on to say that the book may not be for you if you ’re already a programmer .
( Too late ! )
It does start off at the very basics of writing software , but that ’s fine because some of us are interested in how people teach and learn that stuff anyway .
There ’s also a funny section that could only have been prompted by annoying undergraduates demanding why they should learn something that they heard was based on the tragically unhip language of Java .
Shiffman delivers a spirited overview of the programming language trendscape , the fact that no language is perfect , that there is no competition for the PDE , and that Processing just plain gets the job done .
Finally :
I would suggest that you stop worrying about what it is you should be using and focus on learning the fundamentals with Processing .
That knowledge will take you above and beyond this book to any language you want to tackle .
Excellent advice for this year ’s class !
But maybe not for 2010’s .
The fundamentals of programming
All of us almost certainly learned our programming skills in a similar order : statements , variables , conditionals , loops , then procedures .
We learned procedural programming and internalized it to the point that now , when solving a software problem , our minds immediately start declaring variables and acting on them in loops .
Sorry guys , but — this is not normal human behavior .
Variable declaration and loops are noise that turns most well - balanced people away from programming .
Once you start programming functionally ( snobbism alert ) , you stop turning problems into variables and loops and start getting really beefed at languages like Java that give you no other choice ( or the functional option is verbose and sticks out like a bauble ) .
Here is a parallel idea in a completely different technology :
The equivalent of branching and cloning in centralized version control systems , when it exists , requires network communication .
… these operations will be slower to some degree , usually to the point where users wo n’t bother using them unless absolutely necessary . …
I experienced these phenomena first - hand .
Git was the first version control system I used , and I grew accustomed to it , taking many features for granted .
I did not know what centralized systems were like , and assumed they were similar .
Later , I was forced to use one …
Just having a feature is not good enough : it has to be convenient .
And also , is n’t it trippy to think about someone learning Git first , then struggling with Subversion or whatever , while the rest of us are struggling up a steep learning curve in the opposite direction ( uphill both ways ) to learn Git ?
Do n’t you wish you had learned Git first ?
So here is the theory : if you teach people functional programming first , not only will they learn a better form of programming , but they ’ll learn it more readily .
Human brains are not composed of registers and logic units .
And even though we are n’t all mathletes , the concept of the function was developed by humans , for humans , long before anybody thought about updating variables in instruction loops that repeat thousands of times — an idea that is almost oppressively mechanical in the abstract .
Functional programming is more humane
From the original Flocking example , a method of the Boid class :
// Separation //
Method checks for nearby boids and steers away Vector3D separate ( ArrayList boids ) { float desiredseparation = 25.0 f ; Vector3D sum = new Vector3D ( 0,0,0 ) ; int count = 0 ; // For every boid in the system , check if it 's too close for ( int i = 0 ; i < boids.size ( ) ; i++) {
Boid other = ( Boid ) boids.get ( i ) ; float d = loc.distance(loc,other.loc ) ; //
If the distance is greater than 0 and less than an arbitrary amount // ( 0 when you are yourself ) if ( (d > 0 ) && ( d < desiredseparation ) ) { //
Calculate vector pointing away from neighbor Vector3D diff = loc.sub( loc,other.loc ) ; diff.normalize ( ) ; diff.div(d ) ; //
Weight by distance sum.add ( diff ) ; count ++ ; //
Keep track of how many } } //
Average -- divide by how many if ( count > 0 ) { sum.div( ( float ) count ) ; } return sum ; }
It ’s no coincidence that the method we use to understand procedural code ( aside from reading the comments and just pretending to understand it ) is to become , temporarily , a very slow and crappy computer .
Step through it and make a table of the value of variables in succeeding statements and iterate — gruellingly — multiple times through any loop until it is clear how the machine will interpret the instructions .
Once you see what ’s going on in this separate function , it ’s possible to translate it into a very opaque , single expression in Scala .
But keeping MacIver ’s recent post in mind , the one with title crafted to trick the logically lazy , let ’s break things into a few smaller blocks :
// is the other bird within a certain distance def within ( dist : Float ) = { other : Boid => val d = loc distance other.loc d > 0 && d < dist } // Sum , and divide by size def avg ( l : List [ Vector ] ) = ( l :\ new Vector ) ( _ + _ ) / ( l.size max 1 )
You can work through those if you know the wacky Scala gang signs .
If not , they ’re fun to learn .
Note that Scala allows our version of Vector ( defined elsewhere ) to use symbols for its arithmetic .
Using these blocks , it ’s easy to write a separate that , honestly , returns the same results as the one above :
// Separation //
Method checks for nearby boids and steers away def separate ( boids : List [ Boid ] ) = avg ( boids.filter ( within( 25.0 ) ) .map { other => ( loc - other.loc ) .normalized / ( loc distance other.loc ) })
Nice ?
But here ’s the kicker .
In Flocking there are two other functions that do similar things .
In the original , quite reasonably , the loop and conditional structures are entirely repeated for each one .
( Check the source if you want to see them . )
Why not factor out some logic ?
Because that ’s a pain and probably would n’t save any lines of code .
Which is n’t meant to be a criticism of the original , at all .
It ’s good procedural code written for easy student digestion .
And let ’s face it : if you work in Java , you know you are always writing loops that do similar things as other loops because it ’s just easier that way .
But what if it were easier to do it the right way ?
// Alignment //
For every nearby boid in the system , calculate the average velocity def align ( boids : List [ Boid ] ) = avg ( boids.filter ( within( 50.0 ) ) .map ( _.vel ) ) max maxforce // Cohesion //
For the average location ( i.e. center ) of all nearby boids , // calculate steering vector towards that location def cohesion ( boids : List [ Boid ] ) = boids.filter ( within( 50.0 ) ) match { case Nil => new Vector case nearby => steer ( avg(nearby.map( _.loc ) ) , false ) }
Gosh , extracting within and avg for the first function sure paid some dividends in the second two !
It ’s times like these when the excitement surrounding functional programming seems muted , if anything .
You might have thought , with graphical programming being all about arrays and loops , that translating some of it into Scala would mean fewer semi-colons and not much else .
But then something awesome like this happens .
If you wanted to learn functional programming , say , in your spare time , there ca n’t be a more fun way to do it than with interactive graphical programming .
So just merge this book and that book ( Git , a little help ? ) and off you go .
And if someone did write a book on functional graphical programming for absolute beginners , how totally sweet would that be for the next generation of programmers ?
Maybe they could even be less exclusively male ?
( Oops , hobbyhorse . )
What the flock
Sorry , this post is n’t going to cover drawing the birds and the program setup business .
You ’ll have to study the full example sources for that , and to play with this Scala version , you ’ll need Spde .
The good news is that with the right software it ’s easy to run .
Um , how large is the intersection of the installed bases of Buildr , Scala , and Git ?
Anyone out there ?
Just type this in :
Or you can just download the application package .
git clone git://technically.us/git/spde
Tic tic tic ( the repository is now fun sized ) .
Then :
cd spde buildr run
And Flocking will be under the Examples menu !
It is not hard to find because there are only three examples .
Fly fly away , birdies .
With Obama crushing McCain in fundraising , with the DCCC and DSCC absolutely destroying their GOP counterparts , the lone fundraising bright spot for Republicans has been the RNC .
Well , now that Obama is helping direct contributions to the national party , that advantage is gone .
From an email press release on the July numbers :
This morning the DNC announced July fundraising numbers .
For the first time since October 2004 , the DNC has outraised the RNC .
The strong fundraising numbers are a testament to Barack Obama 's message of change and hope and his vision for America 's future .
July 2008 Fundraising Raised : $ 27.7 M
COH : $ 28.5 M NOTE : Totals include : DNC , Obama Victory Fund ( DNC / Obama joint fund ) , and Democratic White House Victory Fund ( Joint DNC , Obama and Hillary Fund )
The RNC reported $ 26 million in June , and still leads in cash in the bank , with $ 75 million .
But if the DNC raised this much , expect monster numbers from Obama .
McCain , for his part , raised just $ 27 million with $ 21 million in the bank .
While that haul was a record for McCain , it was barely half what Obama raised in June -- $ 52 million .
His July numbers should be released any day now .
The RNC also announced it had passed 1 million individual donors , while the McCain campaign claims 600,000 .
The Obama campaign has already blown by the 2 million mark .
Update : Obama 's numbers for July are in -- $ 51 million .

Perhaps the most fascinating part of this mind - bendingly historic election cycle is that so many conservative Republicans are standing up to say they have had enough .
They “ are n’t leaving their party , ” to paraphrase Ronald Reagan when he supported Barry Goldwater ’s conservative movement , “ their party is leaving them . ”
Editors Note :
This is the fourth of the four part Culture of Lies series ; read the entire series here .
Perhaps the most fascinating part of this mind - bendingly historic election cycle is that so many conservative Republicans are standing up to say they have had enough .
To paraphrase Ronald Reagan when he supported Barry Goldwater ’s conservative movement , they “ are n’t leaving their party , their party is leaving them . ”
Like Reagan , many of these conservatives are making that decision based on cultural extremism , but as political cycles go in America , this time the extremism is on the far right , not the far left .
It is the left now standing for shared American values of freedom , faith , privacy , justice , equality and liberty , against an extremism that would have government intrusively dictating personal life decisions and legislating morality .
Like the hippies of the late 1960s who , to many Americans , turned from a peace and love curiosity into a radical and violent menace , giving birth to the conservative backlash , the far right has turned from people interested in babies and motherhood into a rigid , intolerant , controlling , manipulative and angry mob .
It appears a new backlash , against far - right extremism , may be born .

Abortion .

But it ’s not only the left saying that .
" The [ Republican ] party has moved even further to the right and Gov. Palin has indicated an even further rightward shift .
I would be concerned about two more conservative appointments to the Supreme Court , but that is what we would be looking at in a McCain - Palin administration , ” said General Colin Powell .
Former Republican Governors Arne Carlson and Bill Weld , and Senator Larry Pressler join many others attempting to chart a new course .
Former New Republic publisher Wick Allison suggested that conservatism is less a political philosophy and more “ a stance , a recognition of the fallibility of man , and man ’s institutions . ”
Allison continued , “ ‘ Every great cause , ’ Eric Hoffer wrote , ‘ begins as a movement , becomes a business , and eventually degenerates into a racket . ’
As a cause , conservatism may be dead .
But as a stance , as a way of making judgments in a complex and difficult world , I believe it is very much alive in the instincts and predispositions of a liberal named Barack Obama . ”
It is fair to say that far - right religious fundamentalism has in fact become a racket , something that should concern every person of faith .
It clearly concerned David Kuo , who worked in the Bush White House on faith - based initiatives .
Kuo suggested the mixture of faith and politics was n’t turning out as he ’d hoped , that people of faith were being used when he left the White House .
Perhaps the best example of the “ racket ” social conservatism has become is the more than $ 1.5 billion dollar boondoggle that is the abstinence - only - until - marriage program .
Far - right profiteers like multi-millionaire Raymond Ruddy now spend tax dollars promoting programs that do n’t work , to buy advertising trying to influence the elections with some of the most egregious , and widely debunked , lies about abortion politics .
I ’m sure Ruddy ’s self - interest in preserving the government grant gravy train for abstinence - only is the furthest thing from his mind .
He ’s just promoting his values , even though many objective fact checkers suggest he is doing so with distortions of fact , if not outright lies .
Christopher Buckley , in endorsing Obama and subsequently losing his job at the National Review , wrote about his father William F. Buckley trying to “ separate conservatism from the kooks . ”
David Brooks is fond of quoting the elder Buckley and recently took on the charges of “ elitism ” now favored by the McCain - Palin ticket saying , “ Buckley famously said he ’d rather be ruled by the first 2,000 names in the Boston phone book than by the Harvard faculty .
But he did n’t think those were the only two options .
He thought it was important to have people on the conservative side who celebrated ideas , who celebrated learning .
And his whole life was based on that , and that was also true for a lot of the other conservatives in the Reagan era .
Reagan had an immense faith in the power of ideas .
But there has been a counter , more populist tradition , which is not only to scorn liberal ideas but to scorn ideas entirely .
And I ’m afraid that Sarah Palin has those prejudices .
I think President Bush has those prejudices . ”
Buckley and Brooks are joined by other conservative columnists Kathleen Parker , Christopher Hitchens , Peggy Noonan , each citing different reasons for their concern about conservatism , but each agreeing the GOP is adrift .
Liberals remember being adrift after Reagan swept into office .
For a generation progressives have been on the defensive on sexual and reproductive health issues , but as more and more Americans see that the tactics and strategies of the far - right create more division than healing , many people are saying it is time to change the debate .
Progressives have long promoted their values in policies like Prevention First , Real Education About Life , and the Unintended Pregnancy Reduction Act — each promoting the very conservative notion of personal responsibility coupled with individual rights and liberty .
We can disagree on issues like abortion , contraception and homosexuality , but we can work together to build a society where everyone is making healthier , more responsible and more respectful decisions for themselves and their partners , based on medical facts .
Many conservatives seem to agree it is time for the Culture War debate to change .
Former Bush speech writer David Frum expresses concern that conservatives must change their stance on the abortion debate before they seem cruel denying access to women who need abortions .
Former Reagan advisor Douglas Kmiec is joined by other pro-life Catholic legal scholars Nicholas Carfardi and Cathleen Kaveny calling for a different approach to the abortion debate , bravely challenging other pro-life conservatives within the Catholic Church .
The pro-choice community should reach out a hand to find common ground , for they are making their
stand in the middle of fierce protest .
Groups like Catholics United and Pro-Life Catholics for Choice join long - time progressive advocates like Catholics for Choice in raising questions based on morality , not running from it .
The list of conservatives saying , in one way or another , that they are uncomfortable with the extremism within their own party grows longer as the days in the campaign grow short .
Far more importantly , millions and millions of independent , moderate and conservative voters are rejecting the far - right ’s extremism .
These conservative “ elites ” cited above are not setting the agenda , but doing what all good writers , thinkers , scholars and leaders do : listening carefully to what they hear in their conservative networks and reflecting it in the marketplace of ideas .
They realize that America is not bound by ethnicity or one religion , but is the only nation founded on an idea , and like so many of us , now see cause for concern within their own party to the core principles that make up the American ideal .
That leaves fewer , but no less vocal , purveyors of the Culture of Lies , the anti-elite “ elites ” like Rush Limbaugh and his legions on talk radio , Sean Hannity and the boys at Faux News , Anne Coulter , Wendy Wright , Hugh Hewitt , the hyper - politicized Catholic Conference of Bishops and other evangelical priests of the far - right like Tony Perkins , Gary Bauer , James Dobson , Richard Land , Rick Warren and , of course , their new heroine Sarah Palin .
John McCain , true to himself , is a man in the middle trying to hold it all together .
The John McCain of 2000 would be among the conservative crowd rejecting the John McCain of 2008 .
While America is a centrist country , we like people who have strong convictions and eventually grow weary of people who lie or manipulate us to gain power .
Perhaps it is best to leave the last word to Mr. Conservative himself .
It was Ronald Reagan ’s mentor , and the Senator who John McCain succeeded , Barry Goldwater , who sounded the alarm as he saw the rise of the far right .
Ray Dubuque at Liberals Like Christ writes :
" I look at these religious television shows , " [ Goldwater ] said , " and they are raising big money on God .
One million , three million , five million – they brag about it .
I do n’t believe in that .
It ’s not a very religious thing to do .
But Goldwater was also deeply worried about the Religious Right ’s long - term impact on his beloved GOP .
" If they succeed in establishing religion as a basic Republican Party tenet , " he told U.S. News & World Report in 1994 , " they could do us in . "
In an interview with The Post that same year , Goldwater observed , " When you say ‘ radical right ’ today , I think of these moneymaking ventures by fellows like Pat Robertson and others who are trying to take the Republican Party and make a religious organization out of it .
If that ever happens , kiss politics goodbye . "
But most importantly , Goldwater was deeply concerned about the Religious Right ’s relentless war on the Constitution and basic American freedoms .
In a Sept. 15 , 1981 senate speech , Goldwater noted that Falwell ’s Moral Majority , anti-abortion groups and other Religious Right outfits were sometimes referred to in the press as the " New Right " and the " New Conservatism . "
Responded Goldwater , " Well , I ’ve spent quite a number of years carrying the flag of the ‘ Old Conservatism . ’
And I can say with conviction that the religious issues of these groups have little or nothing to do with conservative or liberal politics .
The uncompromising position of these groups is a divisive element that could tear apart the very spirit of our representative system , if they gain sufficient strength . "
Insisted Goldwater , " Being a conservative in America traditionally has meant that one holds a deep , abiding respect for the Constitution .
We conservatives believe sincerely in the integrity of the Constitution .
We treasure the freedoms that document protects . . .
" By maintaining the separation of church and state , " he explained , " the United States has avoided the intolerance which has so divided the rest of the world with religious wars . . .
Can any of us refute the wisdom of Madison and the other framers ?
Can anyone look at the carnage in Iran , the bloodshed in Northern Ireland , or the bombs bursting in Lebanon and yet question the dangers of injecting religious issues into the affairs of state ? "
Goldwater concluded with a warning to the American people .
" The religious factions will go on imposing their will on others , " { he said , } " unless the decent people connected to them recognize that religion has no place in public policy .
They must learn to make their views known without trying to make their views the only alternatives . . .
We have succeeded for 205 [ now 232 ] years in keeping the affairs of state separate from the uncompromising idealism of religious groups and we must n’t stop now " { he insisted} .
" To retreat from that separation would violate the principles of conservatism and the values upon which the framers built this democratic republic . "

Obama is the first Gen X Presidential candidate — for better and for worse .
A generation rises with Obama
On his way to Denver , Barack Obama has been trying to mainstream his campaign .
The selection of Sen . Joe Biden as his running mate was intended to be a steadying force as the historic nature of his campaign as a candidate of change remains unsettling for some .
But so much has been said about his status as a candidate of racial change , that his status as a candidate of generational change has been little noticed .
The torch , as JFK might say , is passing to a new generation .
Obama is the first Gen X Presidential candidate — for better and for worse .
Advertisement
He 's the son of a baby boomer — his mother , Anne , was born in 1942 — and although his birth in 1961 puts him slightly ahead of the textbook mid-1960s start date of Gen X , he is the same age as the man who coined the term " Generation X , " author Douglas Coupland .
Like many Gen Xers , Obama is a child of divorce .
His anthropologist mother embodied the restless drift and countercultural curiosity of the baby boomer generation .
His grandparents ' lives were more typical of the " greatest generation " — with struggles through the Great Depression and then the Second World War , followed by a more conventional , even conservative , life .
His mother married a Kenyan ; his grandparents voted for Nixon — Barack tried to bridge the divide .
Reconciling these generational tensions has been the unwelcome responsibility of Gen X .
We have been living in the wake of the Boomers all our lives .
We 've benefited from the civil rights struggles and enjoyed the opening of our culture , from rock music to the sexual revolution .
But we 've also experienced the fallout from their excesses — drug abuse , racial strife , fractured families , homelessness , AIDS , a decaying environment and dangerous inner cities .
Gen Xers have been left to clean up after the Baby Boomers ' party , to put up with the societal growing pains , and try to reconcile the warring factions .
Obama voiced this frustration in " The Audacity of Hope , " writing , " In the back and forth between Clinton and Gingrich , and in the elections of 2000 and 2004 , I sometimes felt as if I were watching the psychodrama of the Baby Boom generation — a tale rooted in old grudges and revenge plots hatched on a handful of college campuses long ago — played out on the national stage . "
His antidote is the rhetorical post - partisanship and professed belief in political pragmatism that are central to his political appeal amongst younger voters .
His style of problem - solving — a cool assessment of the problems associated with predictable positions on both sides , and then an attempt to synthesize new solutions — fits Gen X perfectly .
Jeff Gordinier , author of " X Saves the World : How Generation X Got the Shaft but Can Still Keep Everything from Sucking , " told me .
" Obama 's talk about going beyond the old politics of ' red ' and ' blue ' , liberal and conservative , and building a third way does resonate .
Gen Xers tend to be pretty post - ideological , there is less allegiance to any one party or any one way of thinking .
…
Our political pragmatism comes as a result of growing up in the shadow of the Boomers ' idealism and seeing it fail miserably . "
But there is another aspect of the Generation X experience Obama must overcome :
They are the first American generation to come of age without a draft .
While McCain entered military service as a young man , Obama opted for a combination of higher education and community service .
At the age when McCain was a prisoner of war in the Hanoi Hilton , Obama was at Harvard Law .
To be fair , McCain is a legendary military hero because his experience was uncommon .
Obama 's experience — inevitably cushy by comparison , both liberal and elite — is more common to contemporary Americans .
But biography is at the root of what pollsters clinically call " character attributes , " and this does not help in the commander in chief test .
Obama 's college years were full of generationally recognizable rites of passage — detailed with disarming candor in his first book , " Dreams from My Father " — smoking cigarettes and some pot and drinking beer while listening to ' 70s and ' 80s rock and soul .
There were the confusing cross-currents of yuppie culture and multicultural identity politics — particularly resonant to a biracial student like Obama — and protests against the evils of apartheid while the evils of communism were comparatively ignored on campus .
Before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , the civic demands of John McCain 's pre-Boomer generation experience of personal sacrifice and physical courage were largely limited to debate amongst Gen Xers .
The generational fault lines under this campaign are rumbling right below the surface .
It 's no accident that Hillary Rodham Clinton 's strength in the late Democratic primaries came overwhelmingly from older white Americans who have now begun to shift their allegiance to one of their own , John McCain .
This is not just about race ; it is also a generational judgment — the sense among older voters that Obama is a self - possessed smooth operator who is light on real world experience , and has n't earned the office .
Obama , in turn , runs strongest among his contemporaries — voters under 50 and African - Americans .
The younger the voter , the more likely they are to support Barack Obama .
The so - called enthusiasm gap — and the pop-culture fascination with Obama — parallels other famous first - in - their - generation presidential candidates , Jack Kennedy and Bill Clinton .
The younger Millennial Generation 's reverence for Obama may have fueled the " celebrity " ads , but it 's because he 's made politics ( briefly ) cool again .
With the Jay - Z " Dirt Off Your Shoulder " riff during the primary and pioneering use of YouTube and Facebook , Obama speaks the language of our contemporary culture and he looks like what 's next — the first high - tech , hip - hop president .
After four decades and two administrations dominated by the Baby Boomer echo chamber , it 's understandable that we'd want to turn the page and get a president who has learned from their debates but is not held hostage by them .
The promise of Obama is in transcending outdated labels and bridging old divides , but beneath that promise there is also a dash of democracy 's vanity — we like him because he is like us .
As Gen X humorist Joel Stein wrote in Time magazine , " The truth is that I like Obama because he 's young , he eats arugula , and knows who Ludacris is .
Because he 's the closest thing to the person I 'd really like to vote for : me . "
John P. Avlon is the author of “ Independent Nation : How Centrists Can Change American Politics . ”
He served as chief speechwriter and deputy policy director for Rudy Giuliani 's presidential campaign .
It 's a far cry from the universal admiration that Sarah Palin elicited after her debut at the Republican National Convention this summer , but Thursday night 's performance during the vice presidential debate with Joe Biden allayed many conservatives ' fear that Palin would bomb , and take down the campaign with her .
Republican tech strategist Jon Henke , part of the coveted youth demographic that the presidential candidates are trying to win over , voiced a common sentiment when he opined that Palin did well because " she did n't make any major mistakes . "
Initial polls showed that Biden 's performance appealed to those who have n't committed themselves to either camp .
A CBS poll found that 46 percent thought Biden had performed the best while 21 percent thought Palin did .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll showed that just over half of those surveyed thought Biden had performed the best during the debate , while 36 percent thought Palin did .
Other than that , opinions in the blogosphere about Thursday evening 's vice presidential debate were all over the map .
For his part , Henke spun it this way : " Face it , Biden did well .
He was serious , fluent , he had gravitas .
He did n't pull a Biden .
And yet , Biden reinforced the real problem he represents for the Obama campaign :
Whatever he may be , senator Biden is not ' Change . ' "
Patrick Ruffini , a fellow blogger on the site , was more emphatic .
" Tonight , Sarah Palin was sharp , articulate , and connected with the middle class , " he wrote .
" The # 1 political effect tonight will have is an important one for the McCain campaign : she shut the doubters up , and then some .
In this important sense , she stopped the bleeding . "
But Palin 's folksy performance Thursday night did n't shut the doubters up at all .
In fact , one of Palin 's most prominent doubters , conservative columnist Kathleen Parker of Townhall.com and the National Review , wrote in PostPartisan , a Washington Post blog , that she " experienced the uneasy feeling throughout that I was witnessing a data dump from a very appealing droid .
Even the winks and jaw juts seemed slightly programmed .
And the question remains :
Is she ready to be president should the need arise ? "
Last Friday , Parker made news when she had called for Palin to step aside because she was " out of her league . "
Parker said that Palin 's performances during her interviews with the networks television anchors had revealed that she did n't know much about anything .
The columnist 's most damning line : " If BS were currency , Palin could bail out Wall Street herself . "
Over on the left , MyDD 's Jonathan singer wrote that Palin 's performance on Thursday did n't do much to change anything .
" While it may have staved off the hemorrhaging of support for the
Republicans , it did little to nothing to swing the momentum back away from the Obama - Biden ticket , " he wrote .
And Nate Silver , an Obama supporter , wrote on his blog FiveThirty Eight.com that he thought this was another missed opportunity for the McCain campaign .
He said that he thought Palin 's scripted responses and lack of spontaneity allowed Biden to get in effective shots at John McCain .
In fact , that 's probably the most interesting insight that emerged from the storm of opinion that poured forth on the web Thursday night , both on Twitter and on the blogs :
That despite all the folksy charm , Palin fell short because her debate performance , like her television interviews , was so scripted and unengaging
" Sprphoto " said it on Twitter : " You know what bothered me most about Palin ?
She came off like a badly voiced cartoon character . "
But she did n't make any obvious gaffes .
So Tina
Fey is just going to have to actually do some work next time around when she presents the world with her next Palin impersonation on Saturday Night Live .

Photovoltaic cells , the basic building blocks of solar panels , are more efficient and less costly than ever .
But manipulating cells ( which are usually made of semiconductor materials ) and incorporating them into different panel designs is not necessarily easy .
John A. Rogers of the University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign , and colleagues have come up with a novel method for creating extremely thin solar cells that can be combined in flexible , even partially transparent , arrays .
Described in Nature Materials , it could be called the rubber - stamp approach .

The technique involves creating a series of precisely spaced “ microbars ” on a block of single - crystal silicon .
These bars , which have a thickness of a few micrometers , have doped regions that create p-n junctions , the main feature of most photovoltaic cells .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A federal judge on Thursday rejected a request by Republican U.S. Sen .
Ted Stevens of Alaska to dismiss the charges or declare a mistrial because prosecutors withheld helpful evidence from the defense .
Although U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan allowed the trial to go forward , he said he had lost confidence in the ability of Justice Department prosecutors to fulfill their legal obligation to turn over helpful evidence to the defense .
The judge said he thought there had been a violation of that obligation .
“ I am very disturbed that this happened , ” Sullivan said .
Prosecutors admitted a mistake had been made , but said the oversight was not serious enough to warrant dismissing the case or ordering a new trial .
The judge ’s decision to allow the trial to go forward was a setback for Stevens , 84 , one of the Senate ’s most powerful Republicans who is seeking reelection in November .
He is on trial , accused of filing false financial disclosure forms with the Senate by failing to include more than $ 250,000 in gifts he received .
Stevens , who has been in the Senate for 40 years and is the longest - serving Republican senator in U.S. history , faces a close race in what has long been a safe Republican seat .
His Democratic opponent is Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich .
ADJOURNMENT TO MONDAY
The judge said he would adjourn the trial until Monday to give defense lawyers time to review new information that he ordered the prosecutors to turn over .
The information cited by the defense involved an interview by an FBI agent with Bill Allen , the prosecution ’s star witness .
Allen said he believed Stevens and his wife would have paid for the renovations to their home in Alaska if Allen had sent them a bill .
Prosecutors had notified the defense about the information only late on Wednesday , after Allen had completed his second day of testimony about the renovations performed by his oil services company , VECO Corp .
The disclosure of the mistake was an embarrassment for the Justice Department in a high - profile public corruption case .
Defense lawyers filed an emergency motion to dismiss the indictment or for a mistrial .
“ Enough is enough , ” they said .
“ It is impossible at this point to have a fair trial . ”
The new evidence involved an interview that had been turned over to the defense , but the key part of what Allen said -- that the couple would pay if they had been sent a bill -- had been blacked out .
It marked the second time this week the judge has scolded prosecutors .
He previously rebuked them for sending another witness , the foreman of the renovation project , back to Alaska without notifying Stevens ’ lawyers .
Defense lawyer Robert Cary said it was part of a pattern of conduct by the prosecutors and warranted dismissing the case or a mistrial .
“ Our position is it ’s broken and ca n’t be fixed , your honor . ”
Prosecutor Brenda Morris said the incident was reported to the Justice Department unit that investigates possible lawyer misconduct .
“ We had to step up and take our medicine and that ’s what we have done , ” she said .
Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg said Friday that his party is in position for “ an earthquake election ” come November 4 .
Dems predicting ‘ earthquake ’ election
Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg said Friday that his party is in position for “ an earthquake election ” come Nov. 4 .
“ Nothing is going to look the same , ” Greenberg said , joined by Democratic strategist James Carville at a breakfast with reporters hosted by The Christian Science Monitor .

Carville likened the Washington political environment to pre-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans , saying that “ there will be nothing left standing ” after the election .
He added that Republicans stand to lose “ not just an election but a generation of voters . ”
“ [ John ] McCain and [ Sarah ] Palin are losing the argument , ” Greenberg said , pointing to favorable numbers for Obama on the campaign ’s central issue , the economy .
“ They are losing on their central arguments , ” the pollster said of the Republican ’s focus on tax cuts .
“ They ca n’t see that what they take for granted loses them independents . ”
Greenberg said the GOP has not adjusted to a changed electorate and is running toward a base that no longer has the numbers it once had .
“ Republicans want McCain to keep running to the right , ” he said .
“ This is a new map . ”
Carville agreed , though he suggested that Democrats also have not fully adapted to a changed electorate .
“ I do n’t know if we ’ve seen the full sweep of what is possible , ” he said , listing a number of Republican House seats that are polling competitive despite received little or no money from Democratic committees .
Both said that , despite the tough environment Republicans face in this election , the McCain campaign was running a competitive race until selecting Palin as the Arizona senator ’s running mate .
Greenberg said Palin has “ changed the whole criteria of the race ” by moving the debate from assessing Obama ’s experience to change and reform .
“ Attitudes toward Palin are now more of a factor than McCain , ” he said .
“ The Palin thing was just pretty dumb , ” Carville added .
“ That looked good for , what , 48 hours ?
Seventy - two hours ? ”
The Democratic strategist also mocked the McCain campaign ’s attempts to use Joe the Plumber to rally middle - class voters .
“ The reason the Republicans found Joe the Plumber was to find someone hanging around a toilet other than [ Sen . ]
Larry Craig , ” he said .
( Natural News ) Welcome to the Orewellian world of Newspeak , where words are used to control thoughts .
Yesterday , at the bidding of the White House , mainstream news sources across the world magically replaced the term " bail out " with the much more palatable word " rescue . "
The Washington Post jumped on board ( http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitol-bri... ) , then Reuters , the Associated Press and Bloomberg all fell into step within minutes , magically replacing " bail out " with " rescue " across all their articles .
It 's as if " bail out " never even existed .
This is eerily identical to the world in George Orwell ' snovel , where history is constantly being re-written to conform to the political lies of the present .
There is no such thing as a bail out , we 're now being told .
Nobody is getting bailed out .
We 're all beingHow convenient .
Rescued from what , you might ask ?
Rescued from the really bad investment decisions of greedy , careless bankers .
And HOW are we all being rescued ?
By giving them more money , of course .
But do n't think it 's simply about rescuing them .
No , of course not , you simple fools :
It 's about rescuing YOU !
Yes , that 's right : this is all being done for the good of the People , because everybody knows that sending $ 700 billion to pay off the debts of the wealthy elite is the very best way to uplift the economic status of the working poor .
It makes such perfect sense , I do n't know why we did n't think of it sooner .
I mean , why did we have to wait for a crisis to unleash this brilliant rescue plan ?
Why not simply hand over hundreds of billions of dollars to failing banks and financial institutionsweek ?
If this is so good for the people , we should have been doing this all along , right ?
Of course , it 's very , very important to make sure we all use approved words when describing all this .
Because the very term " bail out " implies that somebody is abandoning responsibility for a mess they 've created .
It 's very important that all Americans understand nobody is abandoning any responsibility .
In fact , the wealthy elite bankers and financial crooksfor this mess , and they 're doing it by forcing the taxpayers to clean it up .
That 's how seriously they take this situation :
They 're so deeply committed to solving the problems they 've created that they 'll even reach right into YOUR wallet to make it happen !
After all , you did n't think rescuing all you people would be free , did you ?
You need rescuing , and there 's a rescue fee required .
It 's sort of like what you might pay to be air - lifted by helicopter after breaking your ankle hiking down the Grand Canyon .
If you want to be rescued , you gotta pay up .
The same thing 's true with the economy .
You want to be rescued ?
You 'll have to pay .
And why , you might ask , should n't the people who created the mess be required to pay ?
Well duh ... it 's because they 're too busy .
Somebody 's gotta be in charge of the rescue , right ?
And who better qualified to solve this financial mess than the very people who caused it ?
Do YOU know how to make a trillion dollars vanish into thin air ?
I doubt it .
But these jokers can make that happen before lunch !
They That 's why it makes such perfect sense to put them in charge of the rescue plan ... So do n't question any of this .
You would n't understand all the brilliant , highly - complex aspects of thispackage anyway .
Just trust your government .
Stop asking questions .
Hand over a blank check and do n't use the phrase " bail out . "
It 's not a bail out , it 's a rescue .
Shut up and pay your taxes .
And read the Washington Post to stay informed .
And do n't buy gold .
You wo n't need it .
This rescue plan is going to be so incredibly successful that we 'll all be rich .
The taxpayers are even going toon this rescue !
Yes , you heard that right :
It 's not even really a rescue , it 's actually just anYes , an investment .
Your government is now your stock broker .
Except you do n't really have a choice in this investment .
It 's mandatory .
But do n't worry , your mandatory " investment " is going to make you money .
Lots of it !
And when all these banking assets turn around and become more valuable in the future , we 'll find some way to return all this money to you , the taxpayers .
Because you know , your government is fiscally responsible .
Pay no attention to our national debt .
Debt does n't matter anymore .
It 's all about the cash flow , and right now , cash is flowing like a tidal wave into the hands of one person ... one person who now controls more than half the entire U.S. economy : Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
But do n't worry .
Paulson is a great guy !
He 'll give you ALL your money back someday , with interest , guaranteed !
So technically , it 's not a bail out , or a rescue or even an investment .
It 's really just a LOAN to Uncle Sam .
Yep , that 's right : Uncle Sam needs your money for the big " rescue . "
But it 's all being done for YOU , of course .
And the more you loan Uncle Sam , the more patriotic you are .
You 're a patriot , are n't you ?
If you 're a patriot , then you 'll join us in supporting the " rescue " plan , which really is n't a rescue , but more like a friendly loan to Uncle Sam .
We just need a bit of cash right now , just to make it through to the next loan from China , and to sell off all these worthless bank assets that we 're buying with your money .
But just as soon as all that 's taken care of , we 'll give you all your money back .
We promise .
In fact , we promise with the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government .
Fox suggests swiftboat author being swiftboated himself David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday August 15 , 2008
Print This Email This Jeromi Corsi , the author of Obama Nation , was welcomed to Fox & Friends on Friday to respond to charges made against him and his book in a 40 - page rebuttal from the Obama Campaign , " Unfit for Publication . "
" Essentially it calls you a liar and a bigot , " suggested Fox 's Steve Doocy .
" I think some juvenile leftists have taken over the Obama campaign and gotten a hold of Photoshop , " Corsi replied .
" Now I 'm getting death threats and hate mail from Obama supporters . "
" You 're getting these death threats because you wrote a book , " Doocy agreed , " and in fact there 's a website , Daily Kos , that 's published your home address . "
RAW STORY has been unable to find Corsi 's home address at Daily Kos -- only his email and the address and phone number of one of his employers -- but it is possible that it was posted and then removed by site moderators .
Corsi is the author of 2004's Unfit for Command , which launched the Swift Boat attacks against Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry .
During the last two weeks , Obama supporters have been moving quickly to discredit Corsi as well as his book before his more outrageous charges can gain general credence .
" A lot of people have suggested , " continued Doocy , " well , the Obama campaign is not going to allow their candidate to get swiftboated once again by this guy .
Do you feel almost as if you yourself are being swiftboated ? "
" In a way , but I also think the Obama campaign is making the identical mistakes of the Kerry campaign , " Corsi replied .
" They started now calling me names and trying to get the New York Times to introduce me as a gadfly .
...
They 're quibbling about details . "

When asked what newspapers and magazines she reads , Sarah Palin replied , " all of them . "
All of them !
And so , a meme is born .
All of them !
All !
All !
All !
Of !
Them !
The Modesto Bee , The Hartford Courant , The Louisville Courier - Journal , The Vassar Pioneer Times , Teen People , Tiger Beat , Paris Match , High Times , Destination Qatar -- ALL OF THEM !
All of them .
We just can't stop repeating that line to ourselves .
All of them !
It 's as nonsensical a response to the question as it would be to " can I interest you in any appetizers , " or " which came first , the chicken or the egg , " or " knock knock . "
All of them !
So , readers , we 'd like to ask you : of all the Sarah Palin interviews so far , which has been your favorite ?
We hope you know the correct answer to that , and all , questions from now on .
He is also alleged to have handed over information detailing new EU levies on cheap Chinese shoes , measures that have not yet been agreed by the Commission .
" The information is potentially worth millions , " the Sunday Times claimed .

After eight years of George Bush , people are looking for an adult in the White House .
John McCain acted like a petulant boy .
The post - debate chatter is less about the substance and more about the style .
These are the images and soundbites that voters remember :
The McCains and the Obamas moved about the stage separately for a little while after their debate , greeting people on the stage , but not each other .
Then John McCain tapped Barack Obama ’s back briefly and Obama turned and reached his hand out .
Rather than shaking it , McCain directed him to his wife , Cindy .
If it was n’t clear on TV , photos showed that the two men did shake hands after Tuesday ’s contest .
But that awkward physical moment highlighted a reality that viewers were reminded of repeatedly Tuesday evening :
There ’s no love lost between these two men .
And it was McCain , slipping in the polls and increasingly on the attack in recent days , who appeared to have far more trouble concealing his apparent distaste for his opponent .
He even began the evening with a dig .
“ Sen . Obama , it ’s good to be with you at a town hall meeting , ” McCain said .
Obama declined to participate in town hall settings with McCain earlier in the race .
And then there was the comment , likely to be much remarked upon , about Obama ’s vote on an energy bill .
“ You know who voted for it ? ” McCain asked , thrusting his finger in Obama ’s direction but not looking at him .
“ That one . ”
But the party is not content to stop there .
Even better than demonizing opponents is the more powerful and direct act of taking the vote away from their opponents ’ supporters .
The Republican Party has made strenuous efforts in recent years to prevent Democrats from voting , and to prevent their votes from being properly counted once they ’ve been cast .
Which brings me to the phony Acorn scandal .
John McCain , who placed his principles in a blind trust once the presidential race heated up , warned the country during the presidential debate last week that Acorn , which has been registering people to vote by the hundreds of thousands , was “ on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history . ”
It turns out that a tiny percentage of these new registrations are bogus , with some of them carrying ludicrous names like Mickey Mouse .
Republicans have tried to turn this into a mighty oak of a scandal , with Mr. McCain thundering at the debate that it “ may be destroying the fabric of democracy . ”
Please .
The Times put the matter in perspective when it said in an editorial that Acorn needs to be more careful with some aspects of its voter - registration process .
It needs to do a better job selecting canvassers , among other things .
Image Bob Herbert
“ But , ” the editorial added , “ for all of the McCain campaign ’s manufactured fury about vote theft ( and similar claims from the Republican Party over the years ) there is virtually no evidence  anywhere in the country , going back many elections  of people showing up at the polls and voting when they are not entitled to . ”
He had called the multi-ethnic Mid-Wilshire neighborhood home for more than a decade .
Sitting outside a shuttered dental office near Berendo and 3rd streets , the homeless man with the Buddha - like frame rarely asked for money .
But he got it anyway .
Regulars at the California Donut shop bought him coffee and doughnuts in the mornings , a couple of Asian men took him for showers and a haircut , and poor Central American and Mexican immigrants would give him spare change or food .
“ His priorities were cigarettes , Dr Pepper , hot Cheetos and , once a week , he would buy C batteries ” for his radio , said Asit Bhowmick , the Bangledeshi owner of the Bengal Liquor store .
The homeless man , whom many in the neighborood knew simply as “ John , ” never bothered anybody , said Jorge Garcia , owner of La Morenita Oaxaquena restaurant .

About 9:30 p.m. Thursday , Garcia said he was at work when a woman ran inside the restaurant , screaming for a fire extinguisher .
He ran outside to find the man lying on his back in a nearby parking lot , his body still ablaze .
The man ’s clothes had been burned off , his face blackened and swollen , the tips of his clenched fingers sloughed off .
The smell of gasoline hung in the air .
“ There ’s no name for what they did to him , ” Garcia said .
Los Angeles police said that someone splashed gasoline on the man and set him on fire .
No arrests have been made , and investigators are still puzzling over a motive for the grisly attack .

“ This is one of the cruelest crimes you can imagine , ” said Deputy Chief Sergio Diaz , who oversees the LAPD ’s Central Bureau .
“ As an officer who has responded to many murders over the years , this is amongst the most horrific . ”
The victim has not been identified .
Capt .
Dennis Cremins said police were looking for at least one man who was seen running from the scene .
He was described as a Latino in his 20s , with short brown hair and a large black T - shirt .
Cremins said police believe the man may have bought gasoline in the neighborhood and used it in the attack .
A red plastic gas container was found at the scene .
One resident , who did not want to be identified out of fear for his safety , said he spoke to someone who reportedly saw the crime .
He said he told him several young men got out of a Honda Civic , doused the man with a flammable liquid and set him on fire .
Police could not confirm this account .

Residents and merchants in the working - class neighborhood knew the man either as “ John ” or “ Grimley . ”
They described him as a white man in his 50s , with a beard and blue eyes .
He may have lived in the neighborhood for as long as 20 years .
Some heard rumors that he had once been a successful businessman .
Danette Kuoch , 29 , said the man was a regular at her mother ’s California Donut shop at the corner of 3rd Street and New Hampshire Avenue .
When he was especially dirty , he would keep his distance -- aware that his smell might be bothersome .
Regulars would buy him coffee and doughnuts .
“ He never asked for money , but people gave him money , ” said Joel Sandoval , 45 , a Guatemalan immigrant and a regular customer .
“ Poor man , may he rest in peace . ”
Kuoch said that two years ago , she saw a group of people stop by to visit the man .
She thought it may have been his family .

“ They visited for a while , then just left , ” she said .
“ They parked in the shopping center , but they did n’t stop at any of the shops .
It was like they specifically came to see him . ”
The man would have been a defenseless target , residents said .
His girth limited his movement .
Dinora Morales , 30 , a baker at the doughnut shop , said she was standing at the corner with her husband and friends when she heard the woman screaming Thursday night .
Her voice cracking , Morales said her husband and others ran in the direction of the homeless man .
But it was too late .
He was foaming at the mouth , and his body was charred .
Garcia , the restaurant owner , said he sprayed the man with a fire extinguisher .
A bystander threw water on him .

On Friday , some of the homeless man ’s belongings remained at the scene , including a bag of food from McDonald ’s , a yellow pear and a gray sweat shirt and shorts .
A charred jacket lay on a white cardboard box nearby .
“ This is one of the jackets that someone used to try to put the flames out , ” Morales said .
An elderly woman sobbed as she walked by .
“ He was Mr. John , ” she cried out in Spanish .
“ I do n’t even speak English , but I would say , ‘ Hi , Mr. John , happy today ? ’ ”
The homeless man would smile and nod , she said .
Advertisement
“ Ah , no !
God take care of him -- Mr. John , ” cried the woman , who out of fear did not want to give her name .
“ He was n’t a bother to anyone .
We used to give him whatever we could , a few coins or a little bit of food . ”
Luis Ortega , who works in the neighborhood , looked along the street full of botanical shops , ethnic restaurants and cigar shops .
He said justice would prevail .
“ Karma is coming , ” Ortega said .
“ Karma is going to come and get whoever did this . ”

Germany 's debt load wo n't reach the level it did in the financial crisis a decade ago as a result of the coronavirus pandemic , the finance minister said Tuesday , and it will still look better than that of Germany 's peers in the Group of Seven did before the virus outbreak .
Olaf Scholz was presenting to parliament a draft 2021 budget that foresees significant borrowing for the second consecutive year as Germany , Europe 's biggest economy , works to limit the economic fallout of efforts to contain COVID - 19 .
“ If we did n't act , we would have to use much more money , and at the same time squander the future of our country , ” Scholz told lawmakers .
A different giant Lego man was fished out of the sea in the Dutch resort of Zandvoort in August .
That model was yellow and blue , and had the words " No real than you are " in English across its torso .
That toy was said to come from England , so perhaps the Dutch decided to return the favour .
Most of my posts related to Scala so far have been quite long and unpolished I have intentionally kept them that way since I wanted to give a feel for what i is really like to make the shift , including the dead ends .
During the work of converting Java to Scala I have stumbled over some things that I found to be extra cool , nuggets .
I ’ll try to post them here from time to time .
The first nugget is about implicits .
Implicits are so cool that I think I will shoot myself in the foot with them many times so let ’s start now .
One piece of java - code that I converted looked for module descriptions on the class - path .
The code looked something like this :
private void loadModules ( ) throws IOException { Enumeration < URL > modules = Thread.currentThread( ) .getContextClassLoader().getResources ( " ap.module " ) ; while ( modules.hasMoreElements ( ) ) { URL element = modules.nextElement ( ) ; ... } }
We ask the class loader to give us all the ap.module files it can find .
The class loader will give back an enumeration of URL:s to the resources .
Ever been in a situation where you wished that an enumerator was an iterator ?
Well , let ’s look at the same code in Scala :
private def loadModules ( ) : Unit = { val modules = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResources ( " ap.module " ) ; modules.foreach(moduleUrl => { ... } }
Nice , but it does n’t compile :
value foreach is not a member of java.util.Enumeration[ java.net .URL ]
Ok , let ’s wrap the enumeration in a Scala Iterable .
First create the wrapper :
class RichEnumeration [ T] ( enumeration : Enumeration [ T ] ) extends Iterator [ T ] { def has Next : Boolean = enumeration.hasMoreElements ( ) def next : T = enumeration.nextElement ( ) }
Observe how I can just assign the methods on the wrapped enumeration to the corresponding ones in my iterable .
Itearable is a Trait so you can add this capability to any class with about the same effort .
Well , let ’s use the RichEnumeration :
private def loadModules ( ) : Unit = { val modules = new RichEnumeration ( Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResources ( " ap.module " ) ) ; modules.foreach(moduleUrl => { ... } }
Ok , that was slick .
Now to the final magic trick :
implicit def enumerationToRichEnumeration [ T] ( enumeration : Enumeration [ T ] ) : RichEnumeration [ T ] = { new RichEnumeration ( enumeration ) } private def loadModules ( ) : Unit = { val modules = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResources ( " ap.module " ) ; modules.foreach(moduleUrl => { ... } }
Wow , since we call foreach on the enumerator , Scala , before failing looks around for any implicit conversions it can make .
Our implicit enumerationToRichEnumeration function converts Enumerations to RichEnumerations and the scala compiler sees that RichEnumerations are Iterables and Iterables have a foreach - method .
So Scala can implicitly use it .
With that piece of code I can treat any enumeration as an Iterable , scala will take care of the conversion for me .

If the notion of dark energy sounds improbable , get ready for an even more outlandish suggestion .
Earth may be trapped in an abnormal bubble of space - time that is particularly void of matter .
Scientists say this condition could account for the apparent acceleration of the universe 's expansion , for which dark energy currently is the leading explanation .
Dark energy is the name given to the hypothetical force that could be drawing all the stuff in the universe outward at an ever - increasing rate .
Current thinking is that 74 % of the universe could be made up of this exotic dark energy , with another 21 % being dark matter , and normal matter comprising the remaining 5 % .
Until now , there has been no good way to choose between dark energy or the void explanation , but a new study outlines a potential test of the bubble scenario .
If we were in an unusually sparse area of the universe , then things could look farther away than they really are and there would be no need to rely on dark energy as an explanation for certain astronomical observations .
" If we lived in a very large under - density , then the space - time itself would n't be accelerating , " said researcher Timothy Clifton of Oxford University in England .
" It would just be that the observations , if interpreted in the usual way , would look like they were . "
Scientists first detected the acceleration by noting that distant supernovae seemed to be moving away from us faster than they should be .
One type of supernova ( called Type Ia ) is a useful distance indicator , because the explosions always have the same intrinsic brightness .
Since light gets dimmer the farther it travels , that means that when the supernovae appear faint to us , they are far away , and when they appear bright , they are closer in .
But if we happened to be in a portion of the universe with less matter in it than normal , then the space - time around us would be different than it is outside , because matter warps space - time .
Light travelling from supernovae outside our bubble would appear dimmer , because the light would diverge more than we would expect once it got inside our void .
One problem with the void idea , though , is that it negates a principle that has reigned in astronomy for more than 450 years : namely , that our place in the universe is n't special .
When Nicholas Copernicus argued that it made much more sense for the Earth to be revolving around the sun than vice versa , it revolutionized science .
Since then , most theories have to pass the Copernican test .
If they require our planet to be unique , or our position to be exalted , the ideas often seem unlikely .
" This idea that we live in a void would really be a statement that we live in a special place , " Clifton told SPACE.com .
" The regular cosmological model is based on the idea that where we live is a typical place in the universe .
This would be a contradiction to the Copernican principle . "
Clifton , along with Oxford researchers Pedro G. Ferreira and Kate Land , say that in coming years we may be able to distinguish between dark energy and the void .
They point to the upcoming Joint Dark Energy Mission , planned by NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy to launch in 2014 or 2015 .
The satellite aims to measure the expansion of the universe precisely by observing about 2,300 supernovae .
The scientists suggest that by looking at a large number of supernovae in a certain region of the universe , they should be able to tell whether the objects are really accelerating away , or if their light is merely being distorted in a void .
The new study will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal Physical Review Letters .

The U.K. authorities are considering spending up to 12 billion pounds ( $ 21 billion ) on a database to keep information on Internet intercepts , e-mail and telephone records of everyone in Britain , The Sunday Times reported .
U.K. officials say live monitoring is necessary to fight terrorism and crime .
However , critics have doubts about whether such a vast system can be kept secure , the paper said .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The British security service MI5 currently conducts limited e-mail and website intercepts only under warrants from the home secretary , the paper said .
According to The Sunday Times , the government ’s eavesdropping center , GCHQ , has already been allocated 1 billion British pounds ( $ 21 billion ) to finance the first stage of the project .
Hundreds of secret probes are believed to be installed on two of the country ’s biggest Internet and mobile phone providers – BT and Vodafone – to monitor customers live , the paper said .
According to The Sunday Times , no formal decision had yet been taken but sources said that officials had agreed in principle to the program .
“ Any suggestion of the government using existing powers to intercept communications data without public discussion is going to sound extremely sinister , ” the paper quoted Dominic Grieve , the shadow home secretary , as saying .

One of the sorrier legacies of eight years of Bush and Cheney in
the White House has been the conflation of the terms “ National
Security ” and “ Foreign Policy ” by both Republicans and Democrats .
Granted that the history of US foreign policy in the world has been
heavily larded with wars , many of them at America ’s instigation .
It is
nonetheless true that foreign policy is much bigger and more far
reaching than just what has come to be known as “ national security ”
issues .
In Bush - speak , national security come to mean having big guns , lots
of heavily armed troops , cruise missiles , nuclear weapons , naval
armadas and a bully ’s willingness to use these weapons on a whim , with
no thought of consequences .
The term is kind of oxymoronic , since it is clear that by resorting
to war and to threats of war , and by squandering unprecedented sums of
money on the military , eight years of bellicosity has not made the
nation more secure .
Quite the opposite :
The military has been run into
the ground , the economy has been bankrupted , education , healthcare and
other critical national services have been shortchanged , and the
country has become a pariah state , viewed around the world as a loose
cannon and a terror nation — hardly a comforting position to be in .
Foreign policy , meanwhile , has ceased to have any meaning at all ,
beyond the making of war or threats of war , making it virtually
synonymous with the term national security .
When I was a Fulbright professor in China , back in 1991 , at a
mid - year conference in the southern Chinese city of Kunming , we
grantees were addressed by the head of the Fulbright Program in China ,
a cultural affairs director from the US embassy in Beijing .
He informed
us that as teachers ( I was teaching journalism at Fudan University in
Shanghai ) , we Fulbrighters were the frontline of American foreign
policy in China .
Most of us were kind of repulsed by his semi-military
allusion to a battle line and by implication to us as soldiers , and we
chose instead to see our role as something different : emissaries from
the American people to the Chinese people .
In fact , given that most of
the 21 of us were hardly superpatriots or cold warriors ( the academics ,
journalists , lawyers and other professionals who serve in the Fulbright
Program tend demographically to be among the most liberal and
left - leaning group in the American workforce ) , we would have made a
pretty bad defense line .
Rather , what we were doing in China , by
teaching and building relationships with young Chinese college
students , was the essence of real foreign policy — building bridges at
the grass roots level between the people of China and the people of the
US .
Foreign policy can be reduced to a strategic chess game — the kind of
“ real politik ” practiced by Klemens von Metternich in the 19th Century ,
or espoused by Henry Kissinger in the Nixon years — but it is actually ,
or at least ought to be , much broader than that kind of cold and
calculating manipulation and pursuit of narrow self - interest .
Real foreign policy should be about winning friends , building
trust , establishing relationships between countries and peoples ,
negotiating treaties designed to achieve mutual advantage and to deter
aggression .
It is about aiding countries that are in need of
assistance , and at its best , should also be about making the world a
safer , better place for all , which in the end is the best way to guard
against war and the threats of war .
Now it would be naïve to imagine a foreign policy that ignored
national self - interest .
Much as I or others might wish for a world
without borders and a common humanity , in a world of nation states , it
is inevitable that foreign policy as practiced by any nation , including
the United States , will be focused on achieving the maximum benefit for
that nation , and US foreign policy has always been about just that , and
unfortunately probably always will be .
But even granted this selfish
parochialism , it is incredibly shortsighted and ignorant to treat
foreign policy as simply an America - first process of bullying others
into submission to our dictates .
Thousands of American teachers and
Peace Corps volunteers and aid workers do much more to advance
America ’s position in the world and to enhance the nation ’s security
than do hundreds of thousands of soldiers and hundreds of thousands of
tons of bombs and missiles .
For Republicans , there is no difference between national security ,
which is defined as a powerful and assertive military , and foreign
policy .
But Democrats , who at times have had a more nuanced view , have
more recently bought into this too .
At the current Democratic
Convention , anxious to look as tough as Republicans , Democratic
speakers have used the terms national security and foreign policy
interchangeably .
Afghanistan and Iraq provide excellent cases in point .
Clearly , the
US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 , ostensibly aimed initially at
hunting down Al Qaeda fighters and leaders , quickly devolved into an
all - out assault on that nation , which has been reduced to the same
rubble and state of chaos and civil war as has Iraq .
Now , Democratic
presidential nominee Barack Obama is talking about expanding the war
there , and increasing the killing and destruction in that country .
In
Iraq , where the US has been involved in an orgy of killing and
destruction now for over five years , Obama and fellow Democrats are
calling for a “ responsible exit ” from that conflict over the course of
another 16 months .
A truly responsible exit would be an immediate
withdrawal , a national apology to Iraqis and to the world community ,
and a massive program of reparations to help rebuild that nation .
What Obama and the Democrats are touting is not foreign policy .
It is a continuation of national security run amok .
No amount of American force , no level of mayhem and slaughter , will
bring about a secure and tranquil Afghanistan .
In fact , every time
Americans kill Afghanis , as American bombers recently did , slaughtering
60 children and 30 other adults , women and men , in an aerial
bombardment reminiscent of the German Luftwaffe ’s attack on the Basque
village of Guernica , they produce not peace and submission , but rather
hatred and a desire for vengeance .
It will take perhaps a generation of good works for the US to undo
the evil done to American foreign relations by eight years of
Bush / Cheney obsession with national security , but it does n’t even look
like the Democrats “ get it . ”
In Congress , they have vied with
Republicans to look tough , supporting both the invasion of Afghanistan
and the invasion of Iraq , they have supported the continued funding of
those wars and increased funding for the already bloated US war
machine , and they are now backing Obama ’s call for more combat troops
in Afghanistan .
Real foreign policy would be looking at ways to work with other nations to bring down the level of combat , and to bring peace to Afghanistan and to other war - torn regions of the world .

Ever since the beta for Littlebigplanet hit , we 've seen numerous level designs , some good , some not so good .
From classic Mario remakes to re-imagining of the humongous spectacles found in Shadow of the Colossus .
Heck , even Tristan is a game designer in the making .
But simply from an engineering standpoint , I think this is by far and away the best yet .
A user created a real - time working calculator that accurately adds and subtracts numbers .
The level is said to use 610 magnetic switches , 500 wires , and 430 pistons .
I did n't see what the big deal was until the camera panned up .
That 's when my mouth hit the floor .
Thanks to everyone , and I mean everyone , who sent this in !

Behance has been a source of inspiration on the web for the past 8 years , I remember when they first started back in 2007 and it's amazing to see how important it became to the design community .
That 's also one of the reasons that Adobe acquired them .
While we have seen glimpses of how the F - 35 B - the short take - off vertical landing variant of the F - 35 Lightning II - works , here 's an amazingly detailed video showing its transforming capabilities in flight , which was posted anonymously in YouTube last week .
According to Flight Global , this sophisticated war machine - which is now in its testing phase - wo n't see real action any time soon , as its engine is getting redesigned turbine blades .
Update : one of the authors of the - apparently previously classified - video sends us more detailed information about what this really is .
The video was done two years ago for Northrop Grumman .
Our reader was one of the three people who did it and he 's quite surprised to find it online , since it is under NDA .
The one depicted is the X - 35 [ the prototype that won the contract for the Joint Strike Fighter and became the F - 35 ] .
I do n't know who posted it on YouTube , but the level of NDA 's was substantial where we were not even allowed to showcase it on our demo reel .

My guess is that , since the cat has been out of the bag for a long time , the NDA is no longer applicable .

A couple weeks ago we looked at the importance of making tests robust – which can be accomplished by keeping them simple , focused and loosely coupled .
However , as you test more complicated methods , you ’ll find that no matter how well - written your tests are , they ’ll bloat and grow brittle .
Let ’s look at a simple example :
public ActionResult Save( int userId )
{
User user = repository .
LoadUser(userId ) ;
// todo handle null user
user .
Name = Request . Form [ “ name ” ] ;
user .
Password = Request . Form [ “ password ” ] ;
try
{
user .
Update ( ) ;
}
catch ( ValidationException ve )
{
ViewData [ “ Errors ” ] = ve ;
}
return View ( ) ;
}
Here we have a controller action responsible for handling changes made to a user .
Pretty straightforward stuff , right ?
Unfortunately , the code is n’t particularly easy to unit test ( well , it is n’t really difficult , but we ’re using a straightforward example for demonstration purposes ) .
The problem is that our action actually has a number of distinct behaviours .
One solution is to write a single monolithic test to cover everything in our method .
Of course , we already know that ’ll make it unbelievably brittle , as well as making hard to test variations ( different inputs , different return values ) .
The other solution is to make extensive use of stubs and make sure each dependent call is accounted for .
For example , if we want to write a test that focuses on the handling of ValidationException , we need to do quite a bit of stubbing :
[ Test ]
public void Save_SetsValidationErrorsInViewData ()
{
var controller = Mock.PartialMock < UsersController >( ) ;
var repository = Mock.StrictMock < IRepository >( ) ;
var user = Mock.PartialMock < User >( ) ;
var expected = new ValidationException ( “ name ” , “ invalid ” ) ; Mock. SetFakeControllerContext( controller ) ;
repository .
Stub(r => r.LoadUser ( 3 ) ) .
Return ( user ) ;
controller .
Request .
Stub(r => r. Form )
. Repeat .
Any ( )
. Return( new NameValueCollection ( ) ) ;
user .
Stub(u => u.Update ( ) ) .
Throw ( expected ) ; controller .
Save (3 ) ;
Assert.AreSame ( expected , controller .ViewData [ “ Errors ” ] ) ;
}
Even for this simple example , the test is less than ideal .
We need to setup a fake controller context ( using the MvcMockHelper ) , handle our repository interaction and our Request .
Form mapping .
Worse , the same setup is required for each behaviour of this method that we ’ll test .
The solution is to break - down our method into smaller more focused chunks .
Here ’s an extreme example :
public ActionResult Save( int userId )
{
User user = BindUser( userId , Request .
Form ) ;
UpdateUser( user ) ;
return View ( ) ;
}
internal virtual User BindUser ( int userId , NameValueCollection parameters )
{
User user = repository .
LoadUser(userId ) ;
user .
Name = parameters [ “ name ” ] ;
user .
Password = parameters [ “ password ” ] ;
return user ;
}
internal virtual void UpdateUser ( User user )
{
try
{
user .
Update ( ) ;
}
catch ( ValidationException ve )
{
ViewData [ “ Errors ” ] = ve ;
}
}
Now , take a look at our test :
[ Test ]
public void UpdateUser_SetsValidationErrorsInViewData ()
{
var user = Mock.PartialMock < User >( ) ;
var controller = new AwardsController ( ) ;
var expected = new ValidationException ( “ name ” , “ invalid ” ) ; user .
Expect(u => u.Update ( ) ) .
Throw ( expected ) ;
controller .UpdateUser(user ) ;
Assert.AreSame ( expected , controller .ViewData [ “ Errors ” ] ) ;
}
The test is majorly simplified – in fact , we do n’t even have to worry about our controller ’s context , or our interaction with the repository .
The best part is that each of our methods behaviours ( get the user , bind it , save it and mange the viewdata+ view ) can now be tested with equally simple test – rather than all - encompassing ones .
While I realize refactoring into really small methods can pose a psychological barrier for many , it ’s a truly useful technique with benefits beyond testability .
