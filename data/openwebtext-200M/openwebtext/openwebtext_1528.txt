Michael Ruse posted this article last year , but his insights are still spot on .
A few of his incisive criticisms . . .
I am not a devout Christian , yet if anything , the things said against me are worse .
Richard Dawkins , in his best selling The God Delusion , likens me to Neville Chamberlain , the pusillanimous appeaser of Hitler at Munich .
Jerry Coyne reviewed one of my books ( Can a Darwinian be a Christian ? ) using the Orwellian quote that only an intellectual could believe the nonsense I believe in .
And non -stop blogger P. Z. Myers has referred to me as a “ clueless gobshite . ”
This invective is all because , although I am not a believer , I do not think that all believers are evil or stupid , and because I do not think that science and religion have to clash .
Let me say that I believe the new atheists do the side of science a grave disservice .
I will defend to the death the right of them to say what they do — as one who is English - born one of the things I admire most about the USA is the First Amendment .
But I think first that these people do a disservice to scholarship .
Their treatment of the religious viewpoint is pathetic to the point of non-being .
Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion would fail any introductory philosophy or religion course .
Proudly he criticizes that whereof he knows nothing .
As I have said elsewhere , for the first time in my life , I felt sorry for the ontological argument .
If we criticized gene theory with as little knowledge as Dawkins has of religion and philosophy , he would be rightly indignant .
. . .
Conversely , I am indignant at the poor quality of the argumentation in Dawkins , Dennett , Hitchens , and all of the others in that group .
I have written elsewhere that The God Delusion makes me ashamed to be an atheist .
Let me say that again .
Let me say also that I am proud to be the focus of the invective of the new atheists .
They are a bloody disaster and I want to be on the front line of those who say so .

A hit squad that murdered a senior Hamas official in Dubai used the stolen identities of six British citizens and faked at least five other European passports , it emerged today .
The international investigation into the assassination of Mahmoud al Mabhouh last month is certain to examine the role played by Israel , where four of the victims of identity theft , three Britons and a German , currently live .
Some reports last night suggested that a team of 17 people were involved in the meticulously planned killing , of whom six have yet to be identified .
UK authorities issued the British passports used by the assassins in Dubai last month , official sources said .
They confirmed the killers had not altered the names and numbers in the passports , but the photographs had been changed .
At least five of the Britons whose identities were used by the assassins in Dubai live in Israel .
All deny any involvement .
" I am obviously angry , upset and scared – any number of things , " Melvyn Mildiner told Reuters .
" And I 'm looking into what I can do to try to sort things out and clear my name . "
Israeli television named two other British - Israelis whose identities were used , Paul Keeley and Stephen Hodes , and a German passport holder , Michael Bodenheimer .
The revelation fuelled already widespread speculation in the region over Mossad involvement in the killing of Mabhouh and an elaborately orchestrated plot involving 11 assassins mostly posing as tourists in Dubai , with some wearing wigs and false beards .
Mabhouh was one of the founders of Hamas 's military wing and had been wanted by Israel for his role in the 1989 kidnapping and killing of two Israeli soldiers on leave .
His participation was acknowledged by Hamas last month .
The Israeli government would not comment tonight on allegations of its involvement in Mabhouh 's killing , which , if confirmed , would trigger a diplomatic row with Britain , and the other three European nations , whose passports were used : Ireland , Germany and France .
The Irish Republic said the three Irish citizens named by Dubai police as suspects did not exist .
The German government said the passport number of the sole German suspect was either incomplete or wrong .
The authorities in Paris refused to comment on the authenticity of a French passport used by one of the killers .
Dubai public prosecutors have issued warrants for " premeditated murder " against the 10 men and one woman in the suspected assassin team , the first step in obtaining a " red notice " from Interpol to track down wanted fugitives abroad .
The police in the emirate described the killing as meticulously planned , with the hit squad arriving on different flights and checking into different hotels .
They were seen on surveillance video tailing Mabhouh from the moment he arrived in Dubai .
His murder in his hotel room near Dubai 's international airport took 10 minutes and early forensic tests suggest he was suffocated .
The assassins left on flights to Europe and Asia before the body was discovered on 20 January .
Authorities in the United Arab Emirates identified Austria as a possible " command centre " for the elaborate operation .
In a sign that the country would be seeking formal assistance from European states , Dubai 's attorney general , Essam al - Humaidan , told the National , an Abu Dhabi - based newspaper , that the UAE had signed judicial treaties with certain European countries , enabling the " extradition of the suspects wherever they hide " .
Michael Levi , a Cardiff University professor of criminology and an expert on identity theft , said that if the British travel documents used by the assassins predated the introduction of biometric e-passports , they would not be hard to tamper with .
" The sort of organisation that can pull off a hit like that will be able to make those sort of changes , " he said .
" The point is that in any system , you only have to be good enough to pass the scrutiny of the people you 're going to come across . "
The Foreign Office said it was too early to speculate on who could have carried out the identity theft against the British citizens involved .
In recent decades , the Mossad has gained a reputation for using passports of other countries .
Britain had a diplomatic row with Israel in 1987 over its use of forged British passports .
In 1997 , a Mossad hit squad used doctored Canadian passports in a botched attempt to kill the Hamas leader , Khaled Meshal .
In 2005 , two suspected Israeli agents were jailed in New Zealand for obtaining the country 's passports illegally .
A former Mossad official , Rami Yigal , told Israel Army radio the assassination " does n't look like an Israeli operation "
• This article was amended on 16 February 2010 .
The original read , " ... the other three European nations whose passports were used : Ireland , Germany and France " .
This has been corrected .

SINCE the Silk Road fell into disuse six centuries ago , Asian commerce has been carried not by land but by sea along coasts and island chains , first on monsoon winds and now in the holds of diesel ships .
The story of Asia 's post - war miracle is above all a maritime one .
First Japan , then South Korea , Hong Kong , Taiwan and Singapore , and then all of South - East and East Asia bar North Korea and Myanmar , adopted economic models based on exporting manufactures .
The rise of China has been nothing if not the embrace of the maritime world .
The miracle is inconceivable without the ship - borne container .
The broad lines of Asian security mirror this watery theme .
Since the Pacific War of 1941 - 45 , the United States has enforced a Pax Americana through naval strength and a perimeter of island allies , from Australia to Japan .
If American dominance is challenged , it will be at sea .
The rise of China and India as military powers has been marked by a large increase in their navies .
But Anthony Bubalo and Malcolm Cook of the Lowy Institute in Sydney argue in TheAmerican Interest * that such a perspective is bumping up against the limits of usefulness .
It masks a powerful impulse that is starting to reshape continental Asia 's territorial expanses .
For much of the 20th century the three powers of the Asian land mass , China , India and the former Soviet Union , bothered little with international exchange , and transcontinental development was derisory .
That is now changing .
New roads , railways and pipelines are criss - crossing continental Asia .
In December a pipeline 7,000 km ( 4,400 miles ) long opened , bringing gas from Turkmenistan to China , via Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan .
Russia and China have a $ 25 billion project to pipe oil from the Russian Far East into China .
An Iran - Pakistan pipeline is being built , and could eventually run into India or China .
In Myanmar , South Korean and Indian firms have a big project to bring gas to south - western China .
Road networks are also expanding , led by India ( in Afghanistan , for example ) and , especially , China .
Dusty Myanmar is now plugged into China 's spanking new highway complex .
New roads bind neighbours along the Mekong River .
Central Asia is also seeing a flurry of road - building .
Railways reflect the boldest ambitions .
China has already pushed a railway up the Himalayas to Lhasa in Tibet , on which 5 m people have travelled since 2006 .
Now it wants to push lines down them into Nepal , Bangladesh and Bhutan .
As for high - speed railways , from a standing start China 's are the world 's fastest and longest .
The government has plans to roll out a high - speed network across Asia and even Europe .
It proposes three main routes to connect two dozen countries , from Singapore in the south to Germany in the west ( with a tunnel from mainland China to Taiwan to boot ) .
By 2025 , if the railway ministry is to be believed , it will take two days to travel from Shanghai to London .
Immense financial , not to mention political , obstacles stand in the way of such ambitions .
But these projects are starting to redefine what people mean by Asia .
It is no longer mainly a coastline with strong trade links to the rest of the world .
Now , links across Asia matter just as much .
Trade within the region is growing at roughly twice the pace of trade with the outside world .
From almost nothing 20 years ago , China is now India 's biggest partner , with bilateral trade that may top $ 60 billion this year .
Central Asia 's trade with China jumped from $ 160 m in 1990 to $ 7 billion in 2006 .
And China is the biggest merchandise exporter to the Middle East .
The crowds of worshippers at the mosque in Yiwu , a town in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang with a vast wholesale market , hint at the scale of the links .
On the continent 's western edge it is getting hard to know where Asia ends .
For all its promise , the new continental perspective does not negate the maritime one , and sometimes reinforces it .
C. Raja Mohan , an Indian academic , points out that continental development is helping tie isolated populations into international markets , by giving them a route to the sea ( for example , south - west China to the Bay of Bengal ) .
Meanwhile , the continental infrastructure boom increases maritime business : four - fifths of the crude oil bound for China still passes through the Malacca strait .
Resource competition among rising powers and the need to protect sea lanes will keep naval strategists in work for years .
America all at sea
Whether competition by land will lead to co-operation or conflict remains an open question .
Instabilities abound , including thuggish regimes in Central Asia and fractious populations deep inside China and India .
Much depends on how smaller countries respond to the blandishments of their giant neighbours .
Not all Central Asians like the energy deals their governments are striking with China .
Plenty of South Asians resent India 's swagger .
And now Russia wants to regain influence in its backyard .
In continental Asia , there is no enforcer of the peace , as America has been for maritime Asia .
None of the new clubs , such as the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation of China , Russia and Central Asian countries , includes America .
American pressure on Iran over nuclear programmes has been undermined by the energy interests of China and Russia .
Though the United States has a huge military presence in Afghanistan , it vows to get out .
And whereas America has tried both containment and engagement to influence the rogue regime of Myanmar , China and India have used their better contacts mainly to advance their commercial interests .
With an overemphasis on maritime Asia , say Messrs Bubalo and Cook , the West risks a kind of sea- blindness when it comes to the implications of the new continental trends .

Generic HTTP server for KDE March 29 , 2010
Posted by Vitor Boschi in vitor - planetkde
Some time ago I decided to write a file sharing app for kde , and then began hunting for some server already implemented in the libs .
To my surprise , besides the fact that I found some HTTP server implementations ( KGet , KTorrent and Amarok all use this in some way ) , none of them were suitable for my needs :/.
Their main problem is the way these servers gets the content to be served : all data must be sent at once , within a single function call .
This is great when you only serve small data , but I bet you would n’t like to serve a multi gigabyte ( common case for my app ) file using a server like them .
With no server in hands , I began my own implementation , which supports large transfers without eating all system memory .
This is somewhat like file reading : you fetch just a small chunk of data at a time , process it , and only then you request more data .
This is a bit harder than reading everything at once , but also a lot more scalable .
So I got a working server and a working application ( kpws , in playground -> utils ) , and the I found another application , Kepas , which does almost the same thing I just wrote .
This made me stop my own app for a while , because I think KDE will benefit from having a single HTTP server implementation , just like it have a client one , and I ’d like to write it as a GSoC project , but first I need to gather some feedback from the other developers , specially the ones from the applications I cited here .
Do you think this will improve security , performance , maintainability and code reuse ?
Would it be a good GSoC project ?
The World from Berlin Arms Deal More ' Illusion than Reality , ' But Still a Good START
Washington and Moscow signed a new nuclear disarmament treaty on Thursday .
Although the world 's largest nuclear powers will still have more than 1,500 missiles each , German commentators say the treaty marks a positive development in relations between the United States and Russia .
PARIS — Israel , widely believed to have nuclear weapons and possessing no oil , said on Tuesday that it intended to develop civilian nuclear plants for energy , offering to build one as a joint project with Jordan , under French supervision .
The Israeli infrastructure minister , Uzi Landau , said at a Paris conference that Israel wanted a cleaner , more reliable source of energy than the large amounts of coal now imported .
He said that regional cooperation on civilian nuclear power could help bind the Middle East .
Jordan , however , said any such cooperation was premature before a settlement of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Jordan , like Egypt , has been talking about building a civilian nuclear power plant for some time .
Iran , already subject to sanctions by the United Nations Security Council , insists that its nuclear program is purely for civilian purposes , but Western governments believe its intentions are military .
Sean Hannity went out on a long , long limb yesterday on Neil Cavuto 's Fox News show -- once again promoting his blueprint for Conservative Victory -- and made a bold prediction :
Hannity :
You put all of this in toto , in its entirety , and we are looking at -- not only the socialization , the Europe-ization of -- the Western European socialist model coming to America , we 're looking at a -- the end of capitalism in America as we know it .
I want to add a point .
He is -- by far , I predict , Neil -- and I say this with all sincerity and passion that I can muster up -- he will go down in American history as the worst president we have ever had .
And I 'm talking about national security , and I 'm talking about economic issues .
Gee , he 's been in office a little over year now and he 's already making this prediction ?
And wo n't Obama have a heck of a time doing a worse job than his predecessor , George W. Bush ?
After all , as Sean Wilentz predicted in Rolling Stone in 2006 :
George W. Bush 's presidency appears headed for colossal historical disgrace .
Barring a cataclysmic event on the order of the terrorist attacks of September 11th , after which the public might rally around the White House once again , there seems to be little the administration can do to avoid being ranked on the lowest tier of U.S. presidents .
And that may be the best - case scenario .
Many historians are now wondering whether Bush , in fact , will be remembered as the very worst president in all of American history .
The right - wingers dismissed that because it was Wilentz , a noted liberal .
But sure enough , a survey of 80 historians for C - SPAN three years later found :
President George W. Bush is near the bottom of the heap in the latest survey of historians on presidential leadership .
Bush received an overall ranking of 36 out of 42 former presidents — in the bottom 10 .
Actually , we 'd say that there 's little doubt he was indeed the worst president in history just on the two counts that Hannity stipulates , namely , national security and the economy :
--
The worst attack ever recorded on American soil occurred on his watch , while he was in fact asleep at the wheel .
--
His subsequent policies , particularly the decision to invade Iraq , made the nation quantifiably less safe for the foreseeable future ( see the 2006 National Intelligence Estimate for more on this ) .
-- Bush and his policies nearly destroyed not just the American economy but drove the entire global economy to the brink of complete meltdown .
Projection .
It 's not just for theaters anymore .
As we observed at the time of Bush 's repudiation :
" Many of us expect to be subject to certain kinds of video surveillance when we leave our homes and go out each day - at the ATM , at traffic lights , or in stores , for example , " Specter , who is running for reelection , said on the floor of the Senate .
" What we do not expect is to be under visual surveillance in our homes , in our bedrooms , and , most especially , we do not expect it for our children in our homes . "

German sailor who refused to obey Nazi orders to blow up Bordeaux dies aged 91 . . . in France
A wartime German sailor who refused to obey a command to blow up the French port of Bordeaux for his Nazi masters has died at the age of 91 - in his adopted homeland of France .
Heinz Stahlschmidt was that rare thing in the Third Reich ; a man who followed his conscience instead of his orders when the tide of war began to fall back on the regime he served .
By his actions he not only saved thousands of lives , but a vital component of the post - war economic recovery of France .
Heinz Stahlschmidt , pictured in Bordeaux , is credited with saving the French port during World War II .
He died today aged 91
Bordeaux was the country 's most important harbour city , vital to its prosperity and the lynchpin of the wine trade with Britain , then as now the biggest international importer of the region 's celebrated wines .
But while was recognised as a hero by France - and awarded the country 's highest civilian decoration of the Legion d'Honneur - he was regarded as a traitor in a post - war Germany .
He was struck from the list of naval personnel regarded as eligible for a pension and his name erased from honour rolls of the German navy , despite the fact that he had survived three sinkings of warships in the service of the Reich .
France was never so ambivalent : his courage in defying his Nazi masters earned him undying gratitude and he was referred to today in newspapers as the ' Bordeaux Choltitz ' - Choltitz being the commander of Paris in the war who refused Hitler 's orders to destroy the entire capital rather than let it fall to the Allies .
Stahlschmidt died in his adopted homeland of France as Henri Salmide , his new name for a new life , after a long illness .
He returned only once to Germany , to his birthplace at Dortmund , in 2001 , preferring to spend his days among people who appreciated his valour and humanity .
The son of a plumber , who volunteered for the German navy in 1939 upon the outbreak of war , Stahlschmidt was posted to shore duties after three times being rescued from a watery grave as his vessels were sunk beneath him .
Heinz Stahlschmidt was awarded the Legion d'Honneur after his brave actions in Bordeaux
In Bordeaux in 1944 it fell to Sgt. Stahlschmidt - a weapons and demolitions expert - to lead a detachment that defused British sea mines laid to try to stop German vessels from entering the Bay of Biscay .
In August of that year the Allies were steamrolling their way through France following the successful June landings in Normandy on D - Day .
On August 19 the order came from Berlin to destroy the entire port infrastructure - stretching over seven miles - before retreating .
The date was fixed for August 26 .
Stahlschmidt , ordered to carry out the devastation , struck first on 22 August .
A bunker at Rue Raze in the docks was filled with detonators , explosives , plungers , timers and other hardware needed for the spiteful demolition .
He destroyed the lot with dynamite .
He said years later he was ' sorry ' that some German soldiers had died in the mammoth blast that shook practically the whole of Bordeaux .
But he added ; " My family were Huguenots ( protestant Christians ) and I acted according to my Christian conscience .
I could not accept that the port of Bordeaux be wantonly destroyed when the war was clearly lost , '
Stahlschmidt then deserted , presenting himself to the resistance in the city and offering himself up as their prisoner after telling them what he had done .
They protected him from a vengeful high command who branded him a traitor and gave orders to military police to either arrest or shoot him on sight .
Heinz Stahlschmidt became a French citizen in 1947 under the name of Salmide and a Knight of the French Legion d’Honneur in September 2000 .
French historians estimate that he saved 3,500 lives by refusing to carry out the orders to obliterate the wharves , cranes , warehouses , dry docks and other installations of the port .
He took a job in the port fire brigade where he worked for over 30 years , married a Frenchwoman and raised a family .
He was honoured with the award after a campaign by French war veterans that began in 1990 .
A coalition of the net 's biggest online service providers , including Google and Microsoft , are joining with the top internet rights groups to demand Congress modernize the nation 's privacy laws .
Among the reforms pushed by the so - called Digital Due Process coalition is a requirement that law enforcement get warrants from a judge when they want to force companies to turn over your e-mails , documents and location data .
But despite issuing a clarion call to change privacy laws , none of the companies that are pushing citizens to store more and more sensitive information online announced any change to their own practices .
The coalition announced its four principles in a conference call with reporters Tuesday .
The group says they 've briefed the White House , the FBI and Congress on the proposed changes and expect hearings this year .
Congress is n't expected to act before 2011 , because of a crowded legislative agenda .
Changes in technology dictate the need to update the nation 's electronic privacy law , known as the 1986 Electronic Communications Protection Act , according to Jim Dempsey of the Center for Democracy and Technology .
" With the emergence of location services and the transfer of a huge amount of data to the cloud and our huge reliance on cloud storage of e-mail messages , the law has become outdated and needs to be updated , " Dempsey said in the conference call .
For instance , when the law was crafted , e-mail was almost always downloaded from a central server to a user 's computer .
Any messages left after 180 days were considered abandoned , so the law allows police to obtain any e-mail older than six months simply by issuing a subpoena – meaning no judge is involved .
If those e-mails had been downloaded to a user 's computer and removed from the server , the police would need a search warrant , based on probable cause , to get at them .
But now that Americans store gigabytes of e-mails on Yahoo's , Google 's and Microsoft 's servers , those different standards make no sense , and the law should be platform independent , according to Dempsey .
Corporate members of the coalition made no commitment to transparency on Tuesday , even as they continue to encourage users to store more and more data on the companies ' servers .
Earlier this year , Microsoft tried to suppress publication of its surveillance manual , which told law enforcement what data the company collects through its online services such as Hotmail and Xbox Live .
The document also included sample language for subpoenas .
For its part , Google has refused for years to divulge how often it is served with search warrants , law enforcement subpoenas or civil subpoenas for the immense amount of data it collects .
Nothing in the law prevents Google or Yahoo or AOL from publishing that information , but all of them refuse ( though Google laudably makes a point of publishing copyright takedown notices on ChillingEffects.org . )
With the announcement , Google and Microsoft are tacitly acknowledging that their services , combined with the deficiencies in the law , put their users at risk .
However , there 's no mention of these problems in their respective privacy policies .
There 's no option to delete all documents and e-mails older than 180 days .
And there 's no reminders to users about the holes in the law .
Instead the companies are signing onto four principles , which essentially would require a judge to approve any law enforcement request for online data .
The government has to get a warrant based on a showing of probable cause in order to get at non-publicly available e-mails , Facebook postings , documents or photos .
This includes communications shared in a small group , but not made publicly .
This would not protect you if you happen to friend an undercover police officer and share photos or online postings with that officer .
The government has to get a warrant – based on probable cause – to get at location data from mobile devices .
Currently , the courts are split on the standard necessary , and the Obama administration has followed the Bush administration 's lead in seeking this data using a lower standard .
Any time the governmental law enforcement agents want to get at the names of the people you e-mailed or the digits that you dialed , whether in real - time or from stored records , it needs to get a judge 's approval .
The government can only use a subpoena ( self - issued ) to get at data on a particular individual .
If it wants to know all the identity of all mobile phone users in a particular area at a particular time , or wants bulk search records , it needs to get a judge 's approval .
Taken on their own , the principles are a great start – though they should also require law enforcement to report more information to the public on their use of such warrants , and make it illegal to use information gleaned from improper requests in court .
Microsoft decided to sign on to the principles as part of its support of " cloud computing , " according to Michael Hintze , an associate general counsel for the software giant .
As Microsoft encourages individuals and its enterprise customers to embrace its hybrid desktop / cloud technology , the company is finding that customers are concerned about security and privacy , Hintze said .
" The principles restore what we think is the right balance that is in keeping with customers ' expectations , " Hintze said .
" We know there is a legitimate need for law enforcement to access data to fight crime online . "
He also defends the lack of transparency to customers about the hole in electronic privacy law .
" Trying to explain that to customers in way they can understand is nearly an impossible task , " he said .
" We do n't always know what rules will apply . "
As for transparency , Hintze says Microsoft does not publish numbers on legal requests for customer information , though it has a large team that handles subpoenas and warrants .
" We would like to see more transparency across the industry , " Hintze said .
" But no one company wants to stick its head up to talk about numbers . "
As for the takedown of Cryptome for its publishing of a law enforcement surveillance manual , Hintze called that an " unfortunate situation " where the intellectual property lawyers at Microsoft did n't realize the impact of their use of a copyright takedown notice .
" In the future , we will draft them with the expectation that they probably should be public , " Hintze said .
For its part , a Google spokesperson cut off a question about how many subpoenas it handles a year , saying " You know we do n't discuss that . "
Asked about its responsibility to inform users of the privacy hole in federal law , Google 's law enforcement and information security counsel Richard Salgado says the rules are too complicated , so it 's pushing to make them simpler .
" You have judges with decades of experience struggling with this statute , " said Salgado , a former federal cybercrime prosecutor .
" That 's one of the reasons we need to improve it so that users can understand the protections they are afforded . "
Kevin Bankston at the EFF sees the announcement as a good start for companies his organization has long criticized for encouraging users to put their documents online without pushing hard for changes to privacy laws .
" That 's their duty as good corporate citizens , " Bankston said .
" Today is the beginning of that push . "
" We hope and expect that the larger members are going to push this as hard as they can , so that their businesses can grow without creating new privacy holes , " Bankston said .
The principles do not apply to Patriot Act powers – such as the much - abused National Security Letter power , or to the massive spying power handed to the National Security Agency in July 2008 , when then Senator Barack Obama voted to legalize President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program and retroactively throw out lawsuits filed against the nation 's telecoms that abetted the extrajudicial spying on Americans ' e-mails and phone calls .
The biggest beneficiary of retroactive immunity – AT&T , which installed NSA spying rooms inside its facilities and faced multiple lawsuits from citizens – is also a member of the so - called Digital Due Process group .
Other members of the coalition include the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( the lead group suing AT&T ) , mobile location service Loopt , the ACLU , the American Library Association , Salesforce.com and the libertarian - leaning Progress and Freedom Foundation .
Noticeably absent is Yahoo , though it is indirectly a member through its membership in the Net Coalition , which signed on .
Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - Vermont ) has already announced plans to hold a hearing , and in press release , praised the announcement , saying it is " clear that our federal electronic privacy laws are outdated . "

Li-ion batteries work by transferring lithium ions between a cathode and an anode through a liquid electrolyte .
The capacity of a battery is determined by the number of ions it can contain and how quickly those ions can be exchanged .
Silicon is an ideal material for anodes because it allows lithium ions to pass in and out of the electrode very quickly .
But the expansion and contraction of silicon particles as the ions enter and leave degrades the silicon in short order , ruining the battery .
Instead , nearly all li-ion batteries contain graphite anodes that can withstand repeated charge cycles .

Presenter , Mother Was A Blackshirt
Along with most fascists in Britain Oswald Mosley was arrested in 1940 Children of Blackshirt women , who joined Oswald Mosley 's pro-Nazi British Union of Fascists , often feel that they have had to live with the burden of the guilt and shame caused by their mothers ' fascist sympathies .
When I was 11 , I was taken by my mother to visit her birthplace in Kennington , London .
As we walked around my mother showed me where the air - raid shelters were during the war , but then she began telling me about the Blackshirt meetings .
At 11 it did not mean much to me but it has played on my mind ever since .
I decided to reopen the case of how the Blackshirts attempted to recruit my mother .
It led me to question how many British women supported Hitler during the war , and what was their fate ?
" I could have ended up in prison , " my mother said .
And many of these women did .
Now aged 88 , my mother told me about the ink factory she worked in as a young girl .
" At first I was packing ink , it was horrible .
" There I met Primrose , nobody liked her , but she invited me home .
" I met her family and I fell for it - they were trying to get me to be a Blackshirt . "
Inflammatory speeches
In documentaries about the Blackshirts , the pictures I have seen are only of men , marching in the streets in their paramilitary uniforms .
I knew about the daughters of the aristocracy , like Diana Mitford who married Oswald Mosley , but I had not realised that young girls , like my own mother , could have been sucked in too .
But speaking to the historian Julie Gottlieb ( author of Feminine Fascism ) I was surprised to learn that the first fascist political organisation in Britain was actually founded by a woman .
" It was called the fascisti , then changed its name to the British Fascists and it was founded ... in 1923 , by a Miss Rotha Lintorn - Orman , " she told me .
The women wore a black shirt and tie , beret and slightly flared skirts Until then the most prominent political movement for women had been the Suffragettes .
One of the most influential Suffragettes was Norah Elam , who was in charge of propaganda and imprisoned for making inflammatory speeches on women 's suffrage .
Sent to Holloway prison in 1914 , she shared a cell with Emmeline Pankhurst , leader of the British Suffragettes .
But Norah Elam was imprisoned again during World War II , this time with Diana Mosley , wife of the fascist leader .
Like me , Norah 's granddaughter and great - granddaughter Angela and Susan McPherson have been on a quest to find out more about their family 's history .
They knew little about the colourful past of their granny Norah .
" It was a bit of a shock , " they told me .
A bit of a shock indeed .
' Battle of the shirts '
But women like my mother were not interested in politics , as Norah Elam was , so was it the comradeship or merely the appeal of the smart uniform that was the attraction ?
Julie Gottlieb described the Blackshirt uniform as " a great marketing tool , and an incredible draw particularly for the youth .
Some historians call this period the battle of the shirts " .
I felt utterly responsible for what happened in those camps , because I did write ' Perish the Jews ' on walls - it is something I will never get over
Diana Bailey
The party grew and even children were recruited to support Hitler 's ideology .
Diana Bailey , as a young girl in Bognor Regis , remembers her mother and father in their Blackshirt uniforms .
" We were told to paint slogans on the walls with ' Britain Awake ' and ' Perish the Jews ' .
I was nine years old , " she said .
Francis Beckett 's mother Anne was also a young working woman , like my mother .
Anne was sent along to Mosley 's headquarters by the Pitman 's Shorthand temp agency to work as a secretary .
" She wanted to be an actress but she made what she said was a dreadful mistake , she learnt shorthand .
" Pitman 's sent her to Black House , HQ for the Blackshirts .
She found it exciting .
" She was never a racist but worked amongst racists , " Francis Beckett said .
It was at fascist headquarters that Anne joined the Blackshirts and met and later married one of the Blackshirt elite , John Beckett , Francis 's father .
The British Union of Fascists had 50,000 members at one point John was sent to prison with Oswald Mosley during the war - and his family spent the rest of their lives living hand to mouth .
A former Labour MP , John Beckett should have taken his place in the post - war Attlee government .
Instead , he worked as a night watchman for Securicor .
Seeing how easily Francis 's mother had become a Blackshirt , I asked my mother if something similar had happened to her , with her factory workmate Primrose and her fascist family .
" They were talking about these meetings - I thought they had got me there for a reason .
" They were talking about Mosley , so after this I left , and later gave in my notice at the ink factory , " she said .
So after all these years I can stop imagining my mother sitting in the rows of a mass meeting , ' sieg heiling ' their leader and being hauled off to Holloway Prison .
But in talking to these families I can see how life could so easily have been very different for my family .
Diana Bailey continues to live with the consequences of her parents ' actions - and says she will never lose her feelings of guilt .
" When Richard Dimbleby went into Belsen I felt the guilt of the whole of the world , I felt utterly responsible for what happened in those camps , because I did write ' Perish the Jews ' on walls , it is something I will never get over . "
Mother Was a Blackshirt will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 4 January at 1100 GMT .

A super - injunction to protect John Terry 's privacy was lifted A major review of the use of super - injunctions to gag the media has been ordered , it has been announced .
A committee of senior judges , newspaper group representatives and libel lawyers will look at the issue and meet for the first time on 4 May .
An injunction granted to Swiss firm Trafigura seemed to restrict comments in parliament and footballer John Terry had one which was later repealed .
MPs have expressed fears that their freedom to speak is being restricted .
Super - injunctions are highly secret injunctions where the press cannot even refer to the fact that an injunction has been granted .
In a report published in February , the Culture , Media and Sport Committee of MPs expressed " grave concern " about parliamentary freedom of speech .
The committee called for new laws to clarify the limits on the use of super - injunctions against comments made in Parliament .
' Fundamental principle '
The committee conducting the review into the use of super - injunctions will be chaired by the Master of the Rolls , Lord Neuberger .
A Judicial Communications
Office spokesman said the committee would " examine the issues around the use of injunctions which bind the press and so - called ' super - injunctions ' " .
" This follows the recent report by the Culture , Media and Sport Committee 's report on press standards , privacy and libel and concerns expressed to the judiciary , " he added .
Last year the Lord Chief Justice , Lord Judge , said it was a " fundamental principle " that MPs should be able to speak freely in Parliament .
He said : " The absolute privilege for members to speak freely in Parliament did not come without a price and previous generations fought , and indeed died , for it .
" It is a very precious heritage which , in my view , should be vigorously maintained and defended by this generation . "
The super - injunction granted to Terry , the former England football captain , prevented the reporting allegations about his private life .
In the case of oil trading company Trafigura the super - injunction concerned leaked documents relating to the disposal of waste in the Ivory Coast .

Personal Quotes ( 17 )
Dancing came easy for me .
Acting came hard .
I would rather do a play because it 's instantaneous .
You go on the stage , and you know whether it 's happening or not .
Somebody asked me " what is acting ? "
And I said , " acting is listening . "
And if you ai n't listening , nobody 's listening .
I can't count how many of my friends are in the cemetery at Normandy , the heroes are still there , the real heroes .
[ about arriving at Omaha Beach on D - Day ]
It 's hard to describe what we all went through that day , but those of us who were there will understand .
We were frightened all the time .
My sergeant said ' are you scared , son ? ' and I said ' yes , I am ' , and he said ' that 's good , it 's good to be scared ' , he said ' we all are ' .
This guy in the boat , he turned to me and he threw up all over me , and I got seasick .
He was scared .
You 're not thinking about anything , you 're just thinking about you hope that shell that just went off is n't going to hit this boat .
Even the guys who had seen a lot of action before , and this was my first time , they were just as ashen as I was , and I was frightened to death .
I was the second man off my barge and the first and third men got killed .
First guy the ramp went down , the guy fell and I tried to leap over him and I stumbled and we both slipped into the water .
We were supposed to be able to walk into shore but they did n't bring us far enough .
And I was in 60 feet of water with a 60 pound pack on , so I let it all go .
[ on reaching Omaha Beach after falling in the water ]
I came up and I did n't have a helmet , a rifle , nothing .
I hit the beach , the guys pulled me in who were already there , I 'd lost everything ; but they said ' you 'll find plenty of them on the beach , rifles , helmets , that belong to nobody ' .
Nobody knew where we were supposed to go , there was nobody in charge , you were on your own .
All around me people were being shot at , I saw bodies all over the place ; but you did n't know if they were alive or dead , they were just lying there .
[ about D - Day ]
We got behind this tank to protect ourselves ; we 're holding our own when they called us over to them .
I asked the sergeant ' you want me to go first or you go first ? '
He said ' you go first , I 'll be right behind you ' .
I heard an explosion , and I turned around , and his torso was here , and his body was over there .
[ on what he thought his image was ] Image ?
Hell , I do n't have an image .
There are many secrets in us , in the depths of our souls , that we do n't want anyone to know about .
There 's terror and repulsion in us , the terrible spot that we do n't talk about .
That place no one knows about -- horrifying things we keep secret .
A lot of that is released through acting .
Of course , I 'm not often the top dog , but sometimes it 's better not to be top dog , because you last longer .
If a movie or play flops , you always blame the lead .
They say : " He could n't carry it . "
They always blame him .
But they rarely blame the second or third banana .
[ from an interview in 2008 ]
They 're going to carry me out , if I go .
I never turned down anything and never argued with any producer or director .
[ from a 1997 interview ]
If I 'm not in a part , I drive my wife crazy .
I 'll go downstairs to get the mail , and when I come back I 'll say , " Any calls for me ? " .
' A Chorus Line ' is an actor 's play about actors .
When that girl starts singing ' What I Did for Love ' , it has nothing to do with sex .
It 's the love of the theatre - the horror , the heartbreak , the disappointments .
We 've all had our share .
[ Advice on acting ]
The thing to do is to keep taking chances .
If you 're going to learn anything , you 've got to learn from the masters .
Plus you 've got to work with the talented beginner too .
I was in the business ten years before the actors began to notice me .
Then it took another five years before the agents and producers noticed me .
Five years after that , the public found me .
And five or six years later , the critics took note .
James Cagney is probably the reason I became an actor .
I think I learned much of what I know about acting from watching James Cagney movies .
When people ask me , I tell them I did n't go to school .
I learned directly from Cagney .
Part of my life I tried to keep secret ... and deliberately .
When I first got into this business and told people that I was in burlesque , they immediately characterized me .
Right away , when they say ' burlesque , ' you think of Bert Lahr , Phil Silvers , Red Skelton ... they 're all comics , and they 're all great .
I had none of their ability .
Maybe the Catholic Church just needs a break these days amid sweeping allegations and controversial reports surfacing about decades of child sex abuse by its priests worldwide .
And maybe that break comes in the form of honoring the Beatles .
That ’s right , the Vatican in its newspaper L’Osservatore Romano paid tribute to the Fab Four in its weekend editions , praising the rock stars with two articles and a front - page cartoon reproducing the crosswalk immortalized on the cover of the band ’s album “ Abbey Road . ”
The tribute marked the 40th anniversary of the band ’s breakup .
However some suggest that perhaps by “ making peace ” with the one of the world ’s most famous rock bands of the 1960s and ’ 70s , the Vatican is trying to divert from the public scandal that continues to unfold .
The Vatican said that although the Beatles used drugs , led “ dissolute ” lives and even claimed that they were bigger than Jesus , these were all in the past – while their music lives on .
“ It ’s true , they took drugs ; swept up by their success , they lived dissolute and uninhibited lives , ” said L’Osservatore Romano .
“ They even said they were more famous than Jesus , ” the paper added , recalling a 1966 comment by John Lennon that outraged many Catholics and others .
“ But listening to their songs , all of this seems distant and meaningless , ” the paper added .
“ Their beautiful melodies , which changed forever pop music and still give us emotions , live on like precious jewels . ”
L’Osservatore noted that the Beatles ’ songs have stood the test of time , adding that the band remains “ the longest - lasting , most consistent and representative phenomenon in the history of pop music . ”
Giovanni Maria Vian , editor in chief of L’Osservatore , told the Associated Press he loves the Beatles .
He said that at the time of Lennon ’s sensational statement , the paper “ commented that in reality it was n’t that scandalous , because the fascination with Jesus was so great that it attracted these news heroes of the time . ”
But critics say the real scandal is the Catholic Church ’s response to the sex - abuse crisis .
The Vatican may have forgiven the Beatles over the weekend for their “ satanic ” messages , but Ringo Starr , the band ’s legendary drummer , told CNN he could n’t care less .
“ I think the Vatican , they ’ve got more to talk about than the Beatles , ” he said .

Sunday is a slow night for the Beijing Hooters girls .
Jiang Xin -- or Summer , as her name tag reads -- takes the opportunity to teach the new hires one of their dance routines .
With smoky dark eyes and her all - black trainer uniform , 24 - year - old Jiang is sexy , smoldering and standoffish until she smiles .
This she does when she gently admonishes the girls to loosen up , laugh , and stop tugging at the bottoms of their shorts .
Hooters in Beijing is much like its American counterpart .
The waitresses dress in orange track shorts , pantyhose and shrunken white tank tops .
When customers come in , they call out in garbled English , “ Welcome to Hooters ! ”
A sign hanging by the bathroom reads : “ Caution .
Blonds thinking . ”
A glass case displays a Hooters China swimsuit calendar , mugs , T - shirts and a Hooters - branded miniature Temple of Heaven .
On the scale of China ’s sexual evolution , Hooters lands somewhere between a wink and a smile .
Unthinkable two decades ago , the restaurant promotes a playful kind of sexuality different from the country ’s seedy massage parlors and hostess bars , and yes , it serves the chain ’s famous wings too .
The restaurant may be another example of globalization in China , but it ’s also a snapshot of changing attitudes toward sex in a country full of contradictions .
Gone are the days when public displays of affection were frowned upon , although selected things remain off - limits .
Pornography is strictly prohibited .
A government campaign last year netted 5,000 arrests for distributing porn online .
The crackdown even extended to dirty jokes sent to cellphones .
Last summer , local officials blocked the opening of a sex - themed park named “ Love Land ” in Chongqing that featured a large collection of genitalia sculptures , calling it an “ evil influence . ”
Yet authorities turn a blind eye when it comes to illegal brothels .
Often disguised as hair salons , they remain one of the most common sights in any city , operating unabated next door to businesses and schools without the slightest fuss from locals .
“ In terms of sex , China has these really competing views , socially and personally , ” said James Farrer , a professor at Sophia University in Tokyo who has studied sex in China .
“ What Hooters does is give a new model .
. . .
It ’s an almost family - style restaurant .
It ’s clean .
It ’s very far removed from the salacious commercial sex that is rampant in China . ”
The Beijing Hooters , one of three in China , sits on the second level of a renovated block of restaurants and shops , above a French bakery .
But one does n’t have to look far to find contrasts .
Down the street are two barbershops with scantily clad women waiting for customers and looking bored .
In the same neighborhood , adult stores do n’t bother with euphemisms to conceal what they sell .
Their signs read simply , “ Sex Shop . ”
This is not out of the ordinary in Beijing .
Brothels and kinky toy shops are mixed into residential neighborhoods everywhere .
Next to Hooters is an apartment complex .
Across the street is one of the capital ’s trendiest shopping malls , filled with famous foreign brands .
Hooters has even received the blessing of local government .
After restaurants opened in Shanghai and Beijing , city officials christened the eateries by dining there , said Stephanie Xu , vice president of marketing for the restaurant chain in China .
The restaurant ’s clientele is largely clean - cut , corporate expatriate types , a few visiting businessmen , couples and even parties of women .
The wait staff is also a cut above .
The women are interviewed for how outgoing they are and how well they speak English .
Xu said many of the waitresses are university students working part time to cover tuition .
Pay starts at $ 500 a month and can go up to almost $ 900 .
Such wages are on par with the earnings of recent college graduates in Beijing .
Others look at Hooters as just another Western influence that China could do without .
Lin Lixia of the Women ’s Law Studies and Legal Services at Peking University called Hooters an example of “ hot - girl economics , ” a strategy of profiting from female sex appeal .
Though quite the norm in the U.S. , the concept is relatively new in China , where economic reforms are only three decades old .
“ It ’s a generational thing , ” Lin said .
“ Taking a woman ’s body and objectifying it , that we do n’t support , but the young people desire it and the women want to do it . ”
For some waitresses , however , being extroverted and flirtatious does not come naturally .
“ Some of the girls are shy at first , and uncomfortable in the uniforms , ” Jiang said .
“ Eventually they learn it ’s not low - class , it just looks good . ”
Jiang has worked at Hooters since it opened in Beijing in 2008 .
At the time , she was studying law at a university in the city .
She has since dropped out of school to work full time .
Being a lawyer reflected her parents ’ wishes , not hers , she said .
Jiang admits her boyfriend does n’t like her working there , and her parents have never come for a meal .
Jiang says she hopes to find a job in sales next .
“ It ’s not a career , and you ca n’t do this forever , ” she said .
“ But it ’s a good experience . ”
With unemployment among graduates at 13 % , more young women are applying to Hooters .
In addition to good looks and the ability to speak English , they need a few other skills .
Jiang coaches them in yelping , dancing in a line and , so they ’re not embarrassed when an English - speaking customer asks , the real meaning of “ Hooters . ”
With a sly smile , Jiang demonstrates how to respond : “ Of course I know what hooters means . ”

Turns out that there 's a financial center in Madrid , Spain which is so damn big and confusing to navigate that you 'll desperately need these multilingual robots to guide you around .
Here 's how it works — in- action video and all :
You stroll up to where the mechanical swarm is waiting , tip - tap your way through a menu on a robot 's touchscreen to select your preferred language , pick a destination , and off you go .
The robots are about knee - high and zip back and forth through the Santander Group 's financial complex in Madrid .
They 're clever enough to avoid running into people , other robots , or any of the LED panel covered columns around the complex while promptly getting you to your destination .

This makes the approval process faster , and you wo n't have to worry about hard inquiries that could drive your credit score down even further .
Improve Your Credit Score
For individuals with poor credit ratings , applying for multiple loans can actually decrease their credit score further , as credit scores are affected if an individual receives multiple credit checks in a small amount of time .
This can trap people requiring a loan , as they are stuck being unable to secure a loan due to their credit score which is constantly decreasing .
Applying for an online loan that does n't require a credit check can bring individuals out of this trap and if the borrower makes the agreed loan payments on time , their credit score will improve .
Taking out a no credit check loan is , therefore , a great option for individuals looking to improve their credit rating .

Ta-da !
A comic !
And it is here even though Tony went on an exodus while Wes tore his heart out of his own chest .
– John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst .
The views expressed are his own –
Financial reform legislation is set to reach the Senate floor as early as this week .
With U.S. President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid holding most of the cards , pressure on Senate Republicans and Wall Street to find a compromise is becoming intense .
The Senate Banking Committee ’s own version of reform ( S 3217 ) was placed on the calendar of the Senate late last week ( Calendar No 349 ) from where the Democratic majority leader can call it up for debate at any time .
In practice , Reid will wait until the Senate Agriculture Committee has had time to approve its own version of derivatives rules .
The Agriculture Committee claims jurisdiction over some aspects of derivatives law .
It is due to meet on Wednesday to approve a bill drafted by Chairman Blanche Lincoln ( D , Arkansas ) .
Under Senate Rules , the majority leader has almost absolute control over the order in which legislation is called up for debate .
Once the Lincoln bill has been reported out of committee , Reid will have discretion to call up the banking and agriculture committee bills any time , which could be as early as Thursday this week .
The banking and agriculture bills need to be melded together in some way .
Either Reid will offer a compromise text of his own incorporating elements of both , or the majority leader will bring up the banking bill , perhaps with some or all of the agriculture bill being offered as an amendment .
Ultimately , Senate legislation must be reconciled with the separate Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( HR 4173 ) promoted by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank and approved by the House of Representatives in December last year by 223 votes to 202 .
In practice , it looks like the Senate Banking Committee ’s bill has superseded the House measure , and will form the basis of any final law .
If the Senate passes a measure , it will be sent to the House for approval .
If the House agrees without amendment , it will become law over the president ’s signature .
If not differences will have to be ironed out in conference committee .
DEBATE CONTROL
Senate conventions and the standing rules of the chamber permit unlimited debate on any measure .
To avert endless delay , for routine and non-contentious measures , the majority leader will normally ask for “ unanimous consent ” ( uc ) to set aside the normal rules and consider the bill under an expedited procedure .
In this case , Reid is unlikely to obtain unanimous consent .
The majority leader will therefore offer a motion to proceed with the bill setting terms for debate .
Since the motion itself is subject to a filibuster , the majority leader will need the support of at least 60 senators to invoke “ cloture ” limiting debate to just 30 additional hours .
The motion to proceed , once passed , would control debate on the bill itself .
On final passage , only 50 votes are needed for approval ( the vice - president can vote to break a tie ) .
The point of this detour into Senate procedure is that it helps explain the structure of the poker game each side is now playing .
The only point of leverage the Senate Republican caucus has is its power to block a motion to proceed and therefore prevent the bill ever coming to the floor in a manner it can be approved without unlimited debate .
But while Senate Republicans can prevent the matter coming to a head , the majority leader can raise the bill any time , as many times as he decides , and keep it on the floor of the Senate , and in the headlines , for as long as he wants .
Reid can force the Republicans to go on the record opposing financial reform and keep media and public attention on Wall Street issues for as long as it suits his purposes .
POLITICAL POSITIONING
And it suits Reid and the Democrats to keep the spotlight on this issue .
Unlike healthcare , where Democrats were divided , and found lackluster and ebbing public support , the party is fairly unified on financial reform and seems more in tune with the popular mood , which wants tough reforms as payback for the financial crisis .
In contrast , Republicans appear divided and uncertain , anxious about being seen to align themselves too closely with Wall Street interests opposed to substantial change .
Keeping the spotlight on financial reform keeps Democrats united and their opponents divided and off balance .
It keeps public attention on an issue the party hopes is a plus point , away from more controversial areas such as healthcare , which dominated the headlines only a few weeks ago , until it was pushed aside by financial reform and the retirement of Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens .
Congressional Democrats and the White House have found the perfect issue on which to take an aggressive stand .
If the bill passes , they notch up the second significant legislative victory in six months , on something that energizes the party ’s core voter base and resonates reasonably well with the rest of the electorates .
If the bill stumbles , because the 41 Senate Republicans refuse cloture on a motion to proceed , Reid will force them to cast a vote on the record and tie themselves to Wall Street .
The Democrats will then make it a centerpiece of a populist campaign in the autumn , running against both Republican obstruction and Wall Street itself .
Being linked to unpopular Wall Street interests is the last thing Senate Republicans want in the mid-term elections .
The party would much rather turn the conversation back to healthcare , over - reaching by an activist government , ballooning deficits and unaffordable entitlement programs .
PLAYING THE END GAME
Reid will almost certainly force the 41 Republicans to make a recorded roll call vote against cloture .
He might even challenge the Republicans to start filibustering the bill and keep it on the floor for a few days to maximize the publicity and embarrassment .
Senate Republicans are keen to avert this sort of showdown .
The caucus unified last week to send a unanimous letter to Reid .
Some have interpreted this 41 - siganture letter as an aggressive filibuster threat .
In practice , it seems more like a plea to be let into negotiations so the party could avoid embarrassment and vote for something that could be branded a bipartisan bill .
“ We encourage you to take a bipartisan and inclusive approach , ” the signatories urged .
In contrast to healthcare , where many Republicans , and a large section of the electorate , favored no bill to the one the Democrats were promoting , on financial reform there is a clear majority for change .
“ Inaction is not an option , ” as the Redrafting from scratch is not an option at this stage .
Neither the White House nor Senate Democrats have any interest in doing the bill over again .
But Senate Democrats and the administration would probably offer some minor amendments to secure Republican support .
Republicans and banking lobbyists will need to identify two or three key issues where they can secure compromise .
One will have to be the $ 50 billion bailout fund and issue of resolution authority .
While this is a relatively inconsequential point , on which there are good arguments on both sides , the bill ’s opponents have made it a signature issue .
Since it was not originally suggested by the Treasury , though , it can easily be dropped .
One or two other key changes are also possible at this stage , allowing both sides to declare victory and move on .
But it is much too late to change the basic form and direction of the bill .
It is hazardous to predict the outcome of last - minute legislative maneuvering .
But my guess is that this bill will be approved , by a lopsided majority , after a few amendments are agreed in the next few days , as quite a few Republicans sign on to neutralize the issue .
Otherwise , the matter will go before the voters in the fall .

EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. -- The New Jersey Nets ' sad - sack season appeared to hit another low Monday night when CEO Brett Yormark shouted at a fan wearing a paper bag over his head .

Yormark left his courtside seat at the IZOD Center late in the second half of New Jersey 's 99 - 89 loss to the Miami Heat .
Yormark then doubled back toward the fan , identified by the New York Daily News as Chris Lisi of Middletown , N.J .
It was at that point that Yormark , Lisi and a friend of Lisi 's got into a shouting match with reporters and photographers nearby .
Lisi told the Daily News that the CEO initiated the exchange by asking him why he had a bag on his head .
Lisi 's response -- " because the Nets are so good , " according to the paper .
Yormark then snapped at him and walked off , Lisi told the Daily News .
" I did not agree with the way this person expressed his opinion of our team last night and I let him know , " Yormark said in a statement issued Tuesday .
" It 's been a frustrating season for all of us , but I will continue to stand up for our players , our fans , and our organization . "
The Nets are 7-63 and extended a franchise record with their 14th straight loss at home Monday .
It also was New Jersey 's eighth straight defeat on their way toward possibly finishing with the worst record in NBA history .
New Jersey has to win two of its final 12 games to avoid breaking the Philadelphia 76ers ' mark for futility ( 9 - 73 ) , set in the 1972 - 73 season .

WASHINGTON ( AFP ) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan denied his policies encouraged the type of risky lending that spurred the financial crisis , in testimony to a federal investigative panel Wednesday .
The long - time Fed chair — whose reputation as a financial mastermind has been deeply undermined by the crisis — denied low interest rates and loose regulation had encouraged lenders and borrowers to take ever greater risks .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The house - price bubble , the most prominent global bubble in generations , was engendered by lower interest rates , but … it was long - term mortgage rates that galvanized prices , not the overnight rates of central banks , ” he said .
Greenspan appeared before a committee established by President Barack Obama and Congress to examine the causes of the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression .
In sometimes testy exchanges , Greenspan was accused by commission chair Phil Angelides of failing to prevent “ abusive and deceptive ” subprime home loans from causing the collapse of the housing market .
“ You could ’ve , you should ’ve , and you did n’t , ” said Angelides , a former treasurer of California and Democratic gubernatorial nominee for that state .
Once seen as infallible , Greenspan has come under withering attack since he left office in 2006 .
His account of events was bluntly challenged by Angelides : “ I want to make sure we are not rewriting or ignoring history here . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
After being sworn in , Greenspan admitted there were “ an awful lot of mistakes ” in his 21 years in office , but that he was right 70 percent of the time .
He acknowledged some actions taken in the build - up to the crisis could be included in the 30 percent of times that he was wrong .
But Greenspan also argued that regulators could not be expected to fully predict or prevent crises .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The recent crisis reinforces some important messages about what supervision and examination can and cannot do , ” he told the panel .
“ History tells us they cannot identify the timing of a crisis , or anticipate exactly where it will be located or how large the losses and spillovers will be , ” he added .
ADVERTISEMENT
Greenspan also said the development of some complex mortgage instruments was not improper , but boosted “ the national policy of making homeownership more broadly available . ”
After the meltdown , which is thought to have destroyed around seven trillion dollars ’ worth of housing market value , Obama has vowed to rewrite the rules for banks and lenders whose excessive risks prompted the crisis .
Greenspan swatted aside allegations that the Fed should now see its regulatory role curbed as a result of its failures .
ADVERTISEMENT
But , he admitted , financial institutions must now be asked to keep more cash on hand to cover transactions and that instruments must be backed by high levels of collateral .
On Thursday the commission will hear testimony from Chuck Prince , a former chief executive of Citigroup , a large bank seen as playing a key role in the crisis .
The panel is made up of six Democrats and four Republicans and has the power to subpoena witnesses .
It is expected to deliver its final report by December this year .

Greenspan : I was wrong 30 % of the time

( CNN ) --
An explosion went off Friday at the office of a neo -Nazi group in Athens , Greek police said .
The daily newspaper Eleftherotypia received an anonymous phone call about the explosion 25 minutes beforehand , so the building was evacuated in time and no one was hurt , police said .
It happened at 8:50 a.m. ( 2:50 a.m. ET ) at the fifth - floor office of Chryssi Avghi , a well known group whose name means " golden dawn . "
It was not known whether the group has been targeted before .
Police said the explosion was not large and that firefighters put out the resulting fire .
President Obama is packing on political muscle , with the latest example being his surprise trip to Afghanistan .
There , he delivered a pointed message to Afghan President Hamid Karzai to rein in corruption and improve on good governance .
It was not long ago that Mr. Obama was seen as weak , both at home and abroad .
He was criticized for handing healthcare over to Congress and not leading .
He was chastised for caving in to Russia on a missile defense shield , for reaching out to Iran with kid gloves , for letting Israel roll over him with settlements , for wimping out on greenhouse gases .
The criticisms have come from all sides , depending on the issue .
And there have been exceptions to this weakness complaint , most notably his troop surge in Afghanistan .
But in the last few weeks , he has noticeably stiffened his backbone .
IN PICTURES : Inside President Obama's White House
No matter what one thinks about healthcare reform , the president stood firm and used his powers of persuasion – and his office – to pass the most significant change to medical care for Americans in decades .
After that , an emboldened Obama announced 15 recess appointments to fill openings in his administration , bypassing the Senate and further angering Republicans .
He justified it on grounds of GOP obstruction .
In foreign affairs , Obama told his Russian counterpart he was ready to walk away from a nuclear arms reduction treaty rather than give in to Moscow ’s demands for concessions .
That tough stance saved the START treaty , and the president was able to announce a nuclear weapons deal March 26 .
In recent weeks , the president has shown resolve over Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , and he ’s working on a new round of international sanctions to dissuade Iran from developing a nuclear bomb .
The toughness shows Obama maturing in his presidency , balancing deliberation with decisiveness .
But it does n’t necessarily guarantee success .
Getting the balance right is awfully hard .
Too much deliberation can turn a president into a manager , like Jimmy Carter .
Too much bold and decisive can lead to erroneous conclusions such as President George W. Bush ’s “ mission accomplished ” in the Iraq war .
At home , the White House has on its agenda the regulation of the financial industry , changes to the No Child Left Behind Act , campaign - finance changes , and job creation .
The latter must be the president ’s No. 1 domestic priority .
Obama ’s tough stand on healthcare could strengthen his hand , but he should not stop reaching out to Republicans , even if they profess , as Sen .
John McCain did , that “ there will be no cooperation for the rest of the year . ”
Overarching this agenda , though , must be the job of getting the nation ’s finances in order .
For this , the president will need to exercise toughness and leadership , because neither side will likely be interested in making the sacrifices required to tame the deficit .
Abroad , Obama ’s newly shown resolve may help move the United States and Russia further along the path to a “ reset ” in relations .
His combination of flexibility on the anti-Iranian missile shield but stiffness on the arms treaty shows sensitivity to Russian insecurities and also firmness in the face of an assertive Russia .
Likewise , Obama will have to maintain evenhandedness in the Middle East , which includes a necessary firmness with Israel .
It ’s hard to see how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s governing coalition , with its hard - right elements , will reach a peace deal with the Palestinians without considerable pressure from Washington .
Such pressure can also reinforce America as an “ honest broker ” in the peace process – with positive ripple effects in the region .
March has turned out to be a surprising month for Obama , the professor president .
He ’s gained needed political clout .
Will he use it wisely ?

Arsenal playmaker Andrey Arshavin believes he could be out of action for up to three weeks .
Gunners ace adds to Wenger 's growing injury woes
Blow
Arsenal playmaker Andrey Arshavin believes he could be out of action for up to three weeks .
The Russia international limped off the pitch inside half - an - hour in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League quarter - final clash with Barcelona at Emirates Stadium .
He was one of three players who suffered an injury setback in what was to be a remarkable comeback from the Gunners , who snatched a 2 - 2 draw against their Spanish opponents having fought back from a two - goal deficit .
That result may have come at a significant cost , though , with Cesc Fabregas , William Gallas and Arshavin all missing for the return leg .
" Perhaps I wo n't be able to play for another two or three weeks , " said Arshavin on his .
" It is not a relapse of my old injury , this is a new one . "
Arshavin still believes his side are more than capable of giving a good account of themselves in Spain despite having so many influential players out .
" The rest of the players will play to win , " he said .
" They showed great character on Wednesday .
Barcelona had a good start but we found our way back .
" There is one more match ahead , and there is still hope . "
The above video has been doing the rounds of the interweb , showing former US president George Bush in Haiti .
As you can see from the video , it looks like Bush shakes hands with someone and immediately wipes his hand on Bill Clinton 's shirt .
An NPR news post on the subject was headlined : " Hand - Shaking Bush In Haiti Wipes Mitt On Clinton 's Shirt " , and plenty of tweets and blogs thought the former president was guilty of insulting Haiti and possibly Clinton .
But it seems unlikely , although without being there at the time it 's impossible to say for certain .
An equally likely version of events would show the personality differences between the two presidents .
The video clip above appears to have been selectively slowed at the point that Bush touches Clinton 's shoulder , making his gesture seem worse than it was .
In the full - speed BBC version – available here – Bush is seen tapping Clinton on the shoulder twice and then plucking at his sleeve .
Clinton is notoriously unpunctual and an enthusiastic glad - hander , whereas Bush is known for keeping to a tight schedule .
So it 's just as likely that Bush was encouraging Clinton to hurry up .
Digital marketing is different from traditional media channels because it is inherently measurable .
All the other great attributes of this channel — user participation , mobility , video , personal networks — are built on top of this quantifiable benefit .
Measurability is our medium ’s killer app .
So why do most organizations and websites fail to use web analytics effectively ?
Here are the myths digital marketers need to recognize ( and combat ) in order to deliver on the promise of accountable marketing investments that can be improved over time .
Analytics Requires a Specialist
If you are a digital marketer , you need to measure how your content ( tweeting , emailing , or whatever it is you do ) contributes to business goals .
Nobody will have richer insights about your campaigns than you .
In order to actively manage your piece of the online business , you need direct access to analytics .
Web Analytic Success is Technology , and it ’s Automatic
Most companies with analytics code on their pages have never set a goal , instituted filtering , or defined visitor segments .
Web analytics is no more automatic than business intelligence is .
CMS project success is 20 percent determined by tool selection and 80 percent driven by training , culture , planning and governance .
Web analytics success is driven by the same factors .
Having the Best Tools Provides an Advantage
Nope .
Having the best people drives insight and success .
While some tools may have more built - in testing or quantitative capabilities , these are peripheral .
Arguing that advantage is based on system is like arguing that the Special Forces are a deadly fighting unit because of their gear .
Marines can kill with a spoon ; a good analyst can use Google Analytics and Excel to optimize your business .
Sitewide Dashboard Stats Matter .
Pages have different purposes .
Audiences segments have different goals .
Mixing them together dilutes an analyst ’s ability to spot actionable factors .
Knowing the average AMEX bill may be interesting ; knowing your own bill is actionable .
These myths are cutting marketers off from using online measurability to foster accountability for driving new business revenue .
Social media has been desperate for this over the last year — and so are the businesses investing in digital initiatives .
Give your business a competitive advantage , dedicate staff power to gaining analytic insight .
Take a lesson from social media
Do n’t consolidate web analytics tools or expertise to just a few users .
Over the last few months I ’ve established and trained several dozen new internal web analytics users .
Bringing colleagues in to the mix has been empowering for everyone .
Why ?
More people can do the heavy lifting of turning data in to reports , and there are more hypotheses and insights we can turn in to next steps .
More brains and eyes are a winning combination , and we ’re seeing that on a daily basis .
OK , so you want 3D TV , but you do n't want to wear those dorky Timmy Mallett glasses that they gave you in the cinema when you went to see Avatar and Up .
Never fear : tireless engineers have come up with a design that will let you get that three - dimensional experience without face furniture .
( If you want to be showy , it 's an " autostereoscopic " system . )
The principle is the same as those 3D postcards that entertained you as a child , where you tilt them from one side to the other and the picture seems to flip .
That 's known as a " lenticular lens " – officially , an array of magnifying lenses that show different pictures when viewed from different angles .
But where the postcard shows you only one image at a time , the lenses on the 3D TVs already in production from Philips and LG show two distinct images , one for each eye , routed through the lenses ( which act more like slits pointed in particular directions ) .
If you ask a 3D - imaging specialist such as NewSight how it does it , it will say that it has " a proprietary technology with numerous patents throughout the world " .
Fine , but what technology ?
First , you build a standard HDTV ; then you add eight lenticular - style layers on top , which break the image into repeating segments – in effect , four potential points of view for the left eye , and four for the right ( which means you get the 3D effect over a wide field of view ) .
Your eyes pull two of these images together and interpret them as a binocular scene , which means that you perceive it as being 3D .
It 's finicky , though : the lenses have to be aligned precisely over each of the millions of pixels in the screen .
That means you 're not going to be getting them cheap for quite a while .
There 's another catch : some people who have tried the sets over long periods have reported feeling seasick ( and not only while watching A Perfect Storm ) .
This is caused by your brain struggling to cope with changes in focus and orientation as whizzing camerawork is a favourite of directors discovering 3D .
But do n't worry , they 'll surely calm down when the novelty wears off .
Until recently , most tours followed that model : a view of the brewing system , a quick history of the place , a sample or two of whatever is on tap and a T - shirt at the gift counter .
But today , it ’s not just the small craft breweries taking a more hands - on approach .
Jim Koch , president of the Boston Beer Company , which produces the Samuel Adams line of beers , has for years been making an annual trip to Germany to select and harvest hops ( you may have spotted one of those excursions in a Samuel Adams commercial ) .
It occurred to him a few years ago that others would be interested in joining him on his trips  visiting the fields and centuries - old breweries , learning about beer in the place that perfected it .
So last summer , Boston Beer partnered with Abercrombie and Kent to create a weeklong excursion to Bavaria ’s beer country .
The itinerary included visits to various biergartens ; the centuries - old Stanglmair Farm and Hops Field , just north of Munich ; and the Weihenstephan Brewery , which dates back to the year 1040 .
Mr. Koch said that there were no immediate plans to do another such trip , which cost about $ 3,000 a person , but that his company would focus its efforts closer to home , through a partnership with the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston .
In addition to a stay at the hotel , participants will get a private tour of the company ’s Jamaica Plain neighborhood brewery , where one of the brewers  not the usual tour guide  will show off the facilities and lead a tasting in the barrel room , a space usually closed to the public .
Samuel Adams merchandise and a beer dinner with a brewery expert are included .
“ Just like baby boomers adopted wine , their kids are adopting beer , and the parallels are extraordinary and enormous , ” Mr. Koch said .
“ People want a better experience with their beer . ”
Even Anheuser - Bush realized that visitors wanted more .
Two years ago it began offering a $ 25 Beermaster tour that includes a visit to the floor of the bottling line , a beer sample directly from the tanks , and other experiences not included on the free tour , according to Mr. Pitts .
But the craft breweries still offer the most intimate experiences .
The Woodstock Inn began offering weekend packages within a year after opening its brewery in 1995 , both to capitalize on the growing popularity of craft beer and to drum up business during the off season , said the owner , Scott Rice .
Mr. Rice estimated that about 1,500 visitors had attended Woodstock ’s brewery weekends .
Guests can take part in every step of the brewing process  including the messy work of removing hundreds of pounds of processed grain from the “ mash tun , ” where grain and water are mixed .
The early morning brewing leads into a hearty Saturday lunch ( featuring bread made from the spent grain ) ; later , there ’s a five - course dinner and souvenirs .
( Breakfast is included in the cost of the room . )
Caravanner , 61 , prosecuted for having Swiss Army knife in his glove box ... to cut up fruit on picnics
' Stupid law ' : Rodney Knowles , who walks with the aid of a stick , poses with the penknife found in his glove compartment
A disabled caravanner who kept a penknife in his glove compartment to use on picnics has blasted the authorities after being dragged through court for possessing an offensive weapon .
Rodney Knowles , 61 , walks with the aid of a stick and had used the Swiss Army knife to cut up fruit on picnics with his wife .
Knowles yesterday admitted possessing an offensive weapon at Torquay Magistrates Court .
He was given a conditional discharge .
But speaking after the hearing , he said : ' It 's a stupid law .
Now I have a criminal record .'
Prosecutor Philip Sewell told the court that Knowles was stopped by police when he left a pub on February 24 .
He was arrested for suspected drink - driving but a breath test showed he was under the legal limit , the court was told .
But Knowles was charged with possession of the knife , which was found in its pouch in the car glove compartment .
Mr Sewell told the court : ' He told officers that he had the knife for caravanning .
He is not working and had no malicious reason for carrying the blade '
Defence solicitor Jolyon Tuck said Knowles , who is a carer for his wife , had used the knife to cut up fruit on picnics with his wife .
' He accepts it was in his car and the law is very clear , ' he said .
He admits possession of it and he had no good reason for having it . '
Chairman of the bench Robert Horne ordered forfeiture of the knife and £ 40 costs to be paid .
He said : ' There is no previous conviction history whatsoever and it was not in his possession and was in the car glove compartment in a pouch . '
The retired maintenance engineer , from Buckland , Devon , had no criminal record before the case .
He said : ' The tool was in my glove box in a pouch , along with a torch , first aid kit and waterproofs .
' It is everything I need for the maintenance of my car or if I break down .
' Now I have a criminal record for the first time in my life .
I am upset by that .'
Israel has charged five of its citizens , including a retired army general , with operating a nationwide organ trafficking ring that ensnared dozens of potential victims .
The charges include human trafficking for the purpose of organ harvesting and money laundering .
The indictment says that the ring exploited the desperate condition of sick people and called it a " form of modern slavery . "
The traffickers allegedly offered up to $ 100,000 per kidney but in at least two cases did not pay the donors , who were sought through advertisements and then flown from Israel to Europe , South America or Southeast Asia , where the organs were extracted in illegal procedures .
Israeli law bans organ sales .
Actually i had this plan to mumble about the topic of whether " making sure that Palin and the Republicans stay out of power is good enough reason to vote FOR Democrats in general and Barack Obama in particular " .
But while i think that preventing a racist - hateful - ignorant - misanthropic - stuck - in - the - 19th - century party from regaining power - is more than good enough reason to run , not walk , to vote - i decided not to write anything that creates any kind of linkage between the nothingness that is Sarah Palin and the extraordinary that is Barack Obama .
She is a butthead , he is a damn good president , who in my opinion on his way to greatness .
Anyone remember where we 've been 15 months ago - easily the worst situation since FDR days - and see where we are now in every area , domestically and internationally , knows that this man took a ship on the verge of hitting the iceberg , and stirred it away .
And on the way , he materialized some of the biggest dreams of the Democratic party for decades .
So no , i refuse to elevate this woman to a level of being compared to Barack Obama in any way , form or shape .
For me , this is not about keeping her away , this is about keeping him where he is .

Deal reached on Mexican nuclear fuel issue Washington ( CNN ) --
An agreement involving the United States , Canada and Mexico will help convert fuel at Mexico 's nuclear research reactor to a lower grade of uranium unsuitable for nuclear weapons , the White House said Tuesday .
In a statement at the Nuclear Security Summit convened by President Obama , the White House said the highly enriched uranium fuel at the reactor would be converted to low enriched uranium , which would eliminate all highly enriched uranium in Mexico .
The International Atomic Energy Agency will oversee the project , according to the statement .
In the statement , Mexican President Felipe Calderon said the agreement contributes to reducing the risk of nuclear materials such as highly enriched uranium being sold illegally and possibly ending up in the hands of terrorists .
The agreement follows announcements Monday by Ukraine saying it would get rid of its highly enriched uranium and Canada saying it will send highly enriched uranium from an Ontario power plant to the United States to be converted into another form .

U.S. , Russia reach deal on plutonium Washington ( CNN ) --
The United States and Russia signed an update to a 2000 agreement Tuesday intended to eliminate weapons - grade plutonium from their military programs .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov signed the new protocol amending the earlier agreement at the Nuclear Security Summit involving 47 countries .
Clinton said the agreement commits each country to " irreversibly and transparently " dispose of at least 34 metric tons of weapons - grade plutonium .
She said the total amount of material involved is enough for 17,000 nuclear weapons .
Both Clinton and Lavrov said the agreement prevents any future military use of the plutonium .

A very interesting New Yorker article about the significance of the stimulus spending timing and the coming election :
*
.....
Democrats do have an ace in the hole when it comes to keeping the economy moving : last year ’s stimulus bill was back loaded , which means that close to five hundred billion dollars in stimulus money is still to be spent .
That backloading of the bill was good economics : with the Federal Reserve doing less to pump up the economy , an extra half - trillion dollars in fiscal stimulus will help pick up the slack .
It was also good politics , since much of that money will be flooding into the economy during the key second and third quarters .
Republicans in Congress would presumably block any Democratic attempt to pass another major stimulus , both for ideological reasons and because they have no political incentive to see the economy improve ...
... It did n’t guarantee that the economy would be healthy by November , though .
So it ’s still possible that we may see a replay of the 1982 - 84 election cycle , when Republicans lost twenty - six seats in the midterm elections , thanks to a weak economy , but Ronald Reagan won reëlection in a landslide two years later .
This time around , the recovery could come too late to save Democrats in November but still be in time to set Barack Obama up well for reëlection in 2012 .
The economy ’s recent signs of life , coupled with all the stimulus money , give the Democrats a better chance of avoiding that fate .
But economies are n’t machines .
The Democrats will have to spend the next seven months much the way voters will : waiting and hoping that , at long last , things are finally back on track .

You want optimism ?
How about this Robert Shrum piece already comparing president Obama to Ronald Reagen , in terms of transformative presidency ( you should read it all :)
With his 2012 election victory , Barack Obama has secured a progressive hegemony in American politics reminiscent of the conservative one engendered by Ronald Reagan a generation ago .
Both men arrived at their second term landslides following a remarkably similar path ... ... During the 2008 campaign , Obama was assailed for saying , honestly and accurately , that " Ronald Reagan changed America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not .
He put us on a fundamentally different path . "
Obama was n’t endorsing Reagan ’s policies , but acknowledging the transformative impact of his leadership .
Once in the Oval Office , Obama was Reaganesque in his reach , just as Reagan had been Rooseveltian in his ... ... Reagan ’s landslide entrenched an era that lasted for more than a quarter - century .
He had done big things , disdained the polls , weathered the political storms — and come through to a triumph that brought conservatives far more than his second term .
From the other side of the spectrum , Obama has now finished a similar journey , ending the Reagan Era and forging one of the periodic realignments that redefine our politics .
Reagan might not have liked the outcome , but I believe he would have understood it — and perhaps even have admired Ronald Wilson Obama ’s mastery in setting America on " a fundamentally different path . "

Independent senator Nick Xenophon says he will keep challenging the Church of Scientology 's right to be recognised as a religious organisation .
Senator Xenophon said Scientology was a cult and not a religion , adding he would continue to pursue the organisation because former members had become ' victims ' of its practices .
" ... I want to be quick to acknowledge that Scientology is just one organisation in the community that can be rightly described as a cult , " Senator Xenophon told a forum on cults at Brisbane 's Parliament House .
" I heard some of these stories from the people who approached my office to share their experiences with Scientology .
" Since my first speech to the Senate on this subject , I have unfortunately heard many more . "

As Pope Benedict XVI flew to Malta yesterday for his first overseas visit since the eruption of the latest clerical abuse scandal to rock the Roman Catholic church , it emerged that new claims were to be made of a cover - up operation to clear him of responsibility .
A report in the German news magazine Der Spiegel , to be published tomorrow , will say that a former aide was put under " heavy " pressure to take the blame for an abuse scandal in the pope 's former archdiocese of Munich and Freising .
In 1980 , while the then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was archbishop , a priest known to be a paedophile was accepted into the archdiocese and , instead of being given therapy as planned , he was swiftly assigned to parish duties .
After the case was brought to light by the New York Times last month , Benedict 's former vicar - general in Munich , Gerhard Gruber , accepted " full responsibility " for the decision .
According to Der Spiegel , citing sources very close to the 81 - year - old prelate , Gruber received a string of telephone calls in which church officials " begged " him to take the blame .
After he agreed , he was sent a fax containing the statement that he eventually issued , the weekly will say .
The priest , Father Peter Hullermann , went on to commit an offence involving a boy for which he was tried and convicted .
In Spain , meanwhile , it was reported that a cardinal who congratulated a French bishop on not reporting a paedophile abbot said he had cleared his message of congratulations with the late pope , John Paul II .
La Verdad , a newspaper in the southern city of Murcia , said that Cardinal Dario Castrillón Hoyos told a press conference in the city on Friday that he wrote a letter to the bishop " after consulting the pope and showing it to him " .
The cardinal added that the late pontiff " authorised me to send the letter to all the bishops in the world and put it on the internet " .
The pope flew out of Rome after receiving an unexpected and unconditional endorsement from Silvio Berlusconi 's government .
In greetings sent to the pontiff on his 83rd birthday on Friday , the Italian government blamed the scandal on an " unspeakable campaign of slander against the church and the pope " .
The statement was one of several indications that Benedict 's supporters were shifting from defence to attack in their run-up to the fifth anniversary of the start of his papacy tomorrow .
A junior minister at the Italian ministry of culture , Francesco Giro , was joined by six other members of parliament and numerous regional , provincial and local councillors in a special prayer service for the pope yesterday in Rome .
Critics and supporters alike will be watching to see if Benedict uses his visit to Malta to comment on the continuing scandal and meet local abuse victims .
Some 2,000 police and military have been deployed by the government to ensure the pope 's security during his two - day visit to the island where St Paul is believed to have been welcomed after a shipwreck on his way to Rome .
Tradition has it that he landed on Malta 1,950 years ago , and last night Benedict was due to pray at the grotto where , according to tradition , the apostle took refuge .
" Today ’s actions will enable Iranian , Sudanese and Cuban citizens to exercise their most basic rights , ” Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin said in a statement .
The State Department and a handful of lawmakers had pressed for lifting those restrictions on exports of Web services , describing Internet freedoms as key pathways to democratic reforms .
The move is thus likely to win praise from tech groups like Microsoft and Google , which have long campaigned to resume business in those countries .

“ Consistent with the administration ’s deep commitment to the universal rights of all the world 's citizens , the issuance of these general licenses will make it easier for individuals in Iran , Sudan and Cuba to use the Internet to communicate with each other and with the outside world , " Wolin said .
Internet tools have proven exceptionally critical to dissident groups seeking democratic changes in their authoritarian states , according to tech giants including Google .
Most recently , opposition forces in Iran have taken to personal blogs and Twitter accounts to spread word about upcoming anti-government protests .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government has fought back using a host of new Internet regulations — including a total ban on Gmail activity in his state — that threaten citizens ' unfettered access to the Web .
The State Department has long railed against such abuses of Internet freedom , and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton earlier this year called on Iran and other states to permit unimpeded communication online .
But the White House had not taken much formal , substantive action to preserve Web communication in authoritarian states until Monday , even despite increasing congressional pressure on the matter .
The new Treasury policy would grant " general licenses " for Internet communication exports to Iran , Sudan and Cuba , and software exports only to Iran and Sudan , as the State Department requested .

The Cuba licenses will be handled by the Commerce Department , which has jurisdiction over issues regarding the longstanding U.S. - Cuba trade embargo .
Treasury officials assured that the latest changes to its export laws did not mean the department was relaxing its other restrictions on those authoritarian regimes .
“ At the same time as we take these steps , the administration will continue aggressively to enforce existing sanctions and to work with our international partners to increase the pressure on the government of Iran to meet its international obligations , " Wolin said .
The ospreys perched upon the crowns of trees in the RSPB 's Loch Garten reserve are Scottish wildlife tourism 's natural emblems .
They may not be as majestic as the golden eagles that wheel high above Scotland 's glens , or as large as the sea eagles that patrol its shores , but they make themselves available to the public .
Last year some 40,000 visitors came to view them from the Osprey Centre ( rspb.org.uk , boatofgarten.com ) , a handsome pavilion equipped with telescopes , binoculars and interpretive materials .
The project , in the Cairngorms national park , is a textbook example of how a charismatic species can draw people into the diversity of nature .
Abernethy forest , which surrounds the Osprey Centre , is an exquisite mosaic of woodland that includes remnants of the Caledonian pine forest , pools and fens , boughs draped evocatively in lichens and trunks around which red squirrels peek .
Access is good and the site , a few miles from Aviemore , is easily reached .
Even the ospreys ' period of residence ties in neatly with the summer tourist season , ending in August when they depart for their African wintering grounds .
It was particularly obliging of them to choose a location so convenient for spotters when they returned to breed in Scotland in the 1950s , after ospreys were exterminated there earlier in the century .
Scotland 's star species are not always so forgiving .
Wildlife tourism on the north - western fringe of Europe may require time , patience , a philosophical attitude and , in many cases , a boat .
The possibilities are rich : as the wealth of options and projects above shows .
Nothing is guaranteed , though .
There is plenty of space for wildlife to keep out of humans ' way and even on these trips , you will feel lucky to see your targets .
Most elusive of all is Scotland 's wild cat – which may well be set to disappear for good .
In an effort to save it , supporters have defied its resemblance to a domestic tabby and rebranded it the " Highland Tiger " .
Scottish wildlife tourism can be seen as part of a larger movement that is exploring new kinds of relationships with nature in Scotland , the one part of Britain with ample reserves of something like wilderness .
Different strands of this movement share a desire to restore something of Scotland 's natural past , such as native woodland or the beavers that have been released in a trial project in Argyll .
The vision of the Trees for Life charity , based at the new - age eco community of Findhorn on the Moray Firth , is the return of the Caledonian forest that once covered much of the Highlands .
Trees For Life aims to cover 600 square miles west of Inverness with trees – complete with the animals that used to live in the ancient forest , including wild boars , lynx , wolves and even bears .
The forest would not be for people 's benefit , but exist for its own sake .
Their timescale is a couple of centuries or more , the time it takes for a Scots pine to reach maturity .
The Alladale Wilderness Reserve , which opened in 2003 , 30 miles north of Inverness , is in rather more of a hurry .
Its mission is to restore a remote area of the Highlands to its former natural glory .
It has imported a pair of elks to go with its wild boars , and European bison are next on the list .
Alladale has even managed to provoke controversy with its plans to fence off a huge area as an enclosure for animals such as wolves .
There is a debate around whether such a scheme , where land is fenced in , can truly be called a wildlife experience .
Even in this controlled area , animals such as the elk can be somewhat reclusive , but visitors who stay at Alladale will know that they are at least in the same landscape as the animals – and that , in the long run , may increasingly become the point .
Ecologists now argue that isolated reserves are not enough : animals and plants need to be connected by large , resilient networks of habitats in order to flourish .
The more that the climate changes , the more necessary these will become .
Scotland has more space than the rest of Britain for such networks .
And thanks to the Atlantic , its climate is likely to change far less markedly than that of southern Britain , or almost anywhere else in the world .
Whatever happens to the climate , Scottish landscapes are becoming steadily more precious as Britain becomes more and more built up .
People may be happy to know that they are sharing a landscape with wildlife even if they can't see it .
Marek Kohn 's book , Turned Out Nice : How the British Isles Will Change as the World Heats Up , is published in June
LOS ANGELES — Time - traveling neurotic Guy Axiom , more commonly known as " the Man from the Future , " cannot stop living in the past , which to us , in the present , is also the future , but not quite as far into the future as the period Axiom hails from , sources close to the beleaguered 23rd - century scientist reported Monday .
" You 've got to learn to live in the now , not the now that will have been , " Axiom 's friend Joe Busey said in an attempt to console Axiom .
" There 's nothing you can do about things that have n't happened yet but will . "
The cause of Axiom 's worries , his ex-girlfriend Jan Strontium , could not be reached for comment , as she will not be born for another 200 years .

Tomorrow is designated International Women 's Day , and it is a particularly significant milestone this year : the campaign to improve the rights of women was founded a century ago .
To celebrate the occasion , The Independent on Sunday today salutes 100 women who have changed the world for ever and for the better , and who are drawn from all walks of life .
The IoS 's top female minds came together to make their selections ; the only restriction facing them was that the candidates should be British and have made their lasting contribution during the past 100 years .

The fight for the right to vote
The suffragette movement came of age as the 20th century dawned .
The Women 's Social and Political Union – founded by Emmeline Pankhurst – held its inaugural meeting in 1903 and began a campaign of civil disobedience to force government to grant women the right to vote .
What began with women chaining themselves to railings escalated to smashing windows , arson and hunger strikes .
Like many suffragettes , Pankhurst was arrested many times and went on hunger strike herself during which she was subjected to violent force - feeding .
Women fought , and died , for the cause .
In 1913 , suffragette Emily Davison was killed when she threw herself under the King 's horse at the Derby in protest at the government 's refusal to enfranchise women .
The First World War proved to be a turning point .
The campaign of civil disobedience was put on hold while women worked on farms and in armaments factories .
Lloyd George 's government finally gave in in 1918 and allowed women aged over 30 to vote .
But it took another decade to put male and female voters on an equal footing .
Men who helped the drive for equality
George Lansbury , one of the leading figures in the Labour Party in 1910 , along with James Keir Hardie , led the campaign in Parliament for votes for women .
Lansbury later decided to draw attention to the plight of the Women 's Social and Political Union prisoners by resigning from his seat in the Commons and fighting a by - election in favour of votes for women .
Alfred Frankland , an office worker of the Dick , Kerr factory in Preston , was inspired by the young female workers who played football during their dinner breaks while their husbands were fighting in the trenches during the First World War .
It was Mr Frankland who suggested to the women that they form a team and he later went on to manage them , inspiring legions of women to take up the game .
Also during the Great War , the British Women 's Army Auxiliary Corps was formed thanks to the recommendation of Lieutenant - General H Lawson , who said it should be used in France in 1917 .
Playwright and ardent socialist George Bernard Shaw furthered many causes including gaining equal rights for men and women .
Now a standard feature on hospital wards , the ultrasound scan , pioneered by Professor Ian Donald , has for years made pregnancy and labour safer and allowed for the detection and treatment of foetal abnormality .
David Steel 's Private Member 's Bill , which was backed by government , led to the creation of the 1967 Abortion Act.
Lord Steel wanted the act because of the many women who died during illegal back - street abortions .
Willie Hamilton sponsored the Equal Pay for Equal Work Bill in the early 1970s , which stated that women must receive the same pay and conditions of work as their male counterparts .
The legislation introduced in 1988 that led to the ordination of women to the Church of England was moved by Professor David McClean , who was chair of the House of Laity at the time .
When Tony Blair first came to power in 1997 , there were 101 women Labour MPs in Parliament .
At that point in time there had never been so many women in the House , let alone from one party , and there has n't been since .

Judging panel Lisa Markwell , Jane Merrick , Sophie Batterbury , Claudia Pritchard , Emily Dugan .
A former senior National Security Agency official was slammed with a 10 - count indictment Thursday after allegedly leaking top secret information to a reporter at a national newspaper .
Thomas Andrews Drake , 52 , was a high - ranking NSA employee with access to signals intelligence documents when he repeatedly leaked classified information to the unnamed reporter , who ran stories based on the leaks between February 2006 and November 2007 , the indictment alleges .
Fox News is reporting that the journalist was Siobhan Gorman , who worked at the time for the Baltimore Sun and is now a reporter with The Wall Street Journal , which is published by Fox parent corporation News Corp .
According to the indictment , Drake exchanged hundreds of e-mails with the reporter , and the two met in the Washington , D.C. , area half a dozen times .
Drake also researched stories for the journalist , sending e-mail to other NSA employees asking questions , and accessing classified documents to obtain information .
Drake even " reviewed , commented on , and edited drafts , near final and final drafts " of the reporter 's articles , according to the government .
He later allegedly shredded documents and lied about his activity to federal agents investigating the leaks .
Articles Gorman published at the time dealt with the threat of cyberattacks and the NSA 's struggles to modernize its data collection and sifting technology .
A February 2006 article discussed the failure of a $ 300 million NSA project management system and other mission - critical software programs the agency needed to combat terrorism and attacks .
Another article published in May 2006 discussed a collection program called ThinThread that was abandoned in favor of another program called Trailblazer .
Privacy safeguards that were inherent in ThinThread and not in Trailblazer were dropped as a result .
Gorman wrote :
NSA managers did not want to adopt the data - sifting component of ThinThread out of fear that the Trailblazer program would be outperformed and " humiliated , " an intelligence official said .
Without ThinThread 's data - sifting assets , the warrantless surveillance program was left with a sub - par tool for sniffing out information , and that has diminished the quality of its analysis , according to intelligence officials .
Sources say the NSA 's existing system for data - sorting has produced a database clogged with corrupted and useless information .
Gorman attributed information in the articles to anonymous sources and , in at least one article published in March 2007 , said the source was given anonymity because the document discussed was " classified " in nature .
Drake was charged in the U.S. District Court of Maryland with five counts of willfully retaining classified national security documents , as well as obstruction of justice and making false statements to the FBI .
" Our national security demands that the sort of conduct alleged here – violating the government ’s trust by illegally retaining and disclosing classified information – be prosecuted and prosecuted vigorously , " said Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer in a statement .
Drake 's attorney did not immediately return a call for comment .
“ The damage to our national security caused by leaks wo n’t stop until we see a couple of perpetrators in orange jump suits , ” said Senator Kit Bond ( R - Missouri ) , vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , in a press release praising the indictment .
Bond called on the Justice Department to prosecute other whistleblowers , such as Thomas Tamm , whom Bond said should be following Drake to federal court .
Tamm is a former Justice Department prosecutor who revealed in 2008 that he was a source for a story the New York Times broke in December 2005 about the warrantless wiretapping program the NSA was conducting with authorization from the Bush administration .
Drake 's leaking to the Baltimore Sun began around November 2005 , according the the indictment , when a former congressional staffer who had a " close , emotional friendship " with Drake asked him to speak with the reporter , now identified as Gorman .
Drake had provided the congressional staffer with classified and unclassified information while the person worked for Congress , and after the staffer retired in May 2002 .
Drake opened a Hushmail e-mail account to contact Gorman , and volunteered to provide information about the NSA .
Drake instructed the reporter to open her own Hushmail account so they could communicate covertly .
Hushmail is a Canada - based encrypted e-mail service that allows account holders to communicate securely with a client - side Java encryption applet .
But Threat Level previously reported that the company has subverted its own encryption to help U.S. and Canadian authorities gain access to customer e-mail , in response to court orders .
It 's unclear if the FBI used that capability in investigating Drake .
Gorman agreed that information gathered from Drake would be attributed in articles to a " senior intelligence official " and that Drake would never be her only source for information .
Drake worked as a contractor for the NSA in 1991 until August 2001 when he became an employee in the NSA 's Signals Intelligence Directorate as Chief of the Change Leadership and Communications Office .
A year later , he became technical leader in the Directorate of Engineering .
His work focused not on signals intelligence itself , but on developing efficiencies in the agency .
In November 2007 the agency suspended his security clearance , and in April 2008 he resigned in lieu of termination , according to court records .
When government investigators searched Drake 's home computer in November 2007 they found copies of classified documents , including internal NSA e-mails headed " Volume is our Friend , " " Trial and Testing , " " the Collections Sites , " and " What a Success . "
Updated 15:00 to identify the reporter who allegedly worked with Drake .

A Designer Universe ?

3 The same conclusion may be reached in a more subtle way when quantum mechanics is applied to the whole universe .
Through a reinterpretation of earlier work by Stephen Hawking , Sidney Coleman has shown how quantum mechanical effects can lead to a split of the history of the universe ( more precisely , in what is called the wave function of the universe ) into a huge number of separate possibilities , each one corresponding to a different set of fundamental constants .

Biography
by Steven Weinberg I have been asked to comment on whether the universe shows signs of having been designed .
I do n't see how it 's possible to talk about this without having at least some vague idea of what a designer would be like .
Any possible universe could be explained as the work of some sort of designer .
Even a universe that is completely chaotic , without any laws or regularities at all , could be supposed to have been designed by an idiot .
The question that seems to me to be worth answering , and perhaps not impossible to answer , is whether the universe shows signs of having been designed by a deity more or less like those of traditional monotheistic religions -- not necessarily a figure from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel , but at least some sort of personality , some intelligence , who created the universe and has some special concern with life , in particular with human life .
I expect that this is not the idea of a designer held by many here .
You may tell me that you are thinking of something much more abstract , some cosmic spirit of order and harmony , as Einstein did .
You are certainly free to think that way , but then I do n't know why you use words like ' designer ' or ' God , ' except perhaps as a form of protective coloration .
It used to be obvious that the world was designed by some sort of intelligence .
What else could account for fire and rain and lightning and earthquakes ?
Above all , the wonderful abilities of living things seemed to point to a creator who had a special interest in life .
Today we understand most of these things in terms of physical forces acting under impersonal laws .
We do n't yet know the most fundamental laws , and we can't work out all the consequences of the laws we do know .
The human mind remains extraordinarily difficult to understand , but so is the weather .
We can't predict whether it will rain one month from today , but we do know the rules that govern the rain , even though we can't always calculate their consequences .
I see nothing about the human mind any more than about the weather that stands out as beyond the hope of understanding as a consequence of impersonal laws acting over billions of years .
There do not seem to be any exceptions to this natural order , any miracles .
I have the impression that these days most theologians are embarrassed by talk of miracles , but the great monotheistic faiths are founded on miracle stories -- the burning bush , the empty tomb , an angel dictating the Koran to Mohammed - - and some of these faiths teach that miracles continue at the present day .
The evidence for all these miracles seems to me to be considerably weaker than the evidence for cold fusion , and I do n't believe in cold fusion .
Above all , today we understand that even human beings are the result of natural selection acting over millions of years of breeding and eating .
I 'd guess that if we were to see the hand of the designer anywhere , it would be in the fundamental principles , the final laws of nature , the book of rules that govern all natural phenomena .
We do n't know the final laws yet , but as far as we have been able to see , they are utterly impersonal and quite without any special role for life .
There is no life force .
As Richard Feynman has said , when you look at the universe and understand its laws , ' the theory that it is all arranged as a stage for God to watch man 's struggle for good and evil seems inadequate .
'True , when quantum mechanics was new , some physicists thought that it put humans back into the picture , because the principles of quantum mechanics tell us how to calculate the probabilities of various results that might be found by a human observer .
But , starting with the work of Hugh Everett forty years ago , the tendency of physicists who think deeply about these things has been to reformulate quantum mechanics in an entirely objective way , with observers treated just like everything else .
I do n't know if this program has been completely successful yet , but I think it will be .
I have to admit that , even when physicists will have gone as far as they can go , when we have a final theory , we will not have a completely satisfying picture of the world , because we will still be left with the question ' why ? '
Why this theory , rather than some other theory ?
For example , why is the world described by quantum mechanics ?
Quantum mechanics is the one part of our present physics that is likely to survive intact in any future theory , but there is nothing logically inevitable about quantum mechanics ; I can imagine a universe governed by Newtonian mechanics instead .
So there seems to be an irreducible mystery that science will not eliminate .
But religious theories of design have the same problem .
Either you mean something definite by a God , a designer , or you do n't .
If you do n't , then what are we talking about ?
If you do mean something definite by ' God ' or ' design , ' if for instance you believe in a God who is jealous , or loving , or intelligent , or whimsical , then you still must confront the question ' why ? '
A religion may assert that the universe is governed by that sort of God , rather than some other sort of God , and it may offer evidence for this belief , but it cannot explain why this should be so .
In this respect , it seems to me that physics is in a better position to give us a partly satisfying explanation of the world than religion can ever be , because although physicists wo n't be able to explain why the laws of nature are what they are and not something completely different , at least we may be able to explain why they are not slightly different .
For instance , no one has been able to think of a logically consistent alternative to quantum mechanics that is only slightly different .
Once you start trying to make small changes in quantum mechanics , you get into theories with negative probabilities or other logical absurdities .
When you combine quantum mechanics with relativity you increase its logical fragility .
You find that unless you arrange the theory in just the right way you get nonsense , like effects preceding causes , or infinite probabilities .
Religious theories , on the other hand , seem to be infinitely flexible , with nothing to prevent the invention of deities of any conceivable sort .
Now , it does n't settle the matter for me to say that we cannot see the hand of a designer in what we know about the fundamental principles of science .
It might be that , although these principles do not refer explicitly to life , much less human life , they are nevertheless craftily designed to bring it about .
Some physicists have argued that certain constants of nature have values that seem to have been mysteriously fine - tuned to just the values that allow for the possibility of life , in a way that could only be explained by the intervention of a designer with some special concern for life .
I am not impressed with these supposed instances of fine - tuning .
For instance , one of the most frequently quoted examples of fine - tuning has to do with a property of the nucleus of the carbon atom .
The matter left over from the first few minutes of the universe was almost entirely hydrogen and helium , with virtually none of the heavier elements like carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen that seem to be necessary for life .
The heavy elements that we find on earth were built up hundreds of millions of years later in a first generation of stars , and then spewed out into the interstellar gas out of which our solar system eventually formed .
The first step in the sequence of nuclear reactions that created the heavy elements in early stars is usually the formation of a carbon nucleus out of three helium nuclei .
There is a negligible chance of producing a carbon nucleus in its normal state ( the state of lowest energy ) in collisions of three helium nuclei , but it would be possible to produce appreciable amounts of carbon in stars if the carbon nucleus could exist in a radioactive state with an energy roughly 7 million electron volts ( MeV ) above the energy of the normal state , matching the energy of three helium nuclei , but ( for reasons I 'll come to presently ) not more than 7.7 MeV above the normal state .
This radioactive state of a carbon nucleus could be easily formed in stars from three helium nuclei .
After that , there would be no problem in producing ordinary carbon ; the carbon nucleus in its radioactive state would spontaneously emit light and turn into carbon in its normal nonradioactive state , the state found on earth .
The critical point in producing carbon is the existence of a radioactive state that can be produced in collisions of three helium nuclei .
In fact , the carbon nucleus is known experimentally to have just such a radioactive state , with an energy 7.65 MeV above the normal state .
At first sight this may seem like a pretty close call ; the energy of this radioactive state of carbon misses being too high to allow the formation of carbon ( and hence of us ) by only 0.05 MeV , which is less than one percent of 7.65 MeV .
It may appear that the constants of nature on which the properties of all nuclei depend have been carefully fine - tuned to make life possible .
Looked at more closely , the fine - tuning of the constants of nature here does not seem so fine .
We have to consider the reason why the formation of carbon in stars requires the existence of a radioactive state of carbon with an energy not more than 7.7 MeV above the energy of the normal state .
The reason is that the carbon nuclei in this state are actually formed in a two - step process : first , two helium nuclei combine to form the unstable nucleus of a beryllium isotope , beryllium 8 , which occasionally , before it falls apart , captures another helium nucleus , forming a carbon nucleus in its radioactive state , which then decays into normal carbon .
The total energy of the beryllium 8 nucleus and a helium nucleus at rest is 7.4 MeV above the energy of the normal state of the carbon nucleus ; so if the energy of the radioactive state of carbon were more than 7.7 MeV it could only be formed in a collision of a helium nucleus and a beryllium 8 nucleus if the energy of motion of these two nuclei were at least 0.3 MeV -- an energy which is extremely unlikely at the temperatures found in stars .
Thus the crucial thing that affects the production of carbon in stars is not the 7.65 MeV energy of the radioactive state of carbon above its normal state , but the 0.25 MeV energy of the radioactive state , an unstable composite of a beryllium 8 nucleus and a helium nucleus , above the energy of those nuclei at rest .
This energy misses being too high for the production of carbon by a fractional amount of 0.05 MeV / 0.25 MeV , or 20 percent , which is not such a close call after all .
This conclusion about the lessons to be learned from carbon synthesis is somewhat controversial .
In any case , there is one constant whose value does seem remarkably well adjusted in our favor .
It is the energy density of empty space , also known as the cosmological constant .
It could have any value , but from first principles one would guess that this constant should be very large , and could be positive or negative .
If large and positive , the cosmological constant would act as a repulsive force that increases with distance , a force that would prevent matter from clumping together in the early universe , the process that was the first step in forming galaxies and stars and planets and people .
If large and negative the cosmological constant would act as an attractive force increasing with distance , a force that would almost immediately reverse the expansion of the universe and cause it to recollapse , leaving no time for the evolution of life .
In fact , astronomical observations show that the cosmological constant is quite small , very much smaller than would have been guessed from first principles .
It is still too early to tell whether there is some fundamental principle that can explain why the cosmological constant must be this small .
But even if there is no such principle , recent developments in cosmology offer the possibility of an explanation of why the measured values of the cosmological constant and other physical constants are favorable for the appearance of intelligent life .
According to the ' chaotic inflation ' theories of AndrÃ© Linde and others , the expanding cloud of billions of galaxies that we call the big bang may be just one fragment of a much larger universe in which big bangs go off all the time , each one with different values for the fundamental constants .
In any such picture , in which the universe contains many parts with different values for what we call the constants of nature , there would be no difficulty in understanding why these constants take values favorable to intelligent life .
There would be a vast number of big bangs in which the constants of nature take values unfavorable for life , and many fewer where life is possible .
You do n't have to invoke a benevolent designer to explain why we are in one of the parts of the universe where life is possible : in all the other parts of the universe there is no one to raise the question .
If any theory of this general type turns out to be correct , then to conclude that the constants of nature have been fine - tuned by a benevolent designer would be like saying , ' Is n't it wonderful that God put us here on earth , where there 's water and air and the surface gravity and temperature are so comfortable , rather than some horrid place , like Mercury or Pluto ? '
Where else in the solar system other than on earth could we have evolved ?
Reasoning like this is called ' anthropic . '
Sometimes it just amounts to an assertion that the laws of nature are what they are so that we can exist , without further explanation .
This seems to me to be little more than mystical mumbo jumbo .
On the other hand , if there really is a large number of worlds in which some constants take different values , then the anthropic explanation of why in our world they take values favorable for life is just common sense , like explaining why we live on the earth rather than Mercury or Pluto .
The actual value of the cosmological constant , recently measured by observations of the motion of distant supernovas , is about what you would expect from this sort of argument : it is just about small enough so that it does not interfere much with the formation of galaxies .
But we do n't yet know enough about physics to tell whether there are different parts of the universe in which what are usually called the constants of physics really do take different values .
This is not a hopeless question ; we will be able to answer it when we know more about the quantum theory of gravitation than we do now .
It would be evidence for a benevolent designer if life were better than could be expected on other grounds .
To judge this , we should keep in mind that a certain capacity for pleasure would readily have evolved through natural selection , as an incentive to animals who need to eat and breed in order to pass on their genes .
It may not be likely that natural selection on any one planet would produce animals who are fortunate enough to have the leisure and the ability to do science and think abstractly , but our sample of what is produced by evolution is very biased , by the fact that it is only in these fortunate cases that there is anyone thinking about cosmic design .
Astronomers call this a selection effect .
The universe is very large , and perhaps infinite , so it should be no surprise that , among the enormous number of planets that may support only unintelligent life and the still vaster number that cannot support life at all , there is some tiny fraction on which there are living beings who are capable of thinking about the universe , as we are doing here .
A journalist who has been assigned to interview lottery winners may come to feel that some special providence has been at work on their behalf , but he should keep in mind the much larger number of lottery players whom he is not interviewing because they have n't won anything .
Thus , to judge whether our lives show evidence for a benevolent designer , we have not only to ask whether life is better than would be expected in any case from what we know about natural selection , but we need also to take into account the bias introduced by the fact that it is we who are thinking about the problem .
This is a question that you all will have to answer for yourselves .
Being a physicist is no help with questions like this , so I have to speak from my own experience .
My life has been remarkably happy , perhaps in the upper 99.99 percentile of human happiness , but even so , I have seen a mother die painfully of cancer , a father 's personality destroyed by Alzheimer 's disease , and scores of second and third cousins murdered in the Holocaust .
Signs of a benevolent designer are pretty well hidden .
The prevalence of evil and misery has always bothered those who believe in a benevolent and omnipotent God.
Sometimes
God is excused by pointing to the need for free will .
Milton gives
God this argument in Paradise Lost :
It seems a bit unfair to my relatives to be murdered in order to provide an opportunity for free will for Germans , but even putting that aside , how does free will account for cancer ?
Is it an opportunity of free will for tumors ?
I do n't need to argue here that the evil in the world proves that the universe is not designed , but only that there are no signs of benevolence that might have shown the hand of a designer .
But in fact the perception that God can not be benevolent is very old .
Plays by Aeschylus and Euripides make a quite explicit statement that the gods are selfish and cruel , though they expect better behavior from humans .
God in the Old Testament tells us to bash the heads of infidels and demands of us that we be willing to sacrifice our children 's lives at His orders , and the God of traditional Christianity and Islam damns us for eternity if we do not worship him in the right manner .
Is this a nice way to behave ?
I know , I know , we are not supposed to judge God according to human standards , but you see the problem here :
If we are not yet convinced of His existence , and are looking for signs of His benevolence , then what other standards can we use ?
The issues that I have been asked to address here will seem to many to be terribly old - fashioned .
The ' argument from design ' made by the English theologian William Paley is not on most peoples ' minds these days .
The prestige of religion seems today to derive from what people take to be its moral influence , rather than from what they may think has been its success in accounting for what we see in nature .
Conversely , I have to admit that , although I really do n't believe in a cosmic designer , the reason that I am taking the trouble to argue about it is that I think that on balance the moral influence of religion has been awful .
This is much too big a question to be settled here .
On one side , I could point out endless examples of the harm done by religious enthusiasm , through a long history of pogroms , crusades , and jihads .
In our own century it was a Muslim zealot who killed Sadat , a Jewish zealot who killed Rabin , and a Hindu zealot who killed Gandhi .
No one would say that Hitler was a Christian zealot , but it is hard to imagine Nazism taking the form it did without the foundation provided by centuries of Christian anti-Semitism .
On the other side , many admirers of religion would set countless examples of the good done by religion .
For instance , in his recent book Imagined Worlds , the distinguished physicist Freeman Dyson has emphasized the role of religious belief in the suppression of slavery .
I 'd like to comment briefly on this point , not to try to prove anything with one example but just to illustrate what I think about the moral influence of religion .
It is certainly true that the campaign against slavery and the slave trade was greatly strengthened by devout Christians , including the Evangelical layman William Wilberforce in England and the Unitarian minister William Ellery Channing in America .
But Christianity , like other great world religions , lived comfortably with slavery for many centuries , and slavery was endorsed in the New Testament .
So what was different for anti-slavery Christians like Wilberforce and Channing ?
There had been no discovery of new sacred scriptures , and neither Wilberforce nor Channing claimed to have received any supernatural revelations .
Rather , the eighteenth century had seen a widespread increase in rationality and humanitarianism that led others -- for instance , Adam Smith , Jeremy Bentham , and Richard Brinsley Sheridan -- also to oppose slavery , on grounds having nothing to do with religion .
Lord Mansfield , the author of the decision in Somersett 's Case , which ended slavery in England ( though not its colonies ) , was no more than conventionally religious , and his decision did not mention religious arguments .
Although Wilberforce was the instigator of the campaign against the slave trade in the 1790s , this movement had essential support from many in Parliament like Fox and Pitt , who were not known for their piety .
As far as I can tell , the moral tone of religion benefited more from the spirit of the times than the spirit of the times benefited from religion .
Where religion did make a difference , it was more in support of slavery than in opposition to it .
Arguments from scripture were used in Parliament to defend the slave trade .
Frederick Douglass told in his Narrative how his condition as a slave became worse when his master underwent a religious conversion that allowed him to justify slavery as the punishment of the children of Ham .
Mark
Twain described his mother as a genuinely good person , whose soft heart pitied even Satan , but who had no doubt about the legitimacy of slavery , because in years of living in antebellum Missouri she had never heard any sermon opposing slavery , but only countless sermons preaching that slavery was God 's will .
With or without religion , good people can behave well and bad people can do evil ; but for good people to do evil -- that takes religion .
In an e-mail message from the American Association for the Advancement of Science I learned that the aim of this conference is to have a constructive dialogue between science and religion .
I am all in favor of a dialogue between science and religion , but not a constructive dialogue .
One of the great achievements of science has been , if not to make it impossible for intelligent people to be religious , then at least to make it possible for them not to be religious .
We should not retreat from this accomplishment .

E-ELT Site Chosen
World ’s Biggest Eye on the Sky to be Located on Armazones , Chile
On 26 April 2010 , the ESO Council selected Cerro Armazones as the baseline site for the planned 42 - metre European Extremely Large Telescope ( E - ELT ) .
Cerro Armazones is a mountain at an altitude of 3060 metres in the central part of Chile ’s Atacama Desert , some 130 kilometres south of the town of Antofagasta and about 20 kilometres from Cerro Paranal , home of ESO ’s Very Large Telescope .
“ This is an important milestone that allows us to finalise the baseline design of this very ambitious project , which will vastly advance astronomical knowledge , ” says Tim de Zeeuw , ESO ’s Director General .
“ I thank the site selection team for the tremendous work they have done over the past few years . ”
ESO ’s next step is to build a European extremely large optical / infrared telescope ( E - ELT ) with a primary mirror 42 metres in diameter .
The E - ELT will be “ the world ’s biggest eye on the sky ” — the only such telescope in the world .
ESO is drawing up detailed construction plans together with the community .
The E -ELT will address many of the most pressing unsolved questions in astronomy , and may , eventually , revolutionise our perception of the Universe , much as Galileo 's telescope did 400 years ago .
The final go - ahead for construction is expected at the end of 2010 , with the start of operations planned for 2018 .
The decision on the E- ELT site was taken by the ESO Council , which is the governing body of the Organisation composed of representatives of ESO ’s fourteen Member States , and is based on an extensive comparative meteorological investigation , which lasted several years .
The majority of the data collected during the site selection campaigns will be made public in the course of the year 2010 .
Various factors needed to be considered in the site selection process .
Obviously the “ astronomical quality ” of the atmosphere , for instance , the number of clear nights , the amount of water vapour , and the “ stability ” of the atmosphere ( also known as seeing ) played a crucial role .
But other parameters had to be taken into account as well , such as the costs of construction and operations , and the operational and scientific synergy with other major facilities ( VLT / VLTI , VISTA , VST , ALMA and SKA etc ) .
In March 2010 , the ESO Council was provided with a preliminary report with the main conclusions from the E- ELT Site Selection Advisory Committee [ 1 ] .
These conclusions confirmed that all the sites examined in the final shortlist ( Armazones , Ventarrones , Tolonchar and Vizcachas in Chile , and La Palma in Spain ) have very good conditions for astronomical observing , each one with its particular strengths .
The technical report concluded that Cerro Armazones , near Paranal , stands out as the clearly preferred site , because it has the best balance of sky quality for all the factors considered and can be operated in an integrated fashion with ESO ’s Paranal Observatory .
Cerro Armazones and Paranal share the same ideal conditions for astronomical observations .
In particular , over 320 nights are clear per year .
Taking into account the very clear recommendation of the Site Selection Advisory Committee and all other relevant aspects , especially the scientific quality of the site , Council has now endorsed the choice of Cerro Armazones as the E - ELT baseline site [ 2 ] .
“ Adding the transformational scientific capabilities of the E- ELT to the already tremendously powerful integrated VLT observatory guarantees the long - term future of Paranal as the most advanced optical / infrared observatory in the world and further strengthens ESO ’s position as the world - leading organisation for ground - based astronomy , ” says de Zeeuw .
In anticipation of the choice of Cerro Armazones as the future site of the E- ELT and to facilitate and support the project , the Chilean Government has agreed to donate to ESO a substantial tract of land contiguous to ESO ’s Paranal property and containing Armazones in order to ensure the continued protection of the site against all adverse influences , in particular light pollution and mining activities .
Notes
[ 1 ]
The independent E- ELT Site Selection Advisory Committee ( SSAC ) has been analysing results from several possible sites worldwide in great detail .
Similar efforts have been carried out by the Thirty - Meter Telescope ( TMT ) site selection team from the US .
For the sake of efficiency , the sites pre-selected by the TMT team ( all in North and South America ) were not studied by the SSAC , as the TMT team shared their data with the SSAC .
Two of the sites on the SSAC short list , including Armazones , were on the TMT list .
[ 2 ]
The full ESO Council Resolution reads as follow :
Resolution of ESO Council on the Baseline Site for the E-ELT
Recognising
the very clear recommendation from the Site Selection Advisory Committee that the E- ELT should be located on Cerro Armazones in Northern Chile
the considerable scientific synergy that would result between the E- ELT and future facilities in the Southern Hemisphere , most notably ALMA and SKA
the operational and scientific synergies with Paranal that would result
and expressing its warmest appreciation for
the very generous offers from Spain and Chile to host the E-ELT
the very considerable contributions to the quality and depth of the discussion on the siting of the E- ELT made by Chile and Spain in the course of developing their offers ;
Council has concluded that the overriding driver for the decision on the location of the E- ELT should be the scientific quality of the site .
The scientific qualities of Cerro Armazones and the positive impact that locating the E- ELT there will have on the future scientific leadership of ESO are sufficiently compelling to outweigh the very substantial offer made by Spain .
Council has therefore resolved to approve the recommendation of the Director General to adopt Cerro Armazones in Chile as the baseline site for the E - ELT .
Council noted that this decision is essential for the completion of the construction proposal for decision at a later date .

The last time Iceland 's Eyjafjallajokull volcano blew , the eruption lasted more than a year , from December 1821 until January 1823 , reports Sally Sennert , a geologist at the Smithsonian Institution .
" This seems similar to what 's happening now , " she says .
The volcano is erupting small , jagged pieces of rocks , minerals and volcanic glass the size of sand and silt into the atmosphere , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
This volcanic ash can even be as small as 1/25,000th of an inch across .
Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions .
Once in the air , the wind can blow these tiny ash particles tens to thousands of miles away from the volcano .
Life - threatening and costly damages can occur to aircraft that fly through an eruption cloud , reports the geological survey .
" Silica in the ash gets into the engine and heats up and melts , which causes the engines to stop , " says Sennert .
Based on reported damages from ash encounters , the hazard posed to aircraft can extend more than 3,000 miles from an erupting volcano .
( Click here for a map of the ash zone over Europe ) .
Fortunately for the USA , Sennert says the wind direction is such that the ash cloud is traveling east - southeast , toward Europe and away from the USA .
However , as Science Fair noted previously , the Eyjafjallajokull volcano is n't necessarily the main problem .
It 's Katla , Iceland 's noisier neighbor , that 's the concern .
If lava flowing from Eyjafjallajokull melts the glaciers that hold down the top of Katla , then Katla could blow its top , pumping gigantic amounts of ash into the atmosphere .
The potential eruption of Iceland 's volcano Katla could send the world , including the USA , into an extended deep freeze .
" There 's no telling how long the eruptions could last , " says Sennert about the Eyjafjallajokull volcano .
" These explosions could go on for some time . "

Chandler can only imagine what it would be like to feel camaraderie with the thousands who lost everything and had to start from scratch .
WILTON , CT — Michael Chandler looks out the windows of his sun room , past the swimming pool and guest cottage , to the wide backyard where his two children are playing with their pet dalmatian , Scotty .
At a time when Americans everywhere are sharing the struggle of a once - in - a - generation recession , Chandler can't help but wonder how he and his family fell through the cracks .

" It 's just not fair , " said the 49 - year - old real estate developer and grandson of oil baron Duncan Chandler .
" Everyone is worrying about an uncertain future and coming together to express their outrage , and I do n't get to be a part of it . "
Staring out at the ornate garden where workers were installing a large marble fountain , Chandler sighed and added , " It 's like I do n't even exist . "

According to the multimillionaire , the past 18 months have been incredibly difficult to endure , as he is often left feeling excluded from an American populace that includes millions who struggle every day to make ends meet .
Chandler , who watched helplessly as his enormous fortune easily withstood the market freefall , has been " completely left out " of one of this nation 's most significant cultural moments .
" Everybody 's suffering , " Chandler said .
" And here I am , not scrimping and saving at all , with no demoralizing periods of financial hardship , or frantic weeks living paycheck to paycheck .
What about me , you know ?
Where 's my struggle ? "

" Everyone 's supposed to get a fair shake at this misery , " Chandler added .
" Even incredibly wealthy people of privilege like me . "
Throughout the economic downturn , Chandler has tried to tap into the recession and experience some of the sorrow and widespread desperation he has so cruelly been denied .
Sadly , all of his attempts have been thwarted by his seemingly insurmountable stack of riches .

According to longtime financial adviser Ben Schultz , Chandler " constantly " inquires as to whether any of his diversely invested mutual funds are losing money , but is always let down .
" Michael 's portfolio is better than ever , to be honest , " Schultz told reporters .
" In fact , his only real connection to the recession is that he helped to cause it by artificially inflating home prices and making millions off unstable derivatives trading . "

Chandler has been so devastated by his inability to feel the same anguish and hopelessness the rest of the country is enduring that he took the extraordinary step last week of speaking openly with a chauffeur about how hard the recession has been on everyone .
He even went so far as to tip the driver 50 percent less than usual in an attempt to show the man that he , too , was hurting financially .
" I kept waiting for him to say , ' Well , times are tough on all of us , ' or ' Who is n't feeling the pinch these days , eh ? ' " Chandler said .
" But he just seemed really angry . "

Despite his best efforts , Chandler told reporters he knows that someday the crisis uniting so many of his fellow Americans will pass , and that the far - reaching anger will give way to the worship of money that preceded it .
But until then , he admitted , it will hurt to be excluded .
" Every month they announce tens of thousands of layoffs , " Chandler said , " and every time , I 'm not one of them .
No matter what I say or do , it 'll never be me .
My only memory of this historic point in time will be the prosperity I have always known . "

Added Chandler , " Dear God , when 's this recession going to end ? "
So far today you 've probably used your Oyster Card , used your mobile phone , viewed websites , maybe shopped online too .
And all that data is stored , assigned to your profile , and giving a partial snapshot of your life .
Prompted by a letter telling him that his data had been lost in the notorious misplacement of Government data - discs , documentary - maker David Bond decided to take the only logical step , and disappear .
The resultant documentary , Erasing David , interlaces Bond 's attempts to evade capture by two security experts by leaving his heavily pregnant wife and children at home and travelling to the UK countryside and mainland Europe , with investigation into data collection and use .
Think a low budget documentary version of The Conversation , cut with The Bourne Identity .

This division of the subject results in a film of varying quality .
Intriguing ( and worrying ) sequences regarding fingerprints of school - children , CCTV coverage , personal data held by websites and hospitals all provide footage which would be suited to a television - based investigative documentary , and illustrate the breadth and depth of the data collection to which we are all subject , often unknowingly .
However the low - fi chase , which provides the human drama and tension - building narrative is less convincing .
In fact , given that the security experts tracking David barely touch on data - collection , resorting instead to old - fashioned investigating , the nagging doubt arises that this half of the documentary does n't relate to the other .
The process of disappearing from ' the system ' is only briefly touched upon , and as a result the majority of the documentary has a disconnect with the original proposal .
Erasing David is an interesting watch ( although better suited to the smaller screen ) , with prescient points to make about identity and surveillance , but somewhat clouded by a mixed up narrative .

To virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier , nothing less than our culture and highest moral values are at stake thanks to the World Wide Web and certain destructive online behavior it facilitates .
As evidence , he points out that during the 17 years since the Web took off , those who live off their brains — most writers , illustrators and musicians , for example — have experienced a worsening economic situation .
In Lanier 's view , content originators are only the first to feel the pain — their plight eventually will afflict everyone in the middle class , hampering their ability to earn money .
" Since more livelihoods should depend on brainpower as technology gets better , the direction we 're going in is universal impoverishment , " he tells Scientific American .
The disenchanted Lanier presents his views on Web - induced intellectual poverty , weighs in on whether information on the Web should be free ( it should n't , he thinks ) , identifies several more areas of the Web that he believes are deficient , and explores what it means to be a person in the digital age in his new book You Are Not a Gadget : A Manifesto ( Knopf , 2010 ) .
He is hardly a Luddite and is renowned for creating innovative interfaces , including head - mounted displays that extended virtual reality 's use in medicine , physics and neuroscience .
Lanier is still a big fan of the Internet ; it is the way Web technology is designed and being used that dismays him .
Groupthink
Lanier claims ideology and the Web 's design — user interfaces and logins for example — marginalize individuals as " sources of fragments to be exploited by others . "
Of particular concern is " hive thinking , " whereby personal expression counts for little and the creative process is harmed .
Instead , he wrote , the hive mind esteems networked technologies and holds information stored in those networks — often referred to as " the cloud " — in higher regard than the people who create the information .
Lanier worries that valuing the aggregate more than individuals will " leach " people of empathy and humanity .
Lanier , who is also a musician , is , for example , highly critical of " mashups , " montages of borrowed bits of works by musicians , artists and journalists .
Mashers ( the people who create mashups ) ultimately do broad damage because they rarely understand the originators ' intents , according to Lanier ; meanwhile artists can barely survive because they get no residuals for their work .
In this way little original material is created and , consequently , our culture stagnates , Lanier wrote .
" We can make culture and journalism into second - rate activities and spend centuries remixing the detritus of the 1960s and other eras from before individual creativity went out of fashion , " he wrote , " or we can believe in ourselves . "
Metaphorically misspeaking
" Information wants to be free , " the unofficial motto of the free content movement , anthropomorphizes data and leads people to believe the cloud is an intelligent , evolving life - form , even a " superhuman creature , " Lanier argued in his book .
He characterizes " the Singularity " — a hypothesis posed by futurist and author Ray Kurzweil and others that technology will advance to the point that humans and machines essentially become one — as a new religion , and objects to its position that people will become immortal by uploading their thoughts and memories into a computer .
He claims that the Singularity 's adherents and " cybernetic totalists , " who mistakenly apply computer science metaphors to people and reality , have lowered their standards for what counts as intelligence .
When Lanier wrote that " information does n't deserve to be free , " he was emphasizing his counterclaim that information is not something to which human traits such as wants and needs should be attributed .
A staunch defender of the Singularity , Kurzweil insists that he is not underestimating the brain 's capabilities , but rather that Lanier underestimates the amount of progress technology has enabled and will enable people to make .
Kurzweil is satisfied that open - source and proprietary information will continue to coexist .
And he contends that the open commons allows owners of information and intellectual property to license their contributions in different ways , and that people are free to develop their own pricing methods for the content they produce .
" Drive - by anonymity "
But it is hardly progress , Lanier argues , when Web user interfaces allow people to log in with pseudonyms and contribute to " drive - by anonymity . "
That easily devolves into moblike hounding , which in some extreme cases has ended in suicide , as with Korean movie star Choi Jin-sil in 2008 .
Such " trolling is not a string of isolated incidents , " Lanier wrote , " but the status quo in the online world . "
Despite Lanier 's critique , he insists that he ardently believes in technology 's potential to serve people .
He calls for a " new digital humanism " that would honor and reward individual expression .
A critical mass of people must " buy into a reciprocal social contract in which all find mutual benefit from the idea that people can earn money from brainpower , " he tells Scientific American .
His solution is a universal micropayment system that the government would oversee and that would provide access to content at reasonable prices .
( Kurzweil argues that good payment models already exist , so there 's no need for a centralized organization . )
Wiki science
Lanier asserts that science has so far escaped the influence of cybernetic totalists , but this may not last .
His evidence ?
For one , he says , an idea posed by WIRED magazine Editor in Chief Chris Anderson in an article entitled " The End of Theory " that " science should no longer seek theories that scientists can understand , because the digital cloud will understand them anyway . "
( Anderson declined to comment on Lanier 's interpretation . )
Lanier also warns of applying the open , wiki approach to scientific research , which although not dominant now , is fashionable and becoming influential .
Scientists should work with some degree of privacy , according to Lanier , first gathering and analyzing data and asking questions , then getting feedback from peers before publishing .
But some young scientists tell Lanier they intend to start wikilike work groups and expect questions about nature to " just emerge . "
They believe collectivism and the open process inherently add value , but Lanier argues that this cannot lead to creative science .
Great scientists are always unusual and have differentiated points of view , he tells Scientific American , which is why they ask questions others do n't .
" Wikis might be impressive in terms of magnitude and a politically correct process , but they result in the mundane , self - satisfaction and a lessening of ambition — we already have encyclopedias , " Lanier says .
" To stand on the shoulders of giants you have to climb , offer your own unique perspective , be personally expressive .
To be creative , even the driest scientist has to be a bit of an artist .
This is worth a warning , and I 'm trying to nip it in bud . "
Ray of hope
Some of Lanier 's critics say that he is focusing on the negative aspects of how the Web has evolved .
To his point about cyber meanness , Kurzweil says , " This is what happens when you put people together .
You can get the wisdom of crowds , but you can also get lynch mobs when you amplify the lowest common denominator .
Lanier has been emphasizing the latter . "
Kurzweil stresses the democratizing effect of technology , as evidenced by the blogosphere and social networks .
" Overall communal thinking … amplifies human intelligence , getting to the heart of news in a matter of minutes or hours , " he says , citing the role that Facebook and Twitter played in channeling protest information out of Iran following the most recent elections there .
Nevertheless , for Lanier , the " wisdom of the crowd " is like design by committee .
An auction , for example , can determine the value of a car because the answer is a single number , but if the same crowd tries to design the ideal car for a market , no one will be satisfied , he says .
That is because the wisdom of the crowd only works when the choices are simple , he adds .
Appreciating creative expression , introspecting , asking tough questions , contributing original ideas — being more than a gadget , as the title of his book implies — is hard .

The HiRISE team released some new images on Wednesday — one of which was another incredible avalanche image .
But then there was another shot of Gusev Crater , the home of the Spirit rover .
It was a wide shot of the entire region ( you can see it below ) , and visible are the Columbia Hills , and if you look real close you can see the “ Home Plate ” region where Spirit sits .
Our friend Stu Atkinson took a real close look and found Spirit sitting all alone –but very visible in this wonderfully amazing zoom - in closeup !
( Click the image for access to a larger version ) .
Stu also colorized it to show almost intricate detail of Spirit ’s solar panels .
The image was taken on Feb. 15 , 2010 , and she looks great !
She ’s in her current stationary position , and even though this image is from before she went into hibernation , it ’s great to know she ’s still sitting there , waiting for warmer days .
“ Hang in there rover , hang in there … ” Stu said on Twitter , which echoes all our sentiments .
Awww , Spirit … .
Thanks to Stu and HiRISE for keeping our hopes alive !
Stu has also written a few of wonderful items about Spirit : A poem called Spirit Shivering , a great story about someone who maybe could travel to Mars and free Spirit , and a great blog post titled , “ Spirit , Time to Rest . ”
Stu is a very talented writer and image editor , so check out his incredible handiwork !
The $ 5 - 15 adventure modules forare side adventures that add about an hour of gameplay apiece .
BioWare 's vision forwas much more ambitious , though .
It 's a $ 40 expansion pack that continues the main campaign from .
While it 's certainly larger and a better bargain than the modules , it does n't avoid the main problem with downloadable content : more is n't always better .is set some time after the end of .
Your character ( imported fromor new ) travels to the region of Amaranthine to assume command of the Grey Wardens ' fortress there .
The Darkspawn , the monstrous horde that you faced in , are causing problems once again .
You 're tasked with investigating and stopping the new threat while also ruling over Amaranthine .
You discover early on that the Darkspawn have developed the ability to speak since you last encountered them .
This addresses one of the most problematic parts ofstory : it 's tough to make an antagonist compelling if you never get to speak with them .
Mindless monsters just do n't have much personality .
Thing is , the new talking Darkspawn do n't show much personality , either .
The only foot soldiers who can speak are the lieutenants , who tell you ( in their best orc voice ) that the Mother told them to kill you - cue battle .
Eventually you do meet this Mother ( as well as another leader ) and the peek at the Darkspawn society and its command structure are interesting but it 's too little , too late .
The bulk of the campaign is spent traveling from one end of Amaranthine to the next , wiping out packs of mindless beasts .
The enemies stay about the same and so do your friends .
Only one NPC companion returns from ( Oghren , the token drunk dwarf ) but the new recruits fall into the familiar roles :
Anders is a cocky mage , Velanna 's a nature - loving elf , and so on .
The only companion that really stands out is Justice , a spirit trapped in a human body .
He 's the most interesting character in the expansion and one of the few bright spots in the story .
I suspect he 'll end up inas well .
Maybe the reason I like thecast less than 's is because I did n't get a proper chance to know them .
allowed you to sit in camp and talk with party members at length .
In , however , most conversations take place in the field .
When you walk past a statue of a religious figure , your companion chats with you about it .
This means that the characters you get to know more are the ones you actually use in your active party .
I suppose that 's " realistic " but it ignores the fact that you do n't choose party members based on your interest in their character .
You choose them because they fit your strategy preferences .
If you play a Rogue who specialized in ranged weapons , you probably wo n't take Nathaniel because he 's got the same skillset .
BioWare will argue that seeding the character dialogue opportunities throughout the world like Easter Eggs makes the conversations more " active . "
Players had full control inover how much they talked to their party members in camp , though , so the risk of getting bored by this dialogue was low .
The environmental triggers just seem like an attempt to disguise the fact that your companions have less to say .
The main character 's personal story does n't advance much .
If you chose a " Human Noble " origin for your character , it adds an interesting dimension to your dialogue with one of the companions but otherwise , your origin stories are a non-factor .
Your choices from thecampaign have very little weight here .
The person you chose to become ruler of Ferelden will make a cursory appearance in the beginning , if only to confirm that you imported the right save file .
Your romance fromis n't continued and no new love interests await you .
By the end of , you 're pretty much the same guy / girl you were at the start .
While you 're supposed to be the ruler of Vigil 's Keep , you never feel like you 're in charge .
It 's a Captain Kirk situation : you pop into headquarters occasionally but spend most of your time running around on adventures .
Your leadership amounts to a few fetch quests - the guards want new equipment so if you happen to find any iron ore ( or whatever ) , bring it to the armorer .
You 're asked to make a few seemingly big decisions , such as ruling on disputes between subjects , but there are no obvious consequences from these choices .
While letting the player run his own keep is a good idea - it was executed really well in - not enough time is devoted to it here to make it feel like anything more than a collection of subquests .'s plot is structured like 's : you 're given a small number of large missions you can accomplish in any order you choose and once they 're done , you can begin endgame .
Here , you 're investigating a series of darkspawn - related incidents in Amaranthine .
One of my main criticisms ofin my review last fall was that the locations were boring .
Unfortunately the expansion pack continues the trend .
You 'll visit ( in no particular order ) a forest , a hillside , a swamp , a mine , and a dwarven fortress .
The dwarven fortress has a bit of character but ultimately , you 're in the same environments that you saw in the base game .
Most of the enemies you face in these locales are largely the same , too .
There 's a few new critters seeded within the ranks but they 're dressed up versions of the old ones .
The talking Darkspawn lieutenants , for example , look like Skeletor but fight exactly the same as rank - and - file Darkspawn .
The armored ogres are a bit tougher than the unarmored ones but they have similar attacks .
The only foe that really throws a curve ball at you is the Queen of the Black Marsh , a spectral dragon .
Like an MMO boss encounter , the ( optional ) fight against the Queen has different phases so it requires more thought than the standard tank - and - spank encounters .
For the rest of , though , you 'll get by using the same tactics that you used in In fact , you 'll do more than " get by " - you 'll pretty much wipe the floor with every enemy you encounter .
The level cap 's been upped to 35 and there 's plenty of new talents / spells for you to learn and equipment to acquire .
The game throws a whole lot of money at you , too , so you 'll never be short on consumables to turn to the tide .
Your party gets much stronger but the enemies just do n't keep pace .
I remember a lot of lost battles and close calls inbut in , I had maybe four characters die in the entire campaign .
About eight years ago , BioWare released an expansion pack forcalled .
Like , it was a high - level adventure but the difference was thatmade you feel high - level .
It was n't just a simple matter of giving you more hit points or a slightly shinier weapon .
The game made you believe your character was one of the most powerful beings in existence and was fighting against foes who were just as formidable .
In many ways , just fails to do this .
If you simply want more , these extra 15 hours of gameplay might sate you .
If you were expecting this expansion pack to take the franchise to new heights , though , you 're going to be disappointed .

Depuis quelques jours , tous les blogs sont en effervescence à propos d'une " nouvelle " fonctionnalité de Photoshop qui permet de supprimer des éléments d'une images en quelques clics .
On trouve des tonnes d'articles dessus , par exemple chez Korben .
Un exemple ?
Il suffit de détourer le cheval et hop ... disparu .
Ça fait gagner un temps phénoménal par rapport à un long et fastidieux clonage manuel ( technique habituellement utilisée pour ce genre d'opération ) .
Seule opération effectuée : Lancement du filtre Resynthesize ( dans Gimp sous Linux )
après avoir détouré le cheval avec l'outil " lasso " .
Aucune retouche supplémentaire n'a été apportée .
Pas de doute , tout ce buzz doit faire plaisir à Adobe .
Même plus besoin de se faire chier à lancer une campagne de pub , les internautes s'en chargent .
Seul hic : Cette fonctionnalité ( content - aware fill ) , annoncée dans le prochain Photoshop CS5 , est déjà disponible depuis plusieurs années dans Gimp ( comme ça l'a été signalé sur divers blogs ) .
L'auteur a publié son algo il y a 8 ans , et le plugin Resynthesize pour Gimp était déjà dispo avant 2004 .
Donc rien de révolutionnaire , loin de là .
Je ne doute pas une seconde que les gars de chez Adobe aient amélioré et fignolé l'algo ( hé après tout c'est leur " cœur de métier " ) , mais je ne vois pas pourquoi il faudrait payer 1000 € pour pouvoir faire ça .
( Tiens d'ailleurs je vous ai même écrit un guide sur CCM avec des exemples . )
La force du marketting et de l'image de marque , hein ...
Photoshop , c'est le Lacoste de la retouche photo :
En soit , ça ne casse pas une patte à canard , et on en trouve plein d'autres qui font aussi bien pour bien moins cher , mais il y aura toujours des gugus pour se la péter avec la marque ( « Hé moi j'utilise Photoshop ! » ) .
Yeah man !
Comme tu veux , si ça peut te faire plaisir , paie 1000 € pour un logiciel dont tu n'utilisera jamais 50 % des fonctionnalités , ou pirate - le sur les réseaux P2P ( ça fera plaisir aussi à Adobe et à quelques pirates qui pourront réutiliser ta connexion internet ) .
PS : Il semblerait que la version Windows de Resynthesizer donne de très mauvais résultats alors que la version Linux marche à merveilles .
Allez savoir pourquoi ...
Tech Talk PSE home page and downloads
Tech Talk PSE is technical demonstration software which does n’t suck .
It uses Mozilla ’s rendering engine to display slides , so it ’s easy to use ( just write HTML ) and powerful .
And you can intersperse your talk with shell scripts to run demonstrations .
New in version 1.0.0 is a menu that lets you jump straight to different parts of your talk and take screenshots :
Here is a talk I gave at GLLUG using Tech Talk PSE .
I think that Tech Talk PSE may be one of the best programs I ’ve ever written .
Let ’s compare it to “ OpenOffice Impress ” :
OpenOffice Tech Talk PSE
Open source Yes Yes Play videos Yes Yes Open a shell during a talk No Yes Use your own editor No Yes Induces RSI during use Mouse - controlled Keyboard - controlled Lines of code 109 ( approx ) 850 Comes in Platinum edition No Yes
It ’s better than OpenOffice on any measure .
Yet even if you include all the autoconf , documentation and examples , it ’s only 1 kLoC and was written over 3 days in my spare time .
For giving technical demonstrations , it ’s totally “ Right ” , where OpenOffice is basically “ Wrong ” .

DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - DAY
The stands are empty , but there 's plenty happening on the field .
The Miami Dolphins are practicing .
Dan Marino is in top form , hitting pass after pass .
Behind one of the goal posts , the team 's mascot , a rare dolphin ( SNOWFLAKE ) , wearing # 4 , is practicing his routine .
The Trainer is dressed like a quarterback .
TRAINER Blue !
42 ! Blue !
42 ! Hut !
Hut !
Snowflake swims over , snatches a small football out of the Trainer 's hand , and does an end zone dance on his tail .
He then returns the ball to the trainer .
The Trainer now sets the ball on the dolphin's tail and snowflake " kicks " a perfect field goal .
The Trainer blows a whistle and raises both arms .
DISSOLVE TO : EXT .
DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - NIGHT
The stadium is now completely empty .
Snowflake peacefully swims around his tank .
Suddenly , the water is illuminated by the headlights of an n.d. panel truck .
The rear door slides open .
Two men jump out in wet suits .
They slip into the water while a third waits outside the tank .
Snowflake surfaces to check out the action .
One of the men holds out a fish .
Snowflake eagerly takes it , then shudders as a large syringe is stuck into his back .
Snowflake thrashes around .
Quick cut of a hand with the blur of a ring slamming against the tank .
But the needle has done its job .
Snowflake quickly goes limp .
Snowflake is loaded into the back of the truck .
Move in on Snowflake 's face .
His excited cackle has turned into a painful whimper .
The truck skids away passing the guard gate .
The guard is hog tied and gagged , struggling to free himself .

ADELLE'S FRIENDLY PET SHOP - NEXT DAY
Close up on a dead goldfish laying on a newspaper .
We pull back to reveal ADELLE ROSENBERG , the seventy year old owner of a cluttered pet shop .
She 's handing a live goldfish in a bag to JENNIFER , a very sweet nine year old .
ADELLE
Here you go , honey .
Now remember � this kind of fish does n't like it in the freezer .
JENNY
But what 's gonna happen to Dolly ?
ADELLE
Don't worry , I 'll make sure she gets a proper burial .
Jennifer exits .
Adelle calls to her cat , and tosses it the goldfish .
The cat catches it in mid-air .
ADELLE
Rest in peace .
Ace enters the pet shop .
It looks like he slept in his clothes .
ADELLE
Well � here comes another dead fish .
ACE Hi , beautiful .
What time do you get off ?
ADELLE Uh oh.
ACE ( suggestively )
I 've heard some pretty great things about your kibble .
ADELLE
Well , I hope I 'm not getting a reputation .
ACE ( switching to mock anger )
Just get me the food !
She chuckles at Ace as she loads a couple of bags with different kinds of pet food .
ADELLE
So� ahh , when can I expect you to pay your tab ?
ACE I 'm a little bit Sli Pickins , right now , I 'm a little Tight Squeeze Louise , a little Welfare Wolly , Potless Pissing Pete , I 'm ah � ADELLE
If you were a horse I 'd shoot ya ' .
Just take it .
ACE Gravy !
I 'm good for it , Adelle .
I 'm on a very big case right now .
Ace reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a flyer with a picture of a white pigeon .
ACE
See this pigeon ?
It 's a true albino .
Some rich guy lost it .
He 's offering a ten thousand dollar reward .
ADELLE
Wow , albino pigeons are very rare .
How are you going to find him ?
ACE
Just keep my eyes open , and hope to god it does n't snow .
Ace grabs his bags and heads for the door .
ADELLE
You 're a good boy , Ace .
A good boy .
He holds the door open for an elderly gentleman who is entering at the same time .
The gentleman is walking a toy poodle on a leash .
The poodle is dragging its butt along the entire length of the floor .
Ace and Adelle just stare .
ELDERLY MAN ( in a loud voice )
Do you have anything for ringworm ?
EXT .
SURFSIDE APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY
Ace enters the courtyard of a two story U - shaped apartment complex carrying his groceries .
It 's a crappy joint but he calls it home .
Inside an open apartment on the ground floor , the landlord , MR .
SHICKADANCE , sits watching TV , stuffing his face with cheese doodles .
Ace sneaks past the door and up the stairs .
EXT .
SECOND FLOOR - DAY
Ace is just putting the key in the door when the landlord steps up behind him .
Ace is startled by the dreaded ' Shickadance Rasp ' ( not unlike Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST ) .
LANDLORD Venturaaaaa ?
Ace straightens up , but does n't turn around .
ACE Yes , Satan ?
Now Ace turns around in mock surprise .
ACE
Oh , I 'm sorry , sir .
You sounded like someone else .
LANDLORD
Never mind the wise cracks Venturaaa .
You owe me rent !
ACE Mr. Shickadance � I told you , you 're my first priority !
As soon as I find the white pigeon , you 're paid !!
LANDLORD
I heard animals in there Ventura !
I heard 'em again this morning , scratchin ' around .
ACE I never bring my work home with me , sir .
The landlord notices the bags of kibble .
LANDLORD
Oh , yeah ?
What 's all this pet food for ?
ACE ( beat ) Fiber .
The landlord is n't buying it .
ACE
You wanna take a look for yourself ?
Go head .
Ace rattles his keys in the door .
Then he swings it open and turns on the light .
The house is clear .
Ace walks in as the landlord stands there snooping and sniffing the air .
ACE
Well� are you satisfied ?
LANDLORD ( still suspicious )
Yeah , but do n't ever let me catch you with an animal in there , that 's all !
ACE
Okay then .
Take care now .
' Bye 'bye .
The landlord walks away as Ace closes the door .
ACE ( quietly to himself ) LLOOSER .
He then turns to the room and gives a distinct whistle .
CHAOS ENSUES !
Animals jump out from every direction .
Lizards crawl out of drawers , birds fly through the air , all of them gravitating to Ace.
ACE ( to his flock ) Ooshhooboobooboodoodoo !

MIAMI DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - LATER THAT DAY
The very imposing office of BOBBY RIDDLE , owner of the Miami Dolphins .
Riddle , 70 , is a take charge , does n't take crap from anyone type of guy .
He is yelling at ROGER PODACTER , an ex-linebacker in his early sixties , and MELISSA ROBINSON , Podacter 's attractive assistant .
RIDDLE
I just want to know one thing ;
How the hell do you lose a 500 pound fish ?!
Melissa 's about to speak but hesitates .
RIDDLE ( CONT . )
What ?
MELISSA
It 's not a fish , sir .
It 's a mammal .
An angry Riddle stands up .
RIDDLE
Oh , thank you very much , Mrs. Jacque Cousteau !
PODACTER
Bob , she did n't mean anything by it .
RIDDLE calms down a little , and sits .
RIDDLE ( calmer ) Listen , personally , I do n't give a good god damn about a fish .
He looks at Melissa .
She does n't dare say anything .
RIDDLE ( CONT . )
All I care about is winning this Super Bowl !
I want the players ' head in the right place .
Shit , Roger , you 've been in this game long enough , you know how superstitious players are .
Our quarterback 's been putting his socks on backwards since high school .
And I got a lineman who has n't washed his jock in two years because he thinks flies are lucky !
I want that god damn fish on the field Super Bowl Sunday !
FIND THE FISH , OR FIND NEW JOBS !
INT .
HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
An upset Podacter and Melissa walk through the hallway .
PODACTER
Why did it have to happen now ?
I got three stinking years left till retirement .
MELISSA I 've got forty .
PODACTER
I 'll tell you who did it .
It was those goddamn animal rights nuts !
Always out there with their goddamn signs , ANIMALS WERE BORN FREE , STOP TORTURING SNOWFLAKE !
That goddamn fish lives better than they do !
They stop outside Melissa 's office by her secretary 's desk .
MELISSA
The police are checking into the animal rights people .
( to secretary ) Martha , have the police called back about the dolphin yet ?
MARTHA
No , but I wanted to tell you , when I lost my Cuddles , I hired a pet detective .
PODACTER A what ?
MARTHA A pet detective .
MELISSA
Thanks Martha , but we 'd better leave this to professionals .
MARTHA
Well actually , he was quite good .
Pet detection is a very involved , highly scientific process .
CUT TO : EXT .
ROOF OF HOUSE - SAME TIME CLOSE ON ACE - COOING like a pigeon .
Widen to reveal ,
Ace precariously perched on the roof of a two story building .
He is four feet away from " The " pigeon .
Ater a beat , he makes a mad , spastic , yet scientific , lunge for the bird .
ACE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!
The bird makes a clean getaway .
Unable to stop his momentum , Ace flies past the edge of the building and slides down the side of the roof .
EXT .
GROUND - CONTINUOUS ACTION BAM !!!
Ace crashes to the ground .
As he lies face down , in a heap of trash , his beeper goes off .

MELISSA'S OFFICE - DAY Martha enters .
MARTHA Ah� Mr. Ventura to see you .
MELISSA
Okay , send him in .
Martha exits ,
Ace enters .
MELISSA ( CONT . )
Hi , I 'm Melissa Robinson .
Did you have any trouble getting in ?
ACE
No , the guy with the rubber glove was surprisingly gentle .
MELISSA ( apologetically ) Super Bowl week .
Security 's tight .
Mr. Ventura , I 'll get right to the point �
She slips a tape in the VCR and gestures for Ace to sit .
MELISSA
Our mascot was stolen from his tank last night .
Are you familiar with Snowflake ?
The tape shows Snowflake doing a trick .
The trainer , dressed like a quarterback , shouts out signals .
TRAINER ( ON TAPE ) Blue !
42 ! Blue !
42 ! Hut !
Hut !
Snowflake swims over , snatches the small football out of the trainer 's hand , swims the length of the pool , does an end zone dance on his tail , then returns the ball to the trainer .
MELISSA ( O.S. )
We got Snowflake from the Miami Seaquarium .
He 's a rare Bottle Nose Dolphin .
That 's the new trick he was going to do during the half - time show .
While
Ace studies the tape , he chews sunflower seeds in a bird - like fashion , placing the shells in a neat little pile on her desk .
MELISSA
Would you like an ashtray ?
ACE
No , I do n't smoke .
He adds more shells to the pile .
Melissa is already wondering if she has made a mistake .
MELISSA
To be honest , Mr. Ventura .
I 'm pretty skeptical .
Before today , I did n't even know there was such a thing as a pet detective .
ACE
Well , now that you do , you 'll know who to call if your Schnauser ever runs away .
MELISSA
How did you know I have a Schnauser ?
Ace pulls a , invisible - to - the - naked - eye dog hair off here blouse and presents it to her .
ACE
He 's young , about five pounds , black coat , white speckles� ( sniffs the hair ) �likes to chase cars .
MELISSA
Very impressive .
ACE
You should see what I can do with a good stool sample .
MELISSA I can hardly wait .
Look , we 've got a problem .
Can you help me or not ?
ACE ( coy )
Well , sea faring creatures are n't really my expertise �
MELISSA
We 'll give you three thousand dollars on delivery .
Ace immediately becomes the narrator of a nature show .
ACE
The dolphin is a social creature .
Capable of complex communication .
Traveling in large groups or schools � EXT .
PLAYING FIELD - A SHORT TIME LATER The Dolphin players practice .
A crowd of reporters interview Marino .
MARINO
We just choked in 82 .
We had a chance to win it and we did n't .
Nobody 's gonna choke this time , and if they do , I 'll kill 'em .
Ace and Melissa head for Snowflake 's tank .
MELISSA
The police were here this morning .
Apparently , the kidnappers used the back gate .
Ace bends down to look at some tire tracks on the field .
MELISSA ( CONT )
They said some kind of a � ACE Four wheel drive van� loaded from the rear .
Ace sniffs the turf .
Podacter enters nervously .
MELISSA
Oh , hi , Roger .
How are you holding up ?
PODACTER
Well if it looks like I 'm walking funny it 's because I have a bunch on reporters up my ass .
They 've been asking me about Snowflake all day .
Who 's this ?
MELISSA Roger Podacter , meet Ace Ventura .
Ace is our pet detective .
Podacter shakes his hand .
PODACTER
Nice to meet you .
Martha Metz recommended you very highly .
ACE Martha Metz ? Martha Metz .
Oh yeah , the bitch .

ACE Pekinese .
Hyperactive .
Lost in Highland Park area .
She was half dead when I found her .

INT .
DOLPHIN TANK - MOMENTS LATER
While eating sunflower seeds ,
Ace meticulously examines the tank , including the scratches where the hand banged up against the wall when Snowflake was stolen .
All the while , he is singing a bastardized version of the theme from , " Flipper . " ACE � Wonderful Flipper� glorious Flipper� magnificent Flipper �
The flippiest Flipper� Podacter and Melissa , watching from the rim , look at each other like , " What have we gotten ourselves into ? "
Podacter spots something .
PODACTER
Oh , great .
A hoard or reporters are headed their way .
PODACTER ( CONT )
I 'll try to head them off .
MELISSA ( to Ace )
Get out of the tank .
ACE ( still singing ) � Ca n't hear you Flipper , Flipper� Lookin ' for Flipper , gotta find Flipper� MELISSA
I said , get out of the tank !
Now !
The reporters draw closer .
Podacter heads them off .
REPORTER
So where 's Snowflake ?
PODACTER
Ah� Snowflake is just , ah , not available right now .
REPORTER
Come on , I 'm supposed to get a shot of his new trick for the evening news .
REPORTER # 2 What ?
Is he sick ?
Other reporters chime in .
VARIOUS REPORTERS
Did something happen to Snowflake ?!
What 're you hiding ..?!
Melissa and Podacter do n't know what to say .
Then , a strange voice is heard .
ACE / HEINZ ( O.S. ) ( unrecognizable accent )
How cun I be getting dis vork dun mit all da shouting ?
What for is dis shouting ?
REPORTER
Who the hell is that ?
MELISSA

Just yesterday I 'm asking Snowflake� " ee , eee , eee . "
He said , " Eee , eee , eee , eee . "

Ace spits at the reporters ' feet .
Podacter jumps in .
PODACTER Gentlemen , please , Coach Shula 's press conference is just about to begin .
Why do n't I take you over there and let , ah , Heinz , do his job .
He ushers the press away .
MELISSA ( sotto to Ace )
Are you finished , Heinz ?
ACE
Not yet .
Ace goes to the filter outside the tank , opens it , and pours out its contents � mainly leaves , small twigs and gunk .
He roots through it , notices a very tiny amber stone .
He smiles to himself .
ACE Now I 'm finished .
EXT .
METRO POLICE DEPARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY
A flurry of activity in the detective division .
As Ace enters , several cops taunt him on sight , led by the obnoxious , SERGEANT AGUADO .
AGUADO Hey , Ventura !
Make any good collars lately ?
ANOTHER COP
Or were they leashes ?
They all bust up .
Aguado spots a bug on the ground .
AGUADO Uh oh .
( steps on the bug ) Homicide , Ventura !
The cops are falling all over themselves laughing .
AGUADO
How you gonna solve this one ?!
Ace walks up to them and looks at the squashed bug .
ACE Good question , Aguado� first I 'd establish a motive .
In this case the killer saw the size of the bug 's dick , and became insanely jealous .
The other cops all react with a big " ooooooo " .
Aguado has no comeback .
Ace comes face to face with him .
ACE
Then I 'd lose thirty pounds porking his wife .
Aguado suddenly loses it and swings at Ace .
With a lightening move , Ace sidesteps the punch and forces Aguado 's face down next to the dead bug .
ACE
Now kiss and make up .
Ace walks off .
ACE ( to himself ) LLLOOOSER !
Ace walks to the desk of EMILIO ECHAVEZ , a young energetic member of the homicide division .
Ace has a silly impish look on his face .
ACE ( playfully ) I miss you .
EMILIO
It 's not a good time , Ace .
If Einhorn sees me talking to you I 'm gonna be history .
ACE Okay .
Just tell me what you got on Snowflake .
That 's all I need .
EMILIO � I can't say anything .
My hands are tied .
ACE ( effeminate ) Sounds like my kind of a party .
A cop comes to Emilio 's desk .
COP Look alive , Einhorn 's on her way down .
EMILIO
Ace , please ?!
ACE
Just tell me who 's working the case ?
EMILIO Aguado .
ACE Aguado ?!
He 's pimple juice !
He 's the poster child for lead paint chip eaters !
EMILIO Look , Ace .
We 're a little busy with murderers and drug dealers .
A missing dolphin is n't exactly a high priority .
The elevator is getting closer .
EMILIO
Ace , gimme a break will ya ?
Ace nonchalantly sits back in a chair , pops a sunflower seed into his mouth and cracks it loudly .
EMILIO ( quickly )
Okay , okay .
We checked all the local animal rights groups , taxidermists , and we 're running a check through DMV on all recent van rentals .
So far , nada .
ACE
Any unusual bets being made ?
EMILIO
Ace , it 's the Super Bowl , of course there 's bets being made .
ACE
What 'd you find out about the tank ?
EMILIO Nothing weird .
Just the tire tracks and the exit route .
The guard did n't see anything .
ACE
That 's it ?
EMILIO
That 's it .
I swear .
Now please go away !
ACE
You know something ?
( again impish ) YOU'RE NICE !
Ace gets up and exits the room .
Then just as Emilio sighs with relief , Ace pops back in .
ACE
What about crazy Philly fans ?
The elevator bell rings .
Out steps police LT .
LOIS EINHORN , mid 30s , with a slender build , a great pair of legs and a bad tude .
ACE Holy Testicle Tuesday !
EINHORN ( to Emilio )
What the hell is he doing here ?
ACE I came to confess .
I was the second gunman on the grassy knoll .
EINHORN
Spare me the routine , Ventura .
I know you 're working the Snowflake case .
May I suggest you yield to the experts on this one ?
We 'll find the porpoise .
ACE ( mock relief )
Whewww� now I feel better !
Ace turns to go .
ACE ( CONT )
Of course , that might not do any good .
You see , nobody 's missing a porpoise .
It 's a dolphin that 's been taken .
The common Harbor Porpoise has an abrupt snout , pointed teeth , and a triangular thorasic fin , while the Bottlenose Dolphin , or Tursiops Truncatus , has an elongated beak , round , cone - shaped teeth , and a distinctive serrated dorsal appendage .
( beat )
But I 'm sure you already knew that .

That 's what turns me on about you .
Hey� maybe I 'll give you a call sometime , lieutenant .

ACE'S POV
Part of the ceiling is made of metal grating , so you can see the bottom of the dance floor .
A guy 's face gets smashed into the grate .

Melissa rolls her eyes , then taps a huge door knocker .
MELISSA
I swear , if you do anything to embarrass me in front of Camp� ACE
You mean like this ?
Ace starts doing a spastic body convulsion .
Just then a bald - headed butler , who looks a little like Gavin McCloud , opens the door .
Ace does n't notice until Melissa hits him with her purse .
ACE Owwwe !!!
He sees the butler .

He jumps in .
ACE Tom Ace .
Wonderful to meet you , Mr. Camp , and congratualtions on all your success .
You smell terrific .
CAMP
Ah , well , thank you .
Please , come in .
Ace boldly leads the way over to an hors ' oeuvre table .
Melissa closely follows .
MELISSA ( sotto )
This is insane .
There 's no way that Camp stole Snowflake .
ACE ( spreading pate ' on a cracker )
Will you just keep him occupied , while I work my magic please .
She crosses the room .
He puts the cracker in his mouth and begins to crunch .
A man in a tux beside Ace spreads pate ' on his own cracker .
ACE ( with a mouthful , to man ) Smooshy , is n't it ?
Off the stuffy man 's reaction �
INT .
CAMP'S MANSION - SECONDS LATER

ACE
Thanks .
Stuff probably looks better on the way out , huh ?

The ladder leads to a narrow catwalk over the center of the water .
Ace grabs a feeder fish from a pail and walks carefully out there .

He looks into the dark pool , but sees nothing .
Now he stops singing , quietly squats down and dangles the fish over the water .
ACE ( gently ) Snowflake � Here , Snowflake � Snooowflaaaake� A GREAT WHITE LUNGES OUT OF THE WATER AND SNAPS ITS JAWS AN INCH FROM ACE'S FACE !!!

ACE ( screaming ) IT 'S NOT SNOWFLAAAAKE !!!
IT 'S NOT SNOWFLAAAA !!!
INT .
CAMP'S MANSION - LATER
A line is forming outside the bathroom .
Camp and Melissa are seated nearby .
He 's getting curious .
CAMP
Are you sure he 's okay ?
It 's been an awfu ; ;y long time .
MELISSA
Who , Tom ?
Oh , I 'm sure he 's fine .
Ace suddenly opens the bathroom door and stands there , completely drenched from head to toe , with his pants in shreds .
Everyone stops .
They all stare at Ace in amazement .
ACE ( loudly to the entire room ) DO NOT GO IN THERE !
( fanning the air ) Whewww !!
EXT .
CAMP'S MANSION - LATER Ace and Melissa are exiting .
Camp stops in the doorway .
CAMP ( still confused )
I 'm very sorry , Mr. Ace .
I 'll have the pluming checked immediately .
ACE
Be sure that you do .
If I had been drinking out of that toilet , I might have been killed !
Ace shakes Camp 's hand and notices his ring .
He holds on to get a better look .
It 's a very distinct , commemorative ring .
Camp wants his hand back but Ace wo n't let go .
Melissa finally drags
Ace away .
MELISSA
We 'd better go .
Camp looks on and shakes his head .
INT .
MELISSA'S CAR - NIGHT
Ace is thinking .
Melissa is pissed .
MELISSA �Y 'know , I do n't even want to know why your pants are missing !
I do n't care what happened !
You could have cost me my job .
ACE ( on his own wavelength ) I was wrong about Camp .
He 's breaking the law but he 's not our guy .
MELISSA
It 's a sure thing !
It 's definitely him !
Just get me in there !
Let me work my magic !
Ace takes the stone out of his pocket and studies it intensely .
ACE
This is the key .
Right here !
MELISSA
Hiring you was the biggest mistake I ever made !
ACE
So small !
So unnoticeable !
Yet an invaluable piece� of our twisted little jigsaw puzzle !
Melissa stares at Ace like he 's gone crazy .
There is a flash of headlights and a car horn .
Melissa swerves back into her own lane .
Ace drops the stone somewhere on the seat and begins to search for it frantically .
ACE Damn it ! ( to Melissa )
Try to keep it on the road .
INT .
MELISSA'S LIVING ROOM Melissa enters , followed by Ace .
MELISSA
So , you found a pebble in Snowflake 's tank .
Excuse me while I call CNN .
ACE I found it in the filter .
And it 's not a pebble .
It is a rare , triangular cut , orange amber .
Ace hands Melissa the stone and quickly goes to one of her bookcases .
MELISSA
What are you talking about ?
ACE
Tonight I saw the exact same stone in Camp 's ring .
Ace finds a book on the Dolphin team and flips through it .
MELISSA I thought you said he did n't do it .
ACE N. Camp 's clean .
His ring was n't missing a stone .
But whoever was in that tank had a ring just like his .
MELISSA
Wait a second .
What ring ?
Ace hands her the book .
It 's open to a photo of � ACE The 1982 Dolphin AFC Championship ring .
Melissa holds the stone up to the picture .
It 's a perfect match .
ACE I find the ring with the missing stone , I find Snowflake .
MELISSA
How are you gonna do that ?
ACE Simple .
MUSIC UP CUT TO : EXT .
TRACK - DAY
Ace is wheezing and gasping for air as he struggles to jog up beside a large man who 's running around the track at a very fast pace .
When he finally catches up , he awkwardly tries to catch a glimpse of the man 's ring and trips .
The man just keeps going .
INT .
FOOTLOCKER - DAY
Ace sits waiting with one shoe off .
The store manager , an ex-player for the ' 82 team , sets down several shoe boxes .

We see his ring is intact .
Ace waves and drives off .
INT .
MEN'S ROOM
One huge lineman uses a urinal .
Ace , using the urinal next to him , nonchalantly tries to catch a glimpse of the guy 's hands .
The Lineman has a very angry look on his face , but after a beat it changes to a " come on " smile .
CLOSE ON

Ace circles it .
EXT .
TRACK - DAY
Once again we see the large , fast man jogging toward camera .
Suddenly
Ace runs up behind him , with a desperate look on his face , pouring a bottle of chloroform into a cloth .
He leaps onto the man 's back , smothering him with the cloth and holding on for dear life .
The man slowly gives up the fight and collapses .
Ace casually checks the ring , then walks away disappointed .
EXT .
MELISSA'S BACKYARD - EARLY EVENING
Ace sits in a lawn chair depressed .
Melissa consoles him .
MELISSA
Ace , that stone could have come from anywhere .
An earring , a necklace� ACE ( with murder in his eyes )
It came from an ' 82 AFC Championship ring .
MELISSA Lt. Einhorn thinks it was an animal rights group .
Have you heard of FAN ?
ACE Free Animals Now ?
Started in 1982 by Chelsea Gamble , daughter of the famous industrialist , Fischer Gamble ?
Over half a million members from Florida to Finland ? ( beat ) No .
Who are they ?
MELISSA
Did you know that last year they sent threatening letters to 127 college teams , demanding the release of their mascots ?
At last count � ACE
What do you feed your dog ?
We see Melissa 's dog lying near Ace 's feet .
MELISSA
Ah� dog food , why ?
ACE
He 's miserable .
MELISSA
What are you talking about ?
ACE
He 's just very unhappy , I feel sorry for him .
Bad diet , isolated environment .
It 's amazing he 's still alive .
MELISSA
You 're just mad because your stupid pebble theory did n't work out and you do n't know how to express your anger .
ACE Yeah ?
And you 're ugly .
MELISSA I 'm not even gonna ' talk to you , please leave .
ACE
What , so you can beat him ?
Fatty !
MELISSA
You� are unbelievable .
The phone rings inside the house .
Melissa goes to answer it .
MELISSA
Hiring you was a huge mistake !
The door slams and Ace is alone with the dog .
After a moment he reaches down to pet it and we all see that it is one of the happiest dogs in the world .
ACE
You like her , huh ? �
Yeah , she 's alright .
Ace , feeling guilty , walks into the house .
INT .

Ace and Melissa see Roger Podacter 's body taken away in an ambulance .
ACE
You okay ?
Melissa nods bravely .
Emilio joins them .
ACE
What 'd you find ?
EMILIO Podacter , Roger .
Routine suicide .
He was alone .
He 'd been drinking .
No sign of a struggle .
Neighbor heard him scream on the way down .
Just your classic fifteen story swan dive .
Melissa shudders .
Ace gives Emilio a " way to go " look .
EMILIO Sorry .
INT .
HIGHRISE LOBBY - NIGHT
The three enter .
Emilio pushes the button for the elevator .
MELISSA
It just seems so out of character .
He was going to retire in two years .
ACE
Did he leave a note ?
The elevator arrives .
EMILIO No .
That 's nothing unusual .
Some do , some do n't .
He did n't .
The elevator doors close .
INT .
PODACTOR'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
Police are everywhere .
Emilio , Ace and Melissa enter and are immediately approached by one of the officers .
EMILIO Miss Robinson , this is officer Carlson .
CARLSON
Evening , ma'am .
I wonder if you could answer a few questions about the deceased ?
Ace slips away , we follow him as he eavesdrops on conversations .
NEIGHBOR ( to a cop ) I told you , I was across the hall in my apartment , I heard a scream .
The door was locked , so I called the manager �
The Manager reiterates her story to the cop .
The Manager is about 100 years old .
MANAGER
� The place was empty , except for the damn dog in the other room .
Then I opened the balcony door , looked over the railing , and � splat , bang , pancake time �
Ace , continuing his investigation notices � PODACTER'S DESK in perfect order .
Next , he notices police coming in and out of the balcony , closing the door behind them , shutting out the noise .
INT .
PODACTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
A dog is cowering in the corner .
Ace tries to comfort the little guy .
ACE
Hey , fella , have a bad night ?
Ace examines its paws .
Ace then gets down and finds scratches in the door .
TWO FEET interrupt .
Ace stands .
He is face to face with Einhorn .
EINHORN Who let Dr. Doolittle in ?
Emilio steps in immediately .
EMILIO Ah , Lieutenant .
He came with Miss Robinson � EINHORN
This is official police business .
We 'll let you know if the coroner finds any ticks .
Cops snicker .
EMILIO I just thought since Melissa � ACE E , forget it .
She 's right .
Besides , I would n't want someone tracing my steps and pointing out all the mistakes I made .
Ace crosses to� EXT .
PODACTER'S BALCONY - CONT
Ace examines the area .
Einhorn is in hot pursuit .
EINHORN
Oh , so , you do n't think this in an obvious suicide , Mr. Pet Detective ?
ACE
Well , I would n't say that .
Lord knows , there is plenty of evidence here to support your theory , except of course that spot of blood on the balcony .
On the railing , sure enough , there is a tiny spot of blood .
Einhorn glares at a couple of nearby cops .
They look down .
ACE May I tell you what I think happened ?
Alrighty then !
Ace moves as he talks .
ACE Roger Podacter went out after work .
He had a few drinks , and he came home .
But he was n't alone .
Someone was with him in this apartment .
There was a struggle , and then Roger Podacter was thrown over that balcony .
Roger Podacter did n't commit suicide .
He was murdered .
A beat as everyone considers this .
EINHORN
Well , that 's a very entertaining story , but real detectives have to worry about that little thing lawyers call evidence .
Ace picks up a lottery ticket on Podacter 's desk and becomes a condescending kid show host .
ACE
Let 's take a trip to clue corner , shall we ?
Can anyone tell me why a man buys a lottery ticket on the day he is going to commit suicide ?
Or why the family pet , suffering from acute canine trauma , clawed at the bedroom door until his paws bled ?
How about the blood on the railing ?
I 'll bet if we put our thinking caps on we 'll see that it was the result of the struggle that took place inside this apartment while Mr. Podacter was still alive !
( singing ) NEXT TIME YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE COME ON BACK TO CLUE CORNER !
BOOP !
Everyone looks to Einhorn .
EINHORN
Not a bad try for a pet detective , but not near conclusive enough for us real investigators .
( beat )
First , people buy lottery tickets everyday .
It 's a habit .
It does n't prove a thing .
Second , the dog was n't suffering from canine trauma , he was suffering from bladder trauma .
Sergeant Neilson found a piss stain as big as Lake Huron near the bed .
And third , the blood on the railing .
Simple .
He does n't jump far enough and whacks his head .
A fact confirmed by the paramedics who found cuts on his scalp , with traces of a white chalky substance .
i.e. plaster from the balcony .
Einhorn shows
Ace the paramedics report .
Everyone is impressed with Einhorn .
EINHORN
So much for your murder , Ventura .
AGUADO
Uh oh , I think I heard a toilet flush .
Maybe someone lost their turtle ?
Everyone has a laugh .
Ace looks beaten .
ACE
Well , maybe I 'm just a little out of my league , here .
Einhorn �
Ace holds out his hand , Einhorn shakes it .
ACE �good work .
Ace and Melissa head for the door .
ACE
Oh , there is just one more thing , Lieutenant .
( re : the neighbor ) This man is Roger Podacter 's neighbor .
He lives across the hall .
He said he heard a scream , is that right , sir ?
The neighbor nods .
Ace turns to the apartment manager .
ACE
And you said you had to open the balcony door when you keyed into the room ?
MANAGER
That 's right .
Ace walks out onto the balcony and turns , facing them .
ACE
You 're certain you had to open this door ?
She nods .
EINHORN
What 's the point , Ventura ?
ACE
Only this �
AAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW �
Ace sustains an incredible Pavorati note , while he repeatedly opens and closes the glass door between them .
When the door is closed nothing can be heard .
ACE ( tapping the door )
This is double paned , sound - proofed glass .
There 's no way this neighbor could have heard Podacter scream on the way down with this door shut .
The scream he heard came from inside this apartment , before Podacter was thrown over the railing !
And the muderer closed the door before he left !
( celebrates insanely ) Yes !
Yesss !
I have exorcised the demons ! ( a la Poltergeist )
This house is clear .

ACE'S CAR - A SHORT TIME LATER

MELISSA
You checked all the rings .
ACE I know , Pessimistress .
Could anyone else have gotten a ring that year ?
MELISSA No. Camp was the only honoree .
Just players and coaches .
Everyone in the photo .

Melissa is starting to warm to him .
MELISSA
That was pretty impressive , what you did back at the apartment .
ACE ( still looking )
You do n't have to tell me .
I was there .
MELISSA
Maybe you should have joined the police force� become a real detective .
ACE ( shaking his head ) I do n't do humans .
Melissa gets a bit closer .
MELISSA
You really love animals , do n't you ?
Ace stops searching and looks into her eyes .
ACE I feel a kinship with them .
I understand them .
Wanna hear something kinda spooky ?
MELISSA Sure .
She gets closer still .
ACE
One time , when I was about twelve , I had this dream that I was being followed by a dog with rabies .
He had these really bloodshot eyes and foam coming out of his mouth � and just before I got to my front door � he jumped on me and sunk his teeth in .
Then I woke up , and felt the back of my neck� check this out .
Ace motions for Melissa to feel the back of his neck , but when she does , he snaps at her hand , barking like a vicious dog .
ACE ARARAR !!!
Melissa jumps out of her skin .
MELISSA
Ohhh !!
You bastard !
ACE ( snickering ) I 'm sorry .
I could n't stop myself .
Are these all the receipts ?
MELISSA ( mildly annoyed ) I do n't know .
ACE
There 's only a dozen of them here .
Ace turns from the file cabinet with a hopeless look on his face .
Melissa begins to clean up his mess .
MELISSA ( pointedly )
Gee� maybe they were misplaced because somebody did n't put the files back when he was �
ACE
Who the hell is that ?
MELISSA
What �
Ace crosses to a big picture of the ' 82 team that hangs on the aadjacent wall and points out a player .
ACE
That !
Who the hell is that ?!
He quickly pulls out his crossed out pictures of the team and begins to compare the two .
MELISSA
Oh , that 's Ray Finkle� the kicker .
Do n't you know who Ray Finkle is ?
ACE No !
How come he 's not in this picture ?!
Melissa checks
Ace 's photo .
MELISSA
This was the picture you were using ?
This was taken earlier in the year .
Finkle was n't added to the roster till mid-season .
She starts to realize what Ace has already figured out .

Cost the Dolphins the game .

Poor guy .
ACE
Poor guy with a motive , baby .
Where is he now ?
MELISSA
Last I heard , he went back to his home town , Collier County .
He used to work in a bar up there .
ACE ( pondering ) REHEHEALLY .
MELISSA
Can you drop me off before you go ?
ACE ( shaking his head )
No way .
It may not be safe at your apartment , and you should n't be left alone .
MELISSA
What do you suggest ?
CUT TO : INT .

SKIN , SWEAT , SHEETS FLY , as Ace and Melissa roll back and forth on the bed .
Ace is taking no prisoners .
CUT TO : 50 animals at the bottom of the bed , with eyes as big as silver dollars , watching them silently .
We cut back and forth between furious lovemaking and shots of staring animals .
Melissa and Ace simultaneously reach the pinnacle of pleasure .

They 're still buggin ' us to pick up his stuff .
Mrs. Finkle returns with a plate of football shaped cookies .
MRS . FINKLE ( sweetly )
It was all that Dan Marino 's fault , everyone knows that .
If he had held the ball laces out , like you 're supposed to , Ray would never have missed that kick .
Dan Marino should die of Gonorrhea and rot in Hell .
Would you like a cookie , son ?
Ace takes a cookie .

The area of the sheet that covers the face is a giant red spot .
We widen to see them load good old Mr. Bilbo into an ambulance and drive away , ringing the station bell one more time .
Ace does n't notice .

Ah , he had practice .
Then� he has a commercial shoot out at the Prescott Sound Stage .
ACE
Where is that ?

Okay , that 's about fifteen miles from me .

Ace 's prized WHITE PIGEON lands on the car door right beside him .
Ace cracks his eyes and sees the bird .
Then , with a sudden quick lunge he successfully traps it in his hands , and forgets all about Marino .
ACE I did it !

I caught the white pigeon !
I caught the white pigeon !
Ace jumps out of his car and starts skipping around the park with the pigeon held high over his head .
He looks insane .

Ace slows down and begins to look around warily .
There are now an unusual number of birds perched on the telephone wires around the park and on the monkey bars , and on the swings .
The sky grows darker .
He slowly turns and tries to get back to the car .
All the birds take flight .
Ace sets the white pigeon free and starts to run , but it 's too late .
The birds are on him .
Pecking , and gouging , and ripping his flesh .

Lieutenant , have there been any ransom demands ?
EINHORN
There 's been no communication with the kidnappers at this time .
REPORTER #2
What 's going to happen to the Super Bowl ?
Will it be postponed ?
EINHORN
As of now , the game is going on as scheduled .
REPORTER #3
Why was n't the public told about Snowflake 's kidnapping ?
EINHORN Secrecy was essential .
We did n't want any public interference .
REPORTER
Are the crimes related ?
And what about Roger Podacter 's murder ?
EINHORN I 'm sorry .
I can't comment any further .
Now if you 'll excuse me .
Einhorn pushes her way through the crowd of reporters .
INT .

Einhorn walks to her private bathroom .
EINHORN Ventura , when I get out of this bathroom , you better be gone .
ACE
Is it number one or number two ?
Einhorn turns and glares at Ace .
ACE I just want to know how much time I have .
Einhorn goes to the sink and begins washing her hands .
ACE
Oh , by the way , I went ahead and solved that pesky , Snowflake / Podacter / Marino thing .
EINHORN ( O.S. ) ( humoring him )
Oh yeah ?
ACE yeah , ever hear of a former Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle ?
The water shuts off .
Einhorn appears around the corner .
EINHORN Alright , Ventura .
Make it quick .
ACE I found a rare stone at the bottom of Snowflake 's tank .
It 's from a Dolphin ' 82 AFC Championship ring .
It would have been a Super Bowl ring , but Ray Finkle missed the big kick .
Blames the whole thing on Marino .
We 're talking paranoid , delusional psychosis .
I saw the guy 's room �
Cozy , if you 're Hannibal Lector .
EINHORN
So how does Roger Podacter fit in ?
ACE
My guess is Finkle was snooping around .
Podacter recognized him .
End of story .
As for Snowflake � they gave him Finkle 's number , and taught him how to kick a field goal .
Finkle took it personally .
Einhorn listens with great interest .
EINHORN
So where is Finkle , now ?
ACE
He broke out of a metal hospital .
Did a Claude Raines .
He 's been planning his revenge for years .
Waiting for the perfect time to get back at the Dolphins .
The time when it would hurt them the most .
Super Bowl time !
Man , I 'm tired of being right !
Einhorn walks in front and sits on the edge of the desk .
She 's totally softened her demeanor .
EINHORN Congratulations .
You 've done some fine detective work , Ace .
ACE
Ahh , could you talk in my good ear .
I thought I heard you call me Ace .
Einhorn gets real close .
EINHORN
Maybe I was wrong about you .
Maybe you are more than just a pet dick .
SHE SUDDENLY PLANTS A MAJOR , TONSIL CLEANING , OPEN MOUTHED KISS ON ACE .
Objects are knocked off the desk as they lean back .
ACE
Your gun 's digging into my hip .
More kissing , the Ace stops .
EINHORN ( still coming on )
What 's wrong , Ace ?
Want me to read you your rights ?
ACE Maybe later .
EINHORN
What is it ?
That bony little bitch , Melissa Robinson ?
ACE ( defensive ) No .
You just do n't do anything for me .
He quickly adjusts his crotch , to conceal the erection .
Einhorn withdraws with a coy smile .
EINHORN
I 'll be here if you ever want a real woman .
There 's a sharp KNOCK at the door .
EINHORN
What is it ?
Aguado opens the door .
AGUADO Everything okay in here ?
Heard some commotion .
EINHORN Fine , Sergeant .
AGUADO
You want me to throw him out ?
EINHORN
Why do n't you throw yourself out .
AGUADO � Yes , ma'am .
A crestfallen Aguado exits .
Ace heads for the door .
EINHORN
Ace , I want you to leave everything to us .
ACE Can't do that , Lieutenant .
I was hired to find Snowflake .
EINHORN

I gotta watch this band !
They are the shit !
ACE
Are they ?
WOODSTOCK
Are n't they ?
ACE Alright then .
Do n't worry about it .
I mean dolphins are n't exactly an endangered species .
It 's not like the whole food chain 's gonna be affected if one highly intelligent mammal dies a slow and painful death !
Hell , if the band is loud enough , you wo n't even hear its pitiful whimpering !!
Ace does his best suffering dolphin impression .
Woodstock is no longer enjoying the band .

We know he 's incredibly thrifty .
WOODSTOCK
Is he ?
ACE Is n't he ?
Woodstock types in more information .
Finkle 's TRW flashes on the screen .
WOODSTOCK
Well , I think we can be pretty sure he 's involved in the kidnapping of the dolphin .
ACE Really ?
What makes you say that ?
WOODSTOCK
There 's two - thousand dollars worth of smelts on his VISA card .
After a beat
Ace realizes it was a bad joke .
ACE
Please yank me no further .
I beg of you .
WOODSTOCK Alright already .
The last time this guy used his credit card was June , ' 84 .
He rented a car from Avis .
And� eww � he was a bad boy .
They found it abandoned two months later in South Miami .
ACE
Anything else ?
WOODSTOCK Nope .
ACE
Well � you did all you could .

TEA ROOM - NIGHT
Ace emerges from the basement .
The band is between songs .
Ace strolls by the burnout whose head has now stopped .
ACE ( to burnout )
Did you get all the spiders outta there ?
Ace heads out , then freezes .
The two thugs that took Marino are standing at the exit .
Then they see Ace and start towards him , reaching inside their coats .
Suddenly the music starts .
The burnout 's head wails again .
His manic gyrations interfere with the thugs long enough for Ace to bolt .
One of the thugs pushes the burnout violently against the wall as they pursue Ace .
BURNOUT ( calling , as he gets up )
Thanks , man !
You 're a great dancer !
Ace pushes his way through the crowd .
The thugs follow .
Ace nears the stage .
It 's wild .
People are diving off and getting moshed .
Before the thugs grab him , Ace runs up and throws himself from the stage .
The insane crowd begins to pass him around over their heads .
The thugs exchange a look , then dive after Ace , and a " mosh " chase ensues .
Ace is passed back onto the stage as the song comes to an end .
The singer is lying there exhausted .
Ace sees the crowd starting to put the thugs down , so he quickly grabs the microphone off the floor .
ACE ( screams ) ONE , TWO , THREE , FOUR , SPANK ME MOMMY !!!
The audience looks at Ace for a second .
Then the band members exchange a look and go for it !!
It 's a nightmarish little ditty .
Ace sings like one of Satan 's minions .
ACE URGHHUURRAAAW !
ARGHUURRRREEEW !
The crowd seems to understand .
They throw the thugs high in the air again and mosh them away from the stage .
The Thugs are shooting stray bullets the whole time .
Ace incites the crowd , even more now , with a punching gesture .
The crowd follows their new leader , punching with one hand , moshing with the other .
The thugs get the living crap " moshed " out of them .
When the song ends ,
Ace raises fists in the air .
The cheering crowd violently drops the thugs .
They 're out cold .

Die -Dan potholders , shredded Isotoner gloves .
He opens a little diary .

Marino is tied to a football tackling sled .
The two thugs take turns running into Dan with their shoulders , driving him back five feet each time .
JOHN MADDEN ( ON TV )
� But the real story of this game is the absence of Dan Marino .
Him being kidnapped and all has got to be a strain on this Miami team .

I mean , it 's hard enough enduring the pressure of the Super Bowl , without your star quarterback gettin ' himself kidnapped .
This is the whole ball of wax , folks !

I 'll be right back , Daaaan !!
She goes .
Dan struggles , but to no avail .
MARINO
Look , I do n't know how much psycho woman is paying you guys , but I can double it .
VINNIE Sorry , Danny boy .
Psycho woman keeps us out of prison .
Vinnie grabs a feeder fish and entices Snowflake to the surface .
Roc raises a football .
ROC
Hey , Marino , check it out .
I 'm throwin ' passes to a Dolphin !
He chucks the ball and hits Snowflake , hard .
The thugs both laugh hysterically .
Snowflake makes an angry leap and drenches the thugs .
Snowflake laughs now , the thugs are furious .
VINNIE
Get some more fish !

BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUS
Roc walks behind a big piece of machinery , reaches down for the pail of smelts , but sees nothing .
ROC
Where the hell 's the smelts ?
He stands up straight and we all hear that familiar " Pop " of a sunflower seed being cracked open .
Roc 's eyes widen .
He turns and sees �
Ace coyly smiles at him , blows the sunflower seed shells into his face and CLANG !
He whacks Roc in the head with a pail full of fish .
ACE ( doing Brando )
He sleeps with the fishes .

Hey Roc , what the hell was that ?
Vinnie cocks his gun and goes to check out the sound .
INT .
BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUS
Vinnie rounds the corner and sees nothing .
He walks a little further and notices a trail of smelts lined up on the ground .
He follows the trail around a corner and we see Roc , unconscious but moaning .
He is sitting against the ground , with his legs spread apart and the pail over his head .
The trail of smelts leads to his crotch .
There is one halfway into his zipper , with its tail flipping .
Vinnie takes in this sight , then rushes over to Roc and stands him up .
VINNIE
Hey man !
What happened ?
What 's goin on� ?
We see Ace at the top of a giant machine .
He is aiming a 200 pound steel hook , that hangs on a chain from the ceiling .
ACE
Guess what , boys , it 's nap time .
Ace gently releases the hook .
Just as Vinnie and Roc turn to look , the iron hook shears both of their heads clean off .
Two headless bodies fall to the ground in slow motion with blood gushing from their necks .
CLOSE ON ACE - HORRIFIED ACE Hooooly Shiiit !
Oh my god !
I did n't mean to - Oh man !!!
Ace holds his head and dances around , completely freaking out what he had done .
ACE ( looking to God ) Lord , I swear !
I just wanted to knock them out !
Ace abruptly stops to think .
ACE
Is that murder ?
I do n't know .
They were gonna kill me .
But they did n't �
But they tried .
That 's self defense .
That 's it !!
I have nothing to worry about !!
CUT TO : Ace nervously whistling as he wipes his fingerprints off the hook .

IRONWORKS FACTORY - FACTORY
Ace checks on Snowflake then goes to Marino .
He signals for Dan to keep quiet , then starts to untie him .
MARINO ( whispers )
Who are you ?
ACE ( whispers ) Ace Ventura .
Pet detective .
I 've been sent in with a special play .
( whispers ) Quarterback sneak .
WE HEAR THE CLICK OF A GUN .
EINHORN ( O.S. )
Penalty .
Too many men on the field .
Ace turns .
Einhorn 's holding a gun on them from the other side of Snowflake 's tank .
EINHORN ( CON'T ) I warned you , Ventura .
ACE
What happened to " Ace " ?
EINHORN
Good question .
She pulls out a cellular phone and dials .
ACE
Be careful with that phone , lieutenant .
I would n't want you to get a tumor .
EINHORN ( into phone ) Sergeant Aguado , it 's Lt. Einhorn .
Get some men over to the old ironworks factory on Victoria Road .
I 've got the kidnapper trapped in the warehouse .
It 's Ace Ventura .
He 's killed Marino and Snowflake .
Einhorn smiles as she puts the phone away .
EINHORN Vinnie ! Roc !
Get in here !
Ace gets a very guilty look .
ACE
What ?
Who are they ?
You mean there 's other people here ?

IRONWORKS FACTORY - DAY
Einhorn cocks her gun .
Ace 's face is glistening with tears .
He 's a complete wreck .
ACE
Do n't kill meeee !!
Pleeheeheeheeheeeezzz !!!
I 'll never tell anyone !
I swear !
( indicating Marino )
He 's the one you want !!
Kill him !!
MARINO ( indicating Ace )
No� kill him !
The two argue .
Einhorn fires a shot in the air to stop them .
EINHORN
No , I 'm gonna kill the dolphin first .
( to Ace ) I would n't want you to miss that .
Einhorn walks to the edge of the tank .
She aims the gun at Snowflake and FIRES !
We see the bullet miss Snowflake under water .
Snowflake swims wildly .
She FIRES again !
Misses again .
Suddenly , Ace HOLLERS !
ACE
Blue forty - two !!
Einhorn turns to Ace. EINHORN SHUT UP !!
ACE BLUE FORTY - TWO !
Einhorn shoots at Ace !
He dives out of the way .
ACE HUT !
HUT !
Suddenly , Snowflake leaps out of the water and takes the gun out of Einhorn 's hand , like the trick we saw earlier .
Snowflake swims around the pool with the gun in his mouth .
ACE ( smug ) Yes .
The highly trained dolphin .
Perhaps the smartest mammal in the animal kingdom .
See how he knew exactly what I wanted him to do , as if our minds were somehow in complete synchronization .
They have been know to save men at sea you know .
They have their own language .
( to Snowflake ) Snowflake .
Come here , Snowflake !
Bring me the gun !
( makes dolphin sounds ) EEEEEE !
EEEEEE ! EEEEEE !
Just like the trick in his routine , however , Snowflake swims around the tank , passes Ace , then hands the gun back to Einhorn .
He finishes with a tail walk .
ACE ( under his breath ) Stupid fish .
ON TV : Miami's kicker boots a perfect field goal from fifty yards .
JOHN MADDEN
He got all of his leg into that one !
The field goal kicker is hugged by his teammates .
ACE
Good to see someone who does n't buckle under the pressure ?
MARINO
Yeah , not like in 82 when we choked �
Einhorn walks to Ace and puts the gun against his head .
EINHORN
What would you know about pressure ?
ACE
Well , I 've kissed a man .
JOHN MADDEN ( ON TV )
Of course , there 's never been a more crucial kick than the famous " Kick heard ' round the world � "
The famous footage airs on TV .
They all turn to watch .
JOHN MADDEN �I mean , it 's clear to me that it was a good hold .
Finkle just booted it .
EINHORN
The laces were n't out .
THE LACES WEREN'T OUT !!
Einhorn takes a shot at the screen , creating a hole in Madden 's forehead .
Ace uses the moment to smack the gun out of her hand .
A HUGE , NO - HOLDS - BARRED FIGHT ensues .
Ace and Einhorn punch each other about the face and stomach .
Einhorn throws a punch at Ace .
Ace goes down .
Einhorn goes for the loose gun .
Ace leaps and tackles her .
They both crash into old rusty equipment , raising a mountain of dust .
Marino struggles all the while trying to get free .
Einhorn kicks Ace .
He flies into Marino .
MARINO
Having a little trouble with the lady , Ace ?
ACE ( out of breath )
You do n't understand , she 's a � Einhorn grabs
Ace , throws him into a head lock and begins wailing on his face .
Meanwhile , cops start arriving , SWAT team members disperse onto the catwalk as the fight continues .
They try but can't get a bead on Ace as the two roll around on the floor .
More punches .
They fight up a flight of stairs , then back down .
To the amazement of the SWAT team , Ace and Einhorn slug it out as equals .
AGUADO ( caught up )
Get him , Lois !
Now they crash through a plate glass window together .
Ace gets to his knees first and wobbles toward the gun .
It 's the first clear shot the SWAT team has had .
EINHORN ( screaming )
Shoot him !
Shoot him !
We all hear the guns cocked .
We see Ace in the rifle sights .
We see fingers twitch on triggers .
A loud voice comes from off camera .
EMILIO DON'T SHOOT !
HOLD YOUR FIRE !
Melissa is holding Emilio's gun under his chin .
MELISSA
Put down your guns or this cop gets it !
The SWAT team hesitates .
MELISSA ( CONT'D ) I mean it !!
Much to Emilio's surprise , she cocks the gun .
EMILIO ( whispers to Melissa ) Ah� Melissa ?
That 's a hair trigger .
( loud to cops )
She 's not joking !
The SWAT team leader signals his men .
They lower their guns .
Einhorn gets back to her feet .
EINHORN
He kidnapped Snowflake .
He killed Roger Podacter , and he was about to kill Dan Marino and me !
ACE
Ho , ho !
Fiction can be fun !
But I find the reference section much more enlightening .
( doing his best Clarence Darrow )
For instance , if you were to look up ' professional football 's all time bonehead plays ' , you might read about a Miami Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle , who missed a twenty - six yard field goal in the closing seconds of Super Bowl Seventeen .
( in one breath )
What you would n't read about is how Ray Finkle lost his mind , and was committed to a mental institute , only to escape and join the police force under the assumed identity of a missing hker , seducing her way to the top , in a diabolical plan to get even with Dan Marino whom he blamed for the entire thing !!!
Ace gasps for air .
Everyone is totally confused .
AGUADO
What the hell are you trying to say ?
ACE
She 's not Lois Einhorn !
She 's Ray Finkle !
She 's a man !
EINHORN
He 's lying !
Shoot him !
Ace walks over to her .
ACE
Let 's just see who 's lying .
Would a real woman have to wear one of these ?
Ace dramatically pulls at Einhorn 's hair , thinking it 's a wig .
Einhorn 's head flies back .
The hair is real .
Ace keeps tugging it .
The SWAT team ready themselves .
ACE ( CONT'D )
Boy , that 's really on there !
But tell me this :
Would a real woman be missing these ?!
Ace rips open Einhorn 's blouse , and reveals two beautiful feminine breasts .
The sharp shooters are tensing .
Ace is laughing nervously now .
ACE Ha , ha , ha !
That kind of surgery can be done over the weekend !
But I doubt if she could find the time during her busy schedule to get rid of Mr. Knish !!
Ace rips off Einhorn 's skirt .
Einhorn now stands there fully nude .
She appears to be the perfect figure of a woman .
ACE
Oooh boy .
Ace looks at Melissa and Emilio and shrugs his shoulders .
Then , just when it seems all is lost , Dan Marino who is back behind Einhorn , motions for Ace to come over .
MARINO Psst� Ace .
Come here .
ACE ( to everyone )
Could you excuse me just a second .
Ace goes to Dan.
Melissa still holds Emilio hostage .
EINHORN
Shoot him .
Shoot him , now !!
MELISSA ( to cops )
Do n't anybody make a move !
Marino whispers something in his ear .
Ace looks confident again .
He once more addresses the crowd .
ACE Ladies and gentlemen , my esteemed colleague Mr. Marino , has just brought some new evidence to my attention .
Now , history has certainly shown that even the most intuitive criminal minds can be wrong , from time to time .
But , if I have been mistaken� if the lieutenant is indeed a woman� then my friends , she is suffering from the worst case of hemorrhoids I have ever seen !!!
Ace spins Einhorn around now , exposing to the world , the healthy set of male genetalia that Finkle has learned to keep tucked between his legs .
( And if we have any balls , we 'll actually show it . )
Everyone gasps .
CLOSE UP ON EINHORN / FINKLE .
He finally drops the facade .
FINKLE ( deepest voice possible )
It was Marino 's fault .
The laces were in .
( breaking down now )
They were IN !!!
Quick cuts of all the cops spitting with disgust .
Then Emilio spits .
Then CLOSE ON Marino spitting .
They all have kissed her / him / it .
Even Snowflake blows his spout .
Ace confidently cracks a sunflower seed .
ACE Somebody read it its rights .
Suddenly , Finkle picks up a shard of broken glass and lunges at Ace .
FINKLE DIE ANIMAL BOYYYYY !!!
Thinking fast
Ace sidesteps Finkle and sends him head first into Snowflake 's makeshift tank .
After a few seconds
Finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes around , helplessly .
FINKLE ( gasping for air ) Help I can't swim !!!
Finkle goes under again .
We see him under water sinking down .
Snowflake swims to him now , allowing him to grab onto his fin and pulls Finkle gently to the side of the pool .
Finkle lies there exhausted .
Ace reaches down into frame , removing the ' 82 AFC Championship ring from Finkle 's finger .
We see that it 's the ring with the missing stone .
Ace replaces it with the stone in his pocket .
It 's a perfect fit .
ACE LLLOOOSER !
LLOO HOO SERR HERR HERR !!!
Melissa is still holding the gun on Emilio .
EMILIO Melissa� you can give me back my gun now .
Melissa has forgotten she even had the gun .
She hands it to Emilio and faints in his arms .
Now Aguado appears beside Ace .
AGUADO
I do n't know how you did it , Ventura � but that was damn good police work .
Alright guys , let 's wrap this up !

Ace is furious .

Since we ’re on the subject of confession , here is a look at the subject from the personal side .
Today , Chaplain Mike presents this classic iMonk post that Michael wrote in October , 2008 .
Some Christians love to talk about the sins of Obama or gays or the mainstream media , but get really animated when I suggest we need to talk about our own , even if they are listed in the Bible dozens of times .
If the Gospel isnâ€™t grabbing you by the real sins in your real life , just exactly what is the Gospel doing for you ?
Or you with it ?
I donâ€™t like the fact that I can give a really good talk on prayer when I rarely pray .
I donâ€™t like it that I can read Matthew 5:23 - 24 and , as far as I can recall , never take a single step toward obeying it .
I donâ€™t like that I can sin and then condemn someone elseâ€™s sin in almost the same breath .
I donâ€™t like it that Iâ€™m convinced people need to understand me , but I take so little time to understand others .
I regret that Iâ€™ve spent so much of my life seeking to make myself happy in ways that never led to real happiness at all .
I donâ€™t like it that Iâ€™ve accumulated so much stuff I donâ€™t need , and Iâ€™m so reluctant to give it away .
It causes me real sorrow that Iâ€™ve said â€ œI love youâ€ far to little in my life , especially to the people I love the most .
I donâ€™t like the fact that some of my students think Iâ€™m a hero , when Iâ€™ve done nothing more than be an unprofitable servant .
I hate the difference between what I know and what I do .
I hate the fact that I can use words like â€œradicalâ€ describing what others should do in following Jesus when Iâ€™m the first one to want to play it safe .
I donâ€™t like that part of me that thinks everyone should listen to what I say .
I wish I could see myself as God sees me , both in my sinfulness and in the Gospel of Jesus .
I regret using so little of my lifeâ€™s time , energy and resources for worship and communion with God .
I despise that part of me that always finds fault , and uses that knowledge to put myself above others .
I am embarrassed by the words I use that come so easily from the tongue but have little root in the heart .
I regret taking so few risks in the cause of living a God - filled life .
I despise the shallowness of my repentance for sin that has caused hurt and pain for others .
I donâ€™t like that part of me that can make up an excuse , even lie , almost endlessly in the cause of avoiding the truth and its consequences .
I donâ€™t like that I can talk of heaven in a sermon or at a funeral , but very little of me wants to go there .
I regret that I have loved my arrogant self far than Iâ€™ve loved my self humbled in Christ .
I regret that so much good advice , good teaching and good example was wasted on me .
But I am glad for the endless mercies of the Lord , and the amazing fact that those mercies extend to me , today and every day .
I am glad that Christ my substitute took this sorry life , pathetic obedience and lethargic worship and exchanged it for his perfect righteousness .
I am glad that the Holy Spirit is remaking and raising dead men- even at age 52 .
I am glad that one day I will look at all these failures and regrets and they will have been transformed into the very glory of Jesus Christ himself .
I am glad that God has cast the very things I most dislike about myself into the depths of the sea and has removed them as far as the east is from the west .
I am glad that when I return in shame and embarrassment , my Father meets me running , covers me with his gladness and throws me a party in the presence of the naysayers and pharisees .
I am glad that Jesus takes these things I loathe about myself and says â€ œIt is finished .
Come you good and faithful servant .
Enter into the joy of your Lord .
Today you will be with me in paradise.â€ 
I am glad Jesus says â€ œBefore I have called you servant , but now I will call you friend.â€ 
I am glad Jesus says â€ œWho condemns you ?
There is now no condemnation because you are in me and I am in you .
If I am for you , who can be against you ?
Go , and sin no more.â€ 

Happy Birthday Marty !
Sorry about no new CHASON !
episode this weekend .
But , between the show and my work for the weekend , I just did n't have any time .
I really appreciate you guys voting for me .
Every vote nudges me an inch closer to my fantasy of being able to do this for a living .
For that , I thank you .
Speaking of the show , it went AMAZINGLY .
Scott was a little late , but thankfully Phil came on to hang out for a while until Mr. PvP himself showed up .
We had a great time with Scott .
I think a lot of people have this image of him as a sort of aloof , angry , webcomic god , but he 's actually a really cool regular guy .
You should go listen to our interview .
It might just change your perception .
I hope today 's comic is enjoyable .
I 'm so tired I 'm not sure if anything is funny any more , but I do like the way the mom 's expression came out .
It 's really hard to make someone roll their eyes when you draw little dots instead of eye outlines .
I think I got what I wanted out of the drawing , so hopefully the writing is carrying its weight too .
I 'd like to extend and invitation to anyone else with a webcomic to do a link exchange .
If you 're interested , just email me your site .
As long as the content is n't too terribly offensive , I 'd be happy to post my opinion about it in a straight up link exchange .
One of these days I really have to make a links page .
I also split the forum recently .
So , if you wanna post ridiculous off topic crap , there is now a place for you .
If anyone wants to buy some ad space , I 'm the best deal in town .
You can get a week of adspace for only 7 dollars .
Last week SMBC got over 99,000 page views .

Rudy Giuliani and Ron Paul are clashing over 9/11 again , this time in Kentucky .
Today , Giuliani endorsed the primary opponent of Ron Paul 's son , Rand Paul , in the high - profile Kentucky Republican Senate primary .
In endorsing Secretary of State Trey Grayson , Giuliani fired some shots at Rand , perhaps stirred by a 2007 confrontation with his father over the 9/11 attacks .
Ron Paul , in turn , has fired back .
In a long statement released by Grayson 's campaign this morning , Giuliani praised Grayson as " not part of the ' blame America first ' crowd " - - a reference to Ron Paul 's sentiment that al Qaeda perpetrated the 9/11 attacks because of America 's interventionist foreign policy .
Giuliani took offense to Paul 's statements about 9/11 during a 2007debate .
Here 's Giuliani's statement :
" Trey Grayson is the candidate in this race who will make the right decisions necessary to keep America safe and prevent more attacks on our homeland .
He is not part of the ' blame America first ' crowd that wants to bestow the rights of U.S. citizens on terrorists and point fingers at America for somehow causing 9/11 , " Giuliani said .
He continued , " Kentucky needs a Senator who understands the threat posed by our enemies abroad .
I witnessed firsthand the destruction and loss of life our enemies can cause .
Like me , Trey Grayson knows we must stay on offense against terrorism , and he supports using all the essential tools we have in that fight , including monitoring the conversations and activities of suspected foreign terrorists as allowed by the Patriot Act .
He is a fresh face that Republicans can trust to best represent their values - both on national security and fiscal responsibility - in Washington .
Kentuckians could not elect a better Senator than Trey Grayson . "
Ron Paul responded in a fundraising e-mail to his supporters , announcing that Giuliani is " slithering " into his son 's race .
From the e-mail :
The Neo -Con establishment is pulling out all the stops to beat Rand .
First , Dick Cheney endorsed his opponent .
Next , Rick Santorum .
And today , Mr. Big Government Republican himself is slithering into the race .
That 's right .
Rudy Giuliani has stuck his beak into Rand 's race , endorsing his opponent and blaming Rand for being part of the " blame America " crowd .
Disgusting .
Paul included a video link to his own dispute over 9/11 with Giuliani during the presidential primary debate , in which Paul asked the Fox moderator , " Have you ever read about the reasons they attacked us ?
They attack us because we 've been over there , we 've been bombing Iraq for 10 years , we 've been in the Middle East " and " What would we say here if China was doing this in our country , or in the Gulf of Mexico ? "
Giuliani asked Paul to take back his statement ;
Paul did n't , and instead repeated his sentiments :
National security and 9/11 have become big issues in the Kentucky Senate race , as Grayson and Rand Paul have taken a fight over 9/11 and Guantanamo to the airwaves
Grayson began airing TV ads criticizing Paul for wanting to close the military prison at Guantanamo Bay remarking that terrorist suspects should be sent back to Afghanistan :
Paul fired back with an ad that accused Grayson of exploiting 9/11 for political gain .
( UPDATE :
As a reader notes below , Paul criticized the decision to close Guantanamo and try detainees in civilian courts , when Attorney General Eric Holder announced it . )
" Trey , Grayson , your shameful TV ad is a lie , and it dishonors you , " Paul says in the ad :
Kentucky has become a marquee primary for conservatives , second in national attention only to Florida 's race between Marco Rubio and Gov. Charlie Crist .
Paul is a favorite of Tea Partiers nationwide , while Grayson has the endorsement of establishment Republicans , most prominently Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky 's most powerful politician .
An average of major polls currently shows Paul leading by 15 percentage points .

The Tea Party , which started off as a Libertarian protest against taxes and government , has turned into a right wing , corporate sponsored , racist hate - fest .
Three groups have joined the Libertarian founders of the Tea Party movement to add money , racism , hatred and conspiracy theory based paranoia to the Tea Pot .
Neo -Cons ( Neo- Conservatives ) Republican insiders responsible for Reagan and both Bush Administrations .
The first group is the Neo -Cons .
The same people behind the Bush administration have decided to use the Tea Party movement to put the Republicans back in power .
They are doing this , using the former mouthpieces for the Bush White House , Fox News , Rush Limbaugh and conservative radio .
Neo -Cons like Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin have had prominent roles speaking at Tea Party events , and Neo -Con pundits , Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck have been prominent cheerleaders for the movement .
Tea Parties are funded by FreedomWorks , which is run by Dick Armey .
Armey is the author for the contract for America and was house majority leader for the Republicans during the nineties .
He worked closely with Tom Delay and Newt Gingrich in congress .
The Neo -Con infiltration of the Tea Party is also known as astro-turfing .
When well - funded political insiders try and pass off a well - orchestrated political movement funded by lobbyists as a grass roots , people ’s movement it is called “ astro - turing ” ( fake grass - roots ) .
Neo -Nazis ( Modern Day White Supremacists ) KKK and Nazi sympathizers also known as white nationalists
The next group that has managed to infiltrate the tea party has been the Neo - Nazis .
The white nationalists have seen the anger over a Black President and the mostly white make up of the tea party protesters and have decided to use the Tea Parties as a vehicle to spout their racist views and recruit new members .
Neo -Nazis speak openly about their involvement and support for the Tea Party movement on the White Supremacist Site , Stormfront .
Here are some quotes from white supremacists regarding Tea Party events .
One thing I noticed about the Tea Party crowds is that they are 99 % WHITE !
These are my people and they are your people as well .
Just because they have n’t fully awakened does n’t mean that they are our enemy .
The polls on these people is that they do not support any ( R ) or ( D ) candidate , but instead support the person who is more constitutional .
My suggestion to all you do - nothings is that you join your local Tea -Party at make changes from within instead of criticizing from the outside .
I love my fellow white neighbor and deep down these good Tea - partying white folks want the the basic same freedoms and rights as we all do .
I say we establish ourselves in there before the filthy frikin joos do .
I do n’t give 2 ****s about the RINO ’s or the libs but the majority of the tea party people I ’ve met are now at least willing to listen to the WN viewpoint .
I ’ve converted several of them ( especially on the Jew issue ) and the immigration issue is a no brainer .
I ’ve attended a few of the Tea Party gatherings and have found quite a few racially aware folks in attendance .
I use these gatherings to wake folks up to the ‘ Jew ’ problem in this country with many leaving say “ Hmmm ” and following up with me via email for further mentoring on the subject .
There are people I met during the Ron Paul campaign who were “ clowns ” , and now are active White Nationalists .
I ’m not willing to pass up any opportunity I have to make more of them .
It only takes me a few minutes a day to make either subtle or blatant racially - aware posts on forums filled with Tea Partyers .
If I make even one new White Nationalist , it was worth it .
Source
After a Neo - Nazi caused controversy by pulling out a Hitler flag at a Tea Party event , Neo -Nazis began commenting on Stormfront that White Nationalists should not use their Hitler and Swastika flags for fear of scaring off potential White Nationalist recruits because the Jews have sullied the image of their proud Fuehrer and the Swastika and instead should use Confederate Flags and “ Do n’t Tread On Me ” shirts .
The Tea Party ’s founder , Ron Paul has his own problem with white supremacist and Neo - Nazi supporters .
Paul has received extensive support from Stormfront and other Neo - Nazi groups and has yet to distance himself from these Nazis groups , even taking a picture with Stormfront founder , Don Black and his son Derek .
( see above picture )
Bill
White , the commander of the Nazi group , has alleged that Paul ’s ties to neo -Nazi groups are deeper than campaign contributions and photographs .
I am compelled to tell the truth about Ron Paul ’s extensive involvement in white nationalism .
Both Congressman Paul and his aides regularly meet with members of the Stormfront set , American Renaissance , the Institute for Historic Review , and others at the Tara Thai restaurant in Arlington , Virginia Paul is a white nationalist of the Stormfront type who has always kept his racial views and his views about world Judaism quiet because of his political position .
Neo-McVeighs ( Patriot Movement Inspired Militia Men And Sympathizers ) Believe In New World Order Conspiracy
The last and perhaps most dangerous group to crash the Tea Party is the Neo - McVeighs .
This group subscribes to many Neo - Con talking points and many members of this group subscribe to neo -Nazi beliefs but the Neo - McVeighs are characterized by militia based anger , a fierce devotion to high powered weapons an a strong belief in anti-government conspiracy theories .
Another term for the Neo - McVeighs is the “ patriot ” movement .
The Neo-McVeighs believe in a New World Order conspiracy of a secret society that will turn the world into a one world socialist government while setting up concentration camps for dissenters and taking away the guns of true patriots in the USA .
Many of the Neo-Cons have adopted Neo -McVeigh code words to incite paranoia in the Tea Party .
Sarah Palin has spoken about death panels , Glenn Beck has discussed FEMA concentration camps on his show and Pat Buchanan has openly talked about the New World Order , saying :
The West is disappearing into a New World Order , and against globalism , the Tea Party folks may represent our last best hope .
Right Wing Christian fundamentalist , Pat Robertson wrote a book the New World Order which was based on the Jewish / Mason conspiracy to take over the world .
One example of the Neo- McVeighs are the Oathkeepers , a group of militia based ex-military and policemen who have taken an oaths to not cooperate in the “ New World Order . ”
One prominent Oathkeeper , Charles Dyer was recently arrested and charged with raping a seven - year - old girl .
Authorities found a grenade launcher and explosives residue in his apartment .
Here ’s a quote from Dyer on the New World Order .
They ’re trying to bring in the new world order and destroy our sovereignty .
That means they are the domestic enemy I swore to defend and fight against to defend my constitution .
And , I ’m willing to put my life on the line to defend this country .
And , I ’m asking anyone who ’s taken the oath to do the same .
The Neo-McVeighs have very similar ideologies and backgrounds to their namesake , Timothy McVeigh , who was responsible for the largest domestic terrorist attack in U.S. history .
They both use a lot of pro-constitution and pro-gun rhetoric , often come from a military background and they are extremely anti-government and paranoid about a new world order .
Both Newsweek and The New York Times both wrote pieces about the high level of New World Order conspiracy theorists and the paranoia and anger they are creating in the Tea Party , claiming that “ the party movement is dominated by conspiracy kooks ” and that Tea Party court jester , Glenn Beck “ frequently echoes Patriot ( Neo - McVeigh ) rhetoric , discussing the possible arrival of a “ New World Order ” and arguing that Obama is using a strategy of manufactured crisis to destroy the economy and pave the way for dictatorship . ”
The Neo-Cons maybe creating a Frankenstein they cannot control with their constant funding and Fox News promotion of the Tea Party .
The Neo -Nazis and Neo-McVeighs hold Neo-Cons in the same contempt as they hold the government .
The Neo-Cons have tried to say the protests are against taxes , which is unlikely given that Obama has only proposed raising taxes on the riches one percent , which only applies to the Neo - Cons themselves not their followers and the Neo - Nazis and Neo- McVeighs .
The Neo-Cons differ greatly with the Libertarians , Neo -Nazis and Neo-McVeighs on foreign policy .
While Neo-Cons strongly support Israel , believe in continuing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and starting a war with Iran , the Libertarians , Neo -Nazis and Neo-McVeighs are anti-Israel and against foreign wars .
The Libertarians have begun to speak out against the Neo -Cons .
Will they speak out against the Neo - Nazis and the Neo - McVeighs ?
Will the Neo-Cons address the New World Order paranoia they are putting into the Teabaggers heads ?
Will anyone in the Tea Party stand up to the both blatant and subtle racism that the Ne0 - Nazis and regular old racists are bringing to the Tea Party ?
Will the Neo-McVeighs turn on their Neo-Cons sponsors or create another Oklahoma City massacre ?
Is there any voice of reason in the Tea Party at all ?
If so I ’d like to hear from them .

There ’s been a barrage of attention on the iPad and it ’s hard to go anywhere online and not see a mention of it , it ’s truly a memorable device that is sure to change computing history .
I have no doubt the device is fun , incredible , even revolutionary , but after seeing some of the iPad setups out there I am left wondering are people missing the point of the iPad ?
Look around online and see if something pops out at you too ; the amount of people using iPad ’s with an external keyboard .
If that ’s their purpose , why not get a laptop ?
These are smart and really tech savvy people , the above picture is from Gizmodo but mirrors a setup used by Steve Rubel , and on the left is what TUAW blogger Erica Sadun somehow calls her iPad + stand + external keyboard setup as ‘ ridiculously convenient ’ – what ’s convenient about carrying around three items that can be handled by one less cumbersome laptop ?
If you ’re going to bring a stand and an external keyboard for using the iPad , why not just carry a laptop or netbook ?
It seems really strange to carry around a detached additional keyboard just so you can use the iPad like the device it ’s supposed to replace , a laptop .
Gizmodo goes so far as to say :
Typing on a tablet is serviceable but not without strange moments .
It ’s pretty clear that typing is a secondary function for the iPad .
We knew this would get a little bit weird .
Apparently , there ’s no better way , than to hook up an external keyboard .
If typing is a secondary function for the iPad , why on earth is everyone trying to use it as if it ’s a laptop replacement ?
Am I missing something ?
I admit I ’m speaking without firsthand knowledge here , I have n’t even used an iPad yet … but all these pictures make me wonder .
So I have to ask , are people missing the point of the next phase in the touch UI revolution that is supposed to be the iPad ?
Or is the iPad just really hard to type on without an external keyboard ?

DUBAI / SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - State - run Chinaoil has sold two gasoline cargoes for April delivery to Iran , industry sources said on Wednesday , stepping into a void left by fuel suppliers halting shipments under threat of U.S. sanctions .
Beijing , which has close economic ties with Tehran , has resisted sanctions proposed by Western powers on Iran ’s energy sector that aim to press the Islamic Republic to curb its nuclear programme .
U.S. politicians want to impose unilateral sanctions on fuel suppliers to Iran , and several of the world ’s top oil companies and trading houses have already curbed sales to pre-empt potential penalisation of their U.S. operations in future .
But while others back out , Chinaoil has sold a total of about 600,000 barrels worth around $ 55 million to the Islamic Republic .
The cargoes were Chinaoil ’s first direct sales to Iran since at least January 2009 , according to Reuters data .
Chinese firms have previously sold through intermediaries , traders said .
“ Prior to this there was some third - party trades going on , but this was a direct sell , ” a trader said .
Chinaoil is the trading unit for China ’s top energy group China National Petroleum Corp ( CNPC ) , which is the parent of U.S. and Hong Kong - listed PetroChina .
A CNPC spokesman was unable to comment on the sales .
HIATUS
Another Chinese company , Sinopec Corp , was also poised to resume gasoline sales to Tehran following a hiatus of nearly six years , trade sources said .
Sinopec is Asia ’s largest refiner .
Sinopec ’s trading arm Unipec booked a vessel to load 250,000 barrels in Singapore on Tuesday , with options to discharge in the Gulf .
The cargo was likely to go to Iran , trade sources said .
A Sinopec spokesman was not immediately available for comment .
Unipec sold gasoline to Iran between 2001 and 2004 .
State - run Zhuhai Zhenrong Corp , the world ’s largest single lifter of Iranian crude , also used to be a regular supplier to Iran .
Despite tough talk from the United States and the West and a number of suppliers halting shipments , Iran has maintained robust imports of gasoline from the international market , also buying from Malaysia ’s state oil firm Petronas and France ’s Total .
In March , the OPEC member purchased around 128,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) of gasoline , steady to imports made the previous month , traders said .
“ As long as there is money to be made , and economic benefits to be taken advantage off , Iran will always find ready sellers of gasoline from the international market , ” a trader said .
“ The politicians do n’t understand markets ... sanctions are cosmetic . ”
Earlier this month , LUKOIL , Russia ’s No. 2 oil company , joined a growing list of international oil companies and trading firms who have stopped gasoline sales to Iran .
In March Anglo - Dutch oil firm Royal Dutch Shell announced that it had stopped gasoline supplies to the Islamic republic joining two of the world ’s largest independent trading companies Glencore and Vitol who had taken similar decisions .
Iran , the world ’s fifth - largest oil exporter , has been under mounting pressure by the United States and its allies to halt uranium enrichment .
The West says that Tehran is using its atomic programme to develop a nuclear bomb , while Iran insists it is for electricity .
If this wonderful little piece of machinery is n't Nintendo's 3DS , slated to be revealed at E3 later this year , then we damn sure wish it was .
Check out the sliding , twisting marvel in all its glory .

The pictures come from a Japanese website called , as Google 's translator indicates , Munch Blog , a site about anime , manga , games , and movies .
The author says the pictures were posted without the manufacturer 's permission , and that anyone not wishing to spoil the big reveal at E3 this year should look away .
The device is fist shown as a small unit with one large screen , which threw us off at first .
One screen ?
How could this possible be the 3DS , which should be dual - screened by name and nature ?
Soon it becomes clear .
The one screen allows games to be played either on one large screen , or two simulated screens , ensuring backwards compatibility with the normal DS .
In fact , the person taking the pictures inserts a DS cart , the Japanese version of Super Robot Wars OG Saga : Endless Frontier ( a personal favorite of mine ) , and shows off the various orientations the dual screens can be displayed in , along with a smoothing filter built into the unit .

Other features of this little miracle include the ability to scan pictures , take pictures , composite 3D images over real backgrounds , and place objects in the user 's hands , much like we 've seen demonstrated with the PlayStation Move .
He also demonstrates 3D pointing , which tracks the movement of the user 's finger , including distance , to manipulate an object on screen .

So amazing , in my opinion , that this has to be a fake .

Here is the heartwarming story of 72 - year - old Pearl Carter , her lover and grandson Phil Bailey , and the $ 54,000 surrogate mother they have impregnated .
Sorry , did I say heartwarming ?
I meant , oh my god get it out of my head .
What could be more beautiful than two people in madly in love ?
If those people are a grandmother and her grandson , almost anything !
For example , take the story of Pearl Carter and Phil Bailey , the delightful couple who also happen to be genetically related .
According to Australia 's New Idea magazine , Pearl had a daughter , Lynette , who she gave up for adoption at age 18 .
In 1983 , that daughter had a son , named Phil .
After Lynette died of brain cancer , Phil decided to track down his grandmother :
' We both cried but kept talking for three hours , ' she says .
' When he emailed me a photo , I thought what a handsome and sexy man he was before pinching myself – he was my grandson !'
The attraction intensified when the two met :
The pair spent the first week shopping , bowling and eating out .
During the second week , giggly on wine after a night out , Pearl decided she was n't going to deny her feelings anymore .
The pair spent the first week shopping , bowling and eating out .
During the second week , giggly on wine after a night out , Pearl decided she was n't going to deny her feelings anymore .
' I called Phil into my bedroom , sat him on the bed , and then I leant over and kissed him , ' Pearl says .
' I expected rejection but instead he kissed me back .'...
That night , grandmother and grandson became lovers .
Yes , that 's right , the grossest sentence you 've ever read : " That night , grandmother and grandson became lovers . "
But it gets better , if by better , you mean , even weirder !
The unlikely pair moved in together ... and decided to have a baby !
The determined pair then decided to use Pearl 's retirement money to find a surrogate mother and buy a donor egg to inseminate with Phil 's sperm .
They placed an ad asking for an open - minded surrogate , and Roxanne Campbell applied .
The three met up a few times and hit it off .
' Initially I was shocked , ' says Roxanne on learning the couple were related .
' But they 're a brilliant pair and I saw how much they loved each other .
I know the baby will be loved too . '
Well .
The truth is , it 's hard to think that two consenting adults should n't be allowed to do it with each other , even if it is among the grossest of all possible incest permutations .
And why should n't they be allowed to raise a kid , assuming that the whole " incest " thing stays between , you know , the parents ?
( This is leaving aside the question of why on earth they agreed to be profiled by an antipodean lifestyle magazine when they are apparently from the U.S. — one of many things that makes the story smell a little fishy .
OK , very fishy . )
But being open - minded about it does n't mean that I ever want to read something like this again , ever , in my life :
' Living with Phil as my life partner has been amazing .
He cooks and cleans and we make love three times a week .
We can't keep our hands off each other . '
Update :
As a lot of you have pointed out , the dearth of detail and lack of wide pickup should engender a significant amount of skepticism about the story .
But why let skepticism get in the way of wide - eyed revulsion ?
[ New Idea ; disgusting tip via MissPeacock ]
The NHL has provided more than $ 2 BILLION of committed contracts in terms of players to the Olympics .
The Capitals have provided in our six players more than $ 200 million worth of talent as well , I believe .
And in payment back we received two free tickets to each game per team :-) .
Seems like a fair exchange , huh ?
And we are n’t allowed to do any press work on site or media streaming in any way or use the Olympic logos or see our players or park at the arena and on and on .
I bet I am violating some rules in blogging about the Olympics as I am not paying a penny to do so .
I did n’t ask for permission or credentials either .
I love the Olympics but we do n’t have a fair exchange of value that is for sure .
>>
Capitals owner Ted Leonsis
I like international hockey , but there are some absurd sides to the [ space for rent ]
Olympics that make this avenue toward a " best - on - best " hockey tournament almost intolerable to me -- not the least of which is the U.S. broadcast rights holder 's failure to reliably and promptly televise the games for which the NHL has shut down .
Looking for highlights of these NHL players on the NHL Network ?
Sorry , not allowed .
Want to watch an authorized live stream ?
Sign up and install this Microsoft plug - in .
Want to know when the game will be on ?
It 's after curling , already half - way through the first period , on a different NBC cable outlet , until a bit later when we 'll switch the channel again .
Deal with it -- and in the meantime , check out this dancing " competition " where the winners are determined by judges of debatable impartiality .
Dick Pound , the anti-doping hero of so many famous sweeping claims about drugs in the NHL , is on the International Olympic Committee and -- would n't you know it ? -- finds the Olympics essentially beyond reproach , no matter what happens .
Pound believes criticism of the current Winter Commercial Games is due to a bored media , which is some kind of irony considering his standing m.o. to use the media as a way of drumming up publicity for his World Anti-Doping Agency claims .
The Credit Card Olympics controllers are so determined to appear pure and commercial - free ( well , an alternate universe definition of " commercial - free " ) that the venue every hockey fan knows as G.M.
Place is now absurdly referred to as " Canada Hockey Place . "
Per traditional policy , the IOC covered the advertising from the boards in G.M.
Place -- only to replace it with a mash of pastel Olympic imagery that actually makes the puck harder to see on TV .
That 's right :
In order to form a more perfect , tightly controlled commercial union , viewers suffer .
The Olympics so carefully guards the sanctity of the five rings logo that every episode of Law & Order , The Biggest Loser , and whatever they call Jay Leno 's oxygen - consuming existence features a network logo on top of those sacred five rings .
Go to the right fast - food joint and the five rings are all over it , while my television tells me I too can eat junk and drink soda like an Olympian .
( Cue John Belushi , cigarette in hand : " I ran a lot of miles training for that day .
And I downed a lot of doughnuts ... Little Chocolate Doughnuts . " )
The whole goalie mask " propaganda " issue was just par for the course .
The Fast - Food Olympics wants to sell us on pageantry and tear - jerk personal stories ( unless a luger dies ... then it is unfortunate " operator error " ) .
Just do n't let Ryan Miller tell us that personal story in a small way , with a few token images on his mask , including the " S " denoting the college half of his hockey - crazed family has attended .
I 've no doubt the small concession to allow Miller to keep the tribute to his late cousin was a careful P.R. decision .
Restore the World Cup , Kiss the NBC Visa Coke Samsung Olympics Good Bye
I 'm being a bit flippant and rant - ish , of course .
I get the financial realities of putting on a showcase of , um , " sport . "
And the Soft Drink Olympics need , um , " partners " to help foot the bill .
But as an NHL fan and a distressed observer of the pre-packaged soap opera the Electronics Maker Games have become , I no longer see the fit .
The problem is the rope - a - soap - dope Olympics and hockey are after two different things , and two different audiences , which is why NBC understandably chooses figure skating over Canada vs. USA hockey in prime time .
Allow me to quote Gary Bettman in a momentary rap of reason :
" This is one of the things we do n't have control over .
We bring in 140 - plus players and we participate in the Olympics by stopping our season for two weeks , but this is the IOC 's show , the broadcasters ' show and the IIHF 's show .
There are a lot of things we do n't have control over and going forward , it may be we need to be a little more involved than at least to this point we 've been allowed to be . "
Unfortunate CBA - bargaining tactics aside , forgive me for being in full agreement with the commissioner here .
I understand the NHL players ' desire to continue this arrangement , and I suppose there 's no replacement for the Olympic village " experience " ( though do NHLers really fit there ? ) .
But I wonder if they could n't be coaxed away from interrupting the NHL season to appear on MSNBC and instead throw weight behind a more regularly scheduled World Cup that puts hockey first .
Why , then their national teams could even train together before the tournament , instead of leaving their national pride at the mercy of a chemistry experiment .
Then there would be no worries about the two - week interruption , the compressed schedule and implied injuries it causes , the lack of broadcast control -- and all the other side effects that are the cost of placing your best - on - best hockey tournament under that Most Holy and Pristine Logo with the five rings .
Right after curling and NCIS reruns .
" We are not going to focus on one thing , " said Musa Zondi of the Hawks investigative unit , adding that a sexual link was among the many accusations being made over the case .
At one level , the ICC World Twenty20 , which begins in Guyana on Friday , is just another opportunity for cricket 's 10 elite Test nations to squabble over yet another trophy .
Out of dozens of associate and affiliate nations keen for a crack at the big time , there is room for just two additional qualifiers .
But one of them , remarkably , is war - torn Afghanistan .
The ultimate underdogs , in sport as in any walk of life , they only became recognised as a cricketing nation in 2001 .
The 11 men who will take on millionaire Indian superstars like Mahendra Dhoni and Harbhajan Singh on 1 May in the idyllic tourist haven of St Lucia grew up in the bleak surroundings of the refugee camps in Pakistan , following the Soviet invasion of their homeland in 1979 .
The journey from there to cricket 's top table is one of the most heartening stories in sport , and one of the most unlikely .
The success of the national team has inspired many Afghans to take up cricket
Throughout the 1980s in Afghanistan , the Mujahideen , supported by the West , battled the Soviet Union in what became one of the most extended and fiercest conflicts of the Cold War .
Meanwhile , over the border in Pakistan , the gentler art of cricket was being introduced to the first children born to the new Afghan expatriates .
Those children grew to love the game , and when they were finally able to return home , they continued to play cricket .
Their desire to form an Afghanistan team was eventually approved by the International Cricket Council , though it has largely been self - motivation on a shoestring budget that has carried them through since then .
Of the £ 1 m in funding provided by the ICC since 2003 , the bulk of it only arrived last year , once full one - day international status had been achieved .
The final chapter of this extraordinary story began in May 2008 .
Fledgling appearances in tournaments run by the Asian Cricket Council earned Afghanistan a world ranking of 29 when they arrived in Division Five of the newly - formed World Cricket League in Jersey .
But money was so scarce that debut film - maker Leslie Knott remembers the players scrounging around for pound coins so they could go to get something to eat .
Knott , a Canadian photojournalist based in the Afghan capital , Kabul , was one of a small pocket of Westerners working in the media intrigued by the advent of this young team .
Her friend - the Times correspondent in Kabul , Tim Albone - suggested they follow the exploits of these young cricketers and make what would become the first documentary either had worked on .
Samiullah Shenwari , a 22 - year - old all - rounder , is a valuable member of the current squad
Underfed or otherwise , Afghanistan swept aside Japan in their first match in Jersey and topped their group , before beating the hosts in the final .
Knott , a newcomer to cricket with unrestricted access to the team through the coach Taj Malik , was hooked .
" The tournament was amazing , but we knew we had to get some more money together so we could carry on filming them .
People were starting to get interested , " she says .
In Tanzania in Division Four , Afghanistan were involved in some very close finishes but still won every match .
They moved on to Argentina ( Division Three ) , and Knott noticed something that appeared to set these cricketers apart from others .
After an early defeat to Uganda , there were worries in the Afghanistan camp .
One night leading fast bowler Hameed Hassan was close to despair .
" Hameed had a breakdown , he was crying out and sobbing , " she says .
" I asked him ' What 's going on ? '
He said ' Leslie , I have seen people killed , I have seen people shot and never shed one tear .
But this cricket hits me right in the heart and I can't control it .
It 's too emotional for me . ' "
Again , Afghanistan pulled through , and stayed on course for the big time .
In April 2009 , the juggernaut was finally halted .
They agonisingly missed out on one of four qualifying spots for the 2011 World Cup in the subcontinent .
But 10 months later that disappointment was forgotten when victory over the UAE in Dubai on 13 February put Afghanistan through to the World Twenty20 , and for good measure they followed up by beating the other qualifiers , Ireland , in the final .
I spoke to Hameed on a crackling phoneline as the team made their final preparations before their trip to the Caribbean .
" We are not thinking about playing like Shahid Afridi or Virender Sehwag or Sachin Tendulkar , " says the 22 - year - old .
" We are just playing our best so that we are not nervous for the World Twenty20 , just very , very excited .
" I 've had a great experience , I love my cricket .
And the fans ... all the time they follow the team , sending prayers , messages and lots of wishes .
When we go back from any tour they come to the airport and celebrate with the team .
" After the troubles of the last few years , everybody now is just trying to think about us doing well , and we are hungry for trophies , and hope we can do better for our nation . "
Hameed and his team - mates have shared experiences that their opponents in the Caribbean - after India they face South Africa in their second group game - will find difficult to relate to .
Knott explains : " One of the reserve players was killed by American forces , most of them have lost siblings , either to illness or war , there 's been a lot of suffering .
But what they are doing now is making history .
This is the one chance they have .
" They have known each other since they were six or seven years old and are completely in tune with each other , which is why they are so close .
They are like brothers .
When not playing cricket , back in Afghanistan they hang out together all the time .
" There 's no rivalry between them , they really want to see each member perform well .
They are doing everything they can to make Afghanistan proud of them . "
Given the continued fragile state of the country , few of the players have an alternative career path if cricket fails .
Those whose parents survive work as tradesmen , shopkeepers , or have small businesses .
None are wealthy .
Facilities are still non-existent ; home games are played in the UAE , in Sharjah .
But the first proper ground within Afghanistan is finally being built , near Jalalabad , along with a cricket academy funded by the US embassy .
There is also talk of formulating a domestic competition .
" Now is the time for investment to be made , " says Knott .
" They are riding on a wave of mass excitement with a message that Afghanistan has something else to offer the world other than Taliban , burkhas and war .
The talent is there and the will of international agencies to make it happen is there .
The team arriving back in Kabul after qualifying for the ICC World Twenty20
" There are so many people with nothing to do .
They could be playing cricket a lot .
Afghan people are very naturally athletic , they are physically strong and mentally strong .
The under - 19 team was in the World Cup , which is anther great success story , and there are a lot of girl cricketers .
Cricketing success is sustainable . "
Hassan adds : " Two or three years ago , nobody was interested in cricket too much .
Now you will see lots of children playing around on the streets and fields .
" This is a very good thing .
People are learning cricket and lots of people will try to play for Afghanistan .
There is more and more interest in the game . "
My conversation with Knott takes place on the day the whole Afghanistan team are filming a TV commercial in Dubai .
It 's a day - long shoot involving rehearsals , make - up , and directed by a Bollywood film crew .
It is seeing the attention lavished on the players that makes her think back to the rainy days in Jersey less than two years previously when they struggled to pay for their fast - food orders .
The contrast is hard to absorb .
Hassan , meanwhile , does not see the World Twenty20 as the pinnacle of Afghanistan 's achievements .
" The guys in the team are mostly in their early 20s , all the boys are young and fit so we hope to keep the same squad for five or six years .
Test cricket is definitely an ambition . "
May the dream continue .
Out of the Ashes , a documentary by Leslie Knott , Tim Albone and Lucy Martens , will be screened as part of the Storyville series on BBC4 towards the end of the year .
Today I ’d like to tell you about our newest service , the Amazon Simple Notification Service .
We want to make it even easier for developers to build highly functional and architecturally complex applications on AWS .
It turns out that applications of this type can often benefit from a publish / subscribe messaging paradigm .
In such a system , publishers and receivers of messages are decoupled and unaware of each other ’s existence .
The receivers ( also known as subscribers ) express interest in certain topics .
The senders ( publishers ) can send a message to a topic .
The message will then be immediately delivered or pushed to all of the subscribers to the topic .
The Amazon Simple Notification Service ( SNS ) makes it easy for you to build an application in this way .
You ’ll need to know the following terms in order to understand how SNS works :
Topics are named groups of events or acess points , each identifying a specific subject , content , or event type .
Each topic has a unique identifier ( URI ) that identifies the SNS endpoint for publishing and subscribing .
Owners create topics and control all access to the topic .
The owner can define the permissions for all of the topics that they own .
Subscribers are clients ( applications , end - users , servers , or other devices ) that want to receive notifications on specific topics of interest to them .
Publishers send messages to topics .
SNS matches the topic with the list of subscribers interested in the topic , and delivers the message to each and every one of them .
Here ’s how it all fits together :
The SNS API is , as the name should imply , clean and simple .
Here ’s what it takes to get started :
Call the CreateTopic function to create a new topic .
Topic names can be made up of upper and lower case letters , numbers , and hyphens and can be up to 256 characters long .
Call the AddPermission function to establish the set of publishers and subscribers with access to the topic .
Subscribers call the Subscribe function to express their interest in receiving messages on a particular topic .
As part of their request each subscriber must specify a topic , a protocol ( HTTP , HTTPS , Email , or Email - JSON ) , and an endpoint ( a URL for HTTP or HTTPS , an email address for either flavor of Email ) .
SNS is also integrated with other AWS services for example , you can have the notifications delivered to an SQS queue .
A single subscriber can subscribe to the same topic more than once if desired .
As part of the subscription process , SNS will deliver a confirmation message with an embedded token to the endpoint .
The subscriber must confirm the subscription by clicking a link in an email or using the ConfirmSubscription function in order to initiate message delivery .
Publishers call the Publish function to post messages to a topic which will immediately trigger delivery of the message to each of the topic ’s subscribers .
Other useful SNS functions include ListTopics ( enumerate the list of topics that a specific user can access ) , RemovePermissions , ListSubscriptions ( list the caller ’s subscriptions ) , and ListSubscriptions ByTopic ( list all of the subscriptions to a topic ) .
During the beta period , each AWS account will be able to create up to 100 topics .
We ’ll be evaluating this administrative limit as the beta progresses , and we ’ll do our best to meet requests for increases .
Pricing ?
Glad you asked !
There is no charge for the first 100,000 SNS requests per month , the first 100,000 HTTP or HTTPS notifications and the first 1,000 email notifications .
Additional information on pricing can be found on the SNS page .
As is often the case with new AWS services , we have a long and detailed road map for this service .
Here are a few of the items on it :
AWS Management Console Support –
We ’re building a point - and - click web - based user interface to access and manage SNS .
Additional Transports –
We expect to add additional delivery transport protocols in the future .
Get started now by reading the SNS documentation .
I ’m looking forward to seeing some cool applications built around SNS !
Workflow systems , mobile applications , news and information updates , and the like can all benefit from SNS .
Here are some ideas to get you started :
Monitoring Alert Notification System – Watch for failure events in a complex system and route information about them to appropriate people based on the type and complexity of the failure .
The events could be at the system level ( e.g. a process on an EC2 instance is consuming an excessive amount of memory or CPU time ) or at the application level ( e.g. an application was not able to communicate with an outside data provider ) .
News Distribution – Watch a web site , a Twitter topic , search results , or an RSS feed for changes .
Publish the changes to a series of topics ( one per news topic ) and allow subscribers to choose the topics that they find to be of interest to them .
Control EC2 Instances – Subscribe a large array of EC2 instances to a single topic and publish messages to the topic to control the array .
This could be system level , with messages used to tell each instance to update its installed software , report on free disk space .
Or , it could be application level , with messages to start and stop application processes , change policies , or update reference data tables .
— Jeff ;
The housing bubble is alive and well in certain Westside cities .
Even as the state in other areas like the Inland Empire has found a more reasonable price level , some areas seem to remain in a state of denial .
Prices remain elevated in some markets even though the overall trend is pushing to lower prices .
Santa Monica is one of those locations .
Definitely a prime Southern California niche but current prices are disconnected from market fundamentals .
In all this talk about the bubble and finding a bottom , never do we hear the mainstream media give any actual method for home buyers to measure a reasonable price for a home .
Basically a good price is whatever your mortgage lender will allow you to borrow .
This is actually one of the reasons we got into this housing mess in the first place .
Buyers were empowered with unbelievable amounts of debt and many had no idea how to value a real estate deal besides a few inflated appraisals which somehow conveyed accurate values .
Today I want to provide you with some tangible methods of valuing real estate in your own area .
This should give you some tools to cut through the propaganda and help you arrive at a more fair assessment of home prices .
Today we salute you Santa Monica with our Real Homes of Genius Award .
Santa Monica home and rental comparison
Santa Monica is a highly desirable city in the Westside of Los Angeles .
As of 2008 87,000 residents call Santa Monica home .
The median income for a household is $ 71,796 .
A large reason for this lower income level is that out of 45,000 households 32,000 + are renters ( 70 % ) .
The median housing payment for homeowners is $ 3,744 per month .
That should put the city into context .
If we want to arrive at a reasonable price , we should look at a rental and home for sale that closely resemble one another .
Let us look at our home for sale :
Details
Beds : 2
Baths : 1
Square feet : 735
Built : 1947
On MLS for 86 days
Zestimate : $ 574,500
List Price : $ 649,000
Believe it or not , this is one of the cheaper homes for sale in Santa Monica .
The home is listed at 735 square feet and with the current list price , will cost you $ 883 per square foot .
Let us examine the listing details :
“ 2 bedroom + den/1 bath home with a warm heart and wood burning fireplace .
Great starter or condo alternative .
Numerous possibilities or move right in .
Completely gated , lush landscaping as well as the santa monica schools .
A value packed , comfortable home you should see right now ! ”
$ 649,000 for a “ starter ” home .
This is Southern California for you .
I dug deeper to find some sales history on this home :
3/17/1995 : $ 190,000
6/19/2002 : $ 433,000
If you believe in the current list price , this would mean the home increased in value by $ 216,000 over 8 years while the majority of Californians saw stagnant wages .
Let us look at a comparable rental in Santa Monica :
Details
Beds : 2
Baths : 1
Square feet : 939
Built : 1940
On MLS for 86 days
Zestimate : $ 764,500
Believe it or not , the rental has a Zestimate that is $ 200,000 + higher than the same comparable home .
What is the current lease price for this bigger home with a higher estimated value ?
$ 2,900 per month .
Let us run the numbers of the home for sale assuming we are putting a 10 % down payment :
Purchase price : $ 649,000
Down payment : $ 64,900
PITI @ 5.5 % : $ 3,992
That is a big payment for a 735 square foot home .
Before running an analysis , let us look at 3 income scenarios :
For this home , a household will need to bring in at least $ 200,000 per year .
I find it hard to believe that a family making $ 200,000 will want to live in a 735 square foot home but I could be wrong .
The above rules apply to any location .
You should not take on a mortgage that is 3 times larger than your annual household income .
I know in California with Alt - A and option ARMs this might seem ultra conservative .
The first thing anyone should ask before buying a home is how much they can afford .
The above should give you a quick guideline .
Next , we should run an analysis between the rental and home sale .
I purposely selected a bigger rental with a higher estimated value to drive this point home .
Someone buying this home will be paying $ 4,000 out of their net income each month .
Let us forget about tax deductions for the moment because you are on the hook for $ 4,000 each month here .
In terms of the rental property , we can run a few investment property scenarios to see whether it is a “ good buy ” :
$ 2,900 x 12 = $ 34,800
$ 34,800 x 12 = $ 417,600
$ 34,800 x 15 = $ 522,000
When we value rental properties , we can use a 12 to 15 time annual rent figure to arrive at an estimated value .
So for the rental property with a much higher estimate , we get a range between $ 417,000 and $ 522,000 .
The $ 649,000 for a much smaller place is much too high by this valuation method .
And let us be generous here .
Imagine you are buying this home not to live in , but to rent out as an investor .
Let us be generous and say that this place will also rent for $ 2,900 :
Annual rents : $ 34,800
Property management : $ 2,784 ( 8 % rate )
Vacancy : $ 1,740
Maintenance : $ 2,610
Insurance : $ 3,000
Taxes : $ 6,000
Net operating income : $ 18,666
Once we get the net operating income , we can try and arrive at our capitalization rate :
$ 18,666 / ( price of home $ 649,000 ) = 2 %
This is a horrible rate by the way .
The average cap rate for rentals is roughly 6 to 8 percent .
And if you think the above expenses are high , think again .
Anyone that has owned investment property will go with the more cautious side because expensive things have a way of coming up .
A roof replacement in California can eat up $ 10,000 .
If you want to get a value by the cap rate you can solve for the price :
( $ 18,666 ) / ( x ) = 6 %
X = $ 311,000
Now this is a much lower price obviously .
But this is why when you talk to real estate investors , they will always have fast rules for valuing places like multiplying 10 to the annual rent ( i.e. , $ 12,000 x 10 = $ 120,000 ) for the price of the home .
But this is Southern California and the Westside is still using bubble metrics for home prices .
Today we salute you Santa Monica with our Real Homes of Genius Award .

My beloved Tom Hanks appeared this morning on the Joe - what 's - his - name and Mika - what 's - her - name show , to promote his new mini-series " The Pacific " .
Mika just could n't contain her excitement over the possibility of catching a very big fish , Hollywood - A - List - Liberal - Disappointed - Obama - Supporter .
She forgot only one thing :
This is Thomas Jeffrey Hanks !!
He saved Private Ryan !
He survived 4 years on a Deserted Island , talking only to a volleyball !
He cracked the Da Vinci Code !
He brought Apollo 13 crew safely back from space !
He 's the owner of Bubba Gump Shrimps !
And above all , he did a whole bunch of movies with Meg Ryan , and his career did not went to the toilet !!!
So Mika really thought she had any chance to trick him .
He smacked her down faster than you can say " Brzezinski " , and for the rest of the interview just gave them a lesson in history , common sense and Liberalism .
That was utterly refreshing , and to show my gratitude , i hereby give Tom Hanks permission to do one more movie with Meg Ryan :

Health Care Reform :
*
*
Yesterday the president stopped by a meeting with CEOs of the nation 's largest health insurance companies , and asked them to justify their stunning insurance rate increases .
He brought a letter he received from Natoma Canfield of Medina , Ohio , which he read to the insurance executives ( Official White House Photo by Pete Souza ) : " Dear President Obama , I am 50 years old .
I was diagnosed with carcinoma 16 years ago , and following my divorce 12 years ago I became self - employed .
After my COBRA benefits ran out , I was able to find costly but affordable health insurance .
As a responsible individual , I 've struggled to maintain my individual coverage and have increased my deductible and out - of - pocket limits in an attempt to control my costs and keep my health insurance .
" Last year , 2009 , my insurance premium was increased over 25 percent , even though I increased my deductible and out - of - pocket to the highest limits available .
I paid out over $ 6,075.24 in premiums , $ 2,415.26 for medical care , $ 225 in co-pays , and $ 1,500 for prescriptions .
I never reached my deductible of $ 2,500 , so the insurance company only paid out a total of $ 935.32 to my providers .
" I must repeat , in 2009 , my insurance company received $ 6,075.24 in premiums and paid out only $ 935.32 .
Incredibly , I have been notified that my premium for the next year -- for next year , 2010 , has been increased over 40 percent to $ 8,496.24 .
This is the same insurance company I 've been with for over 11 cancer - free years .
" I need your health reform bill to help me .
I simply can no longer afford to pay for my health care costs .
Thanks to this incredible premium increase demanded by my insurance company , January will be my last month of insurance .
" I live in the house my mother and father built in 1958 , and I am so afraid of the possibility I might lost this family heirloom as a result of being forced to drop my health care insurance . "

Young Voters ' Approval Of Obama Historically High A new analysis from Gallup finds that as President Obama 's ratings have gone up and down , one constant has remained : A sharply disproportionate level of support among younger voters , with an age gap that simply did n't happen with his two predecessors .
Gallup 's data was compiled by analyzing the average approval ratings for Bill Clinton and George W. Bush during their administrations , and comparing these numbers to the Obama administration so far .
The numbers were broken down among four age groups : 18 - 29 , 30 - 49 , 50 - 64 , and 65 +.
Bill Clinton 's numbers actually showed no great variation , with a high of 57 % among the 18 - 29 group , and 54 % among the 50 - 64 cohort .
George W. Bush showed some slight variation , with a low of 46 % among the 18 - 29 group and a high of 52 % with the 30 - 49 group .
Among Obama , though , the high is 66 % among the 18 - 29 group , with a low of 51 % among the 65 + group .

$ 600 million awarded today to 191 new Recovery Act transit projects !
WASHINGTON – Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood today announced funding for 191 new Recovery
Act transit projects in 42 states and Puerto Rico that will help transform the nation ’s infrastructure and support thousands of jobs across the country .
In making the over $ 600 million in new awards , the Federal Transit Administration met an aggressive deadline to award 100 percent of its Recovery Act transit formula dollars by March 5 .
Since President Obama signed the Recovery Act in February 2009 , the FTA has awarded 881 grants totaling $ 7.5 billion .
So far , Recovery
Act funds have supported the purchase of nearly 12,000 buses , vans and rail vehicles , the construction or renovation of more than 850 transit facilities , and the performance of more than $ 620 million in preventive maintenance , which has helped to save transit service and jobs , and enhance service reliability .

16 first - round finalists in the Race to the Top competition New York , Florida and Pennsylvania are among the 16 first - round finalists in the federal grant competition known as Race to the Top , in which states compete for a share of $ 4 billion in school improvement money , the federal Department of Education said Thursday .
The other first - round finalists are Colorado , Delaware , the District of Columbia , Georgia , Illinois , Kentucky , Louisiana , Massachusetts , North Carolina , Ohio , Rhode Island , South Carolina and Tennessee .
The first - round winners will be announced on April 1 .
Forty states and the District of Columbia submitted proposals ... ... Many analysts had identified Florida and Louisiana as strong contenders .
Florida has one of the most advanced student - data tracking systems in the country , as well as a system that rates schools like report cards , A through F. Louisiana was an obvious contender , partly because scores of charter schools opened in New Orleans after the city ’s school system was devastated by Hurricane Katrina .
President Obama last month requested an additional $ 1.3 billion to extend the competition into a third round next year .

Obama looking to give new life to immigration reform Despite steep odds , the White House has discussed prospects for reviving a major overhaul of the nation 's immigration laws , a commitment that President Obama has postponed once already .
Obama took up the issue privately with his staff Monday in a bid to advance a bill through Congress before lawmakers become too distracted by approaching midterm elections ... ... Immigration is a delicate issue for the White House .
After promising to revamp in his first year of office what many see as a fractured system , Obama risks angering a growing , politically potent Latino constituency if he defers the goal until 2011 .
But with the healthcare debate still unresolved , Democrats are wary of plunging into another polarizing issue .
" Right now we have a little problem with the ' Chicken Little ' mentality :
The sky is falling and consequently we can't do anything , " Rep. Raul M. Grijalva ( D - Ariz . ) said in an interview .
Republicans are unlikely to cooperate .
On Capitol Hill , Republicans said that partisan tensions had only gotten worse since Obama signaled this week that he would push forward with a healthcare bill , whether he could get GOP votes or not .

A sequestrare il materiale è stata la Digos di Roma in tre diverse operazioni , già cominciate nei giorni scorsi .
In tutto ieri sono state dieci le persone arrestate : nove quelle a seguito dei tafferugli dentro e fuori dallo stadio Olimpico , oltre a due denunciati .
Un'altra persona è invece finita in manette per il ritrovamento di un ' arsenale ' nella sua auto auto
A federal appeals court says three Seattle police officers did not employ excessive force when they repeatedly tasered a visibly pregnant woman for refusing to sign a speeding ticket .
The lawyer representing Malaika Brooks said Monday that the court 's 2 - 1 decision sanctioned " pain compliance " tactics through a modern - day version of the cattle prod .
" To inflict pain on a person if that person is not doing what the police want that person to do is simply outrageous , " said Eric Zubel , the woman 's attorney .
" I can not say that loud enough . "
Zubel said he would ask the San Francisco - based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to rehear Friday 's 2 - 1 decision that drew a sharp dissent from Judge Marsha Berzon :
" Refusing to sign a speeding ticket was at the time a nonarrestable misdemeanor ; now , in Washington , it is not even that .
Brooks had no weapons and had not harmed or threatened to harm a soul , " ( .pdf ) Berzon wrote .
" Although she had told the officers she was seven months pregnant , they proceeded to use a Taser on her , not once but three times , causing her to scream with pain and leaving burn marks and permanent scars . "
The majority noted that the M26 Taser was set in " stun mode " and did not cause as much pain as when set on " dart mode . "
The majority noted that the circuit 's recent and leading decision on the issue concerned excessive force in the context of a Taser being set on Dart mode , which causes " neuro - muscular incapacitation . "
Stun mode , the court noted , did n't rise to the level of excessive force because it imposes " temporary , localized pain only . "
The majority reversed a lower court judge who said the woman 's rights were violated .
The lower court 's failure to distinguish between the two levels of pain modes " led the court to err in finding excessive force . "
The woman was driving her 12 - year - old to the African American Academy in Seattle when she was pulled over on suspicion of speeding in 2004 .
The child left the car for school and a verbal spat with the police resulted in the woman receiving three , 50,000 - volt shocks , first to her thigh , then shoulder and neck while she was in her vehicle .
An officer was holding Brooks ' arm behind Brooks ' back while she was being shocked .
Brooks gave the officer her driver 's license , but Brooks refused to sign the ticket – believing it was akin to signing a confession .
She was ultimately arrested for refusing to sign and to comply with officers asking her to exit the vehicle .
" A suspect who repeatedly refuses to comply with instructions or leave her car escalates the risk involved for officers unable to predict what type of noncompliance might come next , " Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall wrote for the majority .
She was joined by Judge Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain .
" Therefore , while using the Taser three times makes this a closer case , we find that it does not show excessive force in light of the corresponding escalation of Brooks ' resistance and the fact that it was the third tasing that appeared to dislodge her such that the officers could finally extract her from her car and gain control over her , " Hall wrote .

The principle of conservatism is that we conserve , or protect and nurture , the good things in life .
What ’s good generally does n’t change through the years .
We will always like brave , honest , forthright , honorable , gentle , assertive , intelligent , healthy , attractive and morally upright people .
We will also always like the great works of culture from ancient Rome and Greece , the classical and Romantic periods of European art , and others .
We do n’t throw out these good things when the trend changes , because they are eternally good .
When it comes to race , Conservatives face a quandary .
We do n’t like racism , because racism is the idea of a universal preference against a certain race .
Wherever you are on earth , whatever the circumstance , you do n’t like X race and prefer Y race .
With that tends to come scorn , cruelty and violence .
Even worse , we see that our young men who get caught up in racist movements tend to become embittered , adjusted to futility and violent .
However , we conserve .
And part of conservation is saying that any ethnic group should be able to preserve itself .
Sounds OK so far , but then you realize that part of self - preservation is not outbreeding .
In turn , that requires not letting other people into your local area .
And so conserving ethnic groups is inevitably accused of being racist .
The real racism however is insistence that there ’s one superior race everywhere on earth , at every time , and that it ’s always preferable to pure ethnicity .
That superior race is the mixed race , which is both convenient for industry and gives us warm fuzzies because it means no more ethnic conflict , or so we think .
But in order to demand that this race exist , we must also become racists and demand the forced destruction of all ethnic groups in the name of diversity and anti-racism .
As a Conservative , I loathe well - intentioned attempts by a small minority to “ fix ” what nature has created .
I loathe them mainly because they do n’t work .
They always end up creating a public dogma that because it ’s unrealistic , creates a witch - hunt for people rational enough to deny it .
I fear anti-racism is one of these because of the paradox I relate above .
My solution is to stop pushing an agenda on people .
Stop the diversity mania , because it ’s actually racist .
Instead , conserve culture and heritage everywhere on earth .

Twitter rolls out ad plan
LONDON ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Twitter said Tuesday that it will start featuring ads as part of the company 's effort to turn its popularity into profit .
Twitter co-founder Biz Stone unveiled the new advertising platform , called Promoted Tweets , on the company 's blog .
" This announcement is a long time coming , " said Stone in the announcement .
How Twitter plans to make money has been a question that , until now , the company has been reticent about .
Twitter allows users to post 140 - character entries called " tweets . "
Now when users conduct a search on the site , tweets paid for by Twitter 's advertising partners will be displayed at the top of the search results page .
Companies that will feature ads on the site include Best Buy ( BBY , Fortune 500 ) , Starbucks ( SBX ) and Sony Pictures .
Other than carrying a label that signals they are being paid for by an advertiser , the promoted posts will look like a regular tweet .
As recently as last September , Stone had said it would be " awhile " before Twitter displayed ads on its Web site .
The company has taken heat for not revealling its business plan , but Stone was quick to poke fun at himself .
" When your name is Biz and you 're a co-founder of Twitter , it also means putting yourself at the mercy of folks like Stephen Colbert , who hit home runs wtih lines like , ' So I assume that Biz in Biz Stone does not stand for Business model . ' "
Still , while it is arguable whether a hung Parliament in Britain will lead to policy drift , analysts said Greece was in trouble already .
The country was brought to a standstill on Thursday by the second general strike in weeks .
Police clashed with rioters , again reducing Athens to a fog of tear gas .
Observers said that did not augur well for a nation that has hardly begun its three - year ordeal of draconian cuts .
Tea partiers gather at the Tea Party Express national bus tour rally at the Illinois State Fairgrounds .
GOP operatives crash the tea party
Just days after the first widespread tea party demonstrators hit the streets a year ago Thursday , Joe Wierzbicki , a Republican political consultant with the Sacramento firm Russo Marsh +
Rogers , made a proposal to his colleagues that he said could “ give a boost to our PAC and position us as a growing force / leading force as the 2010 elections come into focus . ”
The proposal , obtained by POLITICO , was for a nationwide tea party bus tour , to be called the Tea Party Express , which over the past seven months has become among the most identifiable brands of the tea party movement .
Buses emblazoned with the Tea Party Express logo have brought speakers and entertainers to rallies in dozens of small towns and big cities , including one in Boston on Wednesday that will feature former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .

Aided by campaign - style advance work and event planning , slick ads cut by Russo Marsh , impressive crowds and a savvy media operation , the political action committee run by Wierzbicki , Russo Marsh founder Sal Russo and a handful of other Republican operatives has also emerged as among the prolific fundraising vehicles under the tea party banner .
Known as Our Country Deserves Better when it was founded during the 2008 election as a vehicle to oppose Barack Obama ’s campaign for president , the PAC saw its fundraising more than quadruple after it took the Tea Party Express public in July , raising nearly $ 2.7 million in roughly the following six months , compared with less than $ 600,000 in the preceding six months , according to Federal Election Commission filings .
Its fundraising success has made the PAC — which formally filed with the FEC in October to change its name to “ Our Country Deserves Better PAC–TeaPartyExpress.org ” — a power player in the tea party and beyond , airing hundreds of thousands of dollars in ads supporting Republican campaigns such as Scott Brown ’s successful special election for Senate in Massachusetts and blasting Democratic ones , such as Senate Majority Leader Reid ’s reelection bid in Nevada .
And that fundraising success has also meant a brisk business for Russo March , which essentially runs the PAC .
In that capacity , Russo Marsh and a sister firm called King Media Group have received $ 1.9 million of the $ 4.1 million in payments made by the committee — a financial relationship that is not uncommon between political action committees run by consultants and their consulting firms .
But the Tea Party Express ’s high profile has angered tea party leaders who are suspicious of its big payments to Russo Marsh , view the bus tours as distractions from meaningful grass - roots organizing headed into the 2010 midterm elections and say the Republican ties of both the firm and PAC are wrong for a movement that has prided itself on independence from the political establishment and has fiercely rejected what it sees as GOP efforts to co-opt it .
“ We ’ve worked hard to distance ourselves from the Tea Party Express because of their close affiliation with the Republican Party , the Republican establishment and their PAC , ” said Debbie Dooley , a national coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots , a national umbrella group of local activists .
The Patriots have supported a strict nonpartisan posture but also have struggled to raise money , and Dooley contends that ’s partly because of Tea Party Express .
“ When people donate to Tea Party Express , they think that they are donating to a tea party , because they do n’t read the fine print at the bottom of their e-mails that says it is a PAC , ” she said .
“ And that hurts the local grass - roots tea party organizers , since a lot of that is actually taking some money away from them . ”
Adds Ned Ryun , president of American Majority , a nonprofit group that trains local tea party organizers : “ I ’m concerned that they ’re using ( Tea Party Express ) as a marketing gimmick to line the pockets of consultants instead of actually helping the tea party movement .
People are already pretty fired up , so enough protesting and rallying — they need to be empowered to go back and organize their communities . ”
In a draft of his proposal last April , Wierzbicki seemed to anticipate some of the criticism , broaching the idea of recruiting Eric Odom and Michael Patrick Leahy , among the organizers of the April 15 , 2009 , rallies , or FreedomWorks , the Washington - based nonprofit that has helped organize local tea party groups and events across the country .
“ We can probably pull off a phenomenally successful tour without these big - ego establishment types , ” Wierzbicki wrote in his proposal , cautioning his colleagues that in any effort to woo them “ We have to be very , very careful about discussing amongst ourselves anyone we include ‘ outside of the family ’ because quite frankly , we are not only not part of the political establishment or conservative establishment , but we are also sadly not currently a part of the ‘ tea party ’ establishment . ”
Wierzbicki posited that his PAC ’s lack of establishment tea party backing could be offset by winning over “ local tea party leaders and grass - roots conservatives ” and also by generating buzz including “ mentions and possibly even promotion from conservative / pro-tea party bloggers , talk radio hosts , Fox News commentators , etc … ”
And the PAC ’s focus had to change to reflect the tea party movement .
Wierzbicki told POLITICO that Our Country Deserves Better did this primarily by eschewing some of the national security and social issues on which it focused during the campaign in favor of a narrower concentration on the fiscal issues that unite much of the tea party movement .
But he defends the PAC as having “ a commitment to honoring the principles of the tea party movement . ”
“ There is an integrity to the work we do with Tea Party Express , ” said Wierzbicki , asserting the Express adheres to the five principles emblazoned on the side of its bus , which he summarized as “ end the bailouts , lower taxes , stop government - run health care , end the out - of - control deficits and reduce the size and intrusiveness of the federal government . ”
Before its tea party days , however , the PAC aired ads praising Palin , both during and after her unsuccessful GOP vice presidential campaign , “ for serving the people of America with a servant ’s heart , ” standing up to “ the liberal media ” and teaching her son about “ the honor and valor of serving in our nation ’s armed forces . ”
Other Our Country ads aggressively attacked Obama , sometimes using themes Palin ’s running mate , Republican presidential candidate John McCain , had declared out of bounds .
One reminded voters of “ hateful sermons from Obama 's pastor for over 20 years , ” while footage played featuring former Obama pastor Rev. Jeremiah Wright preaching the words “ God damn America ! ”
Russo — who helped elect former Govs. George Deukmejian of California and George Pataki of New York , among other Republicans , and helped engineer the recall of Democratic California Gov. Gray Davis — said he was actually planning to shutter Our Country Deserves Better after the 2008 election , “ but so many people were telling us that somebody had to stay active and do something .
So we decided that we would do that , but we were n’t clear on exactly what we would do . ”
When the tea party movement picked up steam , Russo said , it made sense for the PAC to join in .
“ We had a good running start , ” he said .
Russo brought with him some of old tricks .
The bus tour , for example , mirrored the cross-country “ Stop Obama Tour ” in which a bus emblazoned with pictures of McCain and Palin flanking the Our Country Deserves Better PAC logo , stopped at 30 pro-McCain / Palin rallies during the final two weeks of October 2008 .
And then , as now , a substantial portion of the PAC ’s spending goes through Russo Marsh and , to a lesser extent , through King Media .
The PAC paid Russo Marsh $ 135,000 in consulting fees and commissions , $ 400,000 for e-mail and Web newsletters and at least $ 650,000 to produce and place television advertisements .
Though some of those sums reflect payments for e-mail address list rentals and television airtime that were passed along to list vendors and television stations , respectively , many of the blast e-mails and television ads served to drum up more attention and cash for the PAC , even as they also touted Republican candidates or attacked Democratic ones .
“ Go to OurCountryPAC.org and help us defeat Nancy Pelosi ’s Democrats , ” one pre-tea party PAC ad instructed viewers .
A more recent offering urged viewers to “ Join the Tea Party Express as we send Bart Stupak packing for an early retirement .
Log on to TeaPartyExpress.org as we fight to defeat Bart Stupak . ”
Kelly Eustis , who was fired from his job as the Our Country Deserves Better ’s political director in October , said the PAC — and particularly the Tea Party Express aspect of it — “ is keeping the firm afloat . ”
Eustis , who started his own PAC and also has been retained to do fundraising consulting for rival tea party groups , said that while he was at Our Country Deserves Better , his colleagues regarded the tea party as “ a brand name .
We stole the brand name to make money . ”
And he charged Russo and Wierzbicki with “ basically hijacking the movement for their personal and business gains without regard for real tea party activists . ”
Russo countered “ we ’re hardly making any money at all .
I ’m a cause - oriented person .
This is not a lucrative business proposition .
It ’s a cause for me .
I believe in what I ’m doing . ”
As for the bus tours , Russo said “ they work for us .
It ’s a great vehicle to go to a lot of places and get a lot of people involved and engaged .
I am proud of what we do .
Who else goes out there and motivates people and insinuates involvement and activity and actually is making a difference in what is going on ? ”
An otter that escaped from the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs just about two weeks ago remains at large .
Kitchi , a 2 - year - old North American river otter , fled his pen on March 25 and zoo officials have been searching for him since .
A day after the escape Kitchi was spotted on a golf course and a camera confirmed the sighting when it grabbed an image of the otter in a culvert on the course .
But after a couple of wet , snowy spells of weather , Kitchi ’s trail has gone cold .
“ There have been no real developments , ” said Sean Anglum , a zoo spokesman .
“ We ’ve been taking calls from the public and checking them out . ”
The zoo has fielded about three dozen calls since it established a hotline after Kitchi ’s escape .
Zoo staff did pickup otter tracks on March 27 and 28 , and they believe Kitchi headed east from the Broadmoor Golf Course , an area where there are lots of ponds and lakes .
Kitchi could be as far east as Fountain Creek by now , Anglum said .
Anyone who spots the otter is asked to take video or photos if possible and report the sighting to the Kitchi hotline at 719 648-7348 .
Kitchi remains the talk of the town .
“ He ’s still at the top of people ’s minds with everybody down here , ” Anglum said .
“ Whether it ’s at meetings or being out in the public , he ’s still on everyone ’s mind . ”
SUMMARY : Tom Paris , navigator of the starship Voyager , discovers a way to travel at warp 10 .
Which , until now , was apparently a “ theoretical impossibility ” , and means the same thing as achieving “ infinite velocity ” .
His test flight is a raging success , except for the part where he mutates and his body can no longer process oxygen or water , and his head expands to twice its normal size and various body parts fall off .
The holographic Doctor races to find a cure , but not before Paris kidnaps Captain Janeway , subjects her to a warp 10 shuttle flight , and causes them both to mutate into … no , no , it ’s just too stupid .
You ’ll never believe me if I just blurt it out like this .
Read the whole recap , and just maybe you ’ll believe an ending this idiotic was actually scripted and filmed .
Well , here we are , at long last .
Star Trek : Voyager .
In particular , the episode “ Threshold ” .
Unlike most recaps on this site , I ’ve been forecasting this one for years .
In fact , I originally promised a recap way back in my very first Worst of Trek outing , “ And the Children Shall Lead ” , which was over three years ago .
Now that it ’s finally here , I can say this episode is every bit as hellacious and awful as I ’ve been alluding to over the years .
But contrary to what I ’ve been implying all along , Voyager as a whole was n’t as bad as everyone says .
Do n’t get me wrong .
It was n’t a great show , or even a good show by any measure .
It had its moments , but in my mind , there is n’t a single episode of Voyager that stands out as one of the best episodes of Star Trek .
Having said that , I will admit the show usually lived up to its ( generally low ) expectations .
With Voyager , you always knew what you would get .

This is as good of an example as you can get of asserting your rights .
Pete is no stranger to filming police and this is the second video of his used by Cop Block .
The first was confronting Arlington police officers about parking their cruiser illegally , which Cop Block is still waiting to hear the outcome of that investigation .
Pete ’s decisions to go to his girlfriends aid , film the police , open carry a firearm , refuse to produce ID and to walk away from the police , without satisfying their request , were all perfectly legal acts .
Though you do n’t ever have to talk to the police , Pete has an educational background in law enforcement , along with a great knowledge of open carry laws .
Therefore , while he still talked to the police and provided them with information , above and beyond what ’s legally required , he did so with caution .
Stating things like , “ yes , I have an ID but am I legally required to show you ? ”
When told he was legally required to ( a lie )
Pete would ask if the officers could show him that statue which states such ?
Pete does this because the police are legally allowed to lie to you , which they did several times in this video , but Pete counters that by asking questions to the officers which would force them to back up their lies .
As you can see they were unable to do that .
After talking with them for a few minutes
Pete stated he was going to leave and why , then slowly backed away .
They did n’t follow him after that and he never had to produce his government issued ID .
There really was no wrong doings by the police officers in this video ( other than the harassment and lying ) as they seemed to be stumped by Pete ’s actions .
Though they have typical cop syndrome of ‘ if you have nothing to hide why do n’t you just give us what we ask for and / or do what we say . ’
You ’d think that with all the police training and on the job experiences they would of quickly came to the conclusion that felons do n’t walk up to cops openly displaying not only a firearm but a camera too .
Do these cops think that Pete is going to film his last five minutes of freedom , if he were a felon ?
I highly doubt it and I ’m speaking from the perspective of a felon ( as I ’m a victim of the drug war ) .
RANDOM COPBLOCK VIDEO PLAYLIST :
So what can be learned from this video ?
A lot , but the two biggest things to me are how Pete always keeps his cool and does n’t get in a shouting match with the officers .
He does n’t try to impress them with a bunch of legal rambling that would make him seem like ‘ a know it all . ’
He lets the officers speak and then replies giving as little information as possible in a calm cool collected manner .
The second is how Pete counters questions with questions .
In most cases , unless driving or suspected of criminal activity , you ’re not required legally to produce ID when asked to by an officer .
Cops phrase it as a request , may I see your ID ?
Which is n’t them telling you to produced it but merely a request to .
Sometimes when asked if you legally have to show them they lie and say yes because they can lie .
Therefore instead of just handing it over ask them , ‘ Am I legally required to do so ? ”
If they say yes then ask to see the law .
If you start to feel uncomfortable remember at any point you can simply stop talking to them .
State that unless you ’re under arrest you ’re just going to go on your way , like Pete does here .
Leaving the cops dumbfounded .
Cop Block is hoping to get more videos like this .
So the next time you see a cop stopping somebody outside your home or down the street grab your camera .
Film them , even if there seems to be nothing going on .
Most likely the cop will ask you why you were filming the stop ?
I tell the police that I ’m filming to hold everyone ( including myself ) accountable .
We need to make this the norm as it ’s a crucial method to holding officers accountable for their actions .
If you ca n’t film the police sharing Cop Block ’s website and social networks is just as helpful .
A lot of senior people in the Republican party do n't like Michael Steele , who became the party 's national committee chairman in 2009 .
And not because he 's African American , either .
They do n't like him because he gives the impression of being an idiot in interviews such as this :
Under Mr Steele 's helm , the " old " may seem inappropriate in the Grand Old Party 's affectionate nickname .
He said he is putting a new public relations team into place to update the party 's image .
" It will be avant garde , technically , " he said .
" It will come to table with things that will surprise everyone - off the hook . "
Does that mean cutting - edge ?
" I do n't do ' cutting - edge , ' " he said .
" That 's what Democrats are doing .
We 're going beyond cutting - edge . "
Some in the Republican party have been trying to force Steele out on the grounds of his poor performance .
Now they have more ammunition in the form of published returns showing that the RNC has spent lavishly during trips around the country – including nearly $ 2,000 on a high - end strip club in West Hollywood .
The Daily Caller website posted the details from Federal Election Commission filings that the party is obliged to report .
It noted :
A February RNC trip to California , for example , included a $ 9,099 stop at the Beverly Hills Hotel , $ 6,596 dropped at the nearby Four Seasons , and $ 1,620.71 spent [ update : the amount is actually $ 1,946.25 ] at Voyeur West Hollywood , a bondage - themed nightclub featuring topless women dancers imitating lesbian sex .
RNC trips to other cities produced bills from a long list of chic and costly hotels such as the Venetian and the M Resort in Las Vegas , and the W ( for a total of $ 19,443 ) in Washington .
A midwinter trip to Hawaii cost the RNC $ 43,828 , not including airfare .
The RNC 's declaration of spending at West Hollywood strip club Voyeur .
Under " purpose of disbursement , " Republican officials put : " Meals " .
Voyeur West Hollywood is , according to the Los Angeles Times , modelled on sex scenes in the awful Stanley Kubrick / Tom Cruise / Nicole Kidman porn film Eyes Wide Shut .
It describes the scene :
The dark , leather - heavy interior is reminiscent of the masked orgy scene from the movie .
The reference is taken a step further with impromptu bondage and S&M " scenes " being played out on an elevated platform by scantily clad performers throughout the night – not presented as " shows , " like they are in clubs such as Playhouse Hollywood .
There is also a heavy net suspended above the club 's lounge area where performers writhe above the heads of clubgoers .
Even more provocative scenes are played out in an enclosed glass booth area adjacent to the club 's dance floor area .
" It 's pretty ... intense , " clubgoer Lee Stone admitted on opening night as one female performer with a horse 's bit in her mouth was being strapped to the wall by another just behind the booth he was sharing with friends .
His friend was more intrigued by the action .
" I wonder if I would get in trouble for joining them ? " she joked .
A recent reviewer on the Yelp website wrote : " There are topless ' dancers ' acting out S&M scenes throughout the night on one of the side stages , there 's a half - naked girl hanging from a net across the ceiling and at one point I walked to the bathroom and pretty much just stopped dead in my tracks to watch two girls simulating oral sex in a glass case .
Really understated elegance here . "
Classy .
According to the Daily Caller 's piece : " Steele himself declined numerous interview requests , though his defenders point out that luxurious accommodations are sometimes necessary to attract big - time donors , especially since Republicans remain in the minority in Washington . "
Update : The Republican National Committee has now put out a statement responding to the Daily Caller article and denying that Steele himself was at Voyeur .
It describes the $ 1,946 bill as " a reimbursement made to a non-committee staffer " .
Here 's the full statement :
We are investigating the expenditure in question .
The story willfully and erroneously suggests that the expenditure in question was one belonging to the chairman [ Michael Steele ] .
This was a reimbursement made to a non-committee staffer .
The chairman was never at the location in question , he had no knowledge of the expenditure , nor does he find the use of committee funds at such a location at all acceptable .
Good reporting would make that distinction crystal clear .
The committee has requested that the monies be returned to the committee and that the story be corrected so that it is accurate .
Updated update : Tucker Carlson , the editor of the Daily Caller , has responded forcefully to the RNC statement :
To be clear :
We did not claim that Michael Steele personally visited Voyeur West Hollywood .
In fact , and unfortunately , we still know almost nothing about that trip , including its purpose .
If the RNC provides details , we 'll put them on the site immediately .
The Daily Caller requested interviews with Michael Steele on Jan. 14 , Jan. 15 , Jan. 18 , Feb. 10 , Feb. 23 and again on March 23 .
All were denied .
The story we ran today is accurate , as the RNC knows .
This one will run and run .
The FCC is set to share the nation 's first official broadband plan with Congress Tuesday – a sort of Declaration of the Internet that seeks to ensure that a fast broadband connection is just as much an unalienable right as life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
That 's pretty ambitious , but the FCC is as unambiguous about its intentions as the colonists were about throwing off the yoke of another form of oppression .
For example , goal No. 3 states that " Every American should have affordable access to robust broadband service , and the means and skills to subscribe if they so choose . "
Still the plan , put together by the FCC after months of hearings and public comment periods , is pragmatic and reformist in its details , rather than revolutionary .
That is , at least according to a summary ( .pdf ) released Monday .
The FCC is calling for more competition among broadband providers , more spectrum for wireless data services , subsidies for rural and poor citizens , and education for the digitally challenged .
There 's a little bit for every constituency , from those who worry most about the digital divide to those who see a future where all health records are digitized and networked .
There 's not much for those who dreamed of a drastic call for an all - fiber network to be built and subsidized by the government .
There is , in fact , no government building of public networks at all .
Nor is there much in the way of support for municipalities and states .
And for those itching for a confrontation between users and the big telecoms , the plan will disappoint since it steers clear of controversial topics such whether the wireless industry has to follow the same open requirements now applied to DSL and cable companies , and whether those who own the infrastructure connecting people to the net have to rent their lines to competing services at a fair price .
The plan recommendations are split between those steps that Congress should take , and those that the FCC can implement with its own procedures .
The latter recommendations include increasing competition between broadband providers by collecting more data on broadband pricing , performance and competition and requiring broadband providers to give feds more information about what areas they service and at what speed .
To promote wireless broadband , the FCC says it want to free up more spectrum for wireless data usage — recommending that 500 megahertz be freed up in next 10 years and 300 of that made available for mobile use in the next five years .
This is the centerpiece of the plan , because if the agency can get spectrum back from TV broadcasters and auction it to the telecoms , it could bring in a lot of money that can fund the rest of the plan .
The plan also wants to make it easier for infrastructure to be built and run .
For instance , it could reduce the price of renting space on a utility tower .
The plan also call for new rules for cable set - top boxes , the ones that most people rent from their cable company .
The FCC wants to make it simpler for outside companies to make these boxes in the hopes that some company will make a version that combines chat , social networking sites and search right into the television .
The FCC also wants to subsidize broadband using the Universal Service Fund , which currently uses fees from phone companies to subsidize low - income phone users and rural health care .
That re-jiggering would involve moving around some 15 billion in subsidies over the next decade .
The FCC also wants to create a Digital Literacy Corps of adults and youth to help those who want to get online , but who do n't understand it or are intimidated by it .
The FCC also wants a hand in turning the electric grid into the e-grid , complete with smart meters that let people see what they are using and even sell energy back into the grid if they have solar panels .
In terms of safety and security , the FCC proposes creating a nationwide wireless network dedicated to public safety and emergency workers .
While the proposal suggests that Congress put a few billion dollars a year for the next few years into broadband subsidies , the FCC says that it will be able to cover the costs of the new plan from spectrum auctions , provided all goes to plan and broadcasters play nicely .
Early reactions to the FCC's have been positive , though no one seems overjoyed at the pragmatic plan .
The Consumer Federation of America called it a " significant first step in the right direction . "
Public Knowledge president Gigi Sohn referred to it as a " balanced , comprehensive and forward - looking plan that should serve the country well . "
The wireless industry says it 's happy the FCC " recognized the importance of the mobile internet to the economy and to meeting many national priorities " and wants to give it more spectrum .
Once Congress gets the report , there will be hearings and speeches and lobbying , but likely there wo n't be too much action from Congress until the nation 's health care plan has been taken care of .
But the FCC can continue to work on its own , and the government is continuing to pass out $ 7 billion in stimulus grants and loans to broadband projects around the country , which are independent of the national broadband plan .
Tellingly , there is no call in the broadband plan for Congress to set aside large chunks of new money to help extend broadband networks around the country , relying instead on competition and subsidies to achieve that goal .

Advertisement Royal Mail has stopped deliveries to a house in Leeds after postal workers came under attack from an elderly cat .
Tiger is said to have scratched postal workers and chased them down the garden path at his home in High Bank Street , Farsley , over the past few weeks .
Owner Tracy Brayshaw , who must now pick up mail from the nearest sorting office , said the ban was " a bit silly " .
She added : " We 're talking about a 19 - year - old geriatric cat here who likes lazing out in the sun . "
Mrs Brayshaw , 43 , a pharmacy dispenser , said the black - and - white cat slept for 20 hours a day but was always ready to pounce on unsuspecting staff .
' Not a monster '
She said : " There have been three incidents where Tiger 's jumped through the cat flap and is said to have scratched a postie , so they 've decided to suspend our post .
" He 's never done anything like this before . "
Mrs Brayshaw 's daughter , Amy , 17 , said : " Tiger sleeps , he drools when he sleeps and he likes climbing trees , but in the space of three weeks we 've had our post banned because he has attacked the postman .
Tiger is said to like lying in the sun and climbing trees " Apparently he attacked one postman on the leg and on the arm and chased him down the garden path .
" He is very territorial but he 's just an average cat really .
We are all saying it 's health and safety gone mad .
" He wakes up in the middle of the night meowing because he just wants some attention .
He 's not a monster . "
In a statement Royal Mail said : " We are sorry for the inconvenience to Mrs Brayshaw and , as we want to resume delivery of mail to her address as quickly as possible , we 're trying to agree a way to do this and avoid our employees suffering further nasty injuries , as has happened three times already .

Brussels wants people to more happy to access the internet when abroad A new Europe - wide rule to prevent mobile phone users from building up large bills for surfing the internet via their handset has come into force .
Customers can now require their phone firm to cut them off when their bill reaches a certain level after accessing the internet in other European nations .
If users do not put in place a limit by 1 July , it will automatically be set at 50 euros ( $ 65 ; £ 45 ) .
The phone firms will have to warn users when their bill hits 80 % of the limit .
Accessing the internet via your mobile phone while abroad is called " data roaming " .
European Commissioner for Digital Agenda , Neelie Kroes , said : " Protection against data roaming bill shocks is a useful step towards building customers ' confidence to use mobile networks to surf the internet when travelling around Europe .
" Such confidence is essential if people and businesses are to use the internet to its full potential . "
The Commission added that if service providers did not honour people 's set spending limits , national regulators would deal with complaints and impose any necessary sanctions .
Commission spokesman Jonathan
Todd said the move was likely to reduce the cost of data roaming across Europe .
" This measure is likely to bring down the cost of data roaming , because if people stick to their own cash limits and find they do n't get much access to the internet for their money , the tendency will be to bring down prices so you get more surfing for your money , " he said .

The Odds of Finding a SET in The Card Game SET ®
SET ® is a card game using a special deck of cards .
( SET is a registered trademark of Cannei , LLC .
SET cards © 1988 Cannei , LLC .
All rights reserved .
Used with permission from Set Enterprises , Inc. )
Initially , 12 cards are dealt face - up into a shared 4×3 layout , like this :
Players simultaneously try to find a SET : three cards in which each of the four features of the card ( color , shape of symbols , number of symbols , and shading ) have either all the same value or all different values .
For example , this is a SET :
All three cards have different colors ; all have different symbols ; all have different numbers of symbols ; and all have the same shading .
This is not a SET :
All three cards have different colors ; all are diamonds ; all have one symbol ; however , two have open shading and one is filled .
SET is a fun game , whether or not you have kids in middle school math class .
( You can buy it here if you want ; note it gets 85 % 5 - star reviews and 96 % 4 or 5 stars . )
The rules say that when a SET of three cards is found , the three cards are removed and replaced by three more from the deck .
If at any point there is no SET of three cards in the array , then 3 more cards are added .
The instruction booklet says that the odds against there being no SET in 12 cards is 33:1 , and the odds against no SET in 15 cards is a whopping 2500:1 .
However , in playing the game , we were stymied more often than that with 12 cards , and even once with 15 cards ( as shown in this crappy cell - phone - photo ) :
So one of the following must be happening :
We were unlucky to get a one - in - 2500 array of 15 cards in our first day of playing .
We did n't recognize a SET that is actually there .
The instruction book is completely wrong .
The instruction book correctly gives the odds for an initial deal of 12 ( or 15 ) cards , but in the course of playing the game , removing SETs and adding more cards .
the odds change .
I hoped that the answer was 4 , and I built a simulation to check .
Here are the results —
First , when dealing 12 ( or 15 ) cards into a fresh layout and checking whether there is a SET , I get :
Size | SETs | NoSETs | SET : NoSET ratio for initial layout
-----+--------+--------+----------------
12 | 96,701 | 3,299 | 29:1 15 | 99,962 | 38 | 2631:1
Size | SETs | NoSETs | SET : NoSET ratio for game play
-----+--------+--------+----------------
12 | 86,260 | 5,692 | 15:1 15 | 5,433 | 48 | 113:1 18 | 47 | 0 | inft:1
This agrees reasonably well with the ratios stated in the instructions ( 33:1 and 2500:1 ) .
But now if we simulate playing a game , removings and replacing them with new cards , and tallying how often there is or is not awith an array of different sizes , we get :
These ratios are quite different .
The chances for finding noamong 12 cards has doubled .
And the odds of finding nowith 15 cards has jumped by 20 - fold .
Thus , it seems the answer is my choice 4 — the odds change over th course of a game .
Two problems remain .
The first is to update the odds in the instruction booklet .
I 've let the good folks at setgame.com know , and hope they can fix it in the next printing .
But more interesting is the problem of why the odds change so dramatically .
At first I thought it was because players were picking up the " good " cards to make SETs , leaving the " poor " cards , which are less likely to make a SET .
But what makes a card good or poor ?
As Gregory Quenell points out in this presentation , each of the 81 cards participates in the same number of SETs , 40 , and each pair of cards participates in exactly one SET .
( That means there is a total of 1080 distinct SETs : 81 × 80 × 1 / 3 ! = 1080 . )
So there is no such thing as a " good " card , or a " good " pair of cards .
Instead , I think what is happening is that when the initial 12 cards are dealt , there might be 0 , 1 , 2 , or more SETs in the array .
If there was 1 , then when you pick up that SET and replace it with three new cards , you only get three chances to form a SET with one of the new cards .
The act of picking up a set makes it less likely that a set remains in the array , and the odds of generating a new set are somewhat lower since you only get 3 shots at it .
I did another experiment where I tallied the results only for layouts where there are no SETs in the initial *n* - 3 cards ; I then add 3 cards and see if there is a SET .
Here 's what I found :
Size | SETs | NoSETs | SET : NoSET ratio for initial layout , but no SETs before dealing last 3 cards -----+--------+--------+----------------
12 | 26,415 | 3,330 | 8:1 15 | 3,294 | 36 | 92:1
The results for an array of size 15 is roughly the same as when we play the game normally , which it should be , because in playing the game normally we only go to 15 cards when there is noin 12 cards .
But the ratio for an array of size 12 shows half as manys as in playing the game normally , and a quarter as many as the initial deal .
I take this as evidence that supports my theory that the ratio of no-s goes up ass are removed from the array .

It has now emerged from comments by Martin Whitmarsh to Autosport.com that McLaren do indeed have a link between their rear wing and the snorkel on the top of the chassis .
While a link between the two parts emerged during testing as they were both fitted with the same aero testing set up , it is only now that the full picture has emerged .
Using the driver to interact with the snorkel feeding the rear wing and its attendant slot , the wing can ‘ stall ’ increasing straightline speed when the driver needs it .
How its done …
The snorkel on the top of the chassis feeds a duct passing down inside the footwell , its position is some where around the pedals , most probably it runs down alongside the brake pedal \footrest so as to avoid the mandatory padding inside the cockpit .
This duct has a ‘ hole ’ in it to ‘ cool ’ the driver inside the cockpit .
However the duct continues inside the chassis , past the fuel tank and up and over the airbox ( probably passing by the hatch fitted high up on the engine cover ) , then through the shark fin and into the rear wing flap .
When the driver places his foot\leg over the ‘ hole ’ the flow is diverted into the rest of the duct and this feeds the slot on the rear wing flap .
There is enough airflow through the convoluted duct to disrupt the airflow under the rear of the wing , effectively breaking up the flow around the wing .
This is what F1 aerodynamicists term a ‘ stalled ’ condition , although this is different to the term ‘ stall ’ used in aeronautical aerodynamics .
In this ‘ stalled ’ state , the strong spiralling flows coming off the wing , that lead to the huge drag penalty a highly loaded F1 wing incurs , break up .
With out these flows and their resulting drag penalty , the car is able to get to a higher top speed , by around 3 - 4 k ph .
When the driver is ready to brake for the next corner , he releases foot\leg and the airflow passes back into the cockpit and the rear wing flow reattaches , creating downforce and its attendant drag .
In this format the car can lap normally with its wings delivering maximum downforce .
This set up is legal as the rear wing slot in itself is legal ( used by McLaren , BMW Sauber last year ) .
There is no specific working to prevent wing stalling in the rules .
There are no moving aerodynamic parts , except perhaps for the drivers foot\leg .
It ’s a piece of interpretive genius , but perhaps as far removed from the spirit of the rules as you can get .
What now
Of course now its deemed legal , teams can either formally protest it or adopt it themselves .
Doing the the latter is possible for most teams , as they have apertures in the footwell area to fit a snorkel , while the shark fin and rear wing are easily created .
But , finding a route for the duct out of the tub might prove the headache , as the monocoque may not have any openings sufficiently large enough .
This year the monocoque is also is subject to homologation and hence cannot be altered until the 2011 season .
Of course ‘ where there ’s a will , there ’s a way ’ , teams will not want to lose a straight line speed advantage .
Defying US , Pakistan wo n’t extradite captured Taliban leaders
The US Air Force plans to deliver 1,000 laser - guided bomb kits to Pakistan this month to help Islamabad in its offensive against militants on the Afghan border , a spokesman said on Tuesday .
The Air Force is providing the kits after having delivered 1,000 MK - 82 bombs last month to Pakistan ’s military , Lieutenant Colonel Jeffry Glenn told AFP .

The US military assistance underscored Washington ’s role in backing Pakistan ’s months - long campaign against Taliban and Al - Qaeda militants .
The bombs come less than a week after Pakistan apparently defied multiple requests by American and Afghanistan officials to extradite Taliban leaders that it had recently detained .
The Pakistani air force was playing “ a big part ” in operations against the Islamic extremists , Air Force Secretary Michael Donley said .
“ As they had ramped up operations , they ’re looking for ways to get additional capability , ” he told a gathering of defense reporters .
Pakistan ’s air force chief had visited Washington last year and made additional requests for US military assistance , he said .

Donley said the Pentagon had arranged for “ expedited ” delivery of the MK - 82 bombs , which weigh 500 pounds each .
The United States also was due to deliver 18 additional F - 16 fighter jets to Pakistan in June , outfitted with sophisticated night - vision equipment , Glenn said .
Confirmation of the arms deal came as Pakistan on Tuesday revealed a vast Taliban and Al - Qaeda hideout dug into mountains near the Afghan border , captured in an offensive against militants .

Pakistan seized the complex in its latest offensive against militants in its semi-autonomous tribal belt , following US pressure on the country to eliminate Taliban and Al - Qaeda - linked groups who attack Western troops in Afghanistan .
President Barack Obama ’s administration has pledged stepped up military assistance and development aid to Pakistan , which Washington sees as a vital ally in the fight against Al - Qaeda and Taliban militants .

Defying US , Pakistan wo n’t extradite captured Taliban leaders
“ The refusal of Pakistani intelligence to turn over Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and as many as six other top Taliban figures to the United States or the Afghan government has dealt a serious blow to the Barack Obama administration ’s hopes for Pakistani cooperation in weakening the Taliban , ” investigative journalist and historian Gareth Porter writes in an analysis published by IPS .
It has left little doubt in the minds of U.S. officials that the Pakistani military intends to keep physical custody of the Taliban detainees in order to exert influence on both the pace of peace negotiations in Afghanistan and the ultimate terms of a settlement .
The Pakistani custody of Baradar and other Taliban leaders now appears to be more of a safe haven for the Afghan insurgents than a normal detention .
At least some U.S. officials already accept the likelihood that the Pakistanis will allow the Taliban leaders to continue to maintain contact with other Taliban officials while in custody . ….
That Pakistani refusal of access frustrated the CIA , which was eager to interrogate Baradar about details of the Taliban ’s operations and finance .
During those crucial two weeks , U.S. intelligence officials got no information that would lead them to the rest of the Taliban leadership .
U.S. intelligence officials doubt that they can get the truth from Baradar as long he is in Pakistani military custody , according to the Los Angeles Times .

Porter notes that last “ Friday , a provincial high court in Pakistan ’s Punjab province delivered what appeared to be the final blow to the prospects for extradition of Baradar and four other Taliban leaders to Afghanistan .
The court blocked any extradition by Pakistan of the Taliban leaders to any country until the issue of the detainees ’ rights could be heard by the court . ”
Military blogger Bill Roggio reports that “ Lahore High Court has prohibited the Pakistani government from transferring Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar , the Afghan Taliban ’s second in command , and four other members of the Quetta Shura to foreign custody after receiving a petition from a lawyer with known links to the Taliban and al Qaeda . ”
The petition was written by “ Khalid Khawaja , a self - described humans rights activist with deep ties to the Taliban , al Qaeda , and a host of terrorist groups operating on Pakistani soil .
Khawaja is a former Squadron Commander in the Pakistani Air Force who fought alongside al Qaeda and reportedly Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan in the 1980s .
He has also been linked to the murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl . ”
“ The Pakistani government could appeal the court decision , but officials in Islamabad told CBS News there are no plans for such an appeal at present , ” Porter wrote for IPS .
ADVERTISEMENT
Even before the court intervened in the issue , however , any hopes the Obama administration and the U.S. military might have had that Pakistan was prepared to sell out its former Taliban allies had already waned .
The Times story on Wednesday quoted a “ top American official ” who had met with Pakistani Army chief Ashfaq Kayani “ recently ” – presumably Defence Secretary Robert Gates , who had met with Kayani Jan. 21 – who did not seem confident about the prospects of getting control of the Taliban leaders .
The official said , “ We ’ll know soon whether this is cooperation , or a stonewall and kind of rope a dope . ”
The official was referring to a number of past episodes in which the Pakistani military was ostensibly supporting U.S. policy in Afghanistan while it continued to support the Taliban .
Editor ’s note : Gareth Porter reported for RAW STORY in November of 2008 that “ Documents linking Iran to nuclear weapons push may have been fabricated . ”
In 2006 , RAW STORY carried a few reports by Bill Roggio during an embedment in Iraq .
( with AFP report )
The duchess is said to be in good spirits after the accident Camilla , the Duchess of Cornwall , has broken her left leg while hill - walking in Scotland , Clarence House has said .
The duchess , 62 , suffered a twisted fracture of her left fibula when she fell on Wednesday .
Clarence House said although doctors advised her not to put any weight on the leg , she would continue to carry out all her official engagements .
Camilla had been staying at Birkhall , the Prince of Wales ' private home on the Queen 's Balmoral estate .
Plaster cast
The break was confirmed following an x-ray on Thursday .
Prince Charles was at Balmoral on Wednesday but not with her at the time of the fall , which happened during their annual Easter break at the estate .
The Clarence House website says the couple " enjoy fishing and walking in the Scottish countryside and often undertake engagements in the local area " .
But it would not disclose the exact location of the accident or the hospital where Camilla was treated .
In a statement , Clarence House said : " Yesterday while hill - walking in slippery conditions in Scotland , the Duchess of Cornwall took a tumble and hurt her leg ...
" Consequently her royal highness is wearing a plaster cast and will be for six weeks . "
The BBC 's royal correspondent , Nicholas Witchell , said Clarence House advised that this was " not a serious injury " although the duchess 's leg is fractured .
' Good spirits '
The duchess needed help getting down the hill after she fell but she did not realise she had fractured her leg .
Our correspondent said she had an x-ray because the duchess 's leg was still sore the morning after it happened .
Clarence House reported her to be in " good spirits " , he added .
A twisted fracture is a relatively common injury , according to an expert in accident and emergency treatment .
Martin Shalley , a retired A&E consultant at Birmingham 's Heartlands Hospital , said it was " a natural extension of a bad sprain " .
" Usually , as the ankle twists , you may damage a ligament and then carry on .
Sometimes , rather than the ligament being damaged , the bone cracks . "
Mr Shalley , who is former president of the College of Emergency Medicine , added : " It 's usually not very serious .
It 's fairly common .
We see it quite often . "
He said complications were rare , and although the injury could prove quite painful , sometimes people were not aware they had fractured the bone because they did not bother to have it checked .
The duchess had had to cancel a number of engagements during a tour to eastern Europe recently because of the pain caused by a trapped nerve in her back .
In 2008 - 2009 , The Prince of Wales carried out 658 official engagements , while his wife carried out 225 .

On Feb. 24 , as I reported in " The Black Hole of Guantánamo , " Judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr. granted the habeas corpus petition of Uthman Abdul Rahim Mohammed Uthman , a Yemeni who was seized crossing the border from Afghanistan to Pakistan in December 2001 .
In the absence of the judge ’s unclassified opinion explaining why he had ordered his release , I provided only a brief explanation of what was publicly known of his story , stating :
" As I explained in my book The Guantánamo Files , Uthman , who was 22 years old at the time of his capture , ‘ said that he had traveled between Kabul and Khost teaching the Koran from March to December 2001 . ’
Although he ‘ admitted that he had stayed at a Taliban house in Quetta , Pakistan , which was the normal entry point for volunteers who had come to fight with the Taliban , ’ he stated that this was ‘ only because he had been told that it was the only way for him to enter Afghanistan . ’ "
Judge Kennedy ’s opinion was released a month ago [ . pdf ] but was then abruptly withdrawn , and , perhaps with unnecessary delicacy , I held off from analyzing it , waiting for it to be reissued , as I was uncertain how much would be redacted .
When the revised opinion was finally released on April 21 [ .pdf ] , I realized that the name of a criminal investigator with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service had been removed , as had other named operatives , but that other key elements had not ; specifically , the names of two other prisoners who alleged that Uthman " acted as a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden . "
These two men are Sharqwi Abdu Ali al - Hajj and Sanad Yislam Ali al - Kazimi , and in the most important part of the opinion , Judge Kennedy stated , " The Court will not rely on the statements of Hajj or Kazimi because there is unrebutted evidence in the record that , at the time of the interrogations at which they made the statements , both men had recently been tortured . "
The Torture of Sharqwi Abdu Ali al - Hajj
This , alarmingly , was something of an understatement .
Al - Hajj ( also identified as Abdu Ali Sharqawi , but more commonly known as Riyadh the Facilitator ) was seized in a house raid in Pakistan in February 2002 and was then rendered to Jordan , one of at least 15 prisoners whose torture was outsourced to the Jordanian authorities between 2001 and 2004 , where he was held for nearly two years before being transferred to the CIA ’s " Dark Prison " near Kabul , and then , via Bagram , to Guantánamo .
As Judge Kennedy explained , he told his lawyer , Kristin B. Wilhelm , that , " while held in Jordan , he ‘ was regularly beaten and threatened with electrocution and molestation , ’ and he eventually ‘ manufactured facts ’ and confessed to his interrogators ’ allegation ‘ in order to make the torture stop . ’ "
In the " Dark Prison , " he added , he was " kept in complete darkness and was subject to continuous loud music . "
Al - Hajj ’s descriptions of the " Dark Prison " correspond with those of numerous other prisoners , including the British resident Binyam Mohamed , whose descriptions were included in my article " A History of Music Torture in the ‘ War on Terror . ’ "
However , what is missing from the analysis of his time in Jordan is a more sustained narrative of torture , false confessions , and his torturers ’ regular contact with the CIA , which emerged in a letter given to Joanne Mariner of Human Rights Watch during a visit to Jordan in 2008 , which had been written by al - Hajj during his detention , around October 2002 .
In this note , which was smuggled out of the prison , he explained that he " was held as a secret prisoner by the Jordanian intelligence service : unregistered , cut off from all communication , and hidden during visits by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross , " and gave the following " short summary of my sufferings , " as reported by Mariner :
" ’ They beat me up in a way that does not know mercy , ’ Sharqawi wrote , referring to his Jordanian captors , ‘ and they ’re still beating me .
They threatened me with electricity , with snakes and dogs . …
[ They said ] we ’ll make you see death . ’
Sharqawi described his interrogations , explaining that the Jordanians were feeding his responses back to the CIA .
‘ Every time that the interrogator asks me about a certain piece of information , and I talk , ’ Sharqawi said , ‘he asks me if I told this to the Americans .
And if I say no he jumps for joy , and he leaves me and goes to report it to his superiors , and they rejoice . ’ "
In Human Rights Watch ’s final report , " Double Jeopardy , " the extent to which he was interrogated about other men – using photos that , in Afghanistan and Guantánamo , were apparently described as " the family album " – was revealed in the following passage , which not only explains the pressures that led to him providing a false allegation against Uthman Abdul Rahim Mohammed Uthman in Bagram , but also indicates how hundreds – or thousands – of other false allegations may have been extracted :
" I was being interrogated all the time , in the evening and in the day .
I was shown thousands of photos , and I really mean thousands , I am not exaggerating . …
And in between all this you have the torture , the abuse , the cursing , humiliation .
They had threatened me with being sexually abused and electrocuted .
I was told that if I wanted to leave with permanent disability both mental and physical , that that could be arranged .
They said they had all the facilities of Jordan to achieve that .
I was told that I had to talk , I had to tell them everything . "
The Torture of Sanad al - Kazimi
The story of Sanad al - Kazimi ’s false confession is just as distressing .
Seized in the United Arab Emirates in January 2003 , he was subsequently handed over to U.S. forces , who rendered him to an unidentified secret CIA prison , and then to the " Dark Prison " and Bagram , and , as Judge Kennedy explained , he told his lawyer , Martha Rayner , that , " while [ he ] was detained outside the United States , his interrogators beat him ; held him naked and shackled in a cold dark cell ; dropped him into cold water while his hands and legs were bound ; and sexually abused him .
Kazimi told Rayner that eventually " [ h ]e made up his mind to say ‘ Yes ’ to anything the interrogators said to avoid further torture . "
After this he was relocated to the " Dark Prison , " where , he said , " he was always in darkness and … was hooded , given injections , beaten , hit with electric cables , suspended from above , made to be naked , and subjected to continuous loud music .
Kazimi reportedly tried to kill himself on three occasions .
He told Rayner that he realized ‘he could mitigate the torture by telling the interrogators what they wanted to hear . ’ "
At Bagram , he continued , " he was isolated , shackled , ‘ psychologically tortured and traumatized by guards ’ desecration of the Koran ’ and interrogated ‘ day and night , and very frequently . ’
[ He ] told Rayner that he ‘ tried very hard ’ to tell his interrogators in Bagram the same information he had told his previous interrogators ‘ so they would not hurt him . ’ "
This is damning enough , but back in August 2007 , Jane Mayer of the New Yorker spoke to Ramzi Kassem , another of al - Kazimi ’s lawyers , who , as I explained in an article at the time , added further details , telling her that :
" [ Al - Kazimi ] was ‘ suspended by his arms for long periods , causing his legs to swell painfully . …
It ’s so traumatic , he can barely speak of it .
He breaks down in tears . ’
He also said that al - Kazimi ‘ claimed that , while hanging , he was beaten with electric cables , ’ and explained that he also told him that , while in the ‘ Dark Prison , ’ he ‘ attempted suicide three times , by ramming his head into the walls ’ :
‘ He did it until he lost consciousness .
Then they stitched him back up .
So he did it again .
The next time he woke up , he was chained , and they ’d given him tranquilizers .
He asked to go to the bathroom , and then he did it again . ’
On this last occasion , Kassem added , he ‘ was given more tranquilizers , and chained in a more confining manner . ’ "
The Story of Uthman Abdul Rahim Mohammed Uthman
These accounts , sadly , fit a pattern of torture and false confessions that only becomes clearer as time passes and more evidence is revealed , and they also confirm that the two men described above were amongst the 94 prisoners – many still unaccounted for – who were held in secret CIA prisons and subjected to particularly brutal treatment [ . pdf ] .
Compared to them , Uthman ’s own story is easily overshadowed .
This is perhaps understandable , as nothing in the government ’s supposed evidence thoroughly refutes his own assertions that he was in Afghanistan as a missionary , because the entire case against him is based on allegations made by other prisoners ( in addition to al - Hajj and al - Kazimi ) , or attempts to imply guilt by association on the part of the government that make him something of a cipher in his own case .
Throughout the rest of the judge ’s opinion , further attempts by the government to prove that Uthman was a bodyguard for bin Laden , that he trained in an al - Qaeda camp and was present at the battle of Tora Bora ( where al - Qaeda and the Taliban fought the U.S. military and its Afghan proxies in November and December 2001 ) are bedeviled with identifications based on a photograph and a variety of kunyas ( nicknames ) that Judge Kennedy found unconvincing .
The only allegations given any substantial weight are claims that an individual who " supported jihad " financed his trip , that he followed a route that was typically used by al - Qaeda recruits , and that he was seen in two guesthouses in Afghanistan that were reportedly associated with al - Qaeda .
Other prisoners drift in and out of this narrative – Abdul Hakim Bukhari , a Saudi ( released from Guantánamo in September 2007 ) who arrived in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks for jihad but was imprisoned as a spy , who unconvincingly alleged that Uthman " was a member of the Osama bin Laden … security detail " before 9/11 , when Bukhari was n’t in the country and could have had no such knowledge ; and Richard Belmar , a British citizen ( released in January 2005 ) , who was seized in Pakistan in February 2002 , and who , " when shown a picture of Uthman , " stated that he " ’may have been a lower amir , ’ or leader , ‘ in the Kandahar guest house , ’ " even though , as seems apparent , Belmar was not in Kandahar at the same time as Uthman .
The judge refused to disregard this statement entirely , but , to be honest , it is difficult to see why not , as its basis in reality appears to be as flimsy as everything else thrown at Uthman by the government in the hope that some of it would stick , and , moreover , Belmar stated on his release that , on one occasion in Bagram , " a handgun was forced into his mouth , " and he explained , " It tasted cold , bitter .
I thought , ‘ Yeah , this is getting serious , there ’s a good chance they will pull the trigger . ’ "
Elsewhere , the government resorted to trying out guilt by association , claiming that , because Uthman was seized in the vicinity of Tora Bora with approximately 30 other men , " a few of whom he knew from Yemen , " who " were admitted – or at least , alleged , al - Qaeda members , some of whom were likely coming from Tora Bora , " the court should draw an inference that Uthman ’s missionary story was a lie .
The truth , to be honest , is difficult to establish , as Judge Kennedy recognized .
The group of approximately 30 men with whom Uthman was seized have long been referred to by the government as the " Dirty Thirty " and portrayed , as in Uthman ’s case , as bodyguards for bin Laden .
Until this case came to court , it had been presumed that the bodyguard allegations came solely from Mohamed al - Qahtani , the supposed 20th hijacker for the 9/11 attacks , whose torture at Guantánamo is well - known ( and was admitted by Pentagon official Susan Crawford in January 2009 ) , but al - Qahtani is mysteriously absent from Uthman ’s case , as are alleged al - Qaeda member Ibrahim al - Qosi ( currently facing a trial by military commission ) and convicted al - Qaeda member Ali Hamza al - Bahlul , who were also captured at this time .
It may dismay the government to have to concede that it is all but impossible to establish that everyone seized at this time was part of al - Qaeda , and that some of the men may have been missionaries or humanitarian aid workers , attempting to flee the chaos of post - invasion Afghanistan as part of general Arab exodus , but it is not beyond the bounds of reason that this is the case , as Judge Kennedy accepted in his conclusion , when he stated :
" In sum , the Court gives credence to evidence that Uthman ( 1 ) studied at a school at which other men were recruited to fight for al - Qaeda ; ( 2 ) received money for his trip to Afghanistan from an individual who supported jihad ; ( 3 ) traveled to Afghanistan along a route also taken by al - Qaeda recruits ; ( 4 ) was seen at two al - Qaeda guesthouses in Afghanistan ; and ( 5 ) was with al - Qaeda members in the vicinity of Tora Bora after the battle that occurred there .
" Even taken together , these facts do not convince the Court by a preponderance of the evidence that Uthman received and executed orders from al - Qaeda .
Although this information is consistent with the proposition that Uthman was a part of al - Qaeda , it is not proof of that allegation .
As explained , the record does not contain reliable evidence that Uthman was a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden or fought for al - Qaeda .
Certainly , none of the facts respondents have demonstrated are true are direct evidence of fighting or otherwise ‘ receiv[ing ] and execut[ing ] orders ’ … and they do not , even together , paint an incriminating enough picture to demonstrate that the inferences respondents ask the Court to make are more likely accurate than not .
Associations with al - Qaeda members , or institutions to which al - Qaeda members have connections , are not alone enough to demonstrate that , more likely than not , Uthman was part of al - Qaeda . "
In granting Uthman ’ habeas petition , Judge Kennedy added that , " at first blush , " some of the government ’s evidence was " quite incriminating of Uthman and supportive of the position that he is lawfully detained , " but that , on close examination , there was " reason not credit some of it at all and reason to conclude that what remains is not nearly as probative of respondent ’s position as they assert . "
An Alarming Conclusion
This is indeed the case , but what is missing from Judge Kennedy ’s conclusion , but is glaringly obvious from his opinion as a whole , is that the shadows which never quite coalesce around the barely fleshed - out figure of Uthman Abdul Rahim Mohammed Uthman are populated not by reliable witnesses , but by a procession of torture victims or other prisoners worn out by endless interrogation , who , when shown photographs , invented stories to get the torture to stop , or to get the interrogators off their back .
As a demonstration of how to produce false confessions to incriminate insignificant prisoners at Guantánamo , it would be harder to find a document that more perfectly expresses the brutal pointlessness of the " War on Terror " than this opinion , and when the bigger picture is examined – Sharqwi Abdu Ali al - Hajj ‘s statement that , in Jordan , " I was shown thousands of photos , and I really mean thousands " – the scale of this shocking witch - hunt is explicitly revealed .
Beyond Guantánamo , where habeas judges are not empowered to tread , who knows how many other men were seized because of false confessions made through the use of torture ?

An IDF force on Sunday uncovered three mines hidden near the border fence in central Gaza .
The mines were meant to explode during army patrols .
The mines were anti-vehicle devices apparently placed there recently .
They were dismantled without causing injury or damage .
It remains unclear when the mines were planted , but army officials estimated that they were placed near the border sometime during the past few days .
The mines that were found are capable of causing extensive damage to armored vehicles , including tanks .
They contain up to 10 kilograms ( 22 pounds ) of explosives and require an applied pressure of only a few hundred kilograms to detonate .
IDF officials said the discovery of the mines proves that armed Palestinian groups in the Hamas - ruled territory are developing new methods of operation in order to attack Israeli forces .
Three IDF soldiers were killed near the Gaza border last month .

Accountancy has a reputation for dullness but its history is the history of civilisation itself , from the evolution of government and taxation to trade and capitalism .
It has also provided a paper trail through some of the darker periods of human history .
At first sight it looks like the income statement for any factory .
It starts with the daily wage bill , and deals with the costs of uniform and other running expenses , all properly amortised .
But then comes an odd line : the projected income per worker is adjusted so that it covers not one year , but only nine months .
For this is no ordinary factory , but Buchenwald concentration camp .
The workers , leased out by the SS , are expected to be dead from exhaustion in less than a year .
Further down in the accounts is a note : " revenue at death " .
This refers to the sum to be made from the body itself , from ashes , fat and hair .
US soldiers found thousands of wedding rings at Buchenwald Unlike doctors , bankers and lawyers , accountants have generally avoided scrutiny of their role in the Holocaust .
Accountants are seen as technocrats - grey if not completely invisible .
Yet throughout history they are there , if only you look hard enough , and often playing a vital role .
Moral standards
Take the Highland Clearances of the mid-19th century , when peasant farmers were evicted from estates of the landed gentry , to make way for sheep farms and deer forests .
Histories of the Clearances often refer to a rather anonymous figure , " Mr Brown of Edinburgh " as the agent who forced through many of the clearances .

Or catch up via iPlayer But Mr Brown is famous to historians of accounting ( admittedly a small circle ) : he is James Brown , the first president of the Institute of Accountants .
Brown came onto the scene because many highland landlords had gone bankrupt .
Their insolvent estates were placed in the hands of men like him .
He had to maximise revenue to pay off creditors .
Evicting uneconomic tenant families was one way to do it .
What 's remarkable is the zeal that Mr Brown brought to the task .
The population of the Highlands has never recovered from the Clearances
He was a man with a mission , and he was doing it all for the tenants ' own good .
He was motivated , he said , by " feelings of humanity , pity and benevolence " .
The tenants were " being reared in poverty and ignorance many [ had ] never been within the walls of a church " .
They would be much better off if they moved to towns , or emigrated .
Another nineteenth century Edinburgh accountant , Thomas Goldie Dixon , made field visits to the Highlands to inspect the tenants and to assess their personal morality .
One was evicted because Dixon saw him drunk in a pub .
Another lost his home because he was " living with a woman not his wife " .
At the same time as Dixon was imposing his own moral standards , he was insisting that there was no place for sentiment .
Exactly because accountancy looks like a dry , value - free activity , it can be used as a kind of moral laundry
Under the old system landlords had moral obligations to their tenants , but now there was " no room for the exercise of these feelings " .
Indeed exactly because accountancy looks like a dry , value - free activity , it can be used as a kind of moral laundry .
When the Nazis stole the personal property of Europe 's Jews , Himmler insisted that all the looted property be meticulously accounted for .
By enforcing stringent accounting , he argued that " in carrying out this most difficult of tasks ... we have suffered no harm to our inner being , our soul , our character . "
Theft was transformed into book - keeping .
None of this is to argue that accounting is evil .
In fact , there are those that argue that its origins are profoundly religious .
Development of capitalism
The first known accountants worked for the religious authorities in ancient Mesopotamia ( now Iraq ) , making sure that people paid their taxes ( of sheep and other agricultural produce ) to the temples .
In trying to keep track of who owed what , they had to issue receipts and IOUs , and accidentally invented writing .
Thousands of years later , in late medieval Italy , double entry book - keeping emerged .
Dull as it may sound , double entry is one of the key technologies of the last millennium , giving a huge push towards the development of capitalism .
Writing was developed for receipts and IOUs by Mesopotamian accountants
The man who first wrote down the method , Luca Pacioli , was a Franciscan Friar .
Double entry book - keeping recognises that all transactions have two aspects - a credit and a debit - and in a properly constituted set of books , the two sets of figures always balance .
For those of a particular turn of mind , the balance has a beauty , maybe even divinely inspired .
Accounting is a form of story telling - giving an account - and stories require an audience , listeners ; auditors .
In late medieval Italy , the auditor was God .
One historian of accounting , James Aho , argues it's no coincidence that double entry emerged at a time when confession became compulsory for ordinary Catholics .
If you are a businessman concerned with the morality of making a profit , then keeping the fullest possible set of accounts is a bit like confessing your sins .
Even if you are doing something morally suspect , at least you are making a clean breast of it .
Today , we live in a culture that is obsessed with measuring and auditing , whether it 's school league tables , workplace appraisal targets , or the feedback stars that we award each other on Amazon and eBay .
Once we were held accountable to God , then the state , and then our employers ; now , we are now engaged in permanent mutual audit .
You could see it as the ultimate triumph of the book - keepers .

Paul Krugman continues to be very upset with the Chinese government over its currency policy .
He has written another column declaring that China 's dollar peg is damaging to the global economy , and that America should get tough with the leadership in Beijing .
This still makes no sense to me .
As our Leader points out this week , it is probably in everyone 's interest for China to allow the renminbi to appreciate at this point , though I 'm sympathetic to Scott Sumner 's argument that during the depths of the global recession , China 's peg was highly stimulative to the Chinese economy and helped to end the global economic freefall .
But while appreciation of the RMB would be good for mostly everyone :
[ I]t would not be a magic bullet , either within China or outside .
Rebalancing China 's economy will require big structural reforms , from tax to corporate governance , as well as a stronger currency .
A stronger yuan would not suddenly bring back millions of jobs to America .
Since America no longer makes most of the products it imports from China , a stronger yuan would initially act more like a tax on consumers .
Rebalancing America 's economy will also require major structural reforms .
As I have been pointing out , America 's trade deficit with China has been steadily shrinking , and recent growth in the deficit has primarily reflected an increase in America 's petroleum deficit .
Mr Krugman tries to illustrate the scope of the problem by comparing current data to 2003 numbers , saying , " The International Monetary Fund expects China to have a 2010 current surplus of more than $ 450 billion — 10 times the 2003 figure . "
But from 2003 to 2009 , America 's exports to China grew by more ( 245 % ) than America 's imports from China ( 195 % ) .
For " the most distortionary exchange rate policy any major nation has ever followed " , it sure does n't seem to be preventing the very shift Mr Krugman would like to see .
His view of what ought to be done is perplexing .
First , he calls on the Treasury department to label China an official currency manipulator .
I 'm not sure why he believes that anyone in China or America is confused about what the Obama adminstration thinks of the dollar peg .
They 've been quite clear .
I 'm also not sure what effect this is supposed to have .
But that 's just the warm - up .
Here 's the call to action :
Some still argue that we must reason gently with China , not confront it .
But we 've been reasoning with China for years , as its surplus ballooned , and gotten nowhere : on Sunday Wen Jiabao , the Chinese prime minister , declared — absurdly — that his nation 's currency is not undervalued .
( The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that the renminbi is undervalued by between 20 and 40 percent . )
And Mr. Wen accused other nations of doing what China actually does , seeking to weaken their currencies “ just for the purposes of increasing their own exports . ”
But if sweet reason wo n't work , what 's the alternative ?
In 1971 the United States dealt with a similar but much less severe problem of foreign undervaluation by imposing a temporary 10 percent surcharge on imports , which was removed a few months later after Germany , Japan and other nations raised the dollar value of their currencies .
At this point , it 's hard to see China changing its policies unless faced with the threat of similar action — except that this time the surcharge would have to be much larger , say 25 percent .
I do n't propose this turn to policy hardball lightly .
But Chinese currency policy is adding materially to the world 's economic problems at a time when those problems are already very severe .
It 's time to take a stand .
This is really remarkable .
Mr Krugman is careful to explain why we should n't fear that China , as a major creditor , has the leverage to punish America , but it seems as though he has given no thought at all to what leverage America has over China .
Neither does he seem to pay the least mind to the potential fallout from such a reckless rush to a more aggressive approach to China .
Perhaps the decision to impose these surcharges will have the desired effect .
Or perhaps , the Chinese government will retaliate , touching off a trade war at the worst possible economic moment .
The potential upside to Mr Krugman 's recommendation is trifling ; the potential downside is massive .
And Mr Krugman seems entirely uninterested in the domestic political constraints facing China 's leaders .
He does n't consider for a second the possibility that a bullying strategy on America 's part might make China less likely to do what the administration wants .
Why on earth would a nationalistic nation anxious to establish itself as great power want to come off to all observers as a weakling in the face of American bluster ?
Mr Krugman would paint China into a corner , forcing them to take steps detrimental to all involved .
The general tone of his column — focused on toughness , insensitive to the internal politics of foreign nations , blind to potential negative outcomes , reckless and impatient — is familiar .
It looks like nothing so much as the argumentation deployed by the Bush adminstration as it rushed to war in Iraq .
Mr Krugman was prescient and prudent in fighting back against that misguided policy .
He would do well to stop for a moment , take a deep breath , and think again before urging America to " take a stand " , damn the consequences .
He should respect China enough to know that its leaders understand that RMB appreciation is in their interest .
And he should be humble enough to understand that patience and reserve is far more likely to lead to his desired outcome than ill - considered sabre rattling .
UPDATE : By the way , Mr Krugman has responded to this post , and I answer him in a new post here .
It should come as no small surprise for those still waiting for some kind of tethering option for their iPhones , but Apple 's iPad , scheduled to launch April 3 , probably wo n't support tethering either .
It should come as no small surprise for those still waiting for some kind of tethering option for their iPhones , but Apple 's iPad , scheduled to launch April 3 , probably wo n't support tethering either .
That 's according to Steve Jobs himself , who made the brief -- if not curt -- announcement in response to an emailed question from Swedish record producer Jezper Söderlund .
It 's a fair question to ask , as the tethering situation for Apple 's iPhone can be confusing enough as - is .
Officially , the iPhone can share its mobile or WiFi connection with an attached desktop or laptop .
It 's not a question of the phone 's technology ; it 's a question of the phone 's carrier .
AT&T , the iPhone 's sole carrier in the United States markets , does n't yet support tethering .
Though it promises to bring this feature to iPhones eventually , there 's been no set date for deployment just a promise that it'll come " at some point in the future , " says AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel .
European users -- Söderlund included -- are free to tether their connections to their hearts ' contents , provided their carriers support the functionality .
But in the case of the iPad , it 's the hardware itself that 's apparently going to be the stopgap .
Gone is the idea of a connected platform of devices that all intermingle over the same connection , a dream Söderlund makes note of in his email to Jobs :
" I 'll keep it short .
I 'm Jezper from Sweden , a long time Apple fan , currently about to replace the very last computer at home with a brand spanking new iMac i7 .
I 'm also awaiting the release of the iPad .
However , I have one question :
Will the wifi-only version somehow support tethering thru my iPhone ?
Two devices , based on the same OS , with already built - in technology to share one data plan suggests a secondary contract could possibly be redundant .
From the look of your keynote , where the iPad sits well between my MacBook Pro and my iPhone , I was hoping the three of them could interact as seamless as possible .
All the best ,
Jezper Söderlund "
Jobs 's reply --" No .
Sent from my iPhone " -- does n't go into great detail as to what exactly is going to be impossible on the iPad .
Will a 3G - supported iPad be able to tether a connection to a desktop or laptop PC ?
What about a WiFi- only iPad ?
Will a user be able to plug a 3G iPhone into a WiFi iPad to tether the connection ?
Is anything involving the word " tethering " right out ?
What about jailbroken iPhones or -- presumably -- jailbroken iPads ?
And , of course , there 's the biggest question of them all :
Will consumers accept having to purchase separate data plans for mobile Internet on their iPad an iPhone devices ?
Google threatens to leave China .
China calls their bluff and says , " go ahead " .
Google should officially pull out , and inform the other companies that were hacked so they can pull out as well .
Then , all affected companies should remove Chinese localization from their products .
Then , the US government could bring the copyright hammer down n a big way by not allowing Chinese imports while piracy is rampant .
I know it 'll never happen .
But , if we 're ever going to get China to play by the same set of rules everyone else does , something like this needs to happen .
In 2008 , ( the last year data is available ) , there is a $ 268 billion trade deficit with China .
We sold them $ 69.7 billion in goods and they sold us $ 337.8 billion .
This is a serious problem for the US economy .
Of the $ 3.4 trillion in US Treasury Bonds out there , China owns $ 800 billion , or 23 % , of them .
Chinas manipulation of the Yuan , ( it 's national currency ) , to stay below the dollar in value , allows them to under cut US manufacturers .
This means , to stay afloat , US companies need to lower costs .
This results in outsourcing .
People blame NAFTA for our outsourcing problems , when it 's actually Chinas fault .
The time is ripe for American companies to start sending China a message .
Personally , I am willing to pay higher prices for items made in America .
And , until the rest of you out there are too , we will remain a pawn of China .
FROM THE DESK OF TRAVIS HAIR
*** URGENT ***
Dear Coyote Fans :
Time to BRING IT .
It 's official now that we 'll be facing the Detroit Red Wings in the first round of the playoffs .
We know what that means .
No , not that we have to deal with a well coached team .
No , not that they have good goaltending we have to beat .
No , not that we have to pummel Tomas Holstrom about the head until he gets his ass out of the crease without getting called for interference .
Rather it means we have to deal with their annoying , know - it - all , douchebag fans thinking they can come into OUR HOUSE and thinking they can run things .
To that end i'm asking for you to step it up for the playoffs and do the following things .
Be loud .
Be louder than you 've ever been .
I know this is n't what you 're used to , but we 've got these jerks to drown out .
Phoenix fans are polite and reserved at pretty much every event .
Not any more .
Wingers are annoying .
We have to be annoying back .
Bring signs to the game .
It does n't matter what they say because they are n't to show support , but just in case you have Wing fans behind you you can totally ruin their game experience and discourage them from coming to future games .
Do n't sell any extras to Red Wing fans .
Pre -screening is the best way to keep these people out .
You 'll have to be tricky with your screening questions though as Red Wing fans will lie to get you to sell to them .
It 's what they do .
Stretch out your middle fingers .
You 'll be needing them and do n't want to cramp up at the wrong moment when you really need them .
Just in case you might want to do some finger exercises .
Just in case you have n't done this before do the following :
First make a fist .
Then extend your middle finger as far as you can upward , point your finger upward so that the underside is facing you and the outer side is pointing toward someone with a wheel on their jersey .
Good job .
Did I mention be loud ?
I did ?
Well I 'll mention it again because it 's still important .
I swear if people start a " Let 's go Coyotes ! " chant and you do n't follow along we will excommunicate you from the Church of the Holy Canine .
You bought a ticket , put it to good use .
If you need a beer or something to loosen up to get cheering then get one .
Even if the play is slow cheer , get loud , do something .
Be aware that people are watching .
The matchup with the Red Wings means we 'll likely be on National TV once or twice in the first round .
We want to represent .
Do n't let the media get a hold of those " the arena is half Detroit " bullshit .
This is our white out .
You know some jerkstore is going to show up in their solid red Wings jersey to f it up .
Bring white paint .
Do what comes naturally .
See if you can find Wings merchandise at a discount so that you have a way to light your grills during tailgating .
Red Wing flags ?
Burn em. Red Wings jerseys ?
Burn 'em .
Red Wings cars ?
Burn 'em .
Red Wings lighters ?
Burn 'em .
Buy rattlesnakes .
Why ?
New Promotion : Anyone with an octopus automatically receives a rattlesnake in their car after the game .
You 'll need to bring one of those Tide Stain remover pens to get the Red Wing fan blood out of your nice white jersey .
See a Wings fan around town before the game ?
Finger .
See a car with a Wings logo ?
horn and finger .
See a kid with a Wings logo ?
Report the parents to CPS because that 's just not okay .
Do you work at the beer stand at the arena ?
When you see a Wings Jersey the taps are suddenly all malfunctioning .
All you have left is Fresca .
Learn how to boo people .
It 's seriously okay to do .
It 's not classless .
Boo the hell out of the Red Wings at any chance you get .
Also we need to be in sync when telling either Osgood or Howard they suck .
If you see anyone with an octopus report them to security immediately .
Just give them a nice hip check and take possession of the octopus first .
That 's all I have for the moment but expect more memos from my desk during the week .

Blow is working on stable cascaded shadow maps , and trying to reduce wasted texels due to the way the shadow frustum is set up .
Well , as it happens I have my own minor tweak to Valient ’s technique that also reduces wastage , so I ’ figured I ’d describe it here with pretty pictures .
I ’m going to assume that you ’re roughly familiar with the general idea , if not , read e.g .
Blow ’s first blog post on the topic , or ShaderX 6 .
The root of the problem is that with realistic camera FOVs , you often get a situation like below .
The first slice of the view frustum ( the trapezoidal shape in the middle ) is inscribed in a sphere ( for rotational invariance – do n’t want those shadows flickering ! ) , and then that sphere inscribed in a box ( the shadow map ’s orthogonal view frustum ) .
Now , you could take the position that all that red area is wasted , since only the green area is inside the frustum and the first splitting plane .
Blow performs a few very clever tricks to overlap the shadow map slices to avoid all those red parts taking up too much , for a total of 25 % memory savings .
However , who says that only shadow texels within the first slice are useful ?
Anything to the right of the splitting plane is also within the view frustum , and can easily be used for shadowing .
Why reject these high - res shadow texels and skip to the next slice just because we ’re on the other side of the splitting plane ?
So rather than trying so hard to not store these “ wasted ” shadow map texels , we should instead make sure we ’re making use of those texels whenever we can so that they ’ are n’t wasted anymore !
As we sample the shadow map we just test the current point against the first shadow frustum – not the bounding sphere , and not the splitting plane , the frustum .
That changes the picture to something like this :
This is all pretty standard so far .
My own little tweak comes from the realization that if we ’re not going to bother using the splitting plane as our boundary for sampling then why bother with it at all ?
The implication is that when we compute our bounding sphere we should n’t worry about how it fits with some arbitrarily positioned plane , we should only worry about how it fits with the frustum itself ( and previous slices ) .
In other words , we position our bounding sphere ( of the same size ) to minimize waste by just shifting it to the right .
We have to stop before we pass the near plane of the view frustum , of course .
Like so :
As you see we ’ve reduced texel waste for the first slice by quite a lot here .
We ’re using approximately 5/6 of that texture space , instead of 1/6 like the first scenario .
However , notice what happened at the corners where the splitting plane intersects the frustum , they ’re outside the sphere !
That means that we ’ve effectively moved the splitting plane back compared to the previous image .
If you were in the business of worrying about the location of the splitting plane this would be a problem – luckily we are n’t , so it ’s not .
Freeing ourselves from the constraint of the splitting plane means we can find a bounding sphere with a better overall utilization of the shadow map .
If the FOV increases , or the sphere gets smaller , the “ corners ” ( determined by the original splitting plane ) will eventually drop outside not just the sphere , but the shadow map too , and for those pixels we do need to drop to the second slice when sampling , which of course means that we have to be careful that the second slice is far enough back that it does n’t leave any gaps .
This also means that there are minor areas near the edges of the screen where we may drop to a lower resolution shadow map sooner than we would with the original scheme , but in return for that we get a big area in the centre of the screen that can now use a higher res shadow map due to the better utilization .
Now , most of the first slice will actually overlap the second slice – we will still always use the first one when we can to maximize the amount of pixels that get to use highest shadow resolution , but there is some overlap where parts of the second slice will be “ overruled ” by the previous slice .
In practice , however , this is n’t such a big deal because the second bounding sphere is usually several times larger than the first , so as a proportion of the overall area the overlap is actually quite minor .
For example , take a look at this illustration of the second slice :
We ’ve zoomed out a bit .
You can see the first slice as the rectangular red area to the left and centre ( and note how the bounding sphere has been carefully positioned to just barely cover the intersection of the previous slice with the frustum , leaving no gaps ) .
So while there is still some waste for things that are outside the frustum , and there ’s also wastage for texels that are redundant because they ’re already covered by the previous slice , by and large we ’re getting very good texel utilization .
Israel Punks Itself
If you use Facebook or Twitter in Canada , you probably caught this viral advertisement , subtly titled " Size Does n’t Matter , " last month .
Girl [ peering down the camera ’s frame ] : Uhhh… Boy : What ?
Girl :
Do n’t be mad .
But it ’s small .
Boy :
It ’s small ?!
Girl : I just … I do n’t know if I can go there .
Boy : I consider this a spot of worship .
It may be small , but it ’s brought the driest places to life .
Baby , this is paradise !
The camera then pans out to show the young couple , peering at a map of Israel and tourist guidebooks sitting in the boy ’s lap .
Girl : OK .
But , if I go down there for you , you have to promise you ’ll go down south for me next winter .
The video , sponsored by the Canadian Federation of Jewish Students and the Canadian Council for Israel and Jewish Advocacy ( CIJA ) , was met with ridicule — both in Israel and abroad .
Bloggers went wild , and the bemused Israeli Foreign Ministry and CIJA were reduced to pointing fingers at each other , trying to shift the blame .
( Though it is unclear whether the Israeli government funded this ad , overseas advocacy organizations generally take their cues from the homeland . )
The past year has brought many public - diplomacy own - goals for Israel — refusing to cooperate with a U.N. commission , deliberately humiliating the ambassador of a major ally , and snubbing a U.S. congressional delegation , for instance .
But rather than addressing the problems underlying Israel ’s lack of popularity abroad — the stagnated conflict with the Palestinians , and especially the brutal war waged on Gaza last winter — the government has gone for diversion , with a series of flashy ( and , in the case above , idiotic ) global ad campaigns .
Such ads have a lot more to say about Israel ’s insecurities — e.g. , its small size — than the world ’s concerns .
Another advertisement shows a camel ambling across a sandy vista , with a narrator deadpanning in English , " The camel is a typical Israeli animal , used by the Israelis to travel from place to place in the desert where they live . "
Do n’t quite get the joke ?
It sends up Israelis ’ concern that foreigners perceive them to be backward and Oriental .
There ’s hardly an argument that the ads are falling flat with international audiences .
It increasingly seems Israel is trying to persuade not foreigners , but itself .
In March 2009 , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu created a ministry of public diplomacy ( in Hebrew , hasbara ) .
Last week , it launched a website called " Masbirim , " or " Explainers , " offering Israelis talking points to chat up foreigners when traveling overseas .
( The information on the website is also available in booklet form . )
The Masbirim project does not just offer up harmless trivia about Israeli agriculture and inventions — for instance , " Israel invented the solar water - heater " and , crucially , " An Israeli electric hair remover makes women happy the world over . "
It also provides hard - line political arguments .
We ’re told the West Bank ( described as " Judea and Samaria " ) settlements are " restored " ancient Jewish villages , not impositions on Palestinian villages or lands .
The conflict is not about territorial disputes , but about Israel ’s very existence as a state , it says .
And the Golan is not only a strategic stronghold for Israel , but a place stuffed with Jewish heritage sites .
The materials , unsurprisingly , do not mention the illegality of annexing occupied territory .
The campaign then marches into right - wing wilderness roamed only by the likes of the long - debunked 1984 book From Time Immemorial .
It advises Israelis to tell new foreign friends that " there has never been a state called Palestine " and that most Palestinians are " immigrants from other Arab states " — many of whom were drawn to the economic prosperity created by Zionist Jewish immigration .
Just in case the foreign folks had heard many Israelis ’ central argument for a two - state solution — that discrepancies between Jewish and Palestinian birthrates mean Jews will soon be outnumbered in the territories currently under Israeli control — the Masbirim project ’s materials explain that the Palestinian birthrate has actually dropped and the Jewish one is " underestimated . "
The sensitive issues of historic rights , heritage , and demographics are not always well understood outside the Middle East .
But Israeli walls cutting across Palestinian territory are .
That topic goes entirely unmentioned on the website , as do contentious topics outsiders might want " explained " : the Israeli sanctions on Gaza and the withholding of food , construction materials , books , and , bizarrely , musical instruments .
Israeli strikes within Gaza and the overwhelmingly civilian casualties they incur also go largely unexplained , mentioned only as responses to the Palestinians ’ ( deplorable but nowhere near as devastating ) rocket fire .
Rebranding the country without addressing the conflict is just plain stupid , Didi Remez , a advertising specialist and senior partner at BenOr Consulting , warns .
" It ’s unclear whether the campaigns are intended to achieve something diplomatic abroad or to boost the morale of Israeli audiences , " he said in an interview .
" [ That ] is a problem because in today ’s world you ca n’t compartmentalize communications .
So campaigns are picked up on and examined by audiences they were clearly not meant for — and then they boomerang . "
Officials at the ministry in charge of the campaign push back on assertions of its ineptness .
" People [ have pointed out ] we are [ still missing ] information on important issues — the security fence , for instance .
We ’re working to fix that , " says Yuli Edelstein , a former Soviet dissident and the current minister of information and diaspora .
" We ’re not saying the conflict is n’t there or that the Palestinians do n’t exist .
But it ’s also important to say :
We ’re explaining our position ; let the other side explain theirs .
I do n’t have to reflect the Palestinian narrative on our website .
I ca n’t lie if I know for a fact there ’s no birthrate that explains the growth of the Arab population , from which I infer that they are immigrants .
But Israelis are also immigrants .
So what ? "
He also denies that the project is aimed at the Israelis .
" Domestic hasbara is not my portfolio , " he says .
But to Remez , such campaigns are most keenly felt at home .
" The bottom line is : Israelis do n’t like losers .
A government that cannot put together any kind of agenda to keep Israel in a legitimate place on the world stage will find itself facing problems , " he says .
" Unfortunately , Israeli governments tend to deal with this type of policy dead end by escalating the conflict or going to war . "
Thus , while ostensibly making every effort to reach out , Israel is instead curling deeper and deeper into itself , engaging not so much in public diplomacy as in navel - gazing .
Rather than changing the policies that are rapidly turning it into an international pariah , or even honestly arguing its viewpoints , the state is inoculating its citizens against realistic and very real outside criticism .
In the long run , this means it will become even more difficult to persuade Israel to change its course — and to save it from the damage it inflicts upon itself .
I did my best to exhaust the category of console audio players the other day , but I still have a huge list of programs to investigate .
Every time I find a new application for the console , I see another that was designed after it , branched away from it or was rebuilt from scratch to mimic it .
I daresay I find them at a rate of one or two a day , and add them to the stack .
I ’ve already pointed out a few note - taking , organizer - type applications — hnb is my favorite , probably followed by vimwiki ; I mentioned tnote a while back and I ’ve used emacs ’ org - mode as well — but that ’s certainly not the end of the list .
You ’ll need a list , just to keep track of all the programs you can use to make lists .
For example , here ’s devtodo .
This one is a lot like tnote , except more flush with features .
Color codes for prioritization , hierarchical arrangement , shortcuts for adding , editing and arranging items … and at the same time , completely driven by the command - line .
In other words , no fancy interface that will take up the entire terminal window .
Type in todo , and you get your list , neatly spaced and arranged .
I like devtodo for its convenience and speed , but if I must be completely honest , I prefer the fancy interface that will take up the entire window .
It ’s a matter of principle :
The reason I relegate 95 percent of my working hours to the command - line is partly to show that it can be done , and on a minimum of hardware requirements .
So for me , something like doneyet is preferable to devtodo , simply because it looks like an application , and not just a console tool .
What can I say ?
I am a visual person .
And so for me , doneyet is perfect for arranging lists and tasks by priority and attaching notes to them .
It also has some very handy search features , and generates plain text versions on command .
It ’s menu - driven , intuitive and has a clean interface .
urukrama has a great introduction to doneyet on his blog ; if you find this one attractive I would suggest visiting there to get even more details .
What keeps me from adopting doneyet on a permanent basis is the need for subversion ; I am averse to adopting programs that do n’t have a particular release I can work from .
I know , it ’s rather lame , but it ’s just by force of habit .
I like to build Pkgfiles when an application has a tarball I can download and pick through .
You can chastise me if you want , but I am unlikely to change .
Another one that I find attractive is wyrd , which makes using remind terrifically easy .
If you need a specific calendar arrangement , hour by hour , for appointments and timed tasks , I ca n’t think of anything better .
It ’s true I prefer calcurse , but that ’s mostly because wyrd ( and remind ) seem like overkill for me .
If I worked in an office with precise appointments at precise times — precise even to the quarter - hour — I would stick to this like glue .
But calcurse is faster and more at my “ level , ” even if wyrd gets a big gold smilie : 😀
remind by itself is a viable alternative , but again , we ’re back to shell - based prompts and that ’s not much to my liking .
tnote is workable for me , devtodo is acceptable , but remind seems cryptic and unwieldy — especially after using wyrd .
Among calendars , you ’re probably aware of the standard cal command , which prints a clean and flexible calendar to the console .
Much like it , pal is a good , shell - driven calendar system with clean output and easy controls .
I like pal for adding cultural and historical dates , and for having a simple interface with a help screen .
All those are usually always good things . 😉
On the other hand , there is task , which — I think I am safe in saying — reaches an unmatched level of detail .
My problem with task is that it might actually obscure itself , where I find it difficult to handle , and therefore not necessarily better than tnote , devtodo or even remind .
I understand there is a movement afoot to give it something akin to an interface , but I have seen naught but mockups , which do n’t mean much to me .
One more I feel obligated to mention is gcalcli , which I believe is meant to manage Google Calendars via the console .
My best efforts yielded nothing but error messages though , so I am afraid I ca n’t vouch for it . 😉
Of course for each one I mentioned here , there are easily one or two more out there , waiting to be tried out .
Personally I plan on investigating pal and wyrd a little more , and see if they supplant any of the things I already use .
Not likely , but one never knows . 😉
Fallows :
I can't pretend to know the full truth or circumstances of this .
But at face value it is the most damaging documentation of abuse since the Abu Ghraib prison - torture photos .
As you watch , imagine the reaction in the US if the people on the ground had been Americans and the people on the machine guns had been Iraqi , Russian , Chinese , or any other nationality .
As with Abu Ghraib , and again assuming this is what it seems to be , the temptation will be to blame the operations - level people who were , in this case , chuckling as they mowed people down .
That 's not where the real responsibility lies .
Bill Roggio defends the military :
There is nothing in that video that is inconsistent with the military ’s report .
What you see is the air weapons team engaging armed men .
Second , note how empty the streets are in the video .
The only people visible on the streets are the armed men and the accompanying Reuters cameramen .
This is a very good indicator that there was a battle going on in the vicinity .
Civilians smartly clear the streets during a gunfight .
R.M. at DiA arrives at the same conclusion :
I 've watched this video a couple of times now , first with outrage similar to Mr Sullivan's , then with an eye towards seeing what the pilots saw .
I do n't mean to turn this tragedy into a psychological experiment , but I 'm reminded of this selective attention test .
By way of the text and markers in the video we are prodded to see one side of the event .
( The helicopter pilots do not help matters with their casual approach to killing and intermittent laughter . )
But ask yourselves , would you have been able to distinguish between the journalists ' cameras and the guns some of the other men were carrying ?
More importantly , did you see the man with the RPG ?
Did you see him poke around the corner and seem to aim it at the helicopter ?
Juan Cole :
While the pilots who fired at apparently armed men ( and at least 3 were actually armed ) thought they were saving US ground troops who had been pinned down from men with small arms , they had less justification for firing on the van .
Indeed , the latter action may have been a war crime since the van was trying to pick up the wounded and it is illegal to fire on the wounded and those hors de combat .
Raffi Khatchadourian describes the rules of engagement :
The video raises a number of interesting questions about the treatment of casualties during an ongoing military operation .
On several occasions , the Apache gunner appears to fire rounds into people after there is evidence that they are have either died or are suffering from debilitating wounds .
The Rules of Engagement and the Law of Armed Combat do not permit combatants to shoot at people who are surrendering or who no longer pose a threat because of their injuries .
What about the people in the van who had come to assist the struggling man on the ground ?
The Geneva Conventions state that protections must be afforded to people who “ collect and care for the wounded , whether friend or foe . ”
The understanding here is that such people are clearly designated as noncombatantsby wearing a prominently displayed red cross , or red crescent , on their persons , for instanceor who are obviously civilians .
A “ positively identified ” combatant who provides medical aid to someone amid fighting does not automatically lose his status as a combatant , and may still be legally killed .
Greenwald :
As The National put it : " Wikileaks has probably produced more scoops in its short life than The Washington Post has in the past 30 years . "
If they did not obtain and then post this video , we would not know about what happened with this incident .
I wonder how WikiLeaks is able to break so many stories without publishing " beat sweeteners , " spending tens of thousands of dollars to be seen at the White House Correspondents '
Dinner , and currying favor with White House officials in exchange for access ?
Black Five :
Let 's assume there 's a positive place for an organization like Wikileaks .
An outlet .
A steam valve .
Whatever .
Is it the proper place of that outlet to take their raw leaked documents , audiotapes and video , and add biased editorial analysis when they do not -- and cannot -- have all the facts ?

מכה קשה למשטרת התנועה : בית המשפט קבע כי לא ניתן להתבסס על תוצאות מדידות הממל " ז - אקדח הלייזר המשטרתי - כמדויקות .
השופטת רחל ברקאי , מבית המשפט המחוזי בבאר שבע , דחתה את ערעור המדינה על זיכוי נהג מאשמת נהיגה במהירות מופרזת , תוך שהיא מותחת ביקורת חריפה על התנהלות המשטרה בנושא .
בפסק דין שפורסם אתמול ( ד' ) , קובעת השופטת כי אמינות הממל " ז - למרות שאינה מוטלת בספק - אינה יכולה לשמש כבסיס להרשעת נהגים שנתפסו נוהגים במהירות מופרזת .
לדברי השופטת , מדידות המהירות של המכשיר יוכלו לשמש כבסיס להרשעה , רק אם הוא מכוייל במעבדה מוסמכת .
" בהיעד ר כיול למכשיר הממל " ז , לא ניתן להתבסס על תוצאות מדידותיו כמדויקות לשם העמדת אזרחים לדין " , אמרה .
בפסק הדין ציינה השופטת כי גם אם יצרן המכשיר לא ציין במפורש כי יש לכייל אותו - אין הדבר פוטר את המשטרה מהחובה לכיילו .
השופטת ברקאי מותחת גם ביקורת עקיפה על המחוקק : " גם אם לא ראה המחוקק ( צורך ) להכפיף את מכשירי מדידת המהירות לבדיקות כיול במעבדות של רשות המעבדות , אין זה אומר כי הדבר תקין " .
יש לציין כי באוקטובר האחרון , קבעה השופטת ברקאי כי גם מצלמות המהירות הנייחות שמפעילה המשטרה , " מולטנובה " , מחייבות כיול תקופתי במעבדות מוסמכות : " בהיעד ר כיול מכשיר מדידת המהירות על - ידי מעבדה מורשית , אין לומר כי מדובר בתוצאות מדידה אמינה , עליה ניתן לבסס קביעה מעל לכל ספק סביר - ובהתאם הרשעה " .
14 שנים , שלושה זיכויי ם
פסק הדין של השופטת ברקאי ניתן בעניינו של עמיקם לוין , שנתפס לפני 14 שנים - ב- 12 בינואר 1996 - נוהג במהירות של 78 קמ " ש , במקום בו המהירות המותרת היא 60 קמ " ש.
ב-2001 זוכה לוין בבית משפט לתעבורה , אך בעקבות ערעור שהגישה המדינה , הוחזר התיק לבית המשפט .
ב- 2008 זוכה לוין פעם שנייה , אך המדינה החליטה לערער שנית - והפעם לבית המשפט המחוזי .
היום הובהר כי גם ערעור זה נדחה .
השופטת ברקאי התייחסה לעקשנותה של המדינה , ומתחה ביקורת על התנהלותה : " אודה כי השתאיתי למקרא כל ההשתלשלות של תיק זה , ובפרט העובדה כי מדובר באירוע המייחס למשיב ( עמיקם לוין , ש.ה ) עבירת מהירות מלפני 14 שנה , כאשר המשיב זוכה פעמיים ... מאבק זה של המדינה , מן הראוי שלא היה מתנהל " .
בהערת אגב , אף מציינת השופטת כי יש לשקול להטיל מגבלות על זכותה של המדינה לערער בעבירות שוליות .
אמין , אבל חייב בכיו ל
לטענת המדינה , לפני כל הפעלה של הממל " ז מתבצעת " בדיקת אמינות " , הכוללת בדיקת כיול - אם כי לא מדובר בכיול במעבדה .
עוד טענה המדינה כי בית המשפט העליון קבע בעבר כי מכשיר הממל " ז אמין , ולכן אין להטיל ספק בממצאי מדידות המהירות המתבצעות באמצעותו .
אלא שהשופטת ברקאי מציינת בפסק הדין כי גם אם אמינות הממל " ז אינה מוטלת בספק , " יש להבחין בין דבר אמינותו של מכשיר , לבין הצורך בכיולו " .
ובעניין הכיול , השופטת קיבלה במלואן את טענות לוין , לפיהן כל מכשיר מדידה חייב לעבור כיול תקופתי , במעבדה המוסמכת לכך .
" הוכח באופן שאינו משתמע לשתי פנים , דבר חיוניות כיול המכשיר " .
השופטת גם קיבלה את קביעת המומחה מטעם ההגנה , כי את כיול הממל " ז יש לערוך פעם בחצי שנה .
בדברי הסיכום של פסק הדין , מתחה השופטת ביקורת נוספת על התנהלות המשטרה : " המדינה , כגוף האוכף חוק , חייבת להקפיד עם עצמה במובן זה שתוצאות מדידה של מכשירים - על בסיסם מעמידה היא אזרחים לדין - יעמדו בכל מבחני האמינות , ללא כחל וסייג " .
משטרה : האכיפה תימש ך
בשיחה עם ynet , אומר עו " ד אילון אורון , מומחה לדיני תעבורה , כי לפסק הדין של השופטת ברקאי יש חשיבות רבה עבור ציבור הנהגים .
לדבריו , פסק הדין יהווה " הלכה מנחה " - פסיקה שתשמש בבתי משפט לתעבורה ובבתי משפט מחוזיים אחרים .
אמנם אין מדובר בהחלטת בית משפט עליון , המהווה " הלכה פסוק ה " המחייבת את בתי המשפט , אך בהחלט יתכן כי שופטים אחרים יאמצו את קביעותיה של השופטת ברקאי בעניין בעייתיות מדידות מהירות באמצעות מכשירים שאינם מכוילים .
לדברי אורון , פסק הדין גם עשוי לשמש ככלי בידיהם של סנגורים , להשגת הסדרי - טיעון ביתר קלות .
זאת , לאור חשש אפשרי בצד התביעה מפני היגררות למשפטים שבהם ייושמו קביעותיה של השופטת ברקאי .
מאגף התנועה של המשטרה נמסר ל - ynet בתגובה כי האכיפה באמצעות הממל " ז תימשך , וזאת לאור קביעת בית המשפט העליון כי מדובר במכשיר אמין .
דובר האגף , רפ " ק יגאל הבשור , אומר כי פסק הדין של השופטת ברקאי יילמד , ובמשטרה תישקל הגשת ערר לבית המשפט העליון .
More than any one person , goaltending consultant Francois Allaire invented the goaltending coach .
Allaire ’s first pro student was Patrick Roy , the Montreal Canadiens Hall of Famer whose Made In Quebec style ushered the butterfly ( invented by Glenn Hall because he could n’t stop Bobby Hull ’s shot in practice ) into the mainstream .
Roy ’s pre-imminence prompted a generation of cookie - cutter goalies , from Roberto Luongo to Jose Theodore to Marc - Andre Fleury .
Through his goaltending schools and clinics , Allaire made the goalie coach , unknown a generation before , a staple of NHL and even junior teams .
Allaire arrived in Toronto this season after 13 seasons in Anaheim where the line of successful goalies ran from Guy Hebert through Jean - Sebastien Giguere to Jonas Hiller .
The trade of Giguere to Toronto and the rocky road endured by rookie Jonas Gustavsson means Allaire will have plenty of work .
Mike Ulmer of mapleleafs.com checked in with Allaire to discuss his view of what Jacques Plante dubbed the art of goaltending .
What do you teach your goalies ?
I try to make sure my goalies play a simple style .
That means being solid and being square with the puck .
It should look simple .
The goalie should do the minimum of movement .
Can any goalie benefit from this ?
For me , I need a guy who is willing to pay the price .
I always got better results from a guy who was willing to learn than from a guy who just wanted to play by instinct .
What was the launching point of your career ?
I started with Patrick Roy and he was a big fan of what I was trying to do .
It was easy for me to convince him to try and do things a certain way .
When the number one guy in the organization promotes that , everyone all the way down promotes it as well .
Your coaching style is sometimes called rigid .
I coach different goalies differently , but I work with a definite set of principles .
I explain my principles but I am open to different ways of doing it .
Goalies come in all different sizes , body types , backgrounds and with different histories .
There are different ways of getting things done .
Jonas Hiller and Jean - Sebastien Giguerre , for example , had two different ways of operating .
The cornerstone of everything is this : if there is a pass inside the zone my goalie has to be able to push and stop and be ready at the same time the guy receives the puck .
That ’s not easy , especially on the power play where a goalie has six , seven , eight passes before the shot .
The way you skate and move determines a lot of what happens after the shot .
What about the idea of percentages .
It ’s harder to hit different spots of the net so by covering the high percentage areas , you work the numbers in your favour .
Shooters most of the time are under a lot of pressure .
Sometimes they get the puck at the perfect place to shoot but most of the time a shot is in the middle of the net and lower .
If you can cover those parts , you have an edge .
You are credited with helping invent the butterfly style .
The media talks about the butterfly style , but for me it ’s one movement .
It ’s a movement we use more than others , but there are so many more movements than just that one .
How about the two - pad stack ?
I do n’t promote the two pad stack . :
So tell me about a movement that has evolved ?
Since 2003 , a big movement has been one pad down .
The game has changed and there are more shots from the goal line , a distance away from the net .
The goalie puts one leg against the post and keeps the other pad down .
When there is a wraparound , the use of the paddle down movement has become popular .
Goalies practice it .
That movement is older , it goes back to Felix Potvin who used it a lot in Toronto .
I had a theory that the further Potvin moved away from the goal line , the more confidence he felt .
Can you apply that to all goalies ?
I ’m not a big believer in the idea that you can measure a goalie ’s confidence by where he stands in the net .
Martin Gerber played really deep in the crease .
Henrik Lundqvist plays deep in the crease .
It all depends on the goalie ’s athleticism and how they see the puck .
Some goalies think they can play a little higher in the crease and still get to the backdoor play .
The quality of the defence can be different and some goalies may feel they have to play a little deeper .
So what makes a good goalie ?
Being a good goalie is all about reading and understanding .
If you have a big screen , a little screen , it does n’t matter .
It ’s all about reading and understanding the game .
Some goalies just need a little bit of information and they will make the right decision .
Other goalies can have a great amount of information and still struggle with the right decision .
You have a veteran goalie you have worked with in J.S. Giguere and a young goalie in Jonas Gustavsson .
What are your goals this season ?
I ’m looking toward the future .
We have n’t had very much time , but right after the Olympics we want to sit down with Jonas and Jiggy and fix some things .
Jiggy is our guy and we want him to finish strong .
There have been a lot of changes for him , but it ’s time to play like an NHLer and take that into next year .
Jonas has lots of upside .
His legs are really good .
He ’s quick , he ’s tall and he can see the puck pretty well .
But you have to remember , the step from the Swedish Elite League to the NHL is a very big one and Jonas had only one season as the number one goalie there .
The talent , the size , the desire to learn , they ’re are all there .
How confident are you that the team ’s goaltending and the Leafs place in the standings can be improved .
Look at Anaheim with Giguere .
When we started working together , Anaheim was 15th in the West .
Jiggy survived it and he got better .
The next year , he got better and the next year , 2003 , he took us to the finals .
Just because you are on a team that is n’t doing well , it does n’t mean you do n’t get better .
The last six weeks of the season will be important .
We will have to get better and we will .
It seems to me that goaltending has gone from active to passive .
What ’s so exciting about a goalie taking a shot in the chest and smothering it as opposed to a goalie making a spectacular save ?
You are talking about goalies like Mike Palmateer , Ron Hextall , Grant Fuhr and Bill Ranford .
The save percentage in that era was .880 .
Do that now and you are not in the business .
The sport is always changing and the numbers change with that .
Look at skiing in the Olympics in the 1970s .
Guys had long hair and no helmets .
Today , skiers with those same times would be dead last .
To what do you attribute that progress ?
Today , everybody is watching everybody else .
If a power play formation has success , in a month everybody will be able to perform it or defend it .
If a goalie does something well I guarantee half of the goalies in the league will start the next season using it .
The sport is changing very fast , much faster than it used to change .
And for me , when I see a goalie at the right time and in the right position to stop a shot , that ’s something that I like to watch .
As Kennedy further notes , if the law had n’t been overturned , courts would have had to decide what is and is n’t a media corporation .
A conglomerate with a couple of radio stations ?
And who is and is not a journalist ?
Kennedy observes with unseemly relish ,
With the advent of the Internet and the decline of print and broadcast media … the line between the media and others who wish to comment on political and social issues becomes far more blurred .
Rub it in , why do n’t you ?
More to the point , even if you could successfully draw that line between journalists and everybody else , why should you ?
Journalists ’ special pleading is one reason we are so unpopular .
A final example concerns that hoary subject : anonymous sources .
Like FOIA , anonymous sources are vital to journalists ’ task of monitoring the behavior of government and powerful private institutions .
Many journalists believe passionately that a “ journalist ’s privilege ” — like the privileges for spouses , ministers , lawyers , and so on — should protect them from having to reveal the identity of their sources in criminal trials and other circumstances where nonjournalists must talk or risk punishment .
Many journalists , in fact , believe that such a right is already part of the First Amendment , if only judges would recognize it .
The Supreme Court has turned down opportunities to recognize such a right ( which would be a right not to speak , in contrast with the First Amendment ’s usual concern with a right to speak ) , but most states have enacted “ shield ” laws allowing journalists to protect their sources to one degree or another .
You cannot deny the sincerity or seriousness of journalists on this issue .
Many — most notably Judith Miller of The New York Times — have gone to jail rather than break a promise of anonymity to a source .
But you also cannot deny the arrogance of the absolutism here .
The question is not whether journalists should be forced to break promises to anonymous sources .
The question is whether they should have made these promises in the first place , and whether sometimes they should be happy to break them .
The whole saga ( which also involved other journalists : Matthew Cooper of Time , the late Robert Novak , and so on ) concerned the “ outing ” of a CIA agent , Valerie Plame .
( It ’s all coming back now .
Right ? )
The CIA also has its secrets — legitimate secrets .
Do the legitimate secrets of The New York Times always trump the legitimate secrets of the CIA ?
And why do reporters continue to owe protection to sources who turn out to be lying , or to be part of an official disinformation campaign rather than brave dissidents ?
And does the press always get to decide whose secrets trump ?
What bothers me most about the cult of the source is the press ’s insistence on its right to ignore due process of law and refuse to reveal sources even after the issue has been fully litigated .
Fine : appeal it up to the Supreme Court if you want , but in a democracy with an ( all but ) uncorrupted judiciary , if you ultimately lose , you should obey the law as it is , not as you would like it to be .
Especially if you are concurrently publishing editorials urging this course on the president of the United States ( as The Times and other publications were doing about George W. Bush during Plamegate ) .
Upon a federal judge ’s ruling that the Bush administration illegally wiretapped an Saudi - based Islamic charity and two American lawyers , a Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist for The New York Times alleged the Bush administration ’s entire warrantless surveillance program may have been illegal .
“ Plaintiffs must Ã¢â‚¬â€  and have Ã¢â‚¬â€  put forward enough evidence to establish a prima facie case that they were subjected to warrantless electronic surveillance , ” US District Court Judge Vaughn Walker declared Wednesday .

James Risen , who broke the story for the Times in 2005 , told MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann Wednesday night that the ruling raises serious questions about the underpinnings of Bush ’s entire war on terror .
“ You could argue that virtually all the programs that the Bush Administration used , rendition , torture , wiretapping , you know , setting up secret prisons , all were in one form or another , an invasion of congressional power , ” Risen said .
“ If by saying the Bush Administration had no right to avoid congressional mandates and congressional legislation , that raises real questions about whether everything that the Bush Administration did on counterterrorism was illegal , ” Risen added .
The Justice Department , under Attorney General Eric Holder , has handled the case differently than his predecessor , Alberto Gonzales , which may indicate that the Obama administration does n’t have the same willingness to fight for the warrantless version of the program .
But the ruling could expose what the Obama Administration has classified as “ state secrets . ”
“ The Obama Administration , the way they broke with the Bush Administration on this was by saying we are going to abide by the court ’s ruling , ” Risen explained .
“ The Bush people were never going to . ”

At the progressive blog Firedoglake , Marcy Wheeler speculates the judge “ crafted his ruling to give the government a big incentive not to appeal the case . ”
She notes that Walker denied the al - Haramain Islamic Foundation ’s request for an alternative ruling based on the merits of the surveillance program , therefore allowing the government to keep a lid on the details of the program .
“ I ’m betting that the government will be willing to accept the ruling that it illegally wiretapped al - Haramain in exchange for the ability to leave details of how and what it did secret , leaving the claim of State Secrets largely intact , ” Wheeler wrote .

Risen acknowledged this , too .
“ They may not appeal this case , this ruling , which would leave on the books the idea that the NSA program was illegal . ”

Robb Topolski , the man who helped unearth Comcast 's P2P interference , wants Comcast customers to opt out of the $ 16 they have coming to them from a class action lawsuit .
But Eric Somers , the lawyer leading the class - action case , just can't understand the sentiment .
" This is a good settlement , " he told Ars .
" If you opt out , you 're basically giving that money to Comcast . "
At issue is the settlement of the Hart v. Comcast class action , a resolution three years in the making .
When John Hart noticed that his BitTorrent connections would " hang " — sometimes for an entire night — he called up Somers and asked if he knew anything about it .
Comcast was still denying that P2P upload blocks were in place on its network , and it took the legal team time to figure out what was happening .
Hart 's case was the first one filed , and his lawyers were eventually certified as counsel for the entire class of affected Comcast users .
Since 2008 , Somers and his team have argued that Comcast violated the FCC's Internet Policy Statement ( PDF ) ; the FCC famously agreed .
Comcast agreed to settle the class action suit rather than proceed to trial .
The deal puts Comcast on the hook for $ 16 million , plus up to $ 3 million extra for the lawyers .
That $ 16 million will be split up between every Comcast subscriber who was affected , with a cap of $ 16 per person — but no one gets any money unless they sign onto the class at the official settlement website .
Any unclaimed money goes right back into Comcast 's coffers .
Best possible result ?
Somers believes this is the best deal he could get — and better than anyone is going to get in the future .
As the judge noted , the damages here are n't easily quantifiable , and Comcast argued that people were barely affected ; they could still do e-mail , browse the Web , even download on BitTorrent .
Where was the real harm ?
As for putting that $ 16 million pot to better use , say by funding some bigger public project , Somers said he'd love to do that — but courts frown on class - action awards going anywhere but to those actually harmed .
Sixteen dollars is n't enough to do much more than buy a bottle of decent wine , but Somers says that those who want the small individual payouts to do more common good should donate them somewhere like the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" That would be fantastic , " he said .
Besides , he argues , if you 're concerned about the settlement , look at what just happened in DC .
There , the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit recently tossed out the FCC 's entire authority over " network management " and invalidated the agency 's Comcast order .
If the case went to trial , the ruling " makes it more difficult to win the case , absolutely . "
What about the common complaint about class actions , that they disburse tiny amounts of money to victims but concentrate large sums on a single law firm ?
" There was an enormous amount of work " on this case , Somers said , pointing out that his firm has fronted the money on this case since the beginning and that it fought to keep its own award from coming out of the general class settlement fund .
After creating the $ 16 million pot of cash , Somers now wants to see people claim it : " I do n't think anyone 's going to do any better than that . "
No one knows quite what to expect as Matt Smith steps into David Tennant ’s shoes as Doctor Who ‘s new Time Lord .
In the quick clip we ’ve seen so far , Smith seems quirkier for sure — and he looks to be an enthusiastic traveler .
So what is Smith ’s take on the Doctor ’s psyche ?
“ I think the Doctor ’s got a lot of blood on his hands , ” says the new star of the long - running British sci- fi show in this exclusive video for Wired.com .
Smith also tells why he thinks the good Doctor travels the universe .
The new 13 - episode season of Doctor Who , with Stephen Moffat taking over as the show ’s lead writer , will be shown on BBC One starting April 3 in Britain .
It comes to BBC America on April 17 .

Scientists have discovered 243 - million - year - old fossils of dinosaurs ' closest relatives , pushing back the origin of dinosaurs by at least 10 million years *.*
The dinosaur - like creature , Asilisaurus kongwe , was about the size of a Labrador retriever and had teeth and jawbones ideally shaped for eating plants , indicating it ate a mostly vegetarian diet .
" This shows that the lineage leading to dinosaurs goes a lot further back in time than we thought .
The second thing is that it shows that there ’s this real ecological diversity , " said paleontologist Randy Irmis , co-author of the study appearing Mar. 3 in Nature .
" No one thought that the closest relatives to dinosaurs were these four - legged , herbivorous animals .
We thought they were small carnivores . "
The earliest known dinosaur fossils are around 230 million years old .
The new findings indicate that the dinosaurs and the silesaurs , the group that encompasses genus Asilisaurus , diverged more than 243 million years ago .
That means dinosaurs must have originated sometime before then .
The team found more than a dozen partial skeletons of Asilisaurus in bare patches in the Tanzanian grasslands .
During the Triassic period , the area was warm and lush , with a mixture of woodlands and lower plants like ferns .
" Back then it was a very large river system , maybe something like the Mississippi today , " said lead author and University of Texas at Austin paleontologist Sterling Nesbitt .
During that time , Africa , South America , Antarctica , Australia and India were all one giant continent called Gondwana .
Though silesaurs are very closely related to dinosaurs , they lack the open hip - sockets that are universal in dinosaurs .
The Asilisaurus was a small , four - legged creatures with a long tail .
Their beak - like jaws and leaf - shaped teeth helped the animals eat the soft , fibrous leaves of the primordial palms , ferns and conifers that were prevalent during the Triassic period .
That suggests that , while the animal may not have been exclusively vegetarian , a good portion of its diet came from plants , he said .
" In a carnivorous animal , the teeth are pointed , or they are serrated , like a knife to cut meat .
In order for this to be efficient , the serration has to be perpendicular to the edge of the tooth so that it functions like a knife , " said paleontologist Gilles Cuny of the the Natural History Museum of Denmark , who was not involved in the study .
" In these leaf - shaped teeth , you have some very vague serrations , but they are oriented towards the top of the teeth . "
The findings overturn the previously held idea that the closest relatives to dinosaurs were two - legged , cat - sized predators , Irmis said .
The team also found that similar teeth and jaws evolved separately in the line of dinosaurs that includes apatosaurus , as well as in another line that included triceratops and stegosaurus .
All these changes occurred within 10 million years of each other .
" We were really surprised , " Irmis said .
" These are three different groups that are really closely related to each other , so you ’d expect that maybe their common ancestor had this tooth form .
And no , it evolved independently in these three groups . "
That suggests that each of these lineages evolved separately to take advantage of a large , untapped food source , he said .

I first started hearing rumblings about The Human Centipede coming out of various genre festivals sometime last year , and all of the comments seemed to imply the same thing : this is one of the most demented and disturbing horror films to come around in a long while .
I had been a bit apprehensive about digging deeper to find out more about this flick , but now that the first official trailer has arrived online , I could n’t resist .
Be warned … if you ’ve got a weak stomach , even a description of the plot might be too much for you .
If that is the case , stop reading now !
The set up seems similar to movies like Hostel in that it follows two girls who are traveling through Europe .
One night in Germany , their car breaks down during a storm in the middle of nowhere , and they seek refuge in a nearby villa .
Little do they know , the man who took them in is a retired surgeon who has a unique fantasy : to construct the world ’s first human caterpillar by taking captives and surgically connecting them mouth - to - anus !
Apparently this is the first in a trilogy from Dutch artist and filmmaker Tom Six ( the full title is The Human Centipede : First Sequence ) , and IFC will release it via VOD on April 28th , and in select theatres on April 30th .
Will you brave such a sick and twisted proposition ?
Check out the trailer after the jump , and if you think you can handle it , watch a few more clips here .
British democracy is flawed at its heart .
A voting system that was barely defensible in an era of broad , stable class loyalties has become grotesquely unfair as those loyalties have eroded .
It now destroys our engagement with politics and damages the integrity of MPs .
It helps give the British state its particular character – the peripatetic flow of initiatives from a controlling centre and its symbiotic relationship with a hyper - populist media .
It creates parties in thrall to vested - interested groups , mostly recently Big Finance .
Above all , if fairness is a value we care about , the voting system is an offence to any conception of fair political representation .
A state that can collude in this degree of unfairness in its electoral system is unlikely to be especially fair itself .
It was hardly democratic in a former age when 95 % voted for two parties .
With the TV debates creating a genuine three - party race , the probable distribution of seats in a new parliament makes first - past - the - post untenable .
The problem is not the lack of a working majority , it 's that Labour could lose the election but in effect win the parliament .
While the Liberal Democrat vote is evenly spread , Labour 's vote is concentrated in the urban and old industrial constituencies in the Midlands , the north , Wales and Scotland while Conservative votes pile up in the rolling shires .
If there needs to be a coalition government , negotiating it becomes infinitely harder when the parliamentary power of the parties departs so incredibly from the political reality outside .
The charts here , drawn from information on the BBC 's seat calculator , illustrate just how unfair the results could be .
If the votes for the three main parties stood at 30 % each on May 6 ( with " others " such as the Scottish and Welsh nationalists at 10 % ) , Labour would return to Westminster with 315 MPs , 11 short of an overall majority , while the Conservatives have 206 and the Liberal Democrats a mere 100 .
In a second outcome , with the Lib Dems topping the poll with 34 % , the Tories coming second with 33 % and Labour last with 32 % , Gordon Brown 's party would retain 300 seats .
More extraordinarily still , if the Tories win the popular vote with 33 % , the Lib Dems come second with 30 % and Labour last with 27 % , Labour would pip the Tories to be the largest party in the House of Commons by 262 to 257 – with the Lib Dems picking up a lowly 102 seats .
Britain sends observers to elections in countries which have fairer voting systems .
Defenders of the status quo have to argue that this is a one - off , transitional , if admittedly bizarre political outcome , the result of the progressive part of the country deciding which of the two broadly liberal parties is going to be its chief standard bearer .
Once that is settled , there will be a new duopoly between the Conservatives and whatever dominant progressive party emerges – either a reconstructed , rejuvenated Labour party or the newly mature Lib Dems .
Politics in the conception of those who push for the current system is a grand game between two broad opposing coalitions of left and right who seek a mandate for " firm " government with a first - past - the - post system .
The voting system is only playing back to us , albeit in a vastly exaggerated way , the political truth that both the current Conservatives and Labour parties are malfunctioning political constructs .
They say that once the new left and right formations are reconstituted , which will take time , first past the post will work well .
The argument does not work , and on so many levels .
In the first place it presupposes that democracy is only about grand left / right clashes and government can only be successfully prosecuted by one political party in control .
Neither is true .
Democracy is the process that anchors the public realm , but it is the vitality of the whole public sphere that allows both good government and democratic argument .
Is government effective and well - co- ordinated ?
Are official decision - makers held properly to account ?
Are our parties and the government machine too easily captured by vested interests ?
Do citizens feel the complexity and range of their views count and are even heard ?
What is the quality of public debate ?
On all these scores Britain does not do well .
The British electorate is changing .
We are better educated .
Our political loyalties are much more fluid .
We want our votes and opinions to count .
Yet the majority of us vote in constituencies which are essentially rotten boroughs that will return the same party come what may .
Your choice , if not from a winning party , is not to vote or vote tactically .
Only in the 100 or so marginals , where Lord Ashcroft has directed his millions , is there a genuine political contest .
It is the fast road to voter disengagement .
Bidding for votes from this fluid , much more biddable electorate becomes a life and death game in a first - past - the - post system .
If you can move a few per cent towards you , especially in the marginals , control of the state falls into your hands .
With stakes this high party leaderships impose iron control on their parties to stay " on message " .
They court the good opinion of the aggressively populist media with populist initiative after populist initiative .
The centre becomes ever more important .
Political debate and argument is behind closed doors , with MPs rehearsing the line to take and voting dutifully as lobby fodder .
A political career for many MPs is reduced from being an honourable vocation to being the puppet of the small coterie around the leader – as true of David Cameron 's and Gordon Brown 's teams today as it once was of Tony Blair's .
The parties are much more open to the rich and powerful – whether trade unions in the past or now Big Finance .
In a first - past - the - post system like ours it is not the views of the party members and MPs that count , but the leadership who control and dictate so much .
Capture the leadership 's ear with the promise of party donations , threats of exiting the country if you do n't get what you want , or assurances of compliance in some dearly held party aim and you can have enormous influence – as a succession of investment bankers , private equity and hedge - fund partners have found with all three parties .
Proportional representation does not end all this ; Big Finance will be still be here , if hopefully much reformed .
But it changes democratic dynamics .
It opens the system up .
It forces argument out into the public domain .
It connects party leaderships with their MPs , and MPs with their voters .
It requires the voter to be engaged and serious about politics .
It will embolden some politicians to be less in thrall to the right - of - centre press .
Above all , proportionality is at the heart of fairness .
To move to a proportional voting system is a huge step ; it asks our politicians to redefine what they consider fair .
The fairness in first past the post is the fairness of the primitive hunter - gatherer or the landed aristocracy : I eat all that I kill and leave only scraps ; I own all that I survey ; I accept no claim by others nor enter into any discussion .
I and my party won this election .
We have a majority in the House of Commons .
The state is ours .
We will now feast , at least until we worry about the next election .
This , apparently , offers the firm government that Britain needs .
This is nonsense .
The world is too complex and the challenges too difficult for one party to claim a monopoly of right – and to set about governing to dictat , while managing a 24/7 media with an endless flow of populist initiatives and offering private concessions to powerful vested interests .
The Labour party manifesto has made the tiniest of moves towards changing our voting system .
One good outcome in the next House of Commons is that only via a coalition with the Lib Dems could Labour command a majority – and the Lib Dems will insist on more proportional voting as the price of their support .
On the other hand , if the Conservatives were to win , they would entrench first past the post – but with 10 % fewer constituencies .
Thus , they hope , they would guarantee Tory majority rule for decades – and secure the character of the state .
But that is the heart of our problem as a country .
Even Tories are beginning to realise the current voting system is unsustainable .
The Lib Dem insurgency is serving the country well .
This is becoming an epic and crucially important general election .
• More election comment from Cif at the polls
In 2002 , Allison Pearson emerged as the chief chronicler of a very modern female malady : the crazed pursuit of the perfect life .
Her novel , I Don't Know How She Does
It , which started life as a column in the Daily Telegraph , told the story of that rarely sighted beast , a female hedge fund manager , and followed her struggle to juggle two children with her very full - time job .
The protagonist , Kate Reddy , may have had a nanny and a husband who was both gainfully employed and nifty in the kitchen , but her life seemed full of comic anxieties .
( The novel opened with her attempts to " distress " some Sainsbury 's mince pies that her daughter was taking to school , so that they looked appropriately , maternally , handmade . )
And while the book depicted an aspirational bubble that floats way over most of our heads , it found an immediate audience .
In fact , it became a bestseller , the film rights were sold , and Oprah Winfrey – that essential filter of the modern female experience – described it as a " bible for the working mother " .
In her worldly success , and her approach to life , it was assumed that Pearson was very similar to her protagonist .
She 's a high - flying journalist who has won a number of awards ; her partner is New Yorker writer Anthony Lane ; she has two children .
In precis , it 's a convincing portrait of a perfect life .
But yesterday , her comic tone was jettisoned .
Pearson has been writing for the Daily Mail for some years now , but this column was to be her last , she said , because she has depression .
She had always wanted to be " the best kind of girl " , but recently she found herself in a psychiatrist 's consulting room , assessing just how unhappy she was .
The psychiatrist asked if she 'd had any suicidal thoughts , and " I did n't mention the strange allure of a nearby motorway bridge at dead of night . . .
Eventually , I blurted into the silence : ' Sometimes , I think it would be easier not to be .
Not to be dead .
I have two children , I can't leave them .
But just to stop , you know .
To not exist for a while . ' "
Pearson went on to describe herself as a " sandwich woman " , one of a generation who had waited until their 30s to have children and then , just as their offspring were " sleeping through the night , one of [ their ] parents fell ill " .
The stress of this situation – and a job on top – has taken its toll .
" Is it women who are mad , or is it the society we live in ? " she asked .
" We always suspected there would be a price for Having it All , and we were happy to pay it ; but we did n't know the cost would be to our mental health . "
Over the last few months , many other stories like Pearson 's have emerged – tales of apparently enviable lives laid low .
In January , the popular novelist Marian Keyes posted a message on her website attesting to her " crippling depression . . .
I can't eat , I can't sleep , I can't write , I can't read , I ca n't talk to people " .
In February , an inquest found that the bestselling author Susan Morgan – who wrote under the pen name Zoe Barnes – had killed herself .
In March , on Desert Island Discs , the actor Emma Thompson recalled the depression she had experienced after her divorce from Kenneth Branagh in the mid-1990s , saying that she did n't think she had stayed " sane .
I should have sought professional help . "
And over the last few years , a number of memoirs of depression have been written by women .
The former Elle and Red magazine editor , Sally Brampton , wrote Shoot the Damn Dog .
The former Scotland editor of the Observer , Lorna Martin , wrote Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown .
And the former deputy literary editor of the Observer , Stephanie Merritt , published The Devil Within .
The mood of these memoirs was captured in a long , unflinching article by the American writer Daphne Merkin in the New York Times , in which she described her depression as " the sadness that runs under the skin of things , like blood , beginning as a trickle and ending up as a haemorrhage , staining everything " .
This deluge should n't come as a surprise ; over a period of decades , study after study has suggested that women are diagnosed with depression at twice the rate of men ; in recent years , one study found this specific ratio occurring across nine different countries , regardless of economics and culture .
As Merritt , who has written widely on the subject , points out , these findings are open to question – " because it 's possible that , for men , drug and alcohol abuse could be symptoms of a depression that they just can't articulate .
It could be that women are more able to ask for help . "
But there is no doubt that the numbers regarding women and depression are stark – 11.2 % of the female population are experiencing it at any one time .
And those figures are on the rise .
Last year , an NHS study showed that between 1993 and 2007 , while there had been no change in the number of common mental disorders such as depression and panic attacks in men , they had risen by a fifth for women aged 45 - 64 .
For over - 75s , such disorders were twice as likely among women as men .
A study of 15 - year - olds in Scotland found that while 19 % of girls experienced such common mental disorders in 1987 , that incidence had increased to 44 % by 2006 ( a year in which the figure for boys reached 21 % ) .
And , last year , in the US , academics Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers published a report called The Paradox of Declining Female Happiness .
" The lives of women in the US have improved over the past 35 years by many objective measures , " they wrote , " yet we show that measures of subjective wellbeing indicate that women 's happiness has declined both absolutely and relative to men . "
Of course , when studies of this kind are published – spanning the period of second - wave feminism , and showing a diminution in female happiness – the word often goes out that it is time for women to throw off their business suits and get back in the kitchen .
The argument runs that feminism has failed , worn women out , and that a return to domesticity is the answer .
The problem is , of course , that the domestic realm was itself a depressant – as anyone who has ever read The Yellow Wallpaper or The Feminine Mystique , watched The Stepford Wives , or lived through the 1950s , will fully realise .
Depression can , of course , have a multitude of sources – divorces , bereavements , the sea - deep pain of some childhood trauma .
But those problems have always existed .
I ask psychologist and author Dorothy Rowe , a leading expert on depression , where she thinks this modern stream stems from .
Could it have a physical basis ?
Could it be that old culprit : hormones ?
" No , there 's no evidence for that at all , " she says .
" I remember back in the 1980s , when I was working in Lincoln , and the received wisdom was that women got depressed after childbirth because of their hormones .
It 's always your hormones .
But at that time , under Thatcher , there was a huge recession , and there were many men who had lost their jobs at the steelworks .
Their wives could work as secretaries or in shops , and the men stayed at home with small children .
You suddenly found that there was an awful lot of postnatal depression among men .
That 's it .
It 's being at home , bringing up small children , and nobody ever addressing you as yourself . "
Now , says Rowe , while women are still often seen as mothers rather than individuals , there are many more pressures at play .
" There 's still this idea that you 've got to be a wonderful mother , but you also have to have a brilliant career , and you 've got to look attractive all the time , " she says .
" There is no way that you can maintain that and bring up children .
But it 's still being presented to women all the time , in every magazine , on every screen , that you should . "
Martin agrees with Rowe .
In her mid-30s , she was diagnosed with clinical depression , started a course of antidepressants , and eventually began a long period of therapy that brought her out of the " swamplands of the soul " .
She feels that : " There 's massive pressure on women these days to hold down a good , rewarding , fulfilling job , but also to be a good mother , and then to look good , and to look after yourself .
I think there comes a point where your body can't take it . "
She also suspects that we are being made sicker as a result of our culture of entitlement .
Consumer culture constantly undermines the idea that sadness can be an acceptable part of our lives – instead we are taught that the perfect life is verdantly happy , and that any malady can be treated , at a cost .
" I think we 're conditioned to think that sadness should n't be part of the human condition , " says Martin .
" But it is .
It 's like all of these difficult emotions , like loss , fear of mortality .
All of these emotions that seem so difficult , so they 're just pushed away – then they bubble up .
Perhaps we have to become a bit better at understanding and dealing with them . "
She admits though , that while " it 's very easy for me to sit here now and say these things , four years ago , if someone had said that I should have just come to terms with my sadness , I would have wanted to kill them . "
The fact is that modern women are , as Margaret Drabble has termed us , " pioneers " ; while our lives have changed inestimably over the last three decades , men 's have lagged behind .
We have forged careers , inched ever closer to the glass ceiling , seen our salaries increase – at the same time , we 're still expected to take on the lion 's share of the housework and childcare .
Meanwhile consumerism has dictated that we should be forever groomed , well - dressed ; that in order to have a good life we need Louboutin heels and Vuitton bags , a Botoxed brow , inch - long lashes , Cath Kidston curtains and a pastel - blue Aga .
It 's a situation that Pearson chronicled expertly in her novel .
" Is it coincidence , " she wrote , " that we spend far more than our parents ever did on the restyling and improvement of our homes – homes in which we spend less and less time . "
And , crucially , she noted that " mysteriously , childcare , though paid for by both parents , is always deemed to be the female 's responsibility . "
One of the most insidious aspects of this culture is that the quest for perfection seems to stop women getting help for depression as soon as they should .
As Martin says , " I desperately hated the fact that I needed help .
Our culture absolutely insists on us being strong , independent women , and so the idea that you actually need a bit of help , that 's the biggest hurdle . "
Merritt agrees : " I was very reluctant to be an object of pity , or to look vulnerable .
I did n't want people to think that I could n't manage .
But the problem is that the longer you leave it , the harder it becomes , and then you just start cutting corners to keep up this appearance of competence , and eventually you just implode , or explode , because you can't keep that up indefinitely .
The strain of acting the part of somebody who is doing well – and then having other people who depend on you , asking you to do more and more , is a huge issue .
But I think a lot of women impose that on themselves . "
One obvious answer to all this is that men need to do more in the home .
Another answer , says Rowe , is something that 's easier said than done for many women .
You have to let things slide .
" Most girls are still brought up to be very good , " she says , " and a good person is somebody who always feels that they can do better .
We 're brought up on the principle that if a job 's worth doing , it 's worth doing well .
And actually , what women need to learn is that if a job 's worth doing , it 's worth doing badly – as long as you get it done .
If you look around at the people who seem to cope with all that they 've got to do , you 'll see how women skimp things – saying , ' We 'll have something out of the freezer tonight for dinner ' for instance .
You need to distinguish very clearly between what 's essential to do properly , and what is n't essential .
There 's a lot of stuff that does n't need doing . "
Like distressing your mince pies , for example .

Schoenborn ( R ) said Joseph Ratzinger was blocked in the case of Groer ( L ) A senior Austrian cardinal has defended Pope Benedict XVI 's record on tackling child abuse within the Church .
Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn said efforts by the then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger to investigate a 1995 case were blocked by then Pope John Paul II .
Cardinal Schoenborn said the Vatican had argued an investigation would generate bad publicity .
The cardinal 's comments follow a week when the Vatican 's record on child abuse has been intensively scrutinised .
Cardinal Schoenborn told Austrian television that the current Pope tried to establish a Church investigation into abuse allegations against a previous Archbishop of Vienna , Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer .
The Austrian Church was rocked by allegations in 1995 that Cardinal Groer had molested youths at a monastery in the 1970s .
But it was not until 1998 that , on Vatican orders , Cardinal Groer relinquished all religious duties and sought exile in Germany .
He died in Austria in 2003 .
At the time of his resignation , Cardinal Groer , in a statement released by the Church in Vienna , asked for forgiveness but made no admission of guilt .
At the time , the Vatican drew sharp criticism from many Austrians for taking three years to act against Cardinal Groer .
Negative publicity Cardinal Schoenborn , who replaced Cardinal Groer as Archbishop of Vienna in 1995 , said Joseph Ratzinger was blocked in his efforts to confirm if there was a case to answer .
To accuse him of being someone who covers things up - having known the Pope for many years - I can say that is certainly not true
Cardinal Schoenborn According to Cardinal Schoenborn , Vatican officials persuaded Pope John Paul II that the allegations were exaggerated and that an investigation would open the Church up to negative publicity .
" I can still very clearly remember the moment when Cardinal Ratzinger sadly told me that the other camp had asserted itself , " Cardinal Schoenborn told ORF television .
" To accuse him of being someone who covers things up - having known the Pope for many years - I can say that is certainly not true , " he added .
This is not the first time that Christoph Schoenborn has intervened in the scandal currently confronting the Church .
Earlier this month , he said clergy celibacy should be examined in trying to uncover the causes of abuse by priests .

Earlier this year , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave a speech in which she made it clear that Internet freedom would be a major theme of the US government 's attempts to get information to the citizens of repressive governments .
Things have n't change much in the interim , with the conviction of Google executives in Italy serving as a reminder that it's not simply repressive regimes that put companies in legal hot water .
With those events as a backdrop , the US Senate 's Judiciary Committee heard testimony today on Internet freedom that emphasized how challenging it will be to find a way to open up the flow of information in repressive regimes .
The Google - Italy case did figure briefly , as an example of how even a country with values that have a significant overlap with those of the US can have significant legal differences when it comes to online activities ( Italy lacks the US ' safe harbor provisions for hosts of user - generated online content ) .
Still , the hearings focused primarily on those nations , such as China and Iran , that exercise significant control over online content .
The consensus at the hearings is that it's in the US government 's interests to continue to promote the free flow of information on the Internet , including in states like China and Iran .
The challenges that these nations pose came up throughout the testimony , but were best summarized in the testimony of Rebecca MacKinnon a Fellow at Princeton 's Center for Information Technology Policy .
MacKinnon noted that almost every aspect of technology and law that cause problems for the citizens of repressive regimes all have legitimate uses in other contexts .
So , for example , although US law allows a safe harbor , it remains illegal here to transfer things like child porn or classified materials over the Internet .
In other nations , however , various forms of basic political activity are illegal , and Internet companies may end up acting as censors or informants in order to comply with the laws of other countries .
Adding filtering capabilities to network hardware is essential for basic security , but the same technology can be used to enforce censorship .
The Global Network Initiative , meant to foster freedom of expression , had so far attracted only three corporations as members ( Google , Microsoft , and Yahoo ) .
Sanctions and export controls also create problems .
Google 's Nicole Wang suggested that browser - based encryption could potentially help dissidents communicate securely , but her company cannot allow downloads to nations like Cuba and Iran .
And a former Iranian blogger who has lived in the US since his 2004 detention by Iranian security forces pointed out that sanctions prevent US - based companies from hosting material where it 's out of reach of Iranian authorities .
Clearly , some finer - grained legal frameworks could help in these instances , but they would n't be enough to force systematic change in how both US regulators and businesses approach these markets .
When it comes to the current US administration , representatives for the Departments of State and Commerce were on hand to describe the progress of a multiagency task force that 's in the process of reviewing how best to promote Internet freedom in other countries .
But , in response to questions from Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) , the Commerce representative said that the results would n't be ready for public comment until several months from now .
In the meantime , the State Department is pursuing various informal methods of promoting the safe exchange of information with the citizens of repressive regimes , although it has to balance those activities against the risk of discrediting dissidents by having them appear to be too closely associated with the US .
Some of the Department 's efforts include hosting censored or deleted materials , providing education in the use of software for evading censorship and monitoring , and helping groups in different nations share relevant expertise .
The Commerce Department sees its role as using business regulation as a way of promoting freer exchange .
Many governments saddle US - based companies with burdensome regulations or inferior technologies as part of their censorship efforts — China 's Green Dam - Youth Escort was used as an example — and Commerce can help organize and add weight to the resistance .
But hearing Chair Richard Durbin ( D - IL ) also complained that many companies simply seemed uninterested in participating in the process .
He noted that Twitter and Facebook were invited to send representatives to the hearings , but declined .
The Global Network Initiative , meant to foster freedom of expression , had so far attracted only three corporations as members ( Google , Microsoft , and Yahoo ) .
What 's needed , MacKinnon argued , is a change in attitude : " Just as companies have a social responsibility not to pollute our air and water or exploit twelve - year - olds , companies have a responsibility not to collaborate with the suppression of peaceful speech . "
So , how do we drive this sort of cultural change in businesses ?
MacKinnon suggested one way to get there would be the classic American approach to almost anything : a lawsuit .
She recommended that US laws allow those targeted for repression to sue any US - based companies that turned over information on them .
Durbin also mentioned that he was considering a bill that would require companies take steps to protect human rights overseas .
Overall , the clear message is that using the US ' economic and political leverage to drive an open Internet will be a long and difficult process .
Companies will always have to balance their humanitarian instincts against their business interests , and a lone company wo n't be able to drive significant change on its own .
The government can play an important role in coordinating the efforts of US - based businesses and providing support and expertise for local dissidents .
All of those , combined with the content - agnostic nature of the Internet itself should eventually be enough to open some societies , but it wo n't happen overnight , and the efforts will almost certainly require a fine - tuning of US law along the way .
Bus rapid transit is successfully showing its virtues in Sin City .
Last Thursday , Las Vegas broke ground on the ACE Green Line , a new BRT corridor that will connect downtown Las Vegas and Henderson , the second largest city in Nevada .
The new buses , expected to begin operation late next year , will run on dedicated lanes along a 15 - kilometer route of Boulder Highway , which is located to the east of the famous Las Vegas “ Strip ” and similarly dotted with several casinos and motels .
Another line , the ACExpress W line , is also slated to launch later this year .
The Green Line begins construction just weeks after the launch of the ACE ’s first two BRT lines — the ACE Gold Line and the ACExpress C - Line — which have been heavily marketed to appeal to people who would n’t ordinarily get out of their cars to ride the bus because of long - held assumptions and stigmas about mass transit .
One C - Line passenger , Chris Jacobs , a manager at Trump International Hotel , said , “ This is the first time I ’ve taken public transportation .
Ever . ”
And he ’s not alone .
The Regional Transportation Commission ( RTC ) of Southern Nevada is spending $ 164.6 million of public money , some of it from the federal stimulus , to improve the way people move around Las Vegas .
“ This is our first truly commuter - type transit service , ” says Tracy Bower , RTC ’s director of media and government affairs , referring to the ACExpress C - Line , which connects Centennial Hills , a master - planned community in northwest Las Vegas , to the downtown area , and continues out to the University of Nevada , Las Vegas ( UNLV ) .
She emphasizes that a route to downtown that would typically take more than an hour can now be traveled in half the time .
The new ACE lines have already exceeded ridership expectations , officials say .
So far , about 20,000 people per day ride the ACE Gold Line , and 12,000 people have ridden the ACExpress C Line .
This far exceeds the 4,000 to 6,000 riders originally predicted by the RTC ’s computer models .
RAIL ENVY
Though local leaders like Rep. Dina Titus , from the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee , and RTC Commissioner Chris Giunchigliani both praise the benefits of Las Vegas ’ new BRT system — like job creation and shorter travel times — they also seem to have an inherent preference for light rail .
“ I ’d like to see light rail , but in the meantime , this is great , ” Titus says .
Giunchigliani adds , “ next to light rail , this is the next best thing in mass transit . ”
But perhaps they ’re not giving the buses enough credit .
NOT YOUR GRANDFATHER’S BUS
Part of the appeal of the new ACE buses is that they have been purposefully designed not to look like buses .
“ This is Las Vegas , ” says RTC General Manager Jacob Snow .
“ We need to have something that looks different than your grandfather ’s bus . ”
Snow is sure to highlight the ACE system ’s fast , reliable , quiet , comfortable and sleek buses , as well as the elements of art and architecture visible in the stations , platforms , street landscaping , and even traffic signals .
“ There are a lot of urban design improvements on that cordior , ” Snow says .
“ Research shows that if you ’re traveling down a corridor that looks nice … your brain thinks you ’re getting there quicker than you actually are . ”
This perceived comfort and convenience is n’t all an illusion , though .
Other features of the new buses , common to standard BRT systems elsewhere in the world , include prepaid ticketing from vending machines at transit stations ( through a system known as Ticket Now ) , limited stop service , dedicated bus - only lanes , and level - platform boarding .
“ I ’d say it ’s a train on tires , ” Snow says .
“ Every aspect of this system is designed to operate like a right rail system , except that we do have rubber ties , so it has some flexibility . ”
In addition , the “ Park and Ride ” terminal buildings have air conditioning , heating , restrooms and information displays that make “ you have a lot more control over your experience , ” Snow adds .
( Click here to read more about why he thinks the future of public transportation in Vegas lies in bus rapid transit , written in a guest column for the Las Vegas Sun . )
In terms of frequency , ACE buses run about every 10 minutes , which is considered moderately frequent for BRT service in the U.S. , where headways range from 3 to 20 minutes .
But compared to international BRT systems , it ’s still quite low .
In Latin American countries the headways vary from less than 1 minute ( in cities like Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre , Brazil ) to 10 minutes , depending on the time of day .
In countries with high passenger demand , such as Kunming , China and Seoul , Korea , the average headway during the day is continuously less than 1 minute .
( See : “ Bus Rapid Transit Features and Deployment Phases for U.S. Cities . ” )
ADDED BONUSES
The new ACE services have boosted ridership on the city ’s existing bus services , including the 24 - hour , double - decker bus line , known as The Deuce , which stops at nearly every casino and hotel along The Strip , and the Metropolitan Area Express ( or MAX ) , the city ’s very first BRT line , which has been running on Las Vegas Boulevard North since 2004 .
Studies have shown that when the MAX began using the larger buses on dedicated lanes , ridership increased by 35 to 40 percent .
The new lines may also encourage dense development , which is a good thing for an urban desert known for its sprawl .
The city of Henderson — now connected to Vegas by the ACE Green Line — recently created a Boulder Highway Investment Strategy that calls for high - density , mixed - use development integrated with multi-modal transportation .
“ This is part of our sustainable future , ” says Henderson City Councilwoman Debra March .
“ This is an opportunity for good development to take place along the transit corridor . ”
Transmen or female - to - males ( FTM ) are men who were born biologically female but have taken steps to align their gender identity with their presentation .
Some FTM 's elect to have hormones or surgery to accomplish this , but not all choose this option .
The Difference Between Sex and Gender :
People often get these two terms confused because they are similar yet in reality they are entirely different .
Sex is the biological genitalia we are born with , either male , female , or intersex ( combination of male / female genitalia ) .
Gender is how we identify and is a social / biological construct , so in the case of transmen , one may have the parts of a female yet their mind , body , and spirit identifies as a male .
The genitalia one has or lacks does not define their gender identity .
Trans Males and Sexual Identity :
Like all people transmen can be of any sexual orientation .
The majority of transmen like the majority of the population are heterosexual .
However many identify as gay , bisexual , queer or asexual .
Typically one 's gender identity does not dictate their sexual identity .
The Silenced Voice of Trans Men :
Transmen suffer discrimination from all angles .
Many transmen often first find community among lesbians but quickly get drowned out and / or ostracized when they begin to transition .
They face an equal amount of discrimination from many gay and straight men who often do not view them as " real men "
FTM Privilege :
While all transmen face hardships for expressing their identity and have a difficult time finding their place in society there are also privileges associated with being trans .
Transmen often report getting treated with more respect once they transition .
They do n't suffer as much with the stigma and inequalities that women face in job pay , life , and other arenas .
The Influence of Transitioning on Sexuality & Gender Identity
While most people do not find their sexual identity shifting during the transition process there is growing discussion among those who find that hormones may have some impact on sexual orientation .
Below is a guest post on the subject from Sinclar Sexsmith of the Sugarbutch Chronicles :
" One of the most challenging concepts gender theorists like myself work to introduce to the general population is the disruption of the Sex - Gender Assumption - the assumption that sexuality and gender identity are intrinsically linked , and therefore , for example , that all gay men are effeminate and all lesbians are mannish .
Or , on the flip side , that all feminine women are straight and all masculine men are gay .
This is simply not true - one 's gender is not the same as one 's sexual orientation , though they do influence each other .
Think of it as an elaborate dance between the two : the orientation , the sexuality itself being the source of desire , and the gender as one of the physical languages in which to express it .
As different as these things are , however , there are some ways that they are inseparable , and interact with each other .
As I came into my own gender identity in my late 20s , my sexuality began to grow and shift with newfound desires , and I figured out yet more traits that are now basically requirements for my sexual relationships .
As my sexuality grew , so did my gender , and so did the ways that I played with gender in the bedroom , sexually .
Transitioning changes your physical presentation of gender , sure ; great physical effects , finally matching the body to an ' internal ' gender or “ subconscious sex ” ( as Julia Serano calls it ) .
And as those effects go deeper , as testosterone flows freely , transitioning can sometimes bring changes in sexual orientation or other aspects of sexuality .
It has happened frequently enough that there are even some jokes about it - “ testosterone makes you gay , ” some queers joke , meaning , it makes you want to sleep with guys .
I 've seen trans guys become more fully liberated through this process , never before feeling so much like themselves ; I 've also seen trans guys struggle to maintain relationships because of their changing sexuality .
Is it possible that the sexual orientation of “ queer ” can somehow overrides one 's gender identity ?
If one 's gender changes , but one remains queer , will one 's orientation switch too ?
Regardless of whether a certain person is a man or a woman , will some of us still be queer ?
No one knows exactly how the interactions between sexuality and gender identity work - even these concepts barely existed just fifty years ago .
And of course , this shift of sexual orientation is n't true for all of those who transition - though the effects of testosterone do deeply effect all sorts of physical things , like muscle mass , center of gravity , sex drive , desires , and stamina .
As research , observation , and experience is more and more available and less stigmatized , the intertwined connections between sexual orientation and gender identity will , hopefully , become more understood "
How Can a Biological Female Change to Male Bodied ?
Female to male sex reassignment surgery is a complicated and long journey and requires a host of procedures .
FTM's who want a complete transformation can elect to remove their female organs and take testosterone to deepen their voice , develop muscles and facial hair .
The breasts can be removed to create a male looking chest and the clitoris can be elongated to create a penis and scrotal implants can be inserted .
Transgender Female - to - Male Terminology :
FTM or F2M - Female to male transsexual .
Binding -
The process of flattening ones breasts in order to have a more male appearing chest .
Packing -
The process of creating a male looking bulge in the crotch .
Top surgery - Chest reconstruction surgery to remove the breasts to create a more male looking chest .
Bottom surgery - Genital reconstruction surgery for constructing a penis from ones own donor tissue and the possible addition of scrotal implants .
Drag King -
A biological female who impersonates a male .
Drag is usually done for entertainment purposes and does not necessarily reflect the persons desire to live as a male or female .

I. The Shadow On The Chimney There was thunder in the air on the night I went to the deserted mansion atop Tempest Mountain to find the lurking fear .
I was not alone , for foolhardiness was not then mixed with that love of the grotesque and the terrible which has made my career a series of quests for strange horrors in literature and in life .
With me were two faithful and muscular men for whom I had sent when the time came ; men long associated with me in my ghastly explorations because of their peculiar fitness .
We had started quietly from the village because of the reporters who still lingered about after the eldritch panic of a month before - the nightmare creeping death .
Later , I thought , they might aid me ; but I did not want them then .
Would to God I had let them share the search , that I might not have had to bear the secret alone so long ; to bear it alone for fear the world would call me mad or go mad itself at the demon implications of the thing .
Now that I am telling it anyway , lest the brooding make me a maniac , I wish I had never concealed it .
For I , and I only , know what manner of fear lurked on that spectral and desolate mountain .
In a small motor - car we covered the miles of primeval forest and hill until the wooded ascent checked it .
The country bore an aspect more than usually sinister as we viewed it by night and without the accustomed crowds of investigators , so that we were often tempted to use the acetylene headlight despite the attention it might attract .
It was not a wholesome landscape after dark , and I believe I would have noticed its morbidity even had I been ignorant of the terror that stalked there .
Of wild creatures there were none - they are wise when death leers close .
The ancient lightning - scarred trees seemed unnaturally large and twisted , and the other vegetation unnaturally thick and feverish , while curious mounds and hummocks in the weedy , fulgurite - pitted earth reminded me of snakes and dead men's skulls swelled to gigantic proportions .
Fear had lurked on Tempest Mountain for more than a century .
This I learned at once from newspaper accounts of the catastrophe which first brought the region to the world 's notice .
The place is a remote , lonely elevation in that part of the Catskills where Dutch civilization once feebly and transiently penetrated , leaving behind as it receded only a few mined mansions and a degenerate squatter population inhabiting pitiful hamlets on isolated slopes .
Normal beings seldom visited the locality till the state police were formed , and even now only infrequent troopers patrol it .
The fear , however , is an old tradition throughout the neighboring villages ; since it is a prime topic in the simple discourse of the poor mongrels who sometimes leave their valleys to trade handwoven baskets for such primitive necessities as they cannot shoot , raise , or make .
The lurking fear dwelt in the shunned and deserted Martense mansion , which crowned the high but gradual eminence whose liability to frequent thunderstorms gave it the name of Tempest Mountain .
For over a hundred years the antique , grove - circled stone house had been the subject of stories incredibly wild and monstrously hideous ; stories of a silent colossal creeping death which stalked abroad in summer .
With whimpering insistence the squatters told tales of a demon which seized lone wayfarers after dark , either carrying them off or leaving them in a frightful state of gnawed dismemberment ; while sometimes they whispered of blood trails toward the distant mansion .
Some said the thunder called the lurking fear out of its habitation , while others said the thunder was its voice .
No one outside the backwoods had believed these varying and conflicting stories , with their incoherent , extravagant descriptions of the hall - glimpsed fiend ; yet not a farmer or villager doubted that the Martense mansion was ghoulishly haunted .
Local history forbade such a doubt , although no ghostly evidence was ever found by such investigators as had visited the building after some especially vivid tale of the squatters .
Grandmothers told strange myths of the Martense spectre ; myths concerning the Martense family itself , its queer hereditary dissimilarity of eyes , its long , unnatural annals , and the murder which had cursed it .
The terror which brought me to the scene was a sudden and portentous confirmation of the mountaineers ' wildest legends .
One summer night , after a thunderstorm of unprecedented violence , the countryside was aroused by a squatter stampede which no mere delusion could create .
The pitiful throngs of natives shrieked and whined of the unnamable horror which had descended upon them , and they were not doubted .
They had not seen it , but had heard such cries from one of their hamlets that they knew a creeping death had come .
In the morning citizens and state troopers followed the shuddering mountaineers to the place where they said the death had come .
Death was indeed there .
The ground under one of the squatter 's villages had caved in after a lightning stroke , destroying several of the malodorous shanties ; but upon this property damage was superimposed an organic devastation which paled it to insignificance .
Of a possible seventy - five natives who had inhabited this spot , not one living specimen was visible .
The disordered earth was covered with blood and human debris bespeaking too vividly the ravages of demon teeth and talons ; yet no visible trail led away from the carnage .
That some hideous animal must be the cause , everyone quickly agreed ; nor did any tongue now revive the charge that such cryptic deaths formed merely the sordid murders common in decadent communities .
That charge was revived only when about twenty - five of the estimated population were found missing from the dead ; and even then it was hard to explain the murder of fifty by half that number .
But the fact remained that on a summer night a bolt had come out of the heavens and left a dead village whose corpses were horribly mangled , chewed , and clawed .
The excited countryside immediately connected the horror with the haunted Martense mansion , though the localities were over three miles apart .
The troopers were more skeptical ; including the mansion only casually in their investigations , and dropping it altogether when they found it thoroughly deserted .
Country and village people , however I canvassed the place with infinite care ; overturning everything in the house , sounding ponds and brooks , beating down bushes , and ransacking the nearby forests .
All was in vain ; the death that had come had left no trace save destruction itself .
By the second day of the search the affair was fully treated by the newspapers , whose reporters overran Tempest Mountain .
They described it in much detail , and with many interviews to elucidate the horror 's history as told by local grandams .
I followed the accounts languidly at first , for I am a connoisseur in horrors ; but after a week I detected an atmosphere which stirred me oddly , so that on August 5th , 1921 , I registered among the reporters who crowded the hotel at Lefferts Corners , nearest village to Tempest Mountain and acknowledged headquarters of the searchers .
Three weeks more , and the dispersal of the reporters left me free to begin a terrible exploration based on the minute inquiries and surveying with which I had meanwhile busied myself .
So on this summer night , while distant thunder rumbled , I left a silent motor - car and tramped with two armed companions up the last mound - covered reaches of Tempest Mountain , casting the beams of an electric torch on the spectral grey walls that began to appear through giant oaks ahead .
In this morbid night solitude and feeble shifting illumination , the vast boxlike pile displayed obscure hints of terror which day could not uncover ; yet I did not hesitate , since I had come with fierce resolution to test an idea .
I believed that the thunder called the death - demon out of some fearsome secret place ; and be that demon solid entity or vaporous pestilence , I meant to see it .
I had thoroughly searched the ruin before , hence knew my plan well ; choosing as the seat of my vigil the old room of Jan Martense , whose murder looms so great in the rural legends .
I felt subtly that the apartment of this ancient victim was best for my purposes .
The chamber , measuring about twenty feet square , contained like the other rooms some rubbish which had once been furniture .
It lay on the second story , on the southeast corner of the house , and had an immense east window and narrow south window , both devoid of panes or shutters .
Opposite the large window was an enormous Dutch fireplace with scriptural tiles representing the prodigal son , and opposite the narrow window was a spacious bed built into the wall .
As the tree - muffled thunder grew louder , I arranged my plan 's details .
First I fastened side by side to the ledge of the large window three rope ladders which I had brought with me .
I knew they reached a suitable spot on the grass outside , for I had tested them .
Then the three of us dragged from another room a wide four - poster bedstead , crowding it laterally against the window .
Having strewn it with fir boughs , all now rested on it with drawn automatics , two relaxing while the third watched .
From whatever direction the demon might come , our potential escape was provided .
If it came from within the house , we had the window ladders ; if from outside the door and the stairs .
We did not think , judging from precedent , that it would pursue us far even at worst .
I watched from midnight to one o'clock , when in spite of the sinister house , the unprotected window , and the approaching thunder and lightning , I felt singularly drowsy .
I was between my two companions , George Bennett being toward the window and William Tobey toward the fireplace .
Bennett was asleep , having apparently felt the same anomalous drowsiness which affected me , so I designated Tobey for the next watch although even he was nodding .
It is curious how intently I had been watching the fireplace .
The increasing thunder must have affected my dreams , for in the brief time I slept there came to me apocalyptic visions .
Once I partly awaked , probably because the sleeper toward the window had restlessly flung an arm across my chest .
I was not sufficiently awake to see whether Tobey was attending to his duties as sentinel , but felt a distinct anxiety on that score .
Never before had the presence of evil so poignantly oppressed me .
Later I must have dropped asleep again , for it was out of a phantasmal chaos that my mind leaped when the night grew hideous with shrieks beyond anything in my former experience or imagination .
In that shrieking the inmost soul of human fear and agony clawed hopelessly and insanely at the ebony gates of oblivion .
I awoke to red madness and the mockery of diabolism , as farther and farther down inconceivable vistas that phobic and crystalline anguish retreated and reverberated .
There was no light , but I knew from the empty space at my right that Tobey was gone , God alone knew whither .
Across my chest still lay the heavy arm of the sleeper at my left .
Then came the devastating stroke of lightning which shook the whole mountain , lit the darkest crypts of the hoary grove , and splintered the patriarch of the twisted trees .
In the demon flash of a monstrous fireball the sleeper started up suddenly while the glare from beyond the window threw his shadow vividly upon the chimney above the fireplace from which my eyes had never strayed .
That I am still alive and sane , is a marvel I can not fathom .
I cannot fathom it , for the shadow on that chimney was not that of George Bennett or of any other human creature , but a blasphemous abnormality from hell 's nethermost craters ; a nameless , shapeless abomination which no mind could fully grasp and no pen even partly describe .
In another second I was alone in the accursed mansion , shivering and gibbering .
George Bennett and William Tobey had left no trace , not even of a struggle .
They were never heard of again .
II .
A Passer In The Storm For days after that hideous experience in the forest - swathed mansion I lay nervously exhausted in my hotel room at Lefferts Corners .
I do not remember exactly how I managed to reach the motor - car , start it , and slip unobserved back to the village ; for I retain no distinct impression save of wild - armed titan trees , demoniac mutterings of thunder , and Charonian shadows athwart the low mounds that dotted and streaked the region .
As I shivered and brooded on the casting of that brain - blasting shadow , I knew that I had at last pried out one of earth 's supreme horrors - one of those nameless blights of outer voids whose faint demon scratchings we sometimes hear on the farthest rim of space , yet from which our own finite vision has given us a merciful immunity .
The shadow I had seen , I hardly dared to analyse or identify .
Something had lain between me and the window that night , but I shuddered whenever I could not cast off the instinct to classify it .
If it had only snarled , or bayed , or laughed titteringly - even that would have relieved the abysmal hideousness .
But it was so silent .
It had rested a heavy arm or foreleg on my chest ...
Obviously it was organic , or had once been organic ...
Jan Martense , whose room I had invaded , was buried in the grave - yard near the mansion ...
I must find Bennett and Tobey , if they lived ... why had it picked them , and left me for the last ?...
Drowsiness is so stifling , and dreams are so horrible ...
In a short time I realised that I must tell my story to someone or break down completely .
I had already decided not to abandon the quest for the lurking fear , for in my rash ignorance it seemed to me that uncertainty was worse than enlightenment , however terrible the latter might prove to be .
Accordingly I resolved in my mind the best course to pursue ; whom to select for my confidences , and how to track down the thing which had obliterated two men and cast a nightmare shadow .
My chief acquaintances at Lefferts Corners had been the affable reporters , of whom several had still remained to collect final echoes of the tragedy .
It was from these that I determined to choose a colleague , and the more I reflected the more my preference inclined toward one Arthur Munroe , a dark , lean man of about thirty - five , whose education , taste , intelligence , and temperament all seemed to mark him as one not bound to conventional ideas and experiences .
On an afternoon in early September , Arthur Munroe listened to my story .
I saw from the beginning that he was both interested and sympathetic , and when I had finished he analysed and discussed the thing with the greatest shrewdness and judgement .
His advice , moreover , was eminently practical ; for he recommended a postponement of operations at the Martense mansion until we might become fortified with more detailed historical and geographical data .
On his initiative we combed the countryside for information regarding the terrible Martense family , and discovered a man who possessed a marvelously illuminating ancestral diary .
We also talked at length with such of the mountain mongrels as had not fled from the terror and confusion to remoter slopes , and slope again scanned for dens and caves , but all without result .
And yet , as I have said , vague new fears hovered menacingly over us ; as if giant bat - winged gryphons looked on transcosmic gulfs .
As the afternoon advanced , it became increasingly difficult to see ; and we heard the rumble of a thunderstorm gathering over Tempest Mountain .
This sound in such a locality naturally stirred us , though less than it would have done at night .
As it was , we hoped desperately that the storm would last until well after dark ; and with that hope turned from our aimless hillside searching toward the nearest inhabited hamlet to gather a body of squatters as helpers in the investigation .
Timid as they were , a few of the younger men were sufficiently inspired by our protective leadership to promise such help .
We had hardly more than turned , however , when there descended such a blinding sheet of torrential rain that shelter became imperative .
The extreme , almost nocturnal darkness of the sky caused us to stumble badly , but guided by the frequent flashes of lightning and by our minute knowledge of the hamlet we soon reached the least porous cabin of the lot ; an heterogeneous combination of logs and boards whose still existing door and single tiny window both faced Maple Hill .
Barring the door after us against the fury of the wind and rain , we put in place the crude window shutter which our frequent searches had taught us where to find .
It was dismal sitting there on rickety boxes in the pitchy darkness , but we smoked pipes and occasionally flashed our pocket lamps about .
Now and then we could see the lightning through cracks in the wall ; the afternoon was so incredibly dark that each flash was extremely vivid .
The stormy vigil reminded me shudderingly of my ghastly night on Tempest Mountain .
My mind turned to that odd question which had kept recurring ever since the nightmare thing had happened ; and again I wondered why the demon , approaching the three watchers either from the window or the interior , had begun with the men on each side and left the middle man till the last , when the titan fireball had scared it away .
Why had it not taken its victims in natural order , with myself second , from whichever direction it had approached ?
With what manner of far - reaching tentacles did it prey ?
Or did it know that I was the leader , and saved me for a fate worse than that of my companions ?
In the midst of these reflections , as if dramatically arranged to intensify them , there fell nearby a terrific bolt of lightning followed by the sound of sliding earth .
At the same time the wolfish wind rose to demoniac crescendos of ululation .
We were sure that the one tree on Maple Hill had been struck again , and Munroe rose from his box and went to the tiny window to ascertain the damage .
When he took down the shutter the wind , and rain howled deafeningly in , so that I could not hear what he said ; but I waited while he leaned out and tried to fathom Nature 's pandemonium .
Gradually a calming of the wind and dispersal of the unusual darkness told of the storm 's passing .
I had hoped it would last into the night to help our quest , but a furtive sunbeam from a knothole behind me removed the likelihood of such a thing .
Suggesting to Munroe that we had better get some light even if more showers came , I unbarred and opened the crude door .
The ground outside was a singular mass of mud and pools , with fresh heaps of earth from the slight landslide ; but I saw nothing to justify the interest which kept my companion silently leaning out the window .
Crossing to where he leaned , I touched his shoulder ; but he did not move .
Then , as I playfully shook him and turned him around , I felt the strangling tendrils of a cancerous horror whose roots reached into illimitable pasts and fathomless abysms of the night that broods beyond time .
For Arthur Munroe was dead .
And on what remained of his chewed and gouged head there was no longer a face .
III .
What The Red Glare Meant
On the tempest - racked night of November 8 , 1921 , with a lantern which cast charnel shadows , I stood digging alone and idiotically in the grave of Jan Martense .
I had begun to dig in the afternoon , because a thunderstorm was brewing , and now that it was dark and the storm had burst above the maniacally thick foliage I was glad .
I believe that my mind was partly unhinged by events since August 5th ; the demon shadow in the mansion , the general strain and disappointment , and the thing that occurred at the hamlet in an October storm .
After that thing I had dug a grave for one whose death I could not understand .
I knew that others could not understand either , so let them think Arthur Munroe had wandered away .
They searched , but found nothing .
The squatters might have understood , hut I dared not frighten them more .
I myself seemed strangely callous .
That shock at the mansion had done something to my brain , and I could think only of the quest for a horror now grown to cataclysmic stature in my imagination ; a quest which the fate of Arthur Munroe made me vow to keep silent and solitary .
The scene of my excavations would alone have been enough to unnerve any ordinary man .
Baleful primal trees of unholy size , age , and grotesqueness leered above me like the pillars of some hellish Druidic temple ; muffling the thunder , hushing the clawing wind , and admitting but little rain .
Beyond the scarred trunks in the background , illumined by faint flashes of filtered lightning , rose the damp ivied stones of the deserted mansion , while somewhat nearer was the abandoned Dutch garden whose walks and beds were polluted by a white , fungous , foetid , over - nourished vegetation that never saw full daylight .
And nearest of all was the graveyard , where deformed trees tossed insane branches as their roots displaced unhallowed slabs and sucked venom from what lay below .
Now and then , beneath the brown pall of leaves that rotted and festered in the antediluvian forest darkness , I could trace the sinister outlines of some of those low mounds which characterized the lightning - pierced region .
History had led me to this archaic grave .
History , indeed , was all I had after everything else ended in mocking Satanism .
I now believed that the lurking fear was no material being , but a wolf - fanged ghost that rode the midnight lightning .
And I believed , because of the masses of local tradition I had unearthed in search with Arthur Munroe , that the ghost was that of Jan Martense , who died in 1762 .
This is why I was digging idiotically in his grave .
The Martense mansion was built in 1670 by Gerrit Martense , a wealthy New - Amsterdam merchant who disliked the changing order under British rule , and had constructed this magnificent domicile on a remote woodland summit whose untrodden solitude and unusual scenery pleased him .
The only substantial disappointment encountered in this site was that which concerned the prevalence of violent thunderstorms in summer .
When selecting the hill and building his mansion , Mynheer Martense had laid these frequent natural outbursts to some peculiarity of the year ; but in time he perceived that the locality was especially liable to such phenomena .
At length , having found these storms injurious to his head , he fitted up a cellar into which he could retreat from their wildest pandemonium .
Of Gerrit Martense 's descendants less is known than of himself ; since they were all reared in hatred of the English civilisation , and trained to shun such of the colonists as accepted it .
Their life was exceedingly secluded , and people declared that their isolation had made them heavy of speech and comprehension .
In appearance all were marked by a peculiar inherited dissimilarity of eyes ; one generally being blue and the other brown .
Their social contacts grew fewer and fewer , till at last they took to intermarrying with the numerous menial class about the estate .
Many of the crowded family degenerated , moved across the valley , and merged with the mongrel population which was later to produce the pitiful squatters .
The rest had stuck sullenly to their ancestral mansion , becoming more and more clannish and taciturn , yet developing a nervous responsiveness to the frequent thunderstorms .
Most of this information reached the outside world through young Jan Martense , who from some kind of restlessness joined the colonial army when news of the Albany Convention reached Tempest Mountain .
He was the first of Gerrit 's descendants to see much of the world ; and when he returned in 1760 after six years of campaigning , he was hated as an outsider by his father , uncles , and brothers , in spite of his dissimilar Martense eyes .
No longer could he share the peculiarities and prejudices of the Martenses , while the very mountain thunderstorms failed to intoxicate him as they had before .
Instead , his surroundings depressed him ; and he frequently wrote to a friend in Albany of plans to leave the paternal roof .
In the spring of 1763 Jonathan Gifford , the Albany friend of Jan Martense , became worried by his correspondent 's silence ; especially in view of the conditions and quarrels at the Martense mansion .
Determined to visit Jan in person , he went into the mountains on horseback .
His diary states that he reached Tempest Mountain on September 20 , finding the mansion in great decrepitude .
The sullen , odd - eyed Martenses , whose unclean animal aspect shocked him , told him in broken gutterals that Jan was dead .
He had , they insisted , been struck by lightning the autumn before ; and now lay buried behind the neglected sunken gardens .
They showed the visitor the grave , barren and devoid of markers .
Something in the Martenses ' manner gave Gifford a feeling of repulsion and suspicion , and a week later he returned with spade and mattock to explore the sepulchral spot .
He found what he expected - a skull crushed cruelly as if by savage blows - so returning to Albany he openly charged the Martenses with the murder of their kinsman .
Legal evidence was lacking , but the story spread rapidly round the countryside ; and from that time the Martenses were ostracised by the world .
No one would deal with them , and their distant manor was shunned as an accursed place .
Somehow they managed to live on independently by the product of their estate , for occasional lights glimpsed from far - away hills attested their continued presence .
These lights were seen as late as 1810 , but toward the last they became very infrequent .
Meanwhile there grew up about the mansion and the mountain a body of diabolic legendry .
The place was avoided with doubled assiduousness , and invested with every whispered myth tradition could supply .
It remained unvisited till 1816 , when the continued absence of lights was noticed by the squatters .
At that time a party made investigations , finding the house deserted and partly in ruins .
There were no skeletons about , so that departure rather than death was inferred .
The clan seemed to have left several years before , and improvised penthouses showed how numerous it had grown prior to its migration .
Its cultural level had fallen very low , as proved by decaying furniture and scattered silverware which must have been long abandoned when its owners left .
But though the dreaded Martenses were gone , the fear of the haunted house continued ; and grew very acute when new and strange stories arose among the mountain decadents .
There it stood ; deserted , feared , and linked with the vengeful ghost of Jan Martense .
There it still stood on the night I dug in Jan Martense 's grave .
I have described my protracted digging as idiotic , and such it indeed was in object and method .
The coffin of Jan Martense had soon been unearthed - it now held only dust and nitre - but in my fury to exhume his ghost I delved irrationally and clumsily down beneath where he had lain .
God knows what I expected to find - I only felt that I was digging in the grave of a man whose ghost stalked by night .
It is impossible to say what monstrous depth I had attained when my spade , and soon my feet , broke through the ground beneath .
The event , under the circumstances , was tremendous ; for in the existence of a subterranean space here , my mad theories had terrible confirmation .
My slight fall had extinguished the lantern , but I produced an electric pocket lamp and viewed the small horizontal tunnel which led away indefinitely in both directions .
It was amply large enough for a man to wriggle through ; and though no sane person would have tried at that time , I forgot danger , reason , and cleanliness in my single - minded fever to unearth the lurking fear .
Choosing the direction toward the house , I scrambled recklessly into the narrow burrow ; squirming ahead blindly and rapidly , and flashing but seldom the lamp I kept before me .
What language can describe the spectacle of a man lost in infinitely abysmal earth ; pawing , twisting , wheezing ; scrambling madly through sunken - convolutions of immemorial blackness without an idea of time , safety , direction , or definite object ?
There is something hideous in it , but that is what I did .
I did it for so long that life faded to a far memory , and I became one with the moles and grubs of nighted depths .
Indeed , it was only by accident that after interminable writhings I jarred my forgotten electric lamp alight , so that it shone eerily along the burrow of caked loam that stretched and curved ahead .
I had been scrambling in this way for some time , so that my battery had burned very low , when the passage suddenly inclined sharply upward , altering my mode of progress .
And as I raised my glance it was without preparation that I saw glistening in the distance two demoniac reflections of my expiring lamp ; two reflections glowing with a baneful and unmistakable effulgence , and provoking maddeningly nebulous memories .
I stopped automatically , though lacking the brain to retreat .
The eyes approached , yet of the thing that bore them I could distinguish only a claw .
But what a claw !
Then far overhead I heard a faint crashing which I recognized .
It was the wild thunder of the mountain , raised to hysteric fury - I must have been crawling upward for some time , so that the surface was now quite near .
And as the muffled thunder clattered , those eyes still stared with vacuous viciousness .
Thank God I did not then know what it was , else I should have died .
But I was saved by the very thunder that had summoned it , for after a hideous wait there burst from the unseen outside sky one of those frequent mountainward bolts whose aftermath I had noticed here and there as gashes of disturbed earth and fulgurites of various sizes .
With Cyclopean rage it tore through the soil above that damnable pit , blinding and deafening me , yet not wholly reducing me to a coma .
In the chaos of sliding , shifting earth I clawed and floundered helplessly till the rain on my head steadied me and I saw that I had come to the surface in a familiar spot ; a steep unforested place on the southwest slope of the mountain .
Recurrent sheet lightnings illumed the tumbled ground and the remains of the curious low hummock which had stretched down from the wooded higher slope , but there was nothing in the chaos to show my place of egress from the lethal catacomb .
My brain was as great a chaos as the earth , and as a distant red glare burst on the landscape from the south I hardly realised the horror I had been through .
But when two days later the squatters told me what the red glare meant , I felt more horror than that which the mould - burrow and the claw and eyes had given ; more horror because of the overwhelming implications .
In a hamlet twenty miles away an orgy of fear had followed the bolt which brought me above ground , and a nameless thing had dropped from an overhanging tree into a weak - roofed cabin .
It had done a deed , but the squatters had fired the cabin in frenzy before it could escape .
It had been doing that deed at the very moment the earth caved in on the thing with the claw and eyes .
IV .
The Horror In The Eyes There can be nothing normal in the mind of one who , knowing what I knew of the horrors of Tempest Mountain , would seek alone for the fear that lurked there .
That at least two of the fear 's embodiments were destroyed , formed but a slight guarantee of mental and physical safety in this Acheron of multiform diabolism ; yet I continued my quest with even greater zeal as events and revelations became more monstrous .
When , two days after my frightful crawl through that crypt of the eyes and claw , I learned that a thing had malignly hovered twenty miles away at the same instant the eyes were glaring at me , I experienced virtual convulsions of fright .
But that fright was so mixed with wonder and alluring grotesqueness , that it was almost a pleasant sensation .
Sometimes , in the throes of a nightmare when unseen powers whirl one over the roofs of strange dead cities toward the grinning chasm of Nis , it is a relief and even a delight to shriek wildly and throw oneself voluntarily along with the hideous vortex of dream - doom into whatever bottomless gulf may yawn .
And so it was with the walking nightmare of Tempest Mountain ; the discovery that two monsters had haunted the spot gave me ultimately a mad craving to plunge into the very earth of the accursed region , and with bare hands dig out the death that leered from every inch of the poisonous soil .
As soon as possible I visited the grave of Jan Martense and dug vainly where I had dug before .
Some extensive cave - in had obliterated all trace of the underground passage , while the rain had washed so much earth back into the excavation that I could not tell how deeply I had dug that other day .
I likewise made a difficult trip to the distant hamlet where the death - creature had been burnt , and was little repaid for my trouble .
In the ashes of the fateful cabin I found several bones , but apparently none of the monster's .
The squatters said the thing had had only one victim ; but in this I judged them inaccurate , since besides the complete skull of a human being , there was another bony fragment which seemed certainly to have belonged to a human skull at some time .
Though the rapid drop of the monster had been seen , no one could say just what the creature was like ; those who had glimpsed it called it simply a devil .
Examining the great tree where it had lurked , I could discern no distinctive marks .
I tried to find some trail into the black forest , but on this occasion could not stand the sight of those morbidly large boles , or of those vast serpent - like roots that twisted so malevolently before they sank into the earth .
My next step was to reexamine with microscopic care the deserted hamlet where death had come most abundantly , and where Arthur Munroe had seen something he never lived to describe .
Though my vain previous searches had been exceedingly minute , I now had new data to test ; for my horrible grave - crawl convinced me that at least one of the phases of the monstrosity had been an underground creature .
This time , on the 14th of November , my quest concerned itself mostly with the slopes of Cone Mountain and Maple Hill where they overlook the unfortunate hamlet , and I gave particular attention to the loose earth of the landslide region on the latter eminence .
The afternoon of my search brought nothing to light , and dusk came as I stood on Maple Hill looking down at the hamlet and across the valley to Tempest Mountain .
There had been a gorgeous sunset , and now the moon came up , nearly full and shedding a silver flood over the plain , the distant mountainside , and the curious low mounds that rose here and there .
It was a peaceful Arcadian scene , but knowing what it hid I hated it .
I hated the mocking moon , the hypocritical plain , the festering mountain , and those sinister mounds .
Everything seemed to me tainted with a loathsome contagion , and inspired by a noxious alliance with distorted hidden powers .
Presently , as I gazed abstractedly at the moonlit panorama , my eye became attracted by something singular in the nature and arrangement of a certain topographical element .
Without having any exact knowledge of geology , I had from the first been interested in the odd mounds and hummocks of the region .
I had noticed that they were pretty widely distributed around Tempest Mountain , though less numerous on the plain than near the hilltop itself , where prehistoric glaciation had doubtless found feebler opposition to its striking and fantastic caprices .
Now , in the light of that low moon which cast long weird shadows , it struck me forcibly that the various points and lines of the mound system had a peculiar relation to the summit of Tempest Mountain .
That summit was undeniably a centre from which the lines or rows of points radiated indefinitely and irregularly , as if the unwholesome Martense mansion had thrown visible tentacles of terror .
The idea of such tentacles gave me an unexplained thrill , and I stopped to analyse my reason for believing these mounds glacial phenomena .
The more I analysed the less I believed , and against my newly opened mind there began to beat grotesque and horrible analogies based on superficial aspects and upon my experience beneath the earth .
Before I knew it I was uttering frenzied and disjointed words to myself ; " My God !...
Molehills ... the damned place must be honeycombed ... how many ... that night at the mansion ... they took Bennett and Tobey first ... on each side of us ... "
Then I was digging frantically into the mound which had stretched nearest me ; digging desperately , shiveringly , but almost jubilantly ; digging and at last shrieking aloud with some unplaced emotion as I came upon a tunnel or burrow just like the one through which I had crawled on the other demoniac night .
After that I recall running , spade in hand ; a hideous run across moon - litten , mound - marked meadows and through diseased , precipitous abysses of haunted hillside forest ; leaping screaming , panting , bounding toward the terrible Martense mansion .
I recall digging unreasonably in all parts of the brier - choked cellar ; digging to find the core and centre of that malignant universe of mounds .
And then I recall how I laughed when I stumbled on the passageway ; the hole at the base of the old chimney , where the thick weeds grew and cast queer shadows in the light of the lone candle I had happened to have with me .
What still remained down in that hell - hive , lurking and waiting for the thunder to arouse it , I did not know .
Two had been killed ; perhaps that had finished it .
But still there remained that burning determination to reach the innermost secret of the fear , which I had once more come to deem definite , material , and organic .
My indecisive speculation whether to explore the passage alone and immediately with my pocket - light or to try to assemble a band of squatters for the quest , was interrupted after a time by a sudden rush of wind from the outside which blew out the candle and left me in stark blackness .
The moon no longer shone through the chinks and apertures above me , and with a sense of fateful alarm I heard the sinister and significant rumble of approaching thunder .
A confusion of associated ideas possessed my brain , leading me to grope back toward the farthest corner of the cellar .
My eyes , however , never turned away from the horrible opening at the base of the chimney ; and I began to get glimpses of the crumbling bricks and unhealthy weeds as faint glows of lightning penetrated the weeds outside and illumined the chinks in the upper wall .
Every second I was consumed with a mixture of fear and curiosity .
What would the storm call forth - or was there anything left for it to call ?
Guided by a lightning flash I settled myself down behind a dense clump of vegetation , through which I could see the opening without being seen .
If heaven is merciful , it will some day efface from my consciousness the sight that I saw , and let me live my last years in peace .
I cannot sleep at night now , and have to take opiates when it thunders .
The thing came abruptly and unannounced ; a demon , ratlike scurrying from pits remote and unimaginable , a hellish panting and stifled grunting , and then from that opening beneath the chimney a burst of multitudinous and leprous life - a loathsome night - spawned flood of organic corruption more devastatingly hideous than the blackest conjurations of mortal madness and morbidity .
Seething , stewing , surging , bubbling like serpents ' slime it rolled up and out of that yawning hole , spreading like a septic contagion and streaming from the cellar at every point of egress - streaming out to scatter through the accursed midnight forests and strew fear , madness , and death .
God knows how many there were - there must have been thousands .
To see the stream of them in that faint intermittent lightning was shocking .
When they had thinned out enough to be glimpsed as separate organisms , I saw that they were dwarfed , deformed hairy devils or apes - monstrous and diabolic caricatures of the monkey tribe .
They were so hideously silent ; there was hardly a squeal when one of the last stragglers turned with the skill of long practice to make a meal in accustomed fashion on a weaker companion .
0 thers snapped up what it left and ate with slavering relish .
Then , in spite of my daze of fright and disgust , my morbid curiosity triumphed ; and as the last of the monstrosities oozed up alone from that nether world of unknown nightmare , I drew my automatic pistol and shot it under cover of the thunder .
Shrieking , slithering , torrential shadows of red viscous madness chasing one another through endless , ensanguined condors of purple fulgurous sky ... formless phantasms and kaleidoscopic mutations of a ghoulish , remembered scene ; forests of monstrous over - nourished oaks with serpent roots twisting and sucking unnamable juices from an earth verminous with millions of cannibal devils ; mound - like tentacles groping from underground nuclei of polypous perversion ... insane lightning over malignant ivied walls and demon arcades choked with fungous vegetation ...
Heaven be thanked for the instinct which led me unconscious to places where men dwell ; to the peaceful village that slept under the calm stars of clearing skies .
I had recovered enough in a week to send to Albany for a gang of men to blow up the Martense mansion and the entire top of Tempest Mountain with dynamite , stop up all the discoverable mound - burrows , and destroy certain over - nourished trees whose very existence seemed an insult to sanity .
I could sleep a little after they had done this , but true rest will never come as long as I remember that nameless secret of the lurking fear .
The thing will haunt me , for who can say the extermination is complete , and that analogous phenomena do not exist all over the world ?
Who can , with my knowledge , think of the earth 's unknown caverns without a nightmare dread of future possibilities ?
I cannot see a well or a subway entrance without shuddering ... why can not the doctors give me something to make me sleep , or truly calm my brain when it thunders ?
What I saw in the glow of flashlight after I shot the unspeakable straggling object was so simple that almost a minute elapsed before I understood and went delirious .
The object was nauseous ; a filthy whitish gorilla thing with sharp yellow fangs and matted fur .
It was the ultimate product of mammalian degeneration ; the frightful outcome of isolated spawning , multiplication , and cannibal nutrition above and below the ground ; the embodiment of all the snarling and chaos and grinning fear that lurk behind life .
It had looked at me as it died , and its eyes had the same odd quality that marked those other eyes which had stared at me underground and excited cloudy recollections .
One eye was blue , the other brown .
They were the dissimilar Martense eyes of the old legends , and I knew in one inundating cataclysm of voiceless horror what had become of that vanished family ; the terrible and thunder - crazed house of Martense .
Nashville , Tennessee ( CNN ) --
Almost every weekend , there is a tradition called raging at Vanderbilt University .
It 's a recurring , drunken activity that is n't the proudest moment for student Frannie Boyle .
After consuming large quantities of alcohol before a party , her night would sometimes end in making out with a stranger or acquaintance .
Casual hook ups fueled by alcohol may be the norm across college campuses , but Boyle , now a 21 - year - old junior at the school , chose to stop .
Her reasons to quit hooking up echo the emotional devastation of many college students , particularly girls whose hearts are broken by the hook - up scene .
" I saw it [ hooking up ] as a way to be recognized and get satisfaction , " said Boyle , shaking her blond ponytail .
" I felt so empty then . "
The hook - up culture on campuses may seem more pervasive than ever , especially as media outlets , books and documentaries rush to dissect the subject , but some college women and men are saying no .
Some , like Boyle , experimented with hooking up and quit .
Though she is Catholic , she says her reason for disengaging herself from the hook - up culture had more to do with the unhappiness she experienced afterward .
Others influenced by religion have abstained from casual physical activity from the moment they set foot on campus .
The idea of rejecting hook - ups may not be as strange as it sounds in a generation surrounded by sex .
Pop star Lady Gaga recently announced she was celibate and encouraged others to follow .
In Kelly Clarkson 's song " I Don't Hook Up , " she addresses the dominant hook - up culture : " I do not hook up , up I go slow , so if you want me I do n't come cheap . "

The term " hook up " is ambiguous , usually defined as a no-commitment , physical encounter with a stranger or acquaintance .
Hooking up can range from just a make - out session all the way to sex .
Other lingo for the no-commitment sexual encounters are " booty calls " or " friends with benefits . "
Read the downsides of having friends with benefits
Various academic studies have cited at least 75 percent of women have engaged in hooking up on campus , and the number is usually higher for men .
The activity is most likely precipitated by alcohol , studies show .
Boyle 's decision to quit hooking up leaves her in the minority .
Evidence of the backlash on hooking up on campuses can be seen in the growing popularity of the Love and Fidelity Network , a secular , nonprofit group dedicated to helping college students open the discussion for a lifestyle that does n't involve casual sexual activity with anonymous or uncommitted partners .
The organization , which promotes sexual integrity and defends marriage though discussion and speakers , has gained a presence on at least 20 schools from Harvard University to the University of Notre Dame since its inception in 2007 .
There is no official count on the number of students who participate in the Love and Fidelity Network .
But at Princeton University , about 40 students have joined .
The group says it does not judge those who hook up , but it does promote abstinence .
" A majority of college campuses , when it comes to discussing marriage and sexual relationships , tend to be very one - sided , " said Cassandra Hough , founding director of the Love and Fidelity Network .
" We feel that it does add to pressures for young men and women to participate in a certain type of culture . "
At Vanderbilt University , a pristine campus defined by elegant , Southern - style architecture and manicured lawns , the hook - up culture can be hard to avoid , Boyle said .
The Greek scene also can create more pressure to hook up , added Boyle , who is a member of a sorority .
Boyle explained the warm weather compels some students to engage in " day fratting , " imbibing for hours in the front yard of a fraternity .
Day fratting can result in " afternoon delight , " noncommittal physical activity between two people that can include casual sex .
" Right now , people conceive the idea of what they think from the media and friends -- that the only options are to extremes : to deny everything fun , including sex , or just to hook up , " says Emily O'Connell , a freshman at the College of William and Mary in Virginia .
After observing the hook - up scene as a freshman , O'Connell is starting a nonreligious group to talk about alternatives to hooking up .
" There 's definitely a middle ground , and it's not that outrageous , " she said .
In addition to protection from STDs , some students may have good reasons not to hook up .
Over the past decade , scholars , researchers and authors have begun to examine the psychological toll of hooking up .
An April 2010 study from James Madison University in Virginia revealed more college women tend to want a relationship out of a hook up compared with men who prefer to stay independent .
Other studies have shown the instability from hooking up can cause depression .
Repeated rejection and detached relationships can also damage self - esteem .
But Laura Sessions Stepp , author of " Unhooked : How Young Women Pursue Sex , Delay Love , and Lose at Both , " said not all hook - ups have a negative impact .
Some students can engage in no-strings relationships without suffering emotional trauma .
Some women say casual sexual activity allows them the benefits of experimentation .
It 's unclear at what point hooking up eclipsed traditional dates .
But what is clear is that some students , like Boyle , want old - fashioned courtship to return .
Kathleen Bogle , who wrote " Hooking Up : Sex , Dating , and Relationships on Campus " in 2008 , says she 's found there is a strong and growing desire to bring back traditional dating .
Bogle points to the uptick in college students participating in online dating .
On Facebook.com , several groups are rooting for the traditional dates .
The motto on the group Bring Dating Back reads , " This group is for all those girls who wish that once in a while a guy would take her out on a date before trying to get her into bed .
At least invite us to dinner before expecting us to get down and dirty ! "
Vanderbilt student Boyle says her decision she made at the end of her freshman year to quit hooking up came with criticism .
She is still surrounded by friends and peers who do it .
She 's already lost some guy friends who could n't understand her decision .
But Boyle counters , " They probably were n't my friends anyway . "
Several students from her school participated in the Love and Fidelity Network 's annual conference earlier this year .
There is a possibility that Vanderbilt may start a similar nonreligious group that provides an alternative discussion to hooking up .
" I 'm respecting myself , " Boyle said confidently one sunny morning before class .
" And I wo n't waste my time with some guy who does n't care about me . "
These children were tended to by a team of mental health professionals , special ed teachers , assistants and anger management people whose jobs were specifically to de escalate , discuss issues , work with the families of these children and to bring them back to a place that they could function in society .
Some of them were very disturbed and violent .
Their ages ranged from 4years old to 21 and some of them were there until they aged out .
I was an MSW and my job was to work with these individuals on a one on one basis and with their families .
There was a a point where you would need to decide if they were serious about their violence and usually , they were .
The next step was to determine if they could put it all together and actually plan an act of violence that could potentially , harm , maim or even kill someone .
Many of them were not able to follow through with their threats to harm because they could not focus long enough to commit the act .
Others did n't need that focus because their anger was constantly there and could lash out with anything handy .
Some could be reasoned with .
Some just used threats to scare their fellow students and never really followed through except with flailing around and yelling strong words and threats .
For all of these " children " there were consequences for their behavior .
No they were n't put in a dark box for days without food ... they had to answer to their teachers , understand that the things that they did were harmful to others , sometimes they had to go home in a Police Car , which back then was rare and not be allowed back to school until their suspension was over .
I was never sure why that was a punishment .
Where I am going here is that looking out at the horizon , since HCR seems to be a fact , there is a group of people , adults , with full permission to act out their violence , drop all the social niceties , name call , spit on , and basically behave in a way that is anti social with the blessings of certain news agencies , political parties , and individuals that stand for this kind of behavior , in fact , rabble rouse them .
Since the bill was passed in Congress , I can't help but notice that there are dangerous , angry people with leaders who help them to finish the acts of aggression against innocent bystanders and many of these individuals need only be armed with misinformation and a placard to get started .
Back at the Day Treatment Program , there would have been consequences .
Most folk know if they want a secure gateway between the Internet and their home or business they should use Linux for maximum protection .
The new IPFire distribution seeks to take security to the highest level while also making things a breeze for the less experienced to set up .
Linux can be daunting for those from the Windows world , more used to point - and - click interfaces than a plethora of command - line instructions , and for those without a network security background the general task of establishing a secure server may not be straightforward .
IPFire seeks to address both these , as expressed in its tagline , ' security gone easy ! '
In particular , IPFire has been designed to serve as a policeman and traffic copy intercepting and inspecting all the traffic between your network and the Internet .
In this regard it essentially turns a computer into a sophisticated firewall and router appliance .
This is achieved by bundling a pre-configured collection of top - notch open source security tools as well as IPFire 's own custom - built packet manager called Pakfire .
Pakfire permits close inspection of TCP / IP packets as they come in to the network and thus the ability to make complex decisions based on them .
Pakfire supports a plug - in architecture so it can be easily extended by others .
IPFire is n't just a burn , mount and forget distro ; effort has been expended by the designers to ensure it keeps up to date with security and regulatory patches and changes .
In addition , the team behind IPFire has put in a lot of work to make sure the whole lot is glued together in a cohesive user interface which aims to be clear from beginners through to experienced old hands .
IPFire has downloadable images to suit CDs , USB sticks , embedded device and even a ready - to - run Xen virtual machine .

El IFE se estaría dando un balazo en el pie : Marco Antonio Baños
El listado , manzana de la discordia para discutir la cédula de identidad
This month , Battlefield Earth , the 2000 big budget flop based on Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard ’s novel , won the Razzie for “ Worst Movie of the Decade ” .
J.D. Shapiro , the film ’s original screenwriter , accepted the award in person .
This appeared first in today ’s New York Post :
By J.D. SHAPIRO
Let me start by apologizing to anyone who went to see Battlefield Earth .
It was n’t as I intended — promise .
No one sets out to make a train wreck .
Actually , comparing it to a train wreck is n’t really fair to train wrecks , because people actually want to watch those .
It started , as so many of my choices do , with my Willy Wonker .
It was 1994 , and I had read an article in Premiere magazine saying that the Celebrity Center , the Scientology epicenter in Los Angeles , was a great place to meet women .
Willy convinced me to go check it out .
Touring the building , I did n’t find any eligible women at first , but I did meet Karen Hollander , president of the center , who said she was a fan of Robin Hood : Men in Tights .
We ended up talking for over two hours .
She told me why Scientology is so great .
I told her that , when it comes to organized religion , anything a person does to reward , threaten and try to control people by using an unknown like the afterlife is dangerous .
Nonetheless , Karen called me a few days later asking if I ’d be interested in turning any of L. Ron Hubbard ’s books into movies .
Eventually , I had dinner with John Travolta , his wife Kelly Preston , Karen — about 10 Scientologists in all .
John asked me , “ So , J.D. , what brought you to Scientology ? ”
I told him .
John smiled and replied , “ We have tech that can help you handle that . ”
I do n’t know if he meant they had technology that would help me get laid or technology that would stop Willy from doing the majority of my thinking .
I researched Scientology before signing on to the movie , to make sure I was n’t making anything that would indoctrinate people .
I took a few courses , including the Purification Rundown , or Purif .
You go to CC every day , take vitamins and go in and out of a sauna so toxins are released from your body .
You ’re supposed to reach an “ End Point . ”
I never did , but I was bored so I told them I had a vision of L. Ron .
They said , “ What did he say ? ” “ Pull my finger , ” was my response .
They said I was done .
During my Scientology research , I met an employee who I instantly had a crush on .
She was kind of a priestess , and had dedicated her life to working for the church by becoming a Sea Org member .
She said that she signed a billion - year contract .
I said , “ What !
Really ? ”
She said she got paid a small stipend of $ 50 a week , to which I said , “ Can you get an advance on the billion years , like say , a mere $ 500,000 ? ”
And then she said as a Sea Org member , you ca n’t have sex unless you ’re married .
I asked her if she was married .
She said yes .
So I said , “ Great !
That means we can have sex ! ”
As far as I know , I am the only non-Scientologist to ever be on their cruise ship , the Freewind .
I was a bit of an oddity , walking around in a robe , sandals , smoking Cuban cigars and drinking fine scotch ( Scientologists are not allowed to drink while taking courses ) .
I also got one of the best massages ever .
My friends asked if I got a “ happy ending . ”
I said , “ Yes , I got off the ship . ”
But if you ’re reading this to get the dirt on Scientology , sorry , no one ever tried to force me to do anything .
Even after all the “ trouble ” I ’d gotten into , people at the church liked me , so I read Battlefield Earth and agreed to come up with a pitch to take to studios .
I met with Mike Marcus , the president of MGM , and pitched him my take .
He loved it , and the next day negotiations went under way .
A few days after I finished the script , a very excited Travolta called , told me he “ loved it , ” and wanted to have dinner .
At dinner , John said again how much he loved the script and called it “ The Schindler ’s List of sci -fi . ”
My script was very , VERY different than what ended up on the screen .
My screenplay was darker , grittier and had a very compelling story with rich characters .
What my screenplay did n’t have was slow motion at every turn , Dutch tilts , campy dialogue , aliens in KISS boots , and everyone wearing Bob Marley wigs .
Shortly after that , John officially attached himself to the project .
Then several A - list directors expressed interest in making the movie , MGM had a budget of $ 100 million , and life was grrrrreat !
I got studio notes that were typical studio notes .
Nothing too crazy .
I incorporated the notes I felt worked , blew off the bad ones and did a polish .
I sent it to the studio , thinking the next I ’d hear is what director is attached .
Then I got another batch of notes .
I thought it was a joke .
They changed the entire tone .
I knew these notes would kill the movie .
The notes wanted me to lose key scenes , add ridiculous scenes , take out some of the key characters .
I asked Mike where they came from .
He said , “ From us . ”
But when I pressed him , he said , “ From John ’s camp , but we agree with them . ”
I refused to incorporate the notes into the script and was fired .
I have no idea why they wanted to go in this new direction , but here ’s what I heard from someone in John ’s camp :
Out of all the books L. Ron wrote , this was the one the church founder wanted most to become a movie .
He wrote extensive notes on how the movie should be made .
Many people called it a Scientology movie .
It was n’t when I wrote it , and I do n’t feel it was in the final product .
Yes , writers put their beliefs into a story .
Sometimes it ’s subtle ( I guess L. Ron had something against the color purple , I have no idea why ) , sometimes not so subtle ( L. Ron hated psychiatry and psychologists , thus the reason , and I ’m just guessing here , that the bad aliens were called “ Psychlos ” ) .
The only time I saw the movie was at the premiere , which was one too many times .
Once it was decided that I would share a writing credit , I wanted to use my pseudonym , Sir Nick Knack .
I was told I could n’t do that , because if a writer gets paid over a certain amount of money , they can ’t .
I could have taken my name completely off the movie , but my agent and attorney talked me out of it .
There was a lot of money at stake .
Now , looking back at the movie with fresh eyes , I ca n’t help but be strangely proud of it .
Because out of all the sucky movies , mine is the suckiest .
In the end , did Scientology get me laid ?
What do you think ?
No way do you get any action by boldly going up to a woman and proclaiming , “ I wrote Battlefield Earth ! ”
If anything , I ’m trying to figure out a way to bottle it and use it as birth control .
I ’ll make a mint !
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama , in a preview of the election campaign Democrats will roll out later this year , recalled on Thursday the economic mess he inherited from the Republicans while saying the change he had promised upon winning the White House is being delivered .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
In remarks sown with references to the recession that Obama says his actions helped reverse , he assured fellow Democrats that his overhaul of the $ 2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare sector will yield genuine benefits for ordinary Americans .
“ The change you fought for is beginning to take hold , ” he told a fund - raising speech in Boston .
The reassurance may have been needed .
Opinion polls show many Americans are skeptical about the cost and scale of Obama ’s healthcare measures , risking possible Democratic losses in mid-term congressional elections in November .
Republican lawmakers , who opposed the bill unanimously , are targeting Democratic lawmakers who voted for the healthcare legislation .
Opposition to Obama ’s healthcare proposals has energized the Republicans ’ conservative base .
Shrugging off such concern , the president said unpopularity was a badge of honor that showed his administration was doing the right thing .
“ If you govern by pundits and polls you lose sight of why you got into public service in the first place , ” he said .
“ My job was n’t to husband my popularity , make sure I was n’t making waves .
It ’s how a lot of folks govern .
It ’s easy . ”
Americans remain anxious over still - sluggish economic growth and national unemployment of 9.7 percent .
Obama signed a $ 787 billion economic stimulus package last year to create jobs , but knows it will take time to pay dividends , and in the meantime his best defense is to keep reminding voters that it was the Republicans who are to blame .
He invoked the bailout of Wall Street launched by his Republican predecessor George W. Bush , and promised the audience that every dime of taxpayers ’ money would be recouped , before reminding them about the rescue of U.S. automakers who were now hiring again .
In addition to healthcare , Obama also touted the nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia to be signed on April 8 in Prague and education finance reforms , while warning of the looming fight to reform Wall Street and deliver on climate - change legislation .
But in a coded reference to the election setback some Democrats worry lies ahead in November , Obama recalled he had addressed a similar crowd of loyal supporters in Boston after losing the Democratic primary in New Hampshire to his then - rival Hillary Clinton -- before going on to win the Democratic nomination and ultimately triumph in the 2008 presidential election .
“ We ’re going to be OK .
We ’re going to be better than OK , ” he said .
NEW YORK ( AFP ) – A proposed 657 - million - dollar health settlement for some 10,000 people who worked at Ground Zero after the September 11 attacks was too low and must be renegotiated , a judge ruled Friday .
“ In my judgment , this settlement is not enough , ” federal Judge Alvin Hellerstein said in New York after hearing two hours of testimony from plaintiffs in the huge case .

“ There are some questions that have to be addressed , ” he added , calling for “ additional negotiations to come up with a fair deal . ”
Last week , a preliminary deal was announced in which a government - funded insurance company would compensate more than 10,000 people claiming health problems from their work in the toxic debris of the World Trade Center , which was destroyed in the 2001 attacks .
The deal needs the court ’s approval to go ahead , as well as the backing of 95 percent of plaintiffs .
They would have 90 days to review the proposal before making a decision .
Hellerstein singled out payment of lawyers ’ fees , which are expected to amount to some 200 million dollars or more — about a third of the compensation package .
The judge said the insurance company , not the plaintiffs should foot the attorneys ’ bill .
“ The fees should be paid by the Captive Insurance ” company , he said .

“ Plaintiffs should know what they would get at the end of the day to make an intelligent decision . ”
At the hearing , a majority of plaintiffs testified in support of the proposal .
“ I think it is a fair and accurate determination , ” said Michael Damato , a partially disabled laborer who said he earned 140,000 dollars a year before his stint at Ground Zero and now only earned 40,000 dollars .

Another witness , police officer Candice Baker , who said she suffered from breast cancer and had been operated on five times , asked Hellerstein to be “ as sympathetic , as compassionate as possible .
That is all I can ask . ”
The judge answered : “ I promise . ”

A new hearing was scheduled for April 12 .
Just when you thought you 'd had enough of Goldman Sachs running things -- and running them into the ground -- along comes Meg Whitman .
Most Californians know she 's using her fortune to run for governor .
They probably do n't know that she was once on the board of Goldman Sachs , and most likely still would be if she had n't been cited for a practice one law firm describes as " essentially ... an illegal bribe ... to corporate leaders . "
Then came the Congressional investigation , and the investor lawsuit , and ... well , it was probably best to just leave the board .
What kind of business relationship can Californians expect their state to have with Goldman Sachs and firms like it if Meg Whitman becomes governor ?
Here 's a clue :
In a report called " Corporate cash boosts Whitman , " the Associated Press reported that " The biggest donations came from New York investment bankers , hedge fund managers , attorneys and others . "
If there 's one thing these guys know it 's how to prime the pump .
Not that Whitman 's old pals at Goldman have n't already been profiting off California 's misery .
They were hired to manage some multibillion dollar state bond offerings but , as reported in the Los Angeles Times , millions in fees did n't stop Goldman from secretly undermining California 's credit rating .
That hurt the very sales they were hired to manage .
As the Times states , the firm " urged some of its big clients to place investment bets against California bonds " by " proposing a way for ... clients to profit from California 's deepening financial misery . "
California bucks keep rolling in anyway , despite that little bit of backstabbing ... and despite the fact that , unlike other major banking institutions , Goldman refuses to support reinvestment for low - income communities in the state .
( By contrast , Bank of America 's put in a trillion dollars . )
Still , California clients have rewarded Goldman Sachs with billions of dollars in business , amounting to seven percent of the firm 's 2008 revenues .
No wonder they call it the " Golden State . "
Whitman profited from a practice called " spinning , " which a professor specializing in financial fraud and corruption calls a " quasi- kickback . "
As the Sacramento Bee explains :
" ( Spinning ) involved offering a company 's executives and board members personal shares in IPOs as a reward for giving the investment firms corporate business .
Investment firms initially denied that was their motive , but later agreed to ban the practice .
The firms offered key executives shares at starter IPO prices not then available to ordinary retail investors .
The executives resold their shares within days , making millions . "
As CEO of eBay , Whitman hired Goldman Sachs to handle the company 's initial public stock offering .
She was also a private banking client of the firm's at the same time .
She directed eBay to use Goldman Sachs for a second stock offering , too - and to help it acquire PayPal .
Goldman Sachs got $ 8 million in fees from eBay while Whitman was CEO , while she made $ 1.78 million from those " spinning " deals .
Not that she needed the cash , being a billionaire and all .
But that 's how it works in Meg Whitman 's world :
Taking chances in the stock market is for the little people .
To Meg Whitman , a million here or a million there as a " thank you " for your patronage is nothing more than her due .
It 's noblesse oblige , the aristocratic privilege of the corporate class .
Whitman was forced to leave the board after paying $ 3 million to settle a lawsuit from eBay shareholders , but she and Goldman had a warm relationship while it lasted .
" Meg Whitman is one of the most dynamic and forward - looking leaders in business today , " said Goldman CEO Hank Paulson in 2001 .
( That would be future Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , of course ; these Goldman folks like government power . )
To be clear , Whitman was never convicted of a crime and never admitted to wrongdoing ( unless you think that writing a $ 3 million dollar check is an admission of wrongdoing . )
When we say her past is " shady , " we 're not implying criminality .
We 're using the Merriam - Webster definition - " of questionable merit : uncertain , unreliable b : disreputable . "
As for the " disreputable " part , she was singled out for censure in a Congressional report issued by Ohio Republican Representative Michael Oxley - a distinction which , she complained , was " painful . "
As the Bee reports , a business ethics expert responded thusly : " She 's the victim ?
I love the transmutation .
This was a not -very - subtle form of bribery that Wall Street 's big investment houses , like Goldman Sachs , were using to develop their business . "
She was a competent CEO , though she did n't create eBay and was never an entrepreneur .
Her most noteworthy accomplishment before joining the already - thriving company was that she'd been the worldwide product manager for " Mr. Potato Head . "
( 1) She ran the company well ... except for , you know ... the Goldman Sachs thing .
But private sector CEO experience does n't mean you 'll perform well in a government job .
( Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld were both former CEOs : I rest my case . )
And her spending 's become an embarrassment .
She 's shattered all records , shelling out seven times as much as her opponents ( $ 46 million so far - $ 27 million on the primary alone . )
Her policy proposals include making the State Legislature a part - time body ( looks like Republicans in the US Senate are beating her to it , though ; maybe that 's why they call them " bankers ' hours . " )
The next governor will inherit a state in deep financial crisis .
Betting 's still hot and heavy on who will default first : Greece or California .
As the SEIU reported ( pdf ) , many cities ( including some in California ) are facing a financial crisis because of bad derivatives deals they made with firms like Goldman Sachs .
Will all this , does the state really need to be led by someone with a Goldman Sachs mentality ?
__________
(1) Whitman managed the late - version Mr. Potato Head , the one with the plastic body .
I 'm old enough to have played as a child with the original Mr. Potato Head , discontinued in 1964 - the one where you inserted the toy eyes , ears , etc. into an actual potato .
That has not influenced this analysis of Ms. Whitman in any way .

Gough denied his nakedness was a breach of the peace A man known as the naked rambler has received his longest sentence yet for refusing to put his clothes on .
Stephen Gough , 50 , was jailed for 21 months after being found guilty of breaching the peace and being in contempt of court .
Gough turned down an offer of freedom if he got dressed - and was warned he could spend many more years in prison .
The former Royal Marine , from Eastleigh in Hampshire , has been behind bars for much of the past seven years .
He was jailed for a year for walking naked in Perth after being freed from prison , and for a further three months for contempt for conducting his trial in the nude .
It does n't need an expert in crystal ball gazing to anticipate that if I impose a custodial sentence then in so many months time a similar scenario will arise
Sheriff Lindsay Foulis Sheriff Lindsay Foulis also added the 180 days he had left to serve when he was released midway through his previous 12 - month sentence last December .
On the past two occasions when he has been freed from jail , officers from Tayside Police were waiting at the jail gates to rearrest him .
Sheriff Foulis told Gough the same process was likely to occur " again and again and again " .
" A number of your recent convictions have arisen in similar circumstances , " he said .
" You have more or less been apprehended when you have been released from prison .
" I suppose it does n't need an expert in crystal ball gazing to anticipate that if I impose a custodial sentence then in so many months time a similar scenario will arise . "
Gough told Perth Sheriff
Court he accepted it was " potentially " the case that he could remain in jail forever - apart from the few seconds of freedom he enjoys every six months or so .
He denied his nakedness was a breach of the peace or an affront to the court .

Engineers building Britain 's longest road tunnel have met in the middle after a year of excavation .
The 1.9 mile A3 tunnel under Hindhead in Surrey is expected to cost £ 371 m and be completed by 2011 .
We blundered over swine flu , admit health chiefs
Uncertainty : Keiji Fukuda speaks at the health experts ' meeting at the WHO HQ
Global health chiefs have finally admitted that they may have overreacted to the swine flu ' pandemic ' - landing governments with millions of unused vaccines .
The World Health Organisation has conceded that it may have been guilty of failing to communicate ' uncertainties ' about how virulent the new virus was .
Critics say the UN agency was too quick to designate the influenza a pandemic in June after it spread from Mexico .
Keiji Fukuda , its top influenza expert , yesterday admitted a six - phase system for declaring this was confusing and the bug was not actually as deadly as bird flu .
' The reality is there is a huge amount of uncertainty ( in a pandemic ) , ' he said .
' I think we did not convey the uncertainty .
That was interpreted by many as a non-transparent process . '
He admitted the scale may be flawed as it takes into account the geographic spread of a virus but not its severity .
' Confusion about phases and level of severity remains a very vexing issue , ' added Mr Fukuda .
He was addressing a meeting of experts reviewing the WHO 's handling of the first influenza pandemic in 40 years .
Last week it emerged Britain wasted up to £ 300 million on vaccines that will never be used .
H1N1 has killed 17,770 people in 213 countries , the WHO says .
The best doughnut ?
That 's Peter Pan doughnuts in Brooklyn .
It 's a Polish bakery .
We shot nearby once for 30 Rock .
Its white - cream - filled powdered doughnut .
And I really believe , when I first tried it , if I had a penis , I would put it in this doughnut .
I finally understand what you guys are thinking about and what motivates you guys .
My four - year - old daughter has a pretend hair - and - nail salon , and I was doing her hair and makeup .
I said , " Hello ma'am .
What 's your name ?
And what do you do ? "
And she said , " I get paid to dance at parties . "
And I said , " Oh , no .
That 's a terrible , terrible answer . "

She says she looks like Barack Obama .
I think she heard so many people at that time saying I looked like Sarah Palin , I think she was just trying to get in on that .
" I look like Barack Obama . "
Okay .
Sure .
It 's an honor to work with Mark Wahlberg 's nipples in Date Night [ which opens April 9 ] .
They 've been in a lot of amazing movies and music videos .
I 'm actually impressed the director , Shawn Levy , got him back to Shirtless Town .
Because obviously he 's done some serious movies since he was a Calvin Klein model .
He does n't have to give us the nipples .
I do n't know if it's that his nipples wanted to work with Steve Carell [ with ] , or maybe his nipples are fans of The Office .
But they showed up .
No , I could n't see the third nipple .
And I was paid to stare at them for a day .
James white
Date Night is n't just for married people .
It 's for all people , regardless of race or creed .
If you liked Avatar ?
Imagine Avatar but everything is 2 - D , and everybody 's not blue .
The difference between male comedy writers and female comedy writers is that the male ones are taller and weigh more .
They also fake - rape each other more .
Female comedy writers pretty much never fake - rape each other .
The women comedy writers do not urinate in cups around the office .
Sometimes guys like to have an excuse to take their penis out .
I 've said penis twice in this interview .
What 's happening ?
James White
There are a couple of things I want to impart to ladies who want to be in comedy :
One , you do n't have to be weird or be quirky to get your job done .
And two , comedy skill is not sexually transmittable .
You do not have to sleep with a comedian to learn what you 're doing .
Male comedians will not like that advice , but it is the truth .
Twitter seems like a busman 's holiday : just more writing .
I have no plans to do it .
I 'll just stick with my 24/7 webcam .
I 'm old - fashioned that way .
I got a fan letter on the back of a prison menu .
And I remember thinking , Well , they get pie .
It 's not so bad .
They get pie on the weekends .
I want to say blueberry and also a Boston cream pie .
Not so bad .
James White
My daughter wants to be Belle from Beauty and the Beast .
She 's a pretty violent Belle .
She 'll come in and say , " Gaston is hurt .
I 've killed him with a sword . "
There was an episode where Frank plays this high - pitched sound that only people under forty are supposed to hear .
There were internerds who were like , " I could hear the first sound , but I could n't hear the second . "
And I was like , " Buddies , there was no sound . "
It 's like that old SNL William Shatner sketch where he was at a Trekkie convention and was saying , " Have you ever kissed a girl ? "
The amount of thought — I love it , but I 'm also concerned for these people .
I wrote a play when I was in Chicago — it was before I learned that plays had to have stories in them — and I wrote one about Catherine the Great .
And she was lamenting the fact that she got bad press , and she said she did all these things , but then " you sleep with one horse and you 're a horsefucker for life . "
James White
I really love cursing a lot .
But as I get older , I realize it's a little unseemly for women of a certain age .
But then once you pass sixty - five , you can hit it full tilt again and it's charming .
Once you 're Lauren Bacall 's age , you can be like , " What the fuck . "
" Shark farts " was one that we ad - libbed that we ended up leaving in .
The studio asked us not to leave it in , but we left it in .
We have a new one we 're going to try out .
You never know if it 's going to stick .
It 's an expression of extreme shock : " Whuck ? "
I do like to use nerds in real life .
Just because I try to stop cursing around my daughter .
Plots we would not do on 30 Rock ?
Let me put the Internet at ease : Liz and Jack will never be together .
Not even if we go fifteen seasons .
Okay , if we get to season fifteen , they 'll do it .
James White
Do n't be too precious or attached to anything you write .
Let things be malleable .
For sketch writers , remember they 're called sketches for a reason .
They 're not called oil paintings .
Some of them are going to stink .
You have to let them stink .
Someone once said that to make a regular person laugh , you need to dress a guy up like an old lady and push him down the stairs .
To make a comedy writer laugh , you have to push a real old lady down the stairs .
I do n't know who that 's attributed to .
I think it 's Aristophanes .
Or Catherine the Great .
I spent a lot of time performing for people who did not want to see any kind of performance , let alone one from me .
I 'd get hired to do an industrial , and I 'd be doing sketch comedy at 8:14 A.M. in a hotel ballroom while people were eating breakfast , and the content of the sketch material was to let them know they were n't getting dental insurance anymore .
Which is what made the Sarah Palin situation so strange .
I was like , " I 've never been in a situation where someone wanted me to do something .
Somebody actually wants me to do this ? "

Tea Party : Beware of the Imposters !
email alert from Tea Party Patriots | 4/3/2010 | Mark Meckler
Posted on by GVnana
Just received the following email alert regarding the Tax Day Tea Party for Sacramento , CA . :
Many of us have been getting disturbing emails and phone calls regarding the counter protests or " crashers " we are expecting on the day of our event .
This did happen last year as well so plan for it .
It 's much better to be prepared than surprised .
Here are some suggestions for our event and " crashers " :
1 . We will introduce ourselves to the local police on that day as the permit holder .
We have already spoken with Officer Troy on many occasions and he knows us and is aware of these possibilities .
The best way to handle these people is to report them to the law enforcement who is there and ask that they be removed by the police since Tea Party Patriots hold the permit for the event .
Do n't attempt to deal with " crashers " yourself , they are looking to incite people and get it on video .
2 . We will have 200 from our group doing security ( Crowd Observation ) for the event .
We have many retired military or police persons who have volunteered for this duty .
Have the phone number for the police handy ( and your cell phone ) and call if you see anything happening .
We will have people scanning the crowd for trouble makers who will also let our attendees know of the possibility of infiltrators so they too will be on the look out and make sure they know not to deal with these people but to have them removed if they are being unruly .
3 . Have pre-made signs that say THESE PEOPLE ARE INFILTRATORS !
with a big arrow and when they cause a ruckus have people stand by them with the sign .
This will usually make them go away as it ruins their reason for being there .
4 . If any of you have video cameras , please bring them and take video of our event so we will have eyes all over the event .
If anyone tires to talk about our event in a negative way you will have a visual diary of the event .
Remember they are out to say we are all racists , and wing nuts !
They are also out to prove that we are violent .
Whatever you do - DO NOT give them anything that will confirm what they are trying to say about us .
Exercise self control and remember your higher calling .
We never want to lower ourselves to be on their level .
This will be OUR event and we will do it with dignity , since that is our nature .
Sincerely ,
Mark Meckler

Be careful ,
The left are ready to use weapons , bats , sticks , stones , incite violence so they can blame us .
They will have SEIU thugs .
This will not be your usual yelling grey haired hippy leftists .
Make sure you have video cam and a direct quick line to the police .
Defend yourself if physiclly attacked with a weapon .
Try to avoid it and sucker your attacker in long enough for the police to take them .

Be ready to video .
Offensive signs , spitting , shouting slurs , etc. will by infiltrators will be the next tactic used by the left to marginalize the moderate Tea Party movement .
Tea Party is middle of the road soccer moms small business owners Sunday school teachers and yet the left is intent on discrediting the movement through tactics like this .
To : TigerBait
One more thing .
Be sure to try to identify anyone who uses racial slurs .
Video tape them , follow them to their car to get their license number .
The leftists that infiltrate the Tea Parties must be exposed .

Agreed ,
The TP is winning the middle ground of America , and its driven the left around the bend to see us uncowed by Obama and his “ grandiose plans . ”
We are suposed to tremble when ” The One ” walks the earth ?
Eff them all .
We outclass and out think these little socialist prigs by a country mile .

Keep in mind also after the militia incident that popped up last week there will likely be FBI agents at these events posing as protestors .
They were there in the 60s at the Vietnam rallies doing the same thing .
Think the leftists in charge have forgotten that ?

Here is my personal example from the Michele Bachmann rally at the MN State Capitol a few weekends ago .
These drunks were there in the front row trying to stir things up and ended up being escorted away by State Troopers for their own good .
I had my camera with me that morning and took pictures and some video in case something happened .
Nothing came of it other than some unpleasant verbal exchanges but I posted their pictures and my account here : Prevoious FR post , Comment # 9
Take a camera with everyone and do n't be afraid to " get in their face " with it close - up pictures only , try not to actually hit them with it :)

Here 's what I 'm worried about :
The impostors will be vile , we do n't want to let them harm our image , so as a result :
In order to not be viewed as hate mongering racist freaks , we will not appear to be angry .
Well , we are angry .
Do n't let these Alinsyites game you into appearing nice .
Be pissed , stay pissed , and calmly dispose of the impostors as you see fit .
When one of them freaks out , act as your gut tells you .
You may want to call the cops .
You may want to videotape .
You may want to ask your neighbor to call the cops , tell the guy behind you to roll video , and grab the " impostor " by the balls and drag him to where the cops can deal with him more easily .
To : GVnana
which is exactly what these three scuzzy leftists wanted to get out of the crowd , anger and jeers back .
They a ) wanted a violent or angry reaction from the crowd ; and b ) they wanted someone to throw a fist and get it on tape .
I disarmed 3 to 4 extreme leftist , scraggly , unbathed hecklers in a crowd of about 2,000 conservatives and independents once , who were leaving a conservative event and confronted by these libnut morons .
Nearly 95 % of the crowd were tactically reacting like typical Americans when directly insulted , i.e. responding in kind and getting mad , and jeering back and butting into them head on , taking their bait and not more cleverly using the commie 's negative power against them , They a ) wanted a violent or angry reaction from the crowd ; and b ) they wanted someone to throw a fist and get it on tape .
I got up right next to the faces , without look at them , and pointed at them and started LAUGHING , RIDICULING , SMILING , in a loud voice drowning THEM out , saying things like " what a joke ! "
" That 's funny , you gotta be kidding " , " Oh realllly ??? har har har !
Tell us another one ! " , deep loud belly laughs , and continuing to make fun of them .
Made fun of every single thing that came out of their mouth .
The departing crowd at first look confused as they could not figure it out .
Staring at the scumbags , then at me , and back at the scumbags , and then back at me , confused looking .
When this protest started , they initially had been met with angry , red conservative faces , almost all of them to a person , a few , mostly the women , looking down and just shaking their heads .
But after about two minutes of this ridicule and not directly attacking ( directly trying to counter or threaten ) , these leftists ' chants got weaker and weaker and less assured , they looked TOTALLY puzzled at me , their faces became somewhat noticebly upset ( and they had been smiling ear to ear when they earlier had been getting precisely the response they wanted from the crowd which was middle fingers , thumbs down , jeering , and some possibly jockeying to assault them ) , and they eventually furled up their offensive signs and left with heads down and nervous , forced grins , when the rest of the crowd started LAUGHING at them , too .
They were laughed right out into the parking lot .
This was about 15 years ago .
There are tactics that work to disarm these types .
I like the " infiltrator " sign as well , with the arrow .
Brilliant .

Re : grabbing someone by the balls , if you lay a finger on any of those protestors no matter how vile their mere words get , you yourself may also be liable for an assault charge and be subject to arrest .

People who do n't want freedom for everyone in the world are laughable .
Why would they forget history and allow themselves to become slaves because someone calls government bondage pretty names like justice ?
I like the idea of turning your back on them ... turning your back on government slavery .
Peaceful protest is your right .
Do not let these lies deter you ... trust me , the lies will just keep coming .
But the more people who come to the protest ... the more who will learn that all these lies are manufactured by a corrupt few .

Fact is , there is anecdotal evidence of a movement afoot to tarnish the whole Tea Party and Dont Tread on Me grassroots Patriot movement -- because it has now simply grown too large and too intense for the enemy , backed up with electoral victories and positive polls , and this discredit effort -- probably eventually very visible in nature -- is being designed and scripted no doubt as we speak by some of the most brilliant minds in Leftism heralding from the politico - intelligentsia world : Madison Avenue wonks , street fighters and organizers , professional ambulance chasers and elite PR whores .
Whomever .
These people are tough and clever and scheming .
But not as clever as us , nor do they have Christ the Lord .
Fortunately , we can outwit them .
Part of that is by being ready when they throw at us what they will invariably scheme to throw at us -- while CNN , MSNBC , CBS , NBC , ABC , NPR , NYT , WAPO , AP , Christian Science Monitor , LAT , NPR , etc. all wait with baited breath .
They probably have the news story template dummied up already ; they just need to fill in the names of the interlocutors and location of the situation that " came down " to show how " ugly " this " mean spirited " public dissent against " government " had become and that the time has come to shut it down .
Knowing doctrinare , tactical Marxist - Leninists schooled in Alinksky and worse , BELIEVE ME they would go so far as to send one of their useful , expendible , low level patsy idiots , into a crowd to get seriously injured , .... or even worse , such as on the way back to his car by an irate , armed tea party type not officially connected with the movement .
BINGO !
You have a NATIONAL INCIDENT , the mainstream media Reichstag Fires the thing to death , Obama appears on National TV to decry this violence from " The Right " ( when it was a set up all along and they just sacrificed one of their expendable Marxists ) , and then you will hear the jackboots and talk of Fairness Doctrine and prohibition of public gatherings for the sake of " Safety " and " National Dialogue " .
The more they engineer this into a Black vs .
White kind of thing , that will only just be the icing on the cake .
They know there is plenty of latent White Guilt going around in this country to shut down debate and get people to Self - Censor , the best form of Censorship .
To me this is what they are engineering .
Why take the bait ?
Be alert .
Be prepared .
Do n't get blindsided .
They already tried this with the so - contrived and phony Congressmen In Locked Armed March Across Independence Avenue in D.C. to go to the Obamacare vote in the House , even though they would have normally used the Capitol Hill underground walkway to go over and cast their votes .
They were clearly hoping for a confrontation , and then to Reichstag Fire it to death with 24/7 Media Complicity .
IMHO , they have not abandoned this strategy and it may be even worse , folks .
That is why you get these intelligence reports of them try to show up and provocate at Tea Party functions such as in Sacramento and probably also in D.C. on 15 April .

Last year some anarchist idiot started shouting obscenities and pulled off all his clothes before the cops carried him away .
Two nitwits with a video camera looking for " racists " were carrying a racist sign ( provocative , eh ? ) .
They were singled - out by the MC and I think the cops escorted them off also .
( BTW these same guys posted a video to YouTube about the racist Tea Party in Sacramento , showing only white people .
Somehow they neglected the very large contingent of Latino farm workers who attended the party in protest over the federal water shutoff in the Central Valley . )
SEIU had given advance word of a counter - demonstration so people were a little tense at first .
But they only managed to muster about 5 guys in purple shirts and they stayed a good 100 yeards away from us .
Seems the capital is a good location for large demonstrations .
It 's teeming with cops and cameras .

I have never heard of any difficulties at a Tea Party Express rally .
I would n’t let any of this stop you , and yes I would definitely bring the children .
It will be one of the proudest days of their lives .

If you think they are the enemy take pictures of them over and over .
They will expose themselves during the picture taking .
They will be easy to spot .
Their signs will be stupid or they will be printed by a printer .

As Tea Party activists and demonstrators , becoming more organized , visible , and “ troublesome ” to the current administration and Congress , we are naturally going to be vulnerable to a coordinated smear campaign orchestrated by supporters of Obama and the Democrats , and facilitated by the media .
We need to think strategically , and then implement a set of tactics based on that .
On the strategic side , here are a few thoughts :
1 ) The mainstream media will run with anything negative , regardless of the actual evidence or responsibility .
They should be called out publicly and visibly for their errors .
We should use every available channel of alternate media to empahsize our non-violent intentions and racial - neutral positions .
2 ) We should take measures to identify individuals locally who are antagonistic to our cause , so that their presence at events is known .
A database , accesible to organizers , could be maintained legally for this purpose .
3 ) It ’s been said before , but keeping sufficient video and pictoral records of the events and actions to deflect criticism and charges of racial bias and violence , and is imperative to support 1 and 2 above .
4 ) The movement should not fear public gatherings , demonstrations and protests , but should become more mobile and fast reacting .
This should allow trusted members in a network to gather quickly in sufficient numbers , with little time for opposition to react .
5 ) It goes without saying , but leaders and organizers should insure that events are always to be arranged with peaceful , non-violent intentions ; that any type of weapon is discouraged ; that members should never take any violent action if contronted by opposition , and should in fact avoid even verbal confrontation with anyone except those who are the target of the protest , such as an elected official .
To this end , events should always have a small group of people whose purpose is to diffuse any confrontations that get out - of - line .

Iran ’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has written to UN chief Ban Ki-moon , asking him to launch an investigation into the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States , news reports said on Monday .
“ The minimum expectation from your excellency is to set up an independent and trusted fact - finding group to comprehensively investigate the real factors behind September 11 , ” Ahmadinejad said in the text of the letter carried by official news agencies .
They did not say when the letter was sent .
The hardliner , who in March dismissed 9/11 as a “ big lie , ” said in the letter that the attacks “ were the main pretext for attacks ” by NATO on Afghanistan and Iraq .
Several times Ahmadinejad has questioned the accepted version of the Al - Qaeda strikes on New York and Washington which killed nearly 3,000 people .

An enormous stick insect more than half a metre long and a bizarre lungless frog are among a staggering collection of new species highlighted today to celebrate an agreement to conserve wildlife on the island of Borneo .
Conservationists say the weird and wonderful creatures were discovered thanks to a pioneering deal between three governments to protect and conserve 220,000 square kilometres of lush rainforest on the island .
Some 123 new species have been recorded in the protected region , known as the " Heart of Borneo " , since the 2007 agreement .
They include a vivid flame - coloured bronzeback snake that can flare the back of its neck to reveal bright orange colours when threatened , a new bird named the spectacled flowerpecker , and a green and yellow slug with a tail three times the length of its head .
Adam Tomasek , leader of conservation group WWF's Heart of Borneo initiative , said : " As the past three years of independent scientific discovery have proven , new forms of life are constantly being discovered in the Heart of Borneo .
If this stretch of irreplaceable rainforest can be conserved for our children , the promise of more discoveries must be a tantalising one for the next generation of researchers to contemplate . "
Explorers have visited Borneo for centuries , he said , yet vast tracts of its interior are yet to be biologically explored .
The new species identified on Borneo are highlighted today by a WWF report on the conservation project , which began in 2007 with an agreement between Brunei Darussalam , Indonesia and Malaysia .
The reserve is an " island within an island " the report says , home to 10 species of primate , more than 350 birds , 150 reptiles and amphibians and 10,000 plants that are found nowhere else in the world .
The discovery of three new species a month since the agreement offers " ample justification " of the decision to protect the region , it adds .
New species include a giant stick insect , known as Chan 's megastick , that measures 57 cm long .
Discovered in 2008 , only three specimens have been found .
It is believed to inhabit the high rainforest canopy , which makes it elusive and difficult to study .
Borneo has long been known for its monster insects , including giant cockroaches some 10 cm long .
A long - tailed slug , dubbed " ninja slug " , was discovered on leaves in high - altitude forests , where the creature likes to wrap its long tail around its body while it rests .
The slug is part of an unusual invertebrate family that uses chalky " love darts " in courtship .
The tiny harpoons pierce and inject hormone into mates , and may increase the chances of reproduction .
Under the 2007 plan , the three governments have committed to enhance management of the protected area , develop eco-tourism and support sustainable resource management .
" Three years on , the Heart of Borneo declaration is proving to be an irreplaceable foundation for conservation and sustainable development by establishing a framework for action to protect Borneo 's globally outstanding biodiversity , ecosystem services and livelihoods , " Tomasek said .
" The discovery of these new species in the Heart of Borneo underlines the incredible diversity of this remarkable area . "
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - A senior Russian diplomat warned the West on Wednesday against trying to paralyze Iran by targeting the Islamic Republic ’s energy and banking sectors with crippling sanctions .
Russia has in recent weeks signaled growing frustration with Iran over its nuclear program , though Moscow has given few indications about what sanctions it might be prepared to sign up to in the United Nations Security Council .
The United States has said it hopes to see sanctions against Iran in a matter of weeks and Israel has pressed Russia to back crippling sanctions , though the Kremlin has steered clear of openly supporting calls for further U.N. sanctions .
Oleg Rozhkov , the deputy director of the Russian Foreign Ministry ’s security affairs and disarmament department , said Moscow would only consider sanctions aimed at strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime .
“ Call them what you want -- crippling or paralyzing -- we are not got going to work on sanctions or measures which could lead to the political or economic or financial isolation of this country , ” Rozhkov told reporters in Moscow .
When asked by a reporter what sanctions Russia might be able to support , he said : “ Those that are directed at resolving non-proliferation questions linked to Iran ’s nuclear program . ”
“ What relation to non-proliferation is there in forbidding banking activities with Iran ?
This is a financial blockade .
And oil and gas .
These sanctions are aimed only at paralyzing the country and paralyzing the regime , ” he said .
Iran holds 16 percent of the world ’s proven gas reserves and 11 percent of the world ’s oil reserves , but desperately needs investment to develop them .
The United States , major European Union nations and Israel suspect Tehran is using its civilian nuclear program as cover for the development of a nuclear weapon .
SANCTIONS ?
Tehran denies it is seeking to make an atomic weapon .
But the U.N. nuclear watchdog added to the pressure on Iran last week , saying it feared Iran was actively pursuing nuclear weapons capability .
Russian officials this month for the first time raised serious doubts about the true nature of Iran ’s nuclear activities , though diplomats say the call on sanctions lies with Russia ’s paramount leader , Vladimir Putin .
Putin , who serves as prime minister after stepping down as Kremlin chief , rarely comments on Iran , although he last year warned the West against pushing Tehran into a corner .
“ We do not consider the sanctions path the right one -- it pushes the situation further and further into a dead end , a dead end which can only be resolved by force and we do not support that at all , ” Rozhkov said of Iran sanctions .
Russia has trade ties worth $ 3 billion annually with Iran and weapons contracts that Israel has urged Moscow to renege on , including a deal to sell Tehran S - 300 air defense systems .
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday Russia would not deliver the truck - mounted S - 300 missile systems -- which could protect Iran ’s nuclear facilities against air strikes -- if such a sale would destabilize any region .
Two horrifying terrorist metro bombings in Moscow , but still there is a need for a new approach to the north Caucasus
BY EARLY evening on March 29th Moscow 's metro was functioning normally .
It was emptier than usual and some people crossed themselves as they boarded .
Blood stains , pieces of shattered glass and flowers marked the sites where 12 hours earlier two bombs had killed at least 39 people .
The first explosion struck just before 8 am at Lubyanka station , near the headquarters of Russia 's security service , the FSB .
Within 40 minutes a second bomb went off at Park Kultury .
Both bombs , say the authorities , were detonated by young female suicide bombers .
They put the blame on the north Caucasus , a mostly Muslim region .
Some Russian reports say the Moscow police may have had a warning .
Yet terrorists can slip through any net , especially given the woeful state of the Russian police .
The security services soon identified the two suicide bombers and their minders on security cameras as they boarded their trains .
The response of the emergency services was fast and efficient , evacuating people , providing access to ambulances and setting up a special headquarters .
Indeed , in large measure the city coped well with the attacks .
That may be because Moscow 's metro has had several terrorist attacks in the past two decades .
The deadliest was in 2004 , when 41 people died .
That black year saw two bombs on the Moscow metro , two lost aircraft and , worst of all , the siege of a packed school in Beslan , North Ossetia .
Since then Moscow has had no terrorist attacks and has lived in relative comfort , insulated from the simmering violence of the north Caucasus .
The war in Chechnya was over and the republic appeared relatively calm under its strongman president , Ramzan Kadyrov .
This former rebel had secured elements of autonomy , and massive subsidies , for Chechnya from Moscow .
However , in recent years , violence has spread from Chechnya throughout the region .
( Alexander Bortnikov , head of the Russian security service , was careful to identify the sources of the Moscow bombing as the north Caucasus , not Chechnya . )
Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , has described the situation in the north Caucasus as Russia 's biggest domestic political problem .
Two days after the Moscow attacks , a pair of bombs exploded in Dagestan , which neighbours Chechnya , killing many and injuring scores .
Arbitrary killings , disappearances , torture , inter -clan warfare and corruption have become normal in the region .
As Russia 's own officials have admitted , some of the money and weapons come from corrupt bureaucrats who pay off terrorists .
The corruption and brutality of those who identify themselves as representatives of the state have also helped the terrorists to recruit radicalised youths .
Last month Doku Umarov , a terrorist leader and the self - proclaimed emir of the north Caucasus , warned that war was coming to Russia 's cities .
Several high - ranking leaders of militant organisations led by him have been killed in counter - terrorist operations in recent weeks .
Some observers see the Moscow bombings as an act of revenge .
Others say they would have been in preparation for months .
Few Russians outside the north Caucasus pay attention to the violence in the region .
Although it is part of the Russian Federation , few Muslims from the region feel comfortable and welcome outside their home .
Yet as the Moscow metro bombings show , the north Caucasus is part of Russia — and changing the situation there requires reforms in the whole country .
Even after the Moscow attacks , there is little public discussion about the roots of the violence in the north Caucasus .
Instead , politicians and commentators have talked up the explosions to their own political advantage .
Apologists for the Kremlin blame the civilian deaths on liberals who destabilise the country with their criticism of the authorities .
The government has used previous terrorist attacks to justify scrapping independent television broadcasts and cancelling regional elections .
This makes the apologists ' pseudo - patriotic slogans of unity with the Kremlin all the more alarming .
Yet the Kremlin 's opponents , just as worryingly , all but accuse it of orchestrating the attacks as an excuse to grab more power .
Few Russian public figures rose above immediate political concerns .
An exception was Lyudmila Alexeyeva , a veteran human - rights defender , who was one of only a few to agonise over whether to join an anti-government protest on March 31st .
In the end , as she wrote in her blog , she decided to pay her respects to the dead instead .
Depressingly few politicians or other public figures in Russia even recognised her dilemma .

Espresso sure is a complicated elixir for being so small .
Like Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity , a high - quality shot can be multilayered and complex : rich , sexy , sweet , but also fast and smooth — maybe even a little dangerous — with a hint of a bitter edge .
But have you ever wondered what gives your early morning cup that certain oomph ?
That coating , silky texture ?
That playful tang and sweet kick ?
It 's all about the extraction .
" Extraction " is what the water does when it fraternizes with its old pal ground coffee .
When the two meet , the water pulls all kind of dissolvable stuff out of the coffee , like an old college buddy tapping you for $ 20 every time you see him .
Some of what the water grabs on to is good .
And some , well , not so much — which is part of what makes the truly great jolts so elusive .
An espresso extraction — which ideally lasts between 20 and 30 seconds for a double shot — can be broken down into several parts , making it possible for us to unravel some of tiny brew 's many mysteries .
The first few seconds of the water and coffee 's commingling is where the espresso's body comes from — the thick , honey - like drips that languidly drop into the cup below .
If you were to down this early part of the extraction on its own , it'd be almost chewy , coating your teeth and tongue .
The reason for this buttery mouth bomb is that when the water comes in contact with the finely ground coffee particles , it immediately begins to dissolve and absorb things from them , like delicious flavor oils — transporting the gooey , concentrated result from bean to mug .
Once the pressurized water from the espresso machine has started making inroads through the finely ground coffee , the flow of the liquid espresso turns from fat , lazy drips to a steadier stream , as more of the grounds ' goodies have been picked up by the water that came before .
After about 15 seconds , the shot begins to show a little color , the chestnut hue becoming a mix of brown and sultry blond .
This part of the process contributes some of the coffee 's more nuanced qualities — depending on the espresso blend 's components , now's when nuttiness , fruit - like acidity and toasty flavors can start to shine .
Sweetness and balance are the keys to the extraction 's final throes , though the barista must take care to stop the shot at the right moment — once the coffee trickling out of the espresso machine is fully blond and begins to look thin or watery , all the good stuff has been extracted from the ground beans .
What comes after ?
If the barista left the water running , he or she would be coaxing out more undesirable bitter flavors , while diluting the already - brewed espresso with a watery ickiness that may overpower any sweet or delicate characteristics .
Geeky dissection aside , though , all coffee lovers can agree on the single best part of the perfect coffee extraction :
The happy and caffeinated mouth at the receiving end .

GOP Sen .
Kyl : Unemployment Benefits Make People Not Want To Get A Job
You can always count on the HuffPo for a sensational headline , whether the actual story backs it up or not .
But in this case they have quotes : “ In fact , if anything , continuing to pay people unemployment compensation is a disincentive for them to seek new work , ” said Sen .
Kyl after stumbling across the obvious by noting that unemployment insurance does n’t create new jobs .
Genius .
No wonder this guy makes at least $ 174,000 / year with pension and benefits .
It ’s not as if Sen. Kyl ’s honorable [ sic ] colleagues on the other side of the aisle are actually interested in earning their $ 174,000 / year working for the benefit of the public either .
And the worst part is that all across America people are reading that headline and shaking their head in the affirmative .
The lazy and degenerate moochers sucking the hard workers dry .
Look out , bitches , you do n’t know what the bottom looks like because you believe that if you do n’t open you ’re eyes it is n’t there .
But you ’ll find out …
Go find the actual unemployment and underemployment numbers .
I ’m not gonna do it for you ; you ’re too coddled from being fed information by National Propaganda Radio and Fixed News .
You know damned well that there ’s no truth in the news and no news in the truth , but you want to believe .
You need to believe .
What would there be without hope , right ?
Let me know when hope starts putting food on the tables of the millions who are n’t working or who are barely working .
Yeah , there are a few people happy to mooch of the labor of others … besides for the bankers , politicians and traders .
There are a few raging alcoholics , serial killers , junkies , cokeheads , pedophiles , and all the rest .
But when a Sen . who spends most of his time fundraising for the next cycle while collecting his $ 174,000 / year and favors from the industries he represents starts bitching about the no -good lazy workers trying to get a free ride … and heads all across this once - great nation start nodding … during a time of massive real unemployment , well then you know that we are well and truly fucked .
Because the majority of those people on unemployment benefits want to work .
They want to support their families .
They do n’t want to see their kids get sick and not be able to afford care without turning to “ government handouts . ”
Let ’s pause here , since health care is a topic of conversation .
If we really were the richest nation on Earth , then we ’d probably all have the best health care in the world at an affordable rate .
Maybe Sen .
Kyl could look the fuck into that , eh ?
How many people lost their jobs , have two kids and a mortgage ?
How many of them would go completely under without those benefits ?
Should they go on welfare ?
Eat the damned kids ?
Exactly what , dear leadership , should these people do ?
Maybe nobody in Washington understands that this shining consumer / service economy that they ’ve been touting the benefits of ( for the benefit of all the neo-liberal Randians , see above : bankers , politicians and traders ) requires everybody to have plenty of disposable income .
The civil engineer gets laid off in a country with crumbling infrastructure .
He does the logical thing and tightens his belt .
Fewer discretionary purchases lead to less revenue for the corporations that employ people .
And since less revenue hurts the all important bottom line , it must be made up somewhere .
So someone else gets laid off .
This is your way of life trickling down the motherfucking drain .
Sen .
Kyl probably thinks that tax cuts will spur employment growth , and i’ll bet that he’d be willing to trot out the old “ entrepreneurs and small business people on Main Street are America ’s economic engine ” shtick .
Sen .
Kyl is a liar .
He must know that only Luxembourg ranks below us amongst developed nations in terms of percent of the population that is self - employed .
He knows it because like his esteemed colleagues on both sides of the aisle he has been doing everything in his power for decades to stifle the American people .
Like the rest of the sociopath - enamored Randians who purport to love and lead this nation , he ’s one of the guys dismembering the American Dream .
The murder mystery may never be solved , but the flesh eaters and necrophiliacs are all too brazenly obvious in their tastes .
Sound waves are used in many imaging applications , but they 're often underpowered and hard to focus .
But focus them into " sound bullets " and all sorts of interesting things happen .
A paper published in PNAS this week describes how scientists might transition from creating sound - based images with linear acoustic dynamics to using nonlinear approaches .
Researchers created a system with an acoustic lens that can focus highly tunable and accurate signals into " sound bullets . "
Once researchers have slightly better control over them , the bullets could be used for everything from detecting objects underwater to acting as nonintrusive scalpels in certain kinds of surgery .
We use sound waves a lot to get an idea of what things look like without actually being able to see them , such as an unborn baby ( ultrasound ) or the underwater ruins that the History Channel leads you to believe might be Atlantis before they end an hour - long program on an ambiguous note ( sonar ) .
However , the images that these hard - to - focus signals produce are notoriously murky , and often show little more than nebulous blobs pulsating against a black background .
The quality ceiling for these images is a result of the actuators used in the imaging devices , as they cannot create compact or high - amplitude signals .
Their performance can be improved somewhat by taking advantage of the geometry of transducers that can focus the signal a bit , or by using time - reversal focusing or phase lags to construct a more coherent signal .
Still , all these procedures rely on linear dynamics , meaning there are strict limits on how the signals can change over time and interact with each other .
Let 's get nonlinear
In nonlinear dynamics , these rules do n't apply , and signals can fly around in a bunch of new ways .
While this creates more possibilities for improving wave performance , it also means that scientists have to limit the signals at more steps , and create an environment where the increased activity can be harnessed rather than allowed to dissipate or destructively interfere .
To create an acoustic lens to control a nonlinear signal , researchers needed materials that can support power law behavior , as opposed to constant linear behavior .
They found that using chains of spherical particles in the lens supported even highly nonlinear signals as they moved through , and that these could scale down to linear motion .
Scientists assembled chains of spheres into an array and precompressed them so that an acoustic signal traveling through them with a fixed phase incident would experience specific amounts of phase delay at certain points .
This way , the waves traveling through each chain could be directed to convene at a particular point and form a powerful signal .
Each chain of particles in the lens was able to feed a single - crested wave , with all the waves overlapping each other .
At the point where all the waves intersect , they formed a " sound bullet , " a small traveling region that retains a high energy density as it moves through its medium .
Once the sound bullet is formed , it can only be maintained in a linear nondispersive medium .
This includes both solid and fluid substances , including human bodies , gases , and oceans .
The lens ' creators also found that it was possible to vary the focal length and phase velocity of the signals by varying the precompression states of the particles .
Of course , while a handful of acoustic signals arcing together to produce a sound bullet is theoretically great , that 's not always the reality — sometimes the arcs are misshapen and do n't all intersect where researchers want .
This causes the " bullet " to list to one side or another , curving off - axis ; however , scientists found that the bullet was just as powerful even when its path was crooked .
With this approach , scientists should be able to use the new acoustic lens with existing transducers , cutting down somewhat on adoption costs .
Once the system provides a bit more control , possible uses include detection in defense systems , noninvasive scalpels in surgery , and many other applications in biomedical devices .

The truffle of the apiary world – rare white honey from Ethiopia 's highest peaks – is in danger of disappearing , according to beekeepers in the Tigray region .
" No rain for the flowers , '' said Ashenaf Abera as he stood on his rocky , parched slope in the northern Ethiopian region whose famine inspired Bob Geldof to stage Live Aid in 1985 .
" The bees need high - altitude flowers for the white honey .
When they cannot find them , they go to other plants and produce yellow honey . ''
Abera is paid £ 65 a month to mind 270 hives for the Asira Metira monastery , one of a dozen religious centres in an area whose 4th - century rock churches are among the wonders of the world .
" We know about bees , '' said honey seller Sheikh Mohamed Ahamedin .
He grips a large screwdriver with both hands to ladle a dollop of thick and lumpy white honey out of a plastic bucket .
It is snow - white and tastes sweet and more waxy than yellow honey .
" The price is the highest it has ever been this year , because of scarcity , '' said Ahamedin who sells white honey for £ 7.75 per kilo .
Last year he charged £ 4.50 .
Ethiopia is Africa 's biggest honey producer and the world 's fourth biggest beeswax exporter .
After coffee , gold and cowhide , bee products are major contributors to the economy , especially through exports to Italy , where white honey is considered a delicacy .
Bees ' products are the only export item produced by Tigray 's impoverished 4.6 million people , whose region is said to be one of the worst - hit in the world by climate change .
Such is Ethiopians ' love of honey that apitherapy clinics offer treatments for many ailments .
The national drink is tej – honey mead .
Beekeepers are increasingly scrapping traditional mud hives for square box - like hives from Europe which produce a higher yield .
" The bees will not make white honey in the modern hives , but at least with them we can obtain a decent yield of yellow honey , '' he said .
The region 's bee population is also in decline , with climate change and deforestation to blame .
Tigray was a wealthy , lush region 150 years ago when its king , Johannes IV , brought a carpenter from Italy to fashion his imposing throne from local juniper wood .
But wars with Italy , Egypt , Sudan and neighbouring Eritrea led to deforestation .
'" Without the trees , the rainwater – which seems to be declining – does not run off the limestone in a useful way .
That is why we end up with a landscape of rocks and little else , '' said local water expert Leul Fisseha .

Ahmadinejad Also Denies the Existence of Ringo Starr , and Other Stuff
Like chocolate creme pie and astroturf .

ONTROVERSIAL
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad admitted in his recent interview with CBS News anchor Katie Couric that there is much more besides the Holocaust he is quite sure never occurred .
" It is not the Paul Beatle dying that is of importance .
It is the Ringo Starr that never replaced the drummer Pete Best which is the real issue which we must all reconcile or become the laughing stock of the entire world , " insisted Ahmadinejad through his interpreter .
" But , Mr. President , " insisted Katie Couric , " surely you have seen the photographs and the film footage of Ringo Starr ?
On the Ed Sullivan show , for example . "
" That was but the machinations of the of the Beatle number five , Mr. George Martin , and his infernal replacement of Pete Best for these Sullivan shows with a large - nosed substitute who did not display the talents of the real drummer of The Beatles , Mr. Pete Best , " asserted Mr. Ahmadinejad smiling or grimacing , no one is ever sure .
" But you could meet and talk with Ringo Starr right now , if you chose to , Mr. President , " said Ms. Couric , pressing .
" He 's alive and well , and I 'm sure he would be happy to meet with you . "
" It would not be necessary for me to meet with the large - nosed man who is pretending to be the older Ringo Starr , for he is merely an impostor of impostors , " asserted the Iranian president .
" You know , Mr. President , you yourself have a rather large nose , not unlike that of Ringo Starr , drummer for The Beatles , " ventured the feisty Ms. Couric .
" What nose ? "
" The nose on your face , Mr. President . "
" There is no nose on my face .
You are a petite liar , female western journalist , and you do not cover your head , " said Mr. Ahmadinejad , shifting in his seat and no longer smiling or grimacing .
" OK , Mr. President , I can see we 're not getting anywhere with this .
Then what about your denying the existence of chocolate cream pie and astroturf ? "
Ms. Couric lifted a dessert plate containing a slice of chocolate cream pie , while an assistant placed a small square of astroturf in the CBS anchor 's free hand .
" If you would , Mr. President , I would like you to try a piece of this delicious pie and tell me that 's not the best chocolate creme you 've ever tasted . "
" I have had better , " said Iran 's president , taking a second bite .
" But this is not chocolate creme , which does not exist .
This is french silk .
You must tell your female assistant to brew some highly robust coffee now . "
" The hell it is n't chocolate creme ! " Ms. Couric exclaimed .
" Do not blaspheme before the leader of the Iranian people , little woman journalist with the impossibly spiky heels , " said Mr. Ahmadinejad .
" Very well , Mr. President , " continued Ms. Couric .
" Then what is this I have in my hand , if not astroturf ? "
" It is clearly a comical portion of what you Westerners call , I believe , ' the lawn ' ?
Some such trivial invention that which we find rather useless , in fact , " replied the Iranian leader .
" No , this is not real grass , Mr. President , " said Ms. Couric .
" So , you deny its existence as well , do you ? " asked Mr. Ahmadinejad smiling or grimacing again .
" Now we are making progress . "
The full interview between President Ahmadinejad and Katie Couric has been purchased by the Lifetime " for women " channel , and will be rerun next week immediately following " My Boyfriend Wants to Kill You , Too . "

The former head of the UN�s chief nuclear agency , Mohammed ElBaradei , said in an interview with the British newspaper Guardian Wednesday that those who launched the war in Iraq were responsible for killing a million innocent people and could be held accountable under international law .
He was clearly referring to US President George Bush , British Prime Minister Tony Blair , and their top military and security aides .
It was his first interview with an international publication since ElBaradei returned to his native Egypt , after a decade heading the International Atomic Energy Agency , where he won the Nobel Peace Prize , in large measure because of his opposition to the efforts by the Bush administration to use concocted charges about " weapons of mass destruction " as an all - purpose pretext for military intervention throughout the Middle East .
" I would hope that the lessons of Iraq , both in London and in the US have started to sink in , " he told the Guardian .
" Sure , there are dictators , but are you ready every time you want to get rid of a dictator to sacrifice a million innocent civilians ?
All the indications coming out of [ the Chilcot inquiry in Britain ] are that Iraq was not really about weapons of mass destruction but rather about regime change , and I keep asking the same question ―where do you find this regime change in international law ?
And if it is a violation of international law , who is accountable for that ? "
This suggestion that Bush and Blair were guilty of war crimes , coming from a high - ranking former UN official , would ordinarily be considered major news .
The Guardian interview was reported by the main British and French news agencies , Reuters and AFP , but the entire American corporate media gave it zero coverage .
Not a single major American newspaper or television network mentioned it .
The discussion of the violation of international law in launching the Iraq war came in the course of a longer discussion of the bankruptcy of US - British foreign policy in the Muslim world .
ElBaradei criticized the longstanding support of Washington for dictators like Mubarak .
" The idea that the only alternative to authoritarian regimes is Bin Laden and Co. is a fake one , yet continuation of current policies will make that prophecy come true . "
He warned of " increasing radicalization " in the Arab world : " People feel repressed by their own governments , they feel unfairly treated by the outside world , they wake up in the morning and who do they see ―they see people being shot and killed , all Muslims from Afghanistan , Iraq , Somalia , Sudan , Darfur . "
" Western policy towards this part of the world has been a total failure , in my view , " he said .
" It has not been based on dialogue , understanding , supporting civil society and empowering people , but rather it�s been based on supporting authoritarian systems as long as the oil keeps pumping . "
ElBaradei warned of the hypocrisy and double standard of Western policy .
" The West talks a lot about elections in Iran , for example , but at least there were elections , " he said .
" Yet where are the elections in the Arab world ?
If the West doesn�t talk about that , then how can it have any credibility ? "
ElBaradei is now reportedly considering a presidential bid against 81 - year - old President Hosni Mubarak , whose fifth six - year term expires next year .
He clearly hopes that Western pressure will compel Mubarak to permit a more robust opposition campaign than during the last presidential election , when the largest opposition party , the Muslim Brotherhood , was barred from standing a candidate , and Ayman Nour , the bourgeois liberal candidate who finished second , was jailed for alleged petition fraud .
Speaking to a British newspaper , ElBaradei was in essence warning his old patrons , the major European powers , of the counterproductive character of Western policy , particularly that of the United States .
" When you see that the most popular people in the Middle East are Ahmadinejad and Hassan Nasrallah [ leader of Hezbollah ] , that should send you a message : that your policy is not reaching out to the people , " he said .
He also took note of the extreme social tension in Egypt , where the vast majority of the population lives in crushing poverty .
The Guardian account reads : " In Egypt the rich live in ghettoes , " he said , waving his hand at the beautifully manicured garden , complete with pool .
" The gap in social justice here is simply indescribable . "
It appears that Massey Energy ( MEE ) , the company who owns the Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia , has a troubled past that includes multiple safety violations .
The Upper Big Branch mine is the scene where 25 miners died after an explosion earlier this week .
It 's quite a tragedy and has obviously not bared well for Massey 's stock , which is down 10 % this week .
According to Footnoted.org , Massey 's SEC filings paint a picture of how the company seems to be aware of the dangers associated with mining .
For instance , an 8 - K filed on March 24th , just a few weeks ago , takes an anti-regulatory stance saying increased mining regulation could hamper the company 's ability to perform :
“ Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations . …
All requirements imposed by such authorities may be costly and time - consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations .
…
Permits we need may involve requirements that may be changed or interpreted in a manner that restricts our ability to conduct our mining operations or to do so profitably .
Future legislation and administrative regulations may increasingly emphasize the protection of the environment , health and safety and , as a consequence , our activities may be more closely regulated . “
Then there 's the graph above from ThinkProgress which shows that during 2009 , the Upper Big Branch mine was an amalgamation of violations and fines .
Here are some quick facts regarding that matter :
The mine has been cited for over 3,000 violations by the Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) , 638 since 2009 .
Since 1995 , Massey ’s Upper Big Branch - South Mine has been cited for 3,007 safety violations .
Massey is contesting 353 violations , and 127 are delinquent .
Massey is contesting over a third ( 34.7 % ) of the 516 safety citations the Upper Big Branch - South Mine received in 2009 , its greatest count in the last 15 years
In March 2010 , 53 new safety citations were issued for Massey ’s Upper Big Branch - South Mine , including violations of its mine ventilation plan .
Over $ 2.2 million in fines have been assessed against Massey ’s Upper Big Branch - South Mine since 1995 , with $ 791,327 paid .
Massey is contesting $ 1,128,833 in fines .
Massey ’s delinquent fines total $ 246,320 .
Interestingly , Massey does n't have business interruption insurance , which means if the mine does n't get up and running again soon and it can't meet the demand for coal its customers commend , it will have to purchase coal from its competitors .

GENEVA , Switzerland —
Details are emerging from yesterday 's court appearance in Tehran of seven imprisoned Iranian Baha 'i leaders .
The Baha'i International Community has learned that when the prisoners arrived at the court , their families were not allowed to enter , signaling a closed hearing .
Inside the courtroom , however , the prisoners saw numerous officials and interrogators from the Ministry of Intelligence – along with a film crew which had already set up its cameras .
Concerned over the presence of non-judicial personnel in a supposedly closed hearing , the Baha 'is – with the agreement of their attorneys – declined to be party to the proceedings .
The judge adjourned the session and did not announce a date for continuing the trial .
" The Islamic Republic of Iran should immediately set free these seven innocent prisoners , " said Diane Ala'i , Baha 'i representative to the United Nations in Geneva .
" The dictates of justice demand no less , " she said .
" They are now about to enter the third year of their incarceration on baseless charges which they have categorically denied and for which the government has no evidence whatsoever .
" At the very least , they should be released on bail and steps be taken to ensure that their trial is conducted fairly , in accordance with international standards of jurisprudence .
" If their confinement is to continue , the harsh conditions under which they are being held must be improved , " she said .
Yesterday 's session was the third in the ongoing trial of the seven Baha 'is , who have been accused of espionage , propaganda activities against the Islamic order , and " corruption on earth , " among other charges .
Their first court appearance was 12 January this year .
The seven defendants are Mrs. Fariba Kamalabadi , Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani , Mr. Afif Naeimi , Mr. Saeid Rezaie , Mrs. Mahvash Sabet , Mr. Behrouz Tavakkoli , and Mr. Vahid Tizfahm .
Mrs. Sabet was arrested on 5 March 2008 and the others on 14 May 2008 .
The ACTA Treaty is trying to do an end around the laws of countries by secretly enacting " 3 strikes " laws against " pirates . "
Get reported 3 times for violation copyright , and get kicked off the Internet forever .
This is patently ridiculous in so many ways , but if you 're going to enact a " 3 strikes " law then here are some suggestions for the shadowy negotiators to ponder .
Just Google
It : A person should be banned from the Internet if they post a question that could 've been easily answered by a simple Google search , and be informed to " just Google it " by other posters .
After 3 such posts the offender is banned .
Phrases such as " I was too lazy to do a search " or " I could n't find anything on Bing " do not exempt the poster from punishment .
Exceptions are made for minors and for people whose last name begins with the letter " U " ( if we 're going to be arbitrary about these laws , we might as well go all the way ) .
The Dead Meme :
Three offenses of referring to a meme in a non-historical manner after it has been declared dead by the Internet Meme Council ( IMC ) .
The IMC will be made up of members from the major meme - generating sites ( e.g. Fark , 4 chan , Reddit ) who will meet in secret every three months to determine which meme lives and which dies .
Results are not made public , so evictions from the Internet will seem sufficiently arbitrary .
Ignorance of a meme 's status is not a defense for violating this rule .
No exemptions for age or city of birth .
The Misleading Headline : Publications guilty of using sensational headlines that have are not reflected in the actual story will be banned from the Internet after three offenses .
Headlines such as " Obama Decapitates Glenn Beck in Debate " where the story does not included head loss or actual debate are guilty .
Determination of misleadingness will be determined like movie ratings .
A panel of 3 Mormons and 4 fundamentalist Christians will decide .
Exemptions can be purchased for $ 10,000 per headline run .
Unwanted Facebook Notifications :
If you send out 3 or more unwanted Facebook notifications from 3 different applications in a 30 minute time period , your access to the Internet will be terminated .
Violators will also have to spend 30 hours reading junk mail from credit card companies just for the hell of it .
30 - day exemption for new users .
Brain - dead Clicker :
Three clicks on ads depicting ripped abs , 100,000th visitor , singles in your area or smileys will need to find a new place to be moronic .
The only reasons these ads run is that stupid people click on them , eliminating those people from the Internet will make the Internet better for everyone else .
Children under 13 and people with Random Click Syndrome are exempt from this rule .
Scholars and satirists can also file for an exemption with the Association to Prevent Stupid People from Clicking on Ads that Annoy the Rest of Us. Related News New Law Protects Free Speech New Legislation Would Ban Urban Legends Government to Distribute Souls to Spammers

None of this is new or controversial information ; you can find it in a recent Government Accountability Office report to Congress .
What is less well known , however , is that many countries have instituted consumer protections against such hidden taxes , while the United States , which has some of the developed world ’s highest interchange fees , has left them completely unregulated .
True , there ’s an antitrust class action suit by merchants pending , but its resolution is a long way off and it ’s unclear if or how it would benefit consumers .
And while several legislative proposals are sitting patiently in Congress , they would at best only chip around the edges of the problem .
Instead , Washington should take two straightforward steps .
First , Congress should recognize the obvious : debit cards , whose use and fees are growing at a rapid rate , are actually no more than plastic checks .
Congress and the Federal Reserve do not allow banks to charge their customers a percentage of each check , and it should put the same restriction on debit cards .
Second , Congress should authorize the Federal Reserve to limit credit card interchange fees to their actual cost , fairly determined , plus a reasonable profit .
The annual savings to merchants would be in the tens of billions of dollars .
Since retailing is highly competitive , most of these savings would be passed on to consumers in lower prices or in the form of improved services by retailers that could afford to hire more people .
How can we be sure this would work ?
Because other countries have already done it .
In Australia , for example , regulation brought the credit card interchange rate down from .95 percent to .50 percent  compared to our approximately 2.0 percent .
Five years of experience has confirmed that the payments system works fine ; in 2008 , the Reserve Bank of Australia estimated the savings during the previous year to have been around 1.1 billion Australian dollars ( approximately $ 1 billion ) .
Patrick Kennedy wo n't run for re-election
Rhode Island Democratic Rep. Patrick Kennedy will retire after eight terms in office , bringing an end to his House career just months after his father , legendary Massachusetts Sen .
Ted Kennedy , passed away .
" My father instilled in me a deep commitment to public service , " Kennedy said in a video announcing his retirement .
" Now having spent two decades in politics , my life has taken a new direction and I will not be a candidate for re-election this year . "
Kennedy has easily held Rhode Island 's 1st district since 1994 despite the occasional attempt by Republicans to knock him off .
Kennedy 's time in Congress was decidedly uneven .
He was rumored to be planning a Senate bid in 2000 but decided against running .
He was tasked with chairing the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in that same cycle with expectations within the party that they would seize back control of the House .
It did n't happen .
After his stint at the DCCC , Kennedy took on a far less high - profile role in Congress -- emerging only infrequently and not always in the best light .
In the spring of 2006 Kennedy crashed his car into a police barricade near Capitol Hill ; he entered rehab for addiction and depression days later .
Over the summer , Kennedy admitted himself to a rehabilitation facility again .
Patrick Kennedy 's retirement means that for the first time in nearly five decades there will not be a member of the Kennedy family in Congress .
His father , who served Massachusetts in the Senate for more than four decades , died on August 25 .
Kennedy 's seat , which includes the northeastern reaches of the state , is strongly Democratic .
President Barack Obama won the seat by 32 points in 2008 while Sen. John Kerry ( Mass . ) carried it by 26 points in 2004 .
Among the Democrats mentioned as possible Kennedy replacements include : Providence Mayor David Cicilline , Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts and state party chairman Bill Lynch .
State Rep. John Loughlin was already in the race on the Republican side .
Kennedy is the 14th Democrat to announce his retirement plans this cycle .
Eighteen Republicans are retiring while Rep. Mario Diaz - Balart is giving up his 25th district seat to run in for the 21st district being vacated by his brother -- retiring Rep. Lincoln Diaz - Balart .
PadRacer is like Scalextric for the iPad , a top - down car - racing game for up to four players .
The awesome twist is that those players use their iPhones to control the tiny on - screen cars .
The first game we know of to use this multimachine approach for the iPad is Scrabble , which lets players keep their tile - rack secreted on their iPhone screen and then flick the tiles onto the main board , over on the iPad , when it 's time to play .
PadRacer instead turns the iPhone ( or iPod Touch ) into a wireless controller , connected via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi .
You steer the cars by tilting the iPhone left or right .
The only caveat is that you can't play the game without an iPhone or iPod , so the audience is slightly self - limiting ( and we wonder how many complaints there will be from people who do n't read the warning first and buy the game without the right gear ) .
And we already know what you 're thinking :
The minimum price for the hardware to play a two - player game is $ 900 – one $ 500 iPad and two $ 200 iPod Touches .
On the other hand , the game is just $ 5 , and if you already have the hardware , then this could be a lot of fun .
Who knows where this stuff will lead ?
A first - person shooter with a sniper - rifle view on the iPhone screen ?
IPad Poker , with your cards hidden in the palm of your hand ?
Or even a Keynote remote on the iPhone , complete with preview of the next slide ?
One thing 's for sure :
The iPad is looking like a kick - ass gaming machine .

Analyst View :
While the Apple iPad successfully launched , a dark cloud is hovering : user complaints that the tablet can't maintain a steady Wi -Fi connection .
Apple acknowledged the problem on Tuesday , but did n't offer a solution .
Here are four fixes that may solve the iPad 's issues .
The Apple iPad has enjoyed a successful launch , with over , but there appears to be a dark cloud hanging over Cupertino 's wonder - tablet .
Apple 's support forum is being bombarded by user complaints centering on the iPad 's inability to maintain a full , steady Wi-Fi connection .
A thread entitled " Weak Wifi Pages " already has over 10,000 views  remarkable since it 's only been 48 hours since the official iPad launch .
Here are a couple of user statements :
I have also noticed very weak wifi signal in my 16GB iPad .
Even when standing in front of the wlan router the signal fluctuates from strong to very weak .
The router has very strong signals as every other computer here has full signal strength , even 20 - 30 meters from the route[r ] .
and :
Let me add my voice to the throng .
I 'm getting one or two bars on my iPad in rooms where my iPhone , iPod touch , both Macbook Pros , Apple TV and Playstation all get full service .
Users are speculating that the weak signal strength may be caused by poor placement of the Wi-Fi antenna ; others ponder if the problems are the symptoms of a software issue .
The latter appears to be the culprit evidenced by the fact that most users on the forum who are running completely Apple - based networks are not having the same issue :
I noticed that this was happening at my mother in law's with the ActionTec Verizon FiOS router .
However , here at my house , where Time Capsule and Airport Extreme rule the house , I have 0 problems .
No problem here either , my wireless network is run by apple devices too .
Yet there are also grumblings about weak signals from those using Apple 's Airport Extreme routers .
Another issue being reported is the iPad 's continuous request for re-authentication to a secured wireless router , even after a successful , initial connection to it .
Apple Weighs
In :
On Monday , Apple posted a Knowledge Base article , pertaining to these issues .
Not only does the article make suggestions for a remedy , it gives legitimacy to the fact that Apple considers this a very real issue .
The article states that having a third - party Wi-Fi router that supports both the 2.4 - GHz and 5 - GHz bands may be subject to a connectivity problem .
It suggests that users can setup different SSID 's for each band 's network and to ensure that each network uses the same security type ( WEP , WPA or WPA2 . )
What You Can Do :
If you 're an early adopter experiencing connectivity issues there are a few things you can do to until Apple comes up with a more definitive explanation and fix for this problem :
Update Your Router 's Firmware .
Before attempting to connect an iPad to a home network , make sure that you have the latest version of the firmware to ensure that the router is functioning at full capability .
This is usually done within the router 's included software .

Change The Router 's Location .
Do you have your router positioned in close proximity to equipment that could be causing interference ?
Microwaves , cordless phones , baby monitors , wireless keyboards , and Bluetooth devices can muddy a W - Fi signal .

Set Your Router To Operate On One 802.11 Standard .
Most current routers support not only 802.11n , but a , b , and g as well .
Set your router to operate exclusively on the greatest standard available , and do the same with the wireless devices on your network .
The iPad ships with support for 802.11n , so you should have your router match that if possible .

Change Your Router 's Security Encryption .
Typically , security is n't something that should be experimented with , but when attempting to boost network performance , it may be necessary .
There 's no question that WPA and WPA2 encryption is more secure than WEP , but the jury 's still out about which encryption method can slow a network down more ( some believe it 's WEP and others WPA ) .
If you have either currently deployed in your home network , try changing to a different encryption setting and see if that makes any difference in your connectivity .
Apple also recommends that you use the same security settings across the entire network .

Rename Your Networks .
Apple makes the somewhat odd suggestion that users rename their networks .
" Create separate Wi-Fi network names to identify each band .
This can be done easily by appending one or more characters to the current network name .
Example : Add a G to the 802.11b/ g network name and an N to the 802.11n network name . "
This is surely the so - called pea in the princess ' mattress , at least where the iPad 's launch is concerned .
It 's hard to know where the blame lies at this time .
While it 's understandable that Apple is bearing the brunt of the complaints for their device 's perceived connectivity issues , the problems could very well be an issue with third - party router vendors not releasing or pushing out firmware updates in time for the iPad 's release .
Here 's hoping for a true fix from router vendors and / or Apple in the immediate future .
In the meanwhile , try the tips above , and let us know if they helped you .

Dustin Browder , the design director for Blizzard Entertainment 's upcoming mega-RTS StarCraft II : Wings of LIberty , took time out of his busy Zerg - nerfing schedule to speak with us about the philosophy behind the game .
Strap yourselves in , because we 're in for several pages of exclusive info on one of the biggest PC games of the year .
What 's the biggest change you 've seen in the way the StarCraft II beta plays compared to high - level StarCraft play ?
We 're seeing all kinds of crazy strats .
We do n't know if they 're real , if the counters have been found out yet , or if it 'll all shake out in the end , or if we need to make fixes .
Obviously , StarCraft II is a more mobile game in many ways than the original StarCraft was .
This is in some ways a function of the types of units we have .
There 's a lot of mobility in this game in terms of moving and dancing , attacking and retreating .
We 're seeing lots and lots of dancing between players as they vie for position , as they try to get in good flank attacks , and as they try to get in behind their enemies and prevent them from escaping .
That 's probably the single biggest global change that you see , but as I said we 're also seeing lots of crazy rushes that we have n't really seen before .
We 're seeing lots of warping in stuff early on in enemy bases .
We 're seeing lots of early attacks that were n't really possible in the original game and we 're trying to decide , " Are these permanent problems ?
Are they problems that we need to deal with right now , or will they shake out in the end ?
Is that change in overall mobility something you intentionally built into the game ?
No .
Our creative process on StarCraft II was very different than the creative process I 've used on other RTS games I 've worked on or even on WarCraft III .
We did n't set out with any goals in mind , and I 'm sure that this will upset the fans terribly .
What we did instead was that we said , " We want to make a bunch of cool units , and we 're going to make each unit as cool as we can possibly make it , and then we 'll see how it all works together , and we 'll tune as necessary from there . "
So it was never our intention specifically to do anything exactly with the races .
Our goal was to make the units as interesting as possible and as different from one another as we possibly could .
From there we could see how the races changed and evolved .
That 's definitely how it has worked out .
The Zerg , I think , are a lot more methodical in StarCraft II than they were in the original StarCraft .
The Terrans have a lot more of a commando feel to them in a lot of cases than the original Terrans ever did .
I know that 's something that a lot of the fans look at and say , " Oh my god , you 've changed the Zerg ! " but there 's really no way to re-make this game and to change the units without fundamentally changing the character of the races .
So our goal initially was , " Each unit is as different as it can be from all the other units in the game , and each unit has its own unique role and its own unique abilities , and each unit hopefully feels as cool as it possibly can feel , and then we 'll see where the races end up and hopefully it wo n't feel too different from where they should be conceptually . "
But we did n't really have a set goal when we started , and right now I 'm very happy with how everybody is playing out .
Everybody feels very different from one another , the kinds of strats you see in the different race matchups are fairly different .
We 're obviously looking to continue to push those even further .
For example , we 're seeing the Roach - Hydralisk combo for Zerg is pretty core to a lot of the matchups , and we 're going to do some things to try to break that up a little bit .
But against Terrans we 're seeing very different strategies as a Protoss player as opposed to playing against a Zerg player .
Were you sad to see anything have to go in the name of balance ?
Early on we obviously were n't as worried about balance as we are at this point in time , but for instance the Thor was a unit that went through a lot of changes .
We had these big cannons on the back of the Thor that did massive , long - range AOE [ area of effect ] attacks because that looked cool and it sure was fun to play with .
It stepped on the Siege Tank in the worst way .
You really did n't need a Siege Tank if you had a Thor , or if you had a Siege Tank you did n't need a Thor ; one or the other .
So we ended up scaling those back to be a single - target , high - damage stun attack , which feels pretty different from the Siege Tank , but it does n't quite match the visuals as much as I would like .
But it 's a much better player - based experience .
I would say that those are some of our biggest struggles with StarCraft , that the art will imply a certain look and feel , like what 's supposed to happen , and it does n't always match the best gameplay goals .
We 'll often go with the gameplay , which means that the art is sometimes a little bit out of sorts with what you imagine it could do .
For example , if I build six Battlecruisers , a lot of players look at that and imagine , " there 's nothing in the world that can defeat this .
Look how big they are !
I will crush all with this !
No -one can stand before my might ! "
And they 're quite surprised when they run into 30 or 40 Hydralisks and they get rolled , and they think , " What ?!
That can't be , that 's not right ! "
But we 're not willing to make the Battlecruiser look wimpy just because if he encounters ten times his cost , he 's going to lose .
Those are some of the challenges we face , and that 's the area you 'll see we 've done something and we have to go back on it a little bit , just because we thought it would look cool and we thought it would play cool .
If we thought it did n't play cool , but we still think it looks great , we 'll keep some of the visuals but we 'll change up the gameplay to make it a better experience .
How do you approach defined counter triangles and other meta design aspects ?
We do a lot of work on that stuff .
StarCraft is a little different from other RTS games in the sense that we do have some triangles in the game , but we also try to make sure that a lot of the relationships -- between a lot of the early units , especially -- can be changed fundamentally with micro .
For example , Zealots counter Stalkers unless the Stalkers kite , and if the Stalkers kite the Zealots will lose .
But it all depends on how you manage your units .
It 's not enough to just build the right units ; it also matters how you use that unit .
If I bring the wrong units to the party , like if I come storming out into the middle of the map , like " Hah , I 've got a thousand Stalkers !
Oh my god , that 's a lot of Zealots ! " you 're not just dead .
You can , in fact , get some use out of those units .
Terrain is a large factor as well .
Marines will absolutely lose to Zealots , unless they get some kind of terrain advantage .
If they can catch the Zealots in a tight choke point , or even in some cases just put their backs to a wall and prevent the Zealots from surrounding , they can get a lot of damage off .
So for us , it 's all about some of those triangles , but it 's also about making sure there 's a lot of gameplay based on your position and a lot of gameplay based on the terrain around you .
Then we just grind away at that stuff for months and months and months trying to make them really interesting and giving a lot of player choice and providing a lot of fun tactical options for players not only in terms of the forces they build , but also in the types of choices they make on the battlefield .
Are you happy with the balance between micro and macro play in the beta ?
We see ourselves as doing a lot of everything .
Some games favor a macro gameplay , and some games favor a micro gameplay .
Our goals are to have both be possible .
As a Zerg player , you can choose to be more of a macro Zerg player or more of a micro Zerg player , or anything in between .
The reason this is so interesting for us is if we have that kind of choice for players , it means that even in a Zerg versus Zerg game , I could fundamentally be playing a very different race than you 're playing because I 'm playing a much more economy - based game , and you 're playing a much more tactical - based game .
Both strategies are viable and possible -- that 's our goal .
Whether we succeed or not is still up in the air and ultimately up to the fans .
In terms of how happy I am right now , we 're in beta .
It 's certainly the biggest game I 've ever had the honor of getting a chance to work on .
I 'm not happy at all .
We 're all just scared s** tless .
At this point , I just want to make sure we get the best possible product to the fans and we 're really waiting on the fans to tell us whether or not we should be happy .
I 'm hopeful ; I 'm not seeing huge problems .
But that does n't mean we wo n't see huge problems any minute now .
I could walk back to my desk right after this interview and watch a replay and go , " Oh my god , what are we going to do about that ? " [ laughs ]
So we 're all on pins and needles over here waiting and seeing how the beta shakes out .
Every day brings new sources of terror as we wait to see what the fans think up to do with the game that simply has not occurred to us from playing internally .
How do you plan to introduce newer players to hardcore competitive play ?
I 'll say two things about that .
One is that I would definitely encourage the players out there who got lucky enough to get a [ beta ] key who are thinking of it as a demo not to think of it as a demo .
What we 've done with the beta is fundamentally very similar to putting out a beta of level 80 World of Warcraft arena with no buildup before that .
That would be the most difficult thing to learn .
This is really a chance for us to test our play balance with players of all skill levels , but players who are already committed to learning and playing the multiplayer experience and do n't feel too bad if they lose a game .
For the final game , we 've got twenty - plus hours of campaign , which will get players familiar with and comfortable with the controls , familiar with and comfortable with resourcing , give them a basic understanding of some of the counters in the game , but just give them 20 hours of sort of comfortableness with the game , much as you would when you 're playing through 20 hours of questing in WoW .
It does n't teach you how to do high - end raiding , but it gets you comfortable with the UI and it gets you comfortable with your character .
So we 've got that .
Then we 've got our challenges .
Our challenges are about ten maps that teach you the fundamentals of online competitive play .
They teach you how to defend against rushes .
They teach you how to build up your economy .
They teach you some of the basic counters for the three races .
They teach you how to block your choke .
They teach you all kinds of stuff that you will need to understand on some basic level to play in the competitive environment .
Then we have five different difficulties of AI that you can play against to learn your race .
Obviously the race in solo play for Terrans is a little bit different from the race in multiplayer .
If you want to learn Zerg or Protoss , you can go to those AIs and battle it out against them .
We 've also got an auto - matchmaker for cooperative against the AI that will hopefully get you to a position where you 're more comfortable playing online and more comfortable playing in a team environment .
We 're definitely going to be looking at Achievements and other tools to encourage our players , once they graduate from cooperative vs .
AI to move into team play before they move into 1v1 .
We 're going to offer 4 v4 and 3v3 to encourage them to get into a team play environment , get with a team .
It 's a much more casual environment than the 1v1 ; you 've got somebody to help you play with , you 've got allies who can come to your rescue if you get into a little bit of trouble .
We really consider the 1v1 the final endgame arena - style gameplay that we hope players will only get to after 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 hours played depending on their enthusiasm for it .
That 's my hope as a designer , but whether any of that works out is anyone 's guess .
We 're going to try to do anything we can with the UI and with the Achievements to encourage players to follow some kind of arc like that so that by the time they get to 1v1 hopefully they 're feeling very comfortable with the game and they 're ready for it -- they 're not just thrown into the deep end .
Will the Battle . net revamp support co-op or other online gameplay in any meaningful way ?
We 're going to offer a bunch of Achievements associated with [ co - op play ] to encourage you to keep playing and getting rewards .
We 'll have avatars tied to those Achievements so you can show off your ability against the AI specifically , both solo and in a team environment .
We 've also got the Battle .
net party system , which will allow you to get together with your friends very easily and take on AIs in a variety of different formats .
That was one of the ways that I always enjoyed -- besides competitive play -- with my friends , playing the original StarCraft that way .
We really hope that that is a big part of the experience here for a lot of players .
Ultimately , I imagine that players will start off by playing cooperative against the AI and earning achievements through the matchmaker , but that they 'll graduate at some point , having made friends online or having gotten their friends into the game , into playing custom games and trying on 3v4 versus the AI , or 3v5 versus the AI .
" What happens if we do it on this kind of map ?
What happens if we do it on that kind of map ?
What happens if we 're all Zerg ? "
Those are the kinds of ways that I think are really fun to play StarCraft , where you are continually challenging yourself , not only with new difficulties but with new numbers of opponents on map types that are maybe less friendly to your strategies .
Challenging yourself to try races you 're less familiar with .
It can be a really fun way to play .
Will there be many of these unusual maps at launch ?
We 're definitely going to have a variety of map types out of the box , but there 's really nothing that we can do that will equal the scale or scope of the community 's endeavors .
We 've got hundreds of thousands of map - makers out there making these things .
You 're going to see a lot more exciting stuff .
And of course you saw some really great stuff in Warcraft III .
Tower defense maps were created by the community and went on to spawn almost a whole genre of game types that now you can play on Xbox Live or download on Steam .
So our community almost invented a genre .
You 've of course got DotA [ Defense of the Ancients ] as well , which was a map type that was developed in StarCraft and Warcraft III which went on to be a really great way to play games online .
So we 're obviously going to continue to pursue that .
We 're going to try to provide the community with some seed maps when we first launch that will get them started , but we fully expect the mapmaking community to take off running and show us how it 's done and make some really great stuff .
We 'll see what happens .
We 're going to try to support some cooperative - style maps taking some of our campaign game mechanics and making cooperative maps out of those mechanics .
We have maps where lava rises every few minutes and then recedes , and you can only be on the low ground during the time where it 's safe , and if you 're on the low ground when the lava rises everybody dies .
That could be a really fun cooperative map that 's pretty easy for us to put together .
We 're going to try to ship with some maps like those , but just like we always have in the past – like if you 've ever explored some of the custom campaign folders in StarCraft and Warcraft III , before the community even gets their hands on it there are all kinds of crazy map types in there .
We 're definitely going to try to support some of that at launch , but I fully expect the community to take off running and do a ton of stuff in even the first few weeks and months when StarCraft II goes live .
Is the custom game browser going to be any better ?
Our custom game browser is going to be a little bit updated .
Instead of just a giant list of maps and good luck finding the one you want to find , the maps are now organized by type .
You 'll be able to go in there , and you wo n't see 30 games when in fact there are several hundred games and we just gave you the first 30 ; you wo n't see that .
You 'll see 30 map types that are listed .
So you 'll be able to say , " I want to play Defense of the Ancients , " and if Defense of the Ancients is one of the most popular maps out there -- which , who are we kidding , it probably will be -- then that will be one of the top listed game types and you can just click on that and it will put you into a game of that type .
If by weird chance there are no other games out there right now , it 'll ask you if you want to start a lobby .
Did you have any radical thoughts early on in StarCraft II 's development ?
We went through all kinds of crazy stuff .
We 'd been working on some of our campaign stuff where you 've got a much stronger role - playing component , and that has changed shape several times throughout the development process .
It was much more of a role - playing game at one point , and now it 's settled into a proper RTS with some really strong progression elements to it .
How is StarCraft II a better game now than it was when it was first shown in playable form years ago ?
For instance , a year ago we did n't really have a Zerg race that was that much fun to play .
At the time , the Roach 's regeneration was above ground and all the time .
While I appreciated the unit for its simplicity in that role -- a constantly regenerating unit , kind of a Zerg Wolverine character , that was pretty fun -- it ultimately produced some very random results in battles .
If the units randomly focus - fired on your Roaches in the correct way , and just by chance they happened to pick off one Roach at a time , then you would suddenly have a big victory against the Roach as opposed to if you let them attack move and they all picked their own targets and you got a little unlucky with the acquisition , then suddenly the Roaches would roll your units .
We did n't have a working spellcasting kit for the Zerg at the time .
We did n't have the Queen as the proper base defense spellcaster ; she was trying to be an offensive caster , and she was trying to be a defensive caster at the same time .
She was a little conflicted as to what she was supposed to accomplish .
As I said , the Thor was sort of wandering around , trying to figure out what his role on the battlefield was .
So a lot of the units were a lot more muddy than they are now ; they were a lot less crisp .
The race matchups were also a lot worse .
It was very easy to have games where it was just … depending on the week , it could be that Protoss was winning every game versus Protoss losing every game .
We had a lot more units in the game .
We sometimes had fifteen or sixteen units on the Zerg or Protoss at any given moment before we finally got down to 14 now .
Sometimes as many as 17 or 18 on the Zerg , which meant that the race matchups got very confusing .
It was difficult to know what to build at any given moment , and there was lots of overlap either between the units on a single race or between the units on a race and another unit .
You 'd play as the Zerg with something called a Spore Beast and we'd say , " Oh my god , this is just a Banshee , is n't it ? "
We 'd try to tune as like a really fast Banshee , and it was like , " Okay , dude , but that 's still a Banshee . "
It had n't fundamentally changed its role .
We had some stuff that was a lot wackier , that felt more new but was n't necessarily more fun .
So I would say it was just a much less polished experience .
Just not as tight .
It was sort of all over the place .
You would have some things that were fundamentally crazier and they seemed more fun until you actually played with them .
We had a Corruptor at the time that every time it got a kill , it would turn that kill into a flying corrupted thing that would shoot at enemy forces .
So you 'd see a Viking that was all covered in slime and it'd be shooting at other Vikings and all these spores would be coming off of it .
And it was really crazy cool !
It felt so Zerg -y , it was so awesome !
I definitely miss that vibe from that unit , but I gotta tell you , it was just chaos .
You really had no idea of what was happening on the battlefield , because the fliers are allowed to overlap in StarCraft .
So I 'd have six or seven Vikings kind of on top of each other , and maybe three or four of these corrupted Vikings also on top of the Vikings , and I 'd have no idea of what was going on .
My Vikings are exploding , but who could say why ?
Not even the Zerg player knew what was happening .
Lots of stuff like that .
A lot of clarity issues , a lot of overlap between the units , a lot of playbalance issues .
All of the time , we were just getting it tighter and tighter and tighter , and now we 've managed to get it in front of the community , which is really exciting .
Now we 're starting to see where we can continue to improve it .
I 've complained about it before , but I thought maybe we were good enough and now I think we 're not .
In Protoss versus Protoss games , if you get a bunch of Zealots together from two teams with kind of similar colors , it can be really tough to see what 's going on .
So there are clarity issues , but also the fundamental crispness of the sides and crispness of the units so that when you see an enemy unit , you know immediately , " I know exactly what I have to do to stop that , I have got the perfect unit that 's going to roll him .
If I can only get it out in enough numbers , I can totally push him back . "
That kind of precision and crispness really makes the game feel great .
Have any glaring imbalances shown up in the beta so far ?
I have n't seen anything in beta yet that 's really … .
Well , that 's not true .
We have a proxy Gateway rush that 's been causing us a lot of trouble .
It 's still evolving even now .
The basic strat is that you build a Pylon on low ground , outside the guy 's base .
Then you run inside his base and you build a Gateway next to the cliff edge so it 's powered by that Pylon .
So the enemy player is unable to get at the Pylon , which is the weak link in that whole setup , because the Pylon is on the low ground .
Then you start building Zealots , or at some point warping in Zealots in that power field .
This endless Zealot pressing , especially against a Terran player or even a Protoss player , is pretty unstoppable .
[ laughs ]
It 's pretty grim .
That one is one that we 've been attacking for quite a while and we 're about to attack it again .
We 're seeing it in Protoss versus Protoss games now .
We 've beaten it back pretty well in Protoss versus Terran , but Protoss versus Protoss is still really bad .
If one Protoss player goes three Gateways , the other Protoss player needs to go three Gateways to counter or he is hosed .
So we 're probably going to do some changes to the build time on the upgrade for Warp Gates , just to push that a little bit later in the tech tree so that a lot of the early Warp Gate shenanigans that we 're seeing in the beta get pushed back a little bit .
It 's really tough , because the initial urge from a lot of guys when they see that , is " We just need to take that and move it to Fleet Beacon . "
They just want to bury it in the tech tree as much as they possibly can .
I understand the urge , but at the same time we 've got to try to maintain the differentiation between these races , and we 've got to try to push everything to feel as powerful as it possibly can without actually being unbalanced .
We definitely want to make these things feel mighty .
We also want some of these rushes to be possible .
A lot of players will look at that and say , " Well , that 's just broken .
Why do n't you just beat that out of the game so it 's not even possible ? "
But for us at Blizzard , we really embrace the rush .
For us , the ability to win or lose this game at any time is one of the things that makes it so exciting , that makes it such an intense emotional experience .
There are definitely players out there who do n't want that intensity in their lives .
I understand .
They 're like , " I do n't want to lose a game , thank you very much , let alone in the first 20 seconds . "
But we feel like that 's part of what makes the game really exciting , and really intense , and such an adrenaline rush , such an intense emotional experience .
Because when you see that load screen end , you know it 's on .
Every move you make for the next fifteen minutes could determine your victory or defeat .
We definitely embrace the rush , we just want to know that some of these strategies are as easy to block as they are to do .
When we see a strategy that 's really easy to do but very , very difficult to block , that 's when we have a problem .
In the beta right now , we 're seeing a lot of players do a Planetary Fortress rush where they do everything possible to get the technology necessary for a planetary fortress as early as they can , and they fly to the enemy base , and they land next to their peon stream and they convert their Command Center into a Planetary Fortress , and it 's like , " Haha ! " and the guy 's dead .
All you have to do to stop this , of course , is to put just one unit underneath that Command Center and it can't even land .
So it 's really very easy to block , but if you 're not paying attention you can get caught by it and defeated .
So that 's an example of a kind of rush that we want to allow .
It 's okay if players do this kind of thing as long as it's really easy to block .
MILLEDGEVILLE , Ga. --
The young woman who accused Ben Roethlisberger of sexual assault said she tried to get away from the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback and told him " no , this is not OK , " according to police documents released Thursday .
In a statement to police on March 5 , the 20 - year - old college student said Roethlisberger encouraged her , and her friends , to take numerous shots of alcohol .
Then one of his bodyguards escorted her into a hallway at the Capital City nightclub , sat her on a stool and left .
She said Roethlisberger walked down the hallway and exposed himself .
" I told him it was n't OK , no , we do n't need to do this and I proceeded to get up and try to leave , " she said .
" I went to the first door I saw , which happened to be a bathroom . "
According to her statement , Roethlisberger then followed her into a nearby bathroom and shut the door .
" I still said no , this is not OK , and he then had sex with me , " she wrote .
" He said it was OK .
He then left without saying anything . "
In 500 - plus pages of documents released Wednesday , Nicole Biancofiore , a friend of the accuser , told investigators from the Georgia Bureau of Investigations her friend , a student at Georgia College & State University , " was dragged by a bodyguard to the back room in Capital [ City , a local nightclub ] .
She was extremely intoxicated and not aware of what was happening . "
Two of the woman 's friends said they saw the bodyguard lead her into the hallway and then saw Roethlisberger follow .
They said they could n't see their friend but knew she was drunk and were worried about her .
Ann Marie Lubatti told police she approached one of Roethlisberger 's two bodyguards and said , " This is n't right .
My friend is back there with Ben .
She needs to come back right now . "
She said the bodyguard would n't look her in the eye and said he did n't know what she was talking about .
The GBI later identified that bodyguard as Ed Joyner , and the GBI also determined that the man who led Roethlisberger 's accuser down the hallway was Anthony Barravecchio .
Joyner is a Pennsylvania trooper and Barravecchio is an officer on the force in the Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis .
Attorney Michael Santicola , who represents Barravecchio but said Joyner also is a longtime friend , confirmed on March 10 that the two officers were present , but not in an official capacity .
He said the two men are friends with Roethlisberger and did not witness any criminal activity or inappropriate behavior .
He said the officers " have no memory " of meeting Roethlisberger 's accuser .
I know what you ’re thinking , I ’m fucking sick of bands with that formulaic name style too .
“ Insert Proper Noun Here ” + and the +
“ Insert Collective Noun Here ” .
It does n’t make you individual , so if anyone is out there thinking of naming their new group in this manner …stop it right now .
Having said that though , Pearl and the Puppets were formed in 2006 which was before the formation of Marina , Florence et al. , so the blame ca n’t be fully sent their way .
Because I
Do was recently featured in a Vodafone ( massive cunts , never buy from them ) commercial in Australia , which has in the past has been a great platform for unknown artists to get their music heard by the masses .
Another one of their tracks , Make Me Smile , is being used on the new Victoria ’s Secret advert in the US , and instead of financial remuneration , Pearl â€ “ real name Katie Sutherland â€ “ has asked to be sent some of the company ’s sexy undies …
Because I
Do is quite a catchy track , and the band has been recently signed up by Universal so expect to hear much more from them in the future .

Lisa J. Murphy does n't make ordinary books .
Most books are meant to be looked at , read only with your eyes .
Hers are meant to be touched .
Her book Tactile Mind , which she hand - crafted herself , is meant to be felt up , to be precise .
It is an erotic book for the blind and visually impaired , though it can be enjoyed by the sighted as well .
A photographer with a certificate in Tactile Graphics from the Canadian National Institute for the Blind , Murphy learned to create touchable images of animals for books for visually impaired children .
Then she realized that there was a lack of such books for adults only .
" There are no books of tactile pictures of nudes for adults , at least the last time I looked around , " says Murphy .
" We 're breaking new ground .
Playboy has ( an edition with ) Braille wording , but there are no pictures . "
She says that while we live in a culture saturated with sexual images , the blind have been " left out . "
There are more than 836,000 Canadians living with significant vision loss , according to the CNIB .
As the population ages over the coming decade , this number is expected to rise dramatically .
Though porn for the blind sounds like an oxymoron , Murphy assures that it is not .
Tactile Mind is half art object , half artisanal concept book .
It contains explicit softcore images that are raised from its pages , along with Braille text and photos .
The effect of the tactile , plastic " images " is a bit like that of an ancient Greek bas - relief .
Or , somewhat less precisely , a smutty pop-up book .
Creating a tactile book is far from simple , Murphy says .
She recruited some friends and photographed them wearing masks , streamers , Christmas lights , or nothing at all .
That was the easy part .
Then she blew up the photos and built on top of them with clay , being careful to mimic the photo in three ( well , two and a half ) dimensions .
She baked them until they were hardened , and then covered them with a layer of special Thermoform plastic that molds to what it touches when heated up .
After being heated in a special machine , the plastic - finished product is ready to become a plate in the book .
The whole process takes Murphy between 40 and 50 hours .
That 's for just one image .
" I was just interested in the challenge , " she says .
" When you 're dealing with people who can read Braille with their fingertips , they can feel every error . "
The book wo n't fit on just any shelf .
It 's 13 to 15 centimetres thick when shut .
It displays the visual photos alongside the tactile image based on them .
A Braille description describes what 's in the photos , such as articles of clothing .

" It 'll say , ` He 's wearing a mask , ' ( so readers know ) he 's not missing a nose , " says Murphy .
At $ 225 per numbered , signed copy , the book is definitely upscale .
" People love to touch it and look at it , " says Jesse Huisken , co-owner of This Ain't The Rosedale Library .
" People think it 's charming ; they just can't afford it . "
The book also retails at fetish store Northbound Leather , where it is at home among other things tactile .
" It is something completely new , something completely different , " says manager Enza .
She says Northbound stocks other erotic toys that emphasize touch over sight , such as a stimulation device that administers electric current .
It 's controlled by manipulating a doll that 's attached .
The market is growing for erotic toys and pornography made for people normally left out of the traditional demographic for such things –that is , white , straight , able - bodied males .
The Feminist Porn Awards took place in Toronto on Thursday and Friday , honouring the kind of dirty movie that " expands the boundaries of sexual representation on film and challenges stereotypes that are often found in mainstream porn . "
Murphy 's book lends , uh , depth to her sexy subject matter .
Although she lists her CNIB credentials , she says it 's unclear if the advocacy organization would approve of her book .
Representatives were unavailable to comment by press time .
" I think they might be a little conservative , " Murphy says .
Kurz vor ihrer Ernennung zur niedersächsischen Sozialministerin hat die CDU - Politikerin Aygül Özkan dem “ Focus ” ein Interview gegeben , in dem auch diese zwei Fragen und Antworten vorkamen :
Würde es Sie stören , wenn er in der Schule von Lehrerinnen mit Kopftuch unterrichtet würde ?
Kopftücher haben im Klassenzimmer nichts zu suchen .
Die Schule sollte ein neutraler
Ort sein .
Selbst in der Türkei gilt ein Verbot von Kopftüchern , das sogar noch weiter geht und alle öffentlichen Einrichtungen betrifft .
Ein Kind muss selbst entscheiden können , wie es sich religiös orientiert .
Darum bin ich dagegen , derartige Symbole an Schulen zuzulassen .
Gilt das auch für Kruzifixe ?
Ja. Christliche Symbole gehören nicht an staatliche Schulen .
Für Schulen in kirchlicher Trägerschaft gilt das nicht .
Das Interview sorgte für viel Aufregung in den Medien .
Genauer : Eine der beiden oben zitierten Antworten .
Die meisten Medien schafften es trotz der knalligen Überschriften , wenigstens im Artikel klar zu stellen , dass nach Frau Özkans Meinung alle Arten religiöser Symbole an staatlichen Schulen nichts zu suchen hätten .
Dieses kleine Detail unterschlug Bild.de überraschenderweise :
Und deshalb gibt es natürlich gleich Morddrohungen gegen die “ schöne Ministerin ” , wie Bild.de unter Berufung auf die “ Bild am Sonntag ” schreibt — nur scheinen die ( laut “ Bild am Sonntag ” ) nur bedingt mit dem “ Kruzifix - Zoff ” in Zusammenhang zu stehen :
Seit Mittwochabend wird Aygül Özkan Tag und Nacht von zwei Beamten des Landeskriminalamtes ( LKA ) bewacht .
Seit ihre Ernennung zur Ministerin bekannt wurde , bekommt sie von rechtsradikalen Deutschen konkrete Morddrohungen .
Seit gestern bekommt Frau Özkan darüber hinaus gute Ratschläge von “ Bild ” - Kommentatoren : Hugo Müller - Vogg behauptete zunächst ungerührt , sie wolle “ ‘ christliche Symbole ’ aus den Schulen entfernen ” ( eine Behauptung , die er heute noch einmal wiederholte ) , und erklärt :
Eines hat die erste türkischstämmige Ministerin offenbar nicht verstanden :
Dass es bei uns so tolerant zugeht , das ist das Erbe unserer christlich - abendländischen Tradition .
Aygül Özkan und all die anderen Mitbürger muslimischen Glaubens zählen für Müller - Vogg offenbar nicht zu diesem “ uns ” , das bei “ Bild ” traditionell schwammig zwischen “ Redaktion ” und “ ganz Deutschland ” oszilliert .
Dabei sollten die doch so dankbar sein ( “ uns ” , vermutlich ) :
Von dieser Toleranz profitieren nicht zuletzt Zuwanderer mit anderen Religionen und Werten .
Deshalb dürfen türkische Schülerinnen auch ein Kopftuch tragen , was die Noch - nicht - Ministerin ebenfalls verbieten möchte .
… was freilich nur eine mögliche Interpretation dessen ist , was Özkan geantwortet hatte , als sie vom “ Focus ” explizit auf Lehrerinnen mit Kopftuch angesprochen worden war .
Aber einmal in Fahrt erklärt Müller - Vogg das christliche Symbol Kruzifix gleich zum christlichen Wert :
Aber die “ C ” - Partei kann keine Abstriche an ihren christlichen Werten hinnehmen .
Darum geht ’s also :
Um die Muslima , die heimlich die CDU von innen auflösen will .
Und nachdem Frau Özkan schon wieder zurückgerudert war , machte Franz Josef Wagner heute deutlich , dass er überhaupt nichts begriffen hatte :
Was sollen wir anstelle des Kreuzes ­aufhängen ?
Ribéry , Beckenbauer , Bushido , Bohlen , Buddha , Günter Grass , Köhler , Frau Merkel , Uwe Seeler , Gerd Müller .

EN - V , which is short for Electric Networked - Vehicle , maintains the core principle of personal mobility - freedom - while helping remove the motor vehicle from the environmental debate and redefining design leadership .
EN - V is a two - seat electric vehicle that was designed to alleviate concerns surrounding traffic congestion , parking availability , air quality and affordability for tomorrow 's cities .
The Maio ( Magic ) model ( pictured ) was unveiled today in Shanghai alongside Jiao ( Pride ) and Xiao ( Laugh ) .
They represent three different characteristics which emphasize that future transportation can be fun .
By 2030 , urban areas will be home to more than 60 percent of the world 's 8 billion people .
This will put tremendous pressure on a public infrastructure that is already struggling to meet the growing demand for transportation and basic services .
General Motors and its partner Shanghai Automotive Industry are exploring several solutions for tomorrow 's drivers .
Among the most promising is a new vehicle form called EN -V .

EN - V is a two - seat electric vehicle that was designed to alleviate concerns surrounding traffic congestion , parking availability , air quality and affordability for tomorrow ’s cities .
Three EN - V models were unveiled today in Shanghai .
They represent three different characteristics that emphasize the enjoyable nature of future transportation : Jiao ( Pride ) , Miao ( Magic ) and Xiao ( Laugh ) .
The concepts will be showcased from May 1 through October 31 at the SAIC - GM Pavilion at World Expo 2010 Shanghai .
Shanghai is expected to become one of the epicenters for the establishment of personal mobility solutions for the future .
“ EN - V reinvents the automobile by creating a new vehicle DNA through the convergence of electrification and connectivity .
It provides an ideal solution for urban mobility that enables future driving to be free from petroleum and emissions , free from congestion and accidents , and more fun and fashionable than ever before , ” said Kevin Wale , President and Managing Director of the GM China Group .
Breakthrough Technology
EN - V’s platform has evolved from the platform of the Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility ( P.U.M.A. ) prototype that was developed by Segway and debuted in April 2009 .
Segway has worked collaboratively with GM to develop and deliver multiple copies of the drivetrain platform that seamlessly connect to and power the various EN - Vs .
EN - V is propelled by electric motors in each of its two driving - mode wheels .
Dynamic stabilization technology empowers EN - V , giving it the unique ability to carry two passengers and light cargo in a footprint that ’s about a third of a traditional vehicle .
It can literally “ turn on a dime ” within its own operating envelope .
In addition , everything in EN - V is drive - by - wire , supporting its ability to operate autonomously or under manual control .
The motors not only provide power for acceleration , but also bring the vehicle to a stop .
Power for the motors is provided by lithium - ion batteries that produce zero emissions .
Recharging can occur from a conventional wall outlet using standard household power , allowing EN - V to travel at least 40 kilometers on a single charge .
EN - V can also improve the efficiency of the public electric infrastructure since the vehicle can communicate with the electric grid to determine the best time to recharge based on overall usage .
By combining the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) with vehicle - to - vehicle communications and distance - sensing technologies , the EN - V concept can be driven both manually and autonomously .
Its autonomous operating capability offers the promise of reducing traffic congestion by allowing EN - V to automatically select the fastest route based on real - time traffic information .
The concept also leverages wireless communications to enable a “ social network ” that can be used by drivers and occupants to communicate with friends or business associates while on the go .
This combination of sensing technology , wireless communication and GPS - based navigation establishes a technology foundation , pieces of which could migrate from the EN - V concept and potentially lead the way to future advanced vehicle safety systems .
The ability to communicate with other vehicles and with the infrastructure could dramatically reduce the number of vehicle accidents .
Using vehicle - based sensor and camera systems , EN - V can “ sense ” what ’s around it , allowing the vehicle to react quickly to obstacles or changes in driving conditions .
For example , if a pedestrian steps out in front of the vehicle , EN - V will decelerate to a slower and safer speed and stop sooner than today ’s vehicles .
GM has been a leader in developing autonomous vehicle technology , having worked alongside students and faculty at Carnegie Mellon University in the U.S. city of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
This collaboration created “ The Boss ” Chevrolet Tahoe , which brought autonomous vehicle operation to life in 2007 .
EN - V takes the lessons learned in “ The Boss ” and offers mobility to people who could not otherwise operate a vehicle .
“ The EN - V concept represents a major breakthrough in the research that GM has been doing to bring vehicle autonomy to life , ” said Alan Taub , Global Vice President of GM Research and Development .
“ The building blocks that enable the autonomous capabilities found on the EN - V concept such as lane departure warning , blind zone detection and adaptive cruise control are being used in some GM vehicles on the road today . ”
EN - V has been designed for the speed and range of today ’s urban drivers .
It weighs less than 500 kilograms and is about 1.5 meters in length .
By comparison , today ’s typical automobile weighs more than 1,500 kilograms and is three times as long .
In addition , today ’s automobiles require more than 10 square meters of parking space and are parked more than 90 percent of the time .
EN - V’s smaller size and greater maneuverability mean the same parking lot can accommodate five times as many EN - Vs as typical automobiles .
Smaller , Smarter Design
While EN - V leads the way in terms of efficiency and technology , it also sets a new benchmark for vehicle design .
For its debut , GM had design teams around the world provide their vision of what future mobility will look like .
Xiao ( Laugh ) was designed by GM Holden ’s design team in Australia , while the look of Jiao ( Pride ) was penned by designers at GM Europe and Miao ( Magic ) was designed at the General Motors Advanced Design Studio in the U.S. state of California .
Each EN - V has a unique design theme to showcase the flexibility of the propulsion platform .
The design gives each EN - V its own personality , with a unique opening , elegant interior and innovative color , lighting and seat technology .
Xiao offers a more lighthearted appeal , with its “ gumball blue ” paint and nautical - inspired design .
Miao takes most of its design cues from the consumer electronics industry , as evidenced by its sleek , masculine looks .
Designers also used Miao to display innovative lighting solutions , including extensive use of LED accent lighting .
With its clean lines and bright paintwork , Jiao takes its design influence from bullet trains and Chinese opera masks .
" EN - V incorporates significant technology and material innovation , which has given the design team a whole new world to explore , ” said Clay Dean , Director of Advanced Design for GM North America .
“ Because of the lightweight structures , materials and integrated controls , we created unique surface forms not traditionally found in automotive applications . ”
The body and canopy of EN - V are constructed from carbon fiber , custom - tinted Lexan and acrylic , materials that are more commonly used in race cars , military airplanes and spacecraft because of their strength and lightweight characteristics .
The ability to work with such innovative materials provided a learning opportunity for GM ’s design teams to study the feasibility of future traditional automotive applications .
EN - V’s compact size makes it ideal for use in densely populated cities thanks to its use of advanced safety and propulsion technologies .
But good things come in small packages , as witnessed by EN - V’s innovative interior design , which provides maximum visibility to the world outside .
A simple interface for activating Wi-Fi - based technologies keeps occupants connected to the outside world .
“ The future of how we move around in urban areas like Shanghai can combine the best of personal mobility and public transit .
There is a better solution and it is called EN - V .
It demonstrates that we have both the knowledge and the ability right now to create a way to move people that not only ensures a ‘ better city ’ but also offers people a ‘ better life , ’ ” said Taub .

Modern History Sourcebook :
Alexander H. Stephens ( 1812 -1883 ) :
Cornerstone Address , March 21 , 1861
Alexander H. Stephens ( 1812 - 1883 ) , although originally opposed to secession , was elected vice - president of the Confederacy .
After the war he returned to political service in Georgia and in the House of Representatives .
He was elected governor of Georgia in 1882 and died in office .
We are in the midst of one of the greatest epochs in our history .
The last ninety days will mark one of the most memorable eras in the history of modern civilization .
... we are passing through one of the greatest revolutions in the annals of the world - seven States have , within the last three months , thrown off an old Government and formed a new .
This revolution has been signally marked , up to this time , by the fact of its having been accomplished without the loss of a single drop of blood .
[ Applause . ]
This new Constitution , or form of government , constitutes the subject to which your attention will be partly invited .
In reference to it , I make this first general remark :
It amply secures all our ancient rights , franchises , and privileges .
All the great principles of Magna Chartal are retained in it .
No citizen is deprived of life , liberty , or property , but by the judgment of his peers , under the laws of the land .
The great principle of religious liberty , which was the honor and pride of the old Constitution , is still maintained and secured .
All the essentials of the old Constitution , which have endeared it to the hearts of the American people , have been preserved and perpetuated ....
So , taking the whole new Constitution , I have no hesitancy in giving it as my judgment , that it is decidedly better than the old .
[ Applause . ]
Allow me briefly to allude to some of these improvements .
The question of building up class interests , or fostering one branch of industry to the prejudice of another , under the exercise of the revenue power , which gave us so much trouble under the old Constitution , is put at rest forever under the new .
We allow the imposition of no duty with a view of giving advantage to one class of persons , in any trade or business , over those of another .
All , under our system , stand upon the same broad principles of perfect equality .
Honest labor and enterprise are left free and unrestricted in whatever pursuit they may be engaged in ....
But not to be tedious in enumerating the numerous changes for the better , allow me to allude to one other - though last , not least : the new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions - African slavery as it exists among us - the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization .
This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution .
Jefferson , in his forecast , had anticipated this , as the " rock upon which the old Union would split . "
He was right .
What was conjecture with him , is now a realized fact .
But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands , may be doubted .
The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution were , that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature ; that it was wrong in principle , socially , morally and politically .
It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with ; but the general opinion of the men of that day was , that , somehow or other , in the order of Providence , the institution would be evanescent and pass away .
This idea , though not incorporated in the Constitution , was the prevailing idea at the time .
The Constitution , it is true , secured every essential guarantee to the institution while it should last , and hence no argument can be justly used against the constitutional guarantees thus secured , because of the common sentiment of the day .
Those ideas , however , were fundamentally wrong .
They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races .
This was an error .
It was a sandy foundation , and the idea of a Government built upon it - when the " storm came and the wind blew , it fell . "
Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas ; its foundations are laid , its cornerstone rests , upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man ; that slavery , subordination to the superior race , is his natural and moral condition .
[ Applause . ]
This , our new Government , is the first , in the history of the world , based upon this great physical , philosophical , and moral truth .
This truth has been slow in the process of its development , like all other truths in the various departments of science .
It is so even amongst us .
Many who hear me , perhaps , can recollect well that this truth was not generally admitted , even within their day .
The errors of the past generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago .
Those at the North who still cling to these errors with a zeal above knowledge , we justly denominate fanatics .
All fanaticism springs from an aberration of the mind ; from a defect in reasoning .
It is a species of insanity .
One of the most striking characteristics of insanity , in many instances , is , forming correct conclusions from fancied or erroneous premises ; so with the anti-slavery fanatics : their conclusions are right if their premises are .
They assume that the negro is equal , and hence conclude that he is entitled to equal privileges and rights , with the white man ....
I recollect once of having heard a gentleman from one of the Northern States , of great power and ability , announce in the House of Representatives , with imposing effect , that we of the South would be compelled , ultimately , to yield upon this subject of slavery ; that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics , as it was in physics or mechanics .
That the principle would ultimately prevail .
That we , in maintaining slavery as it exists with us , were warring against a principle - a principle founded in nature , the principle of the equality of man .
The reply I made to him was , that upon his own grounds we should succeed , and that he and his associates in their crusade against our institutions would ultimately fail .
The truth announced , that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics as well as in physics and mechanics , I admitted , but told him it was he and those acting with him who were warring against a principle .
They were attempting to make things equal which the Creator had made unequal .
In the conflict thus far , success has been on our side , complete throughout the length and breadth of the Confederate States .
It is upon this , as I have stated , our social fabric is firmly planted ; and I cannot permit myself to doubt the ultimate success of a full recognition of this principle throughout the civilized and enlightened world .
As I have stated , the truth of this principle may be slow in development , as all truths are , and ever have been , in the various branches of science .
It was so with the principles announced by Galileo - it was so with Adam Smith and his principles of political economy .
It was so with Harvey , and his theory of the circulation of the blood .
It is stated that not a single one of the medical profession , living at the time of the announcement of the truths made by him , admitted them .
Now , they are universally acknowledged .
May we not therefore look with confidence to the ultimate universal acknowledgment of the truths upon which our system rests ?
It is the first Government ever instituted upon principles in strict conformity to nature , and the ordination of Providence , in furnishing the materials of human society .
Many Governments have been founded upon the principles of certain classes ; but the classes thus enslaved , were of the same race , and in violation of the laws of nature .
Our system commits no such violation of nature 's laws .
The negro by nature , or by the curse against Canaan , [ note : A reference to Genesis , 9:20 - 27 , which was used as a justification for slavery ] is fitted for that condition which he occupies in our system .
The architect , in the construction of buildings , lays the foundation with the proper material - the granite - then comes the brick or the marble .
The substratum of our society is made of the material fitted by nature for it , and by experience we know that it is the best , not only for the superior but for the inferior race , that it should be so .
It is , indeed , in conformity with the Creator .
It is not for us to inquire into the wisdom of His ordinances or to question them .
For
His own purposes
He has made one race to differ from another , as He has made " one star to differ from another in glory . "
The great objects of humanity are best attained , when conformed to his laws and degrees [ sic ] , in the formation of Governments as well as in all things else .
Our Confederacy is founded upon principles in strict conformity with these laws .
This stone which was rejected by the first builders " is become the chief stone of the corner " in our new edifice .

The Chemex coffee maker has hardly changed since first introduced by Peter Schlumbohm in 1941 .
It still has that familiar hourglass figure , that bentwood collar tied in place with a rawhide strap threaded through a wood bead .
The Chemex you can buy today is essentially the same object that was added to the collection of the Museum of Modern Art almost 70 years ago .
It could get by on looks alone .
The Chemex feels timeless and a little unfamiliar , as if it ’s from a slightly more rational and groovier future not so far away .
Often , a pedigree like this speaks to form more than function – plenty of gorgeous , impractical things are found at MoMA .
But the Chemex really works , a cult object within the world of coffee .
I know a few professionals who will start the day by flipping on an espresso machine that costs about the same as a BMW 5 - Series just off the lease and , while it warms up , make coffee for themselves on a Chemex that retails for less than $ 40 .
The appeal is simple .
It ’s for purists .
You ’re in control : the water temperature , the flow , the pacing are up to you .
It means the extraction is up to you .
It ’s as straightforward as a drip cone ( except for the filters ; more on that below ) , only it ’s more elegant and feels better in the hand .
Once you invest the six minutes it takes to learn how to use a Chemex , you ’ll run circles around that plug - in machine you have cluttering up your counter .
But first you have to choose which model you want .
There are three , though they ’re basically the same .
That is , the classic , glass handle and handblown all have similar forms and make coffee the same way .
The difference is in the glass .
The handblown ( pictured above ) is for fetishists .
The glass is from the German company Schott , and it has a satisfying heft .
( It ’s available from Chemex and at the MoMA Store . )
It also has the clean hourglass shape of the original ; the classic and glass handle both have a slight roundness to the bottom .
And if the handblown is more expensive , expense is relative .
The six - cup coffee maker , which serves one or two coffee drinkers ( according to Chemex ’s math , one cup equals five ounces , so the six - cup has a 30 - ounce capacity ) , costs around $ 78 .
Dan Neville / The New York Times
The glass in the classic and glass handle is manufactured in Taiwan .
( The glass handle is favored by coffee bars – there ’s no wood or leather , so it can go in the dishwasher . )
Both cost the same , around $ 36 for the six - cup .
Both are easy to find .
Originally , the glass for Chemex coffee makers was manufactured by Pyrex for Schlumbohm , who worked out of an office on Murray Street , in New York City .
Schlumbohm , who immigrated to the United States in 1935 , lived a vivid New York City life .
According to the article “ Dr. Chemex , ” which was published in Gourmet in 2008 ( the slide show is worth it ) , he drove a late - model Cadillac with a gold Chemex bolted to the driver ’s door and only hired women .
He had a penthouse on lower Fifth Avenue , where he kept German beer on ice and several pairs of binoculars handy so he could spy on his neighbors .
By my count , 21 Schlumbohm creations are in the collection of MoMA .
Most have to do with coffee or cocktails .
Schlumbohm died in 1962 .
Chemex moved to Pittsfield , Mass. , shortly after , and was bought by Patrick and Liz Grassy in 1981 .
Though the coffee maker never fell completely out of fashion , Liz Grassy , the company president since Patrick passed away in 1998 , told me that business began picking up in 2007 .
“ When sales started spiking , I could n’t really trace it to any one thing , ” she said over the phone .
“ It crept up on us .
The spring was always a very slow time , and now we ’re busy all year long . ”
Everything about Chemex feels family - owned , from the ’80s packaging on the filters to the AOL e-mail address on the Web site .
Each Chemex coffee maker is polished and tied by hand in Pittsfield .
Today the small company exports to a handful of countries that might seem anomalous to the casual reader but that others will recognize as a roll call of obsessive coffee cultures .
“ Now we ’re in England , ” Grassy said .
“ And recently the Czech Repubic .
Denmark , Finland , Germany , Norway , Sweden , New Zealand , Australia .
Russia , too .
We have a very large market in Japan .
And it ’s growing in Korea . ” ( France and Italy ?
They barely register . )
Which means exporting more filters to Japan and Korea .
Because a Chemex coffee maker calls for an unusually bulky , thick filter made with 36 - pound - weight paper .
According to many in the business , the filter can impart an unpleasant , almost cardboardy taste .
Most instruct you to rinse the filter thoroughly .
What that means is up to debate .
Some say 32 ounces of hot water are necessary , but I feel that ’s excessive .
Especially if you ’re using the oxidized white filters instead of the natural , unbleached filter squares introduced by Chemex in 1990 .
You ’d think the natural squares would be popular among the coffeescenti , a group that seems to like their produce organic and their transportation people - powered .
But almost every coffee figure I contacted fervently endorses oxidized filters .
Are they that different ?
I decided to test one against the other .
I picked up two coffees from Counter Culture Coffee — Michicha Natural Sundried from Sidama , Ethiopa , and Kiryama from Kayanza , Burundi , both five days out of the roaster — then grabbed some croissants at Patisserie Claude for ballast and cleared my morning .
I tested the filters against themselves , rinsing each with a different volume of water ; I tested the filters against each other ; I switched coffees , going from the fruity and faintly funky Michicha Natural Sundried to the cleaner and more citric Kiryama ; I switched back .
I made coffee in my French press as a control .
I ate croissants .
It was a full morning .
And I came to the conclusion that everybody else is right .
Kind of .
The oxidized filter is superior , though I think both can make beautiful coffee .
The unbleached squares had a distinct papery - ness that was more pronounced on the nose than on the palate , though it dissipated the more I rinsed the filter .
At 16 ounces of water , I give a slim advantage to the oxidized paper .
But at eight ounces of water , I feel the oxidized is clearly better .
And eight ounces of water is about right for rinsing .
Any less and the coffee suffers ; any more and it feels wasteful .
Besides , eight ounces of just - boiling water does a nice job of warming up the flask .
There are further Chemex discussions one might have : the asymmetrical triple - ply filter , the shape of the cone , the effect of ambient temperature .
I leave them to the comments , below .
If you want some Chemex coffee without the commitment , it ’s offered at a handful of New York coffee spots , including Ground Support in SoHo and Third Rail in the West Village .
It ’s also an off - menu item at Ninth Street Espresso , Alphabet City location only .
But first , do two minutes and 17 seconds ’ worth of homework and play the video below from Intelligentsia Coffee and Tea .
It ’s a smart , breezy introduction to a way of making coffee that ’s been at the cutting edge for almost 70 years .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has withdrawn from a nuclear security summit in Washington next week , fearing Muslim delegates will demand Israel give up its assumed atomic arsenal .

Netanyahu , who plans to send a deputy and two senior advisers to the April 12 - 13 conference instead , canceled “ after learning that some countries including Egypt and Turkey plan to say Israel must sign the NPT , ” an Israeli official said .
Arab diplomats countered that they suspected Netanyahu had canceled mainly to avoid further confrontation with U.S. President Barack Obama over Jewish settlements , and denied having any plans to press Israel on atomic policy .
Netanyahu ’s attendance at the 47 - country summit would have been unprecedented .
Israeli premiers long shunned such forums , hoping to dampen foreign scrutiny on their nuclear secrets .
By staying outside the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , Israel has not had to forswear nuclear arms nor admit international inspectors to its Dimona reactor , which experts believe has produced plutonium for between 80 and 200 warheads .
Aides said Netanyahu had agreed to attend the summit after being assured it would focus on efforts to secure fissile materials and shun language challenging Israel ’s nuclear “ ambiguity ” policy .
Such coordination between the allies has been clouded by rifts over stalled Israeli - Palestinian peace talks .
EVADING PALESTINIAN ISSUE ?
But two senior Arab officials accused Netanyahu of trying to evade questions on the Palestinian issue that has lately clouded Israel ’s ties with its largest U.S. ally .
“ We believe that Netanyahu withdrew from the summit because he did not want to face President Obama and is using Egypt and Turkey as an excuse , ” a senior Egyptian diplomat said .
Another senior Arab diplomat intimately involved in the negotiations said Arab states had no plan to “ politicize ” the venue and raise the Israeli issue there .
“ We are surprised that the Israeli prime minister would use this as a pretext for not attending , ” the second diplomat told Reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
But Turkey ’s Foreign Ministry said Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan would demand at the summit that Israel disarm as part of a nuclear - free Middle East .
The French newspaper Le Monde quoted Erdogan as saying in Paris this week that “ Israel is the principal threat to peace in the region today . ”
“ Israel has nuclear weapons but does n’t belong to the NPT .
Does that mean that those who do n’t sign the NPT are in a privileged position ? ”
The White House welcomed Netanyahu ’s stand - in , Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor , to the summit .
Meridor will be accompanied by Israeli National Security Adviser Uzi Arad and Shaul Horev , head of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission , aides said .
“ We obviously would like to have the prime minister but the deputy prime minister will be leading the delegation and it will be a robust Israeli delegation , ” U.S. National Security Adviser Jim Jones told reporters .
U.S. - Israeli contacts are “ ongoing and fine and continuous , ” he said .
Netanyahu had planned to drum up support at the summit for sanctions against its foe Iran , which the West suspects of seeking nuclear weapons despite denials from Tehran .
Neither Iran nor North Korea will be attending .
“ This conference is about nuclear terrorism , ” Netanyahu said on Wednesday .
“ And I ’m not concerned that anyone will think that Israel is a terrorist regime .
Everybody knows a terrorist and rogue regime when they see one , and believe me they see quite a few -- around Israel . ”
Israel says its nuclear secrecy helps ward off enemies while avoiding the kind of provocations that can trigger arms races .
The official reticence , and the tacit U.S. acceptance of Israel ’s nuclear monopoly , aggrieves Arab and Muslim powers .
India and Pakistan -- both scheduled to attend the nuclear security summit -- are outside the NPT , like Israel .
Unlike them , Israel has not openly tested or deployed atomic weapons .
Serious thinkers on the right have finally gotten around to a full and open debate on the epistemic closure problem that 's plaguing the conservative movement .
The issue , to put it in terms that even I can understand , because I did n't study philosophy much in college : has the conservative base gone mad ?
This matters to journalists , because I really do want to take Republicans seriously .
Mainstream conservative voices are embracing theories that are , to use Julian Sanchez 's phrase , " untethered " to the real world .
Can anyone deny that the most trenchant and effective criticism of President Obama today comes not from the right but from the left ?
Rachel Maddow 's grilling of administration economic officials .
Keith Olbermann 's hectoring of Democratic leaders on the public option .
Glenn Greenwald 's criticisms of Elena Kagan .
Ezra Klein and Jonathan Cohn 's keepin ' - them - honest perspectives on health care .
The civil libertarian left on detainees and Gitmo .
The Huffington Post on derivatives .
I want to find Republicans to take seriously , but it is hard .
Not because they do n't exist -- serious Republicans -- but because , as Sanchez and others seem to recognize , they are marginalized , even self - marginalizing , and the base itself seems to have developed a notion that bromides are equivalent to policy - thinking , and that therapy is a substitute for thinking .
It is absolutely a condition of the age of the triumph of conservative personality politics , where entertainers shouting slogans are taken seriously as political actors , and where the incentive structures exist to stomp on dissent and nuance , causing experimental voices to retrench and allowing a lot of people to pretend that the world around them is not changing .
The obsession with ACORN , Climategate , death panels , the militarization of rhetoric , Saul Alinsky , Chicago - style politics , that TAXPAYERS will fund the bailout of banks -- these are n't meaningful or interesting or even relevant things to focus on .
( The banks will fund their own bailouts . )
Conor Friedersdorf thinks the problem lies with the conservative movement 's major spokespeople -- its radio / net news nexus -- and the " overwhelming evidence that their very existence as popular entertainers hinges on an ability to persuade listeners that they are " ' worth taking seriously as political and intellectual actors . ' "
That is why the constant failures of these men to live up to their billing is so offensive , destructive , and ruinous to conservatives .
There are plenty of women , too , is all I 'll say .
I think this sensibility is pervasive throughout the smart media -- old and new .
I think it 's one reason why , say , Jake Tapper and other good reporters are very keen about direct fact - challenging -- why the media is reasserting itself as gatekeepers .
( CNN might want to think about branding themselves here , even at the risk -- well , the reality -- of calling out Republicans more . )
I think it 's because there 's so much misinformation out there -- most of it spread by the conservative echo - chamber .
With the advent of Fox News and the power of that echo - chamber , complaints about liberal media bias are quite irrelevant -- the reaction to it being like lupus 's reaction to the body , as Jon Stewart correctly noted .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

The life and times of the Bhuttos is seen afresh in a passionately partisan but well - constructed memoir .
William Dalrymple reviews it in context .
The Bhuttos ’ acrimonious family squabbles have long resembled one of the bloody succession disputes that habitually plagued South Asia during the time of the Great Mughals .
In the case of the Bhuttos , they date back to the moment when Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was arrested on July 5 , 1977 .
Unsure how to defend their father and his legacy , his children had reacted in different ways .
Benazir believed the struggle should be peaceful and political .
Her brothers initially tried the same approach , forming al - Nusrat , the Save Bhutto committee ; but after two futile years they decided in 1979 to turn to the armed struggle .
Murtaza was 23 and had just left Harvard where he got a top first , and where he was taught by , among others , Samuel Huntington .
Forbidden by his father from returning to Zia ’s Pakistan , he flew from the US first to London , then on to Beirut , where he and his younger brother Shahnawaz were adopted by Yasser Arafat .
Under his guidance they received the arms and training necessary to form the Pakistan Liberation Army , later renamed Al - Zulfiquar or The Sword .
Just before his daughter Fatima was born , Murtaza and his brother had found shelter in Kabul as guests of the pro-Soviet government .
There the boys had married a pair of Afghan sisters , Fauzia and Rehana Fasihudin , the beautiful daughters of a senior Afghan official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Fatima ’s mother was Fauzia .
For all its PLO training in camps in Syria , Afghanistan and Libya , Al - Zulfiquar achieved little except for two failed assassination attempts on Zia and the hijacking of a Pakistan International Airways flight in 1981 .
This was diverted from Karachi to Kabul and secured the release of some 55 political prisoners ; but it also resulted in the death of an innocent passenger , a young army officer .
Zia used the hijacking as a means of cracking down on the Pakistan Peoples Party , and got the two boys placed on the Federal Investigation Agency ’s most - wanted list .
Benazir was forced to distance herself from her two brothers even though they subsequently denied sanctioning the hijack , and claimed only to have acted as negotiators once the plane landed in Kabul .
While much about the details of the hijacking remains mysterious , Murtaza was posthumously acquitted of hijacking in 2003 .
I first encountered the family in 1994 when , as a young foreign correspondent on assignment for the Sunday Times , I was sent to Pakistan to write a long magazine piece on the Bhutto dynasty .
I met Benazir in the giddy pseudo - Mexican Prime Minister ’s House that she had built in the middle of Islamabad .
It was the beginning of Benazir ’s second term as Prime Minister , and she was at her most imperial .
She both walked and talked in a deliberately measured and regal manner , and frequently used the royal “ we ” .
During my interview , she took a full three minutes to float down the hundred yards of lawns separating the Prime Minister ’s House from the chairs where I had been told to wait for her .
There followed an interlude when Benazir found the sun was not shining in quite the way she wanted it to : “ The sun is in the wrong direction , ” she announced .
Her hair was arranged in a sort of baroque beehive topped by white gauze dupatta like one of those Roman princesses in Caligula or Rome .
A couple of days later in Karachi , I met Benazir ’s brother Murtaza in very different circumstances .
Murtaza was on trial in Karachi for his alleged terrorist offences .
A one hundred rupee bribe got me through the police cordon , and I soon found Murtaza with his mother — Begum Bhutto — in an annexe beside the courtroom .
Murtaza looked strikingly like his father , Zulfiquar Ali Bhutto .
He was handsome , very tall — well over six feet — with a deep voice and , like his father , exuded an air of self - confidence , bonhomie and charisma .
He invited me to sit down : “ Benazir does n’t care what the local press says about her , ” he said , “ but she ’s very sensitive to what her friends in London and New York get to read about her . ”
“ Has your sister got in touch with you since you returned to Pakistan ? ” I asked .
“ No . Nothing .
Not one note . ”
“ Did you expect her to intervene and get you off the hook ? ” I asked .
“ What kind of reception did you hope she would lay on for you when you returned from Damascus ? ”
“ I did n’t want any favours , ” replied Murtaza .
“ I just wanted her to let justice take its course , and for her not to interfere in the legal process .
As it is , she has instructed the prosecution to use delaying tactics to keep me in confinement as long as possible .
This trial has been going on for three months now and they still have n’t finished examining the first witness .
She ’s become paranoid and is convinced I ’m trying to topple her . ”
Murtaza went on to describe an incident the previous week when the police had opened fire on Begum Bhutto as she left her house to visit her husband ’s grave .
When the Begum ordered the gates of the compound to be opened and made ready to set off , the police opened fire .
One person was killed immediately and two others succumbed to their injuries after the police refused to let the ambulances through .
That night as three family retainers lay bleeding to death , 15 kilometres away in her new farmhouse , Benazir celebrated her father ’s birthday with singing and dancing :
“ After three deaths , she and her husband danced ! ” said the Begum now near to tears .
“ They must have known the police were firing at Al - Murtaza .
Would all this have happened if she did n’t order it ?
But the worst crime was that they refused to let the ambulances through .
If only they had let the ambulances through those two boys would be alive now : those two boys who used to love Benazir , who used to run in front of her car . ”
The Begum was weeping now .
“ I kept ringing Benazir saying ‘ for God sake stop the siege ’ , but her people just repeated : ‘ Madam is not available ’ .
She would n’t even take my call .
One call from her walkie - talkie would have got the wounded through .
Even General Zia ... ”
The sentence trailed away .
“ What ’s that saying in England ? ” asked the Begum : “ Power corrupts , more power corrupts even more .
Is that it ? ”
Two years later , to no one ’s great surprise , Murtaza was himself shot dead in similar and equally suspicious circumstances .
Murtaza had been campaigning with his bodyguards in a remote suburb of Karachi .
As his convoy neared his home at 70 Clifton , the street lights were abruptly turned off .
It was September 20 , 1996 , and Murtaza ’s decision to take on Benazir had put him into direct conflict not only with his sister , but also with her husband Asif Ali Zardari .
Murtaza had an animus against Zardari , who he believed was not just a nakedly and riotously corrupt polo- playing playboy , but had pushed Benazir to abandon the PPP ’s once - radical agenda — fighting for social justice .
Few believed the rivalry was likely to end peacefully .
Both men had reputations for being trigger - happy .
Murtaza ’s bodyguards were notoriously rough , and Murtaza was alleged to have sentenced to death several former associates , including his future biographer , Raja Anwar , author of an unflattering portrait , The Terrorist Prince .
Zardari ’s reputation was worse still .
So insistent had the rumours become that Zardari had ordered the killing of Murtaza at 3 pm that afternoon , that Murtaza had given a press conference saying he had learnt that an assassination attempt on him was being planned , and he named some of the police officers he claimed were involved in the plot .
Several of the officers were among those now waiting , guns cocked , outside his house .
According to witnesses , when the leading car drew up at the roadblock , there was a single shot from the police , followed by two more shots , one of which hit the foremost of Murtaza ’s armed bodyguards .
Murtaza immediately got out of his car and urged his men to hold their fire .
As he stood there with his hands raised above his head , urging calm , the police opened fire on the whole party with automatic weapons .
The firing went on for nearly 10 minutes .
Two hundred yards down the road , inside the compound of 70 Clifton , the house where Benazir Bhutto had spent her childhood , was Murtaza ’s wife Ghinwa , his daughter , the 12 - year - old Fatima , and the couple ’s young son Zulfikar , then aged six .
When the first shot rang out , Fatima was in Zulfikar ’s bedroom , helping put him to bed .
She immediately ran with him into his windowless dressing room , and threw him onto the floor , protecting him by covering his body with her own .
After 45 minutes , Fatima called the Prime Minister ’s House and asked to speak to her aunt .
Zardari took her call :
Fatima : “ I wish to speak to my aunt , please . ”
Zardari : “ It ’s not possible . ”
Fatima : “ Why ? ” [ At this point , Fatima says , she heard loud , stagy - sounding wailing . ]
Zardari : “ She ’s hysterical , ca n’t you hear ? ” Fatima : “ Why ? ” Zardari : “ Do n’t you know ?
Your father ’s been shot . ”
Fatima and Ghinwa immediately left the house and demanded to be taken to see Murtaza .
By now there were no bodies in the street .
It had all been swept and cleaned up : there was no blood , no glass , or indeed any sign of any violence at all .
Each of the seven wounded had been taken to a different location , though none was taken to emergency units of any the different Karachi hospitals .
The street was completely empty .
“ They had taken my father to the Mideast , a dispensary , ” says Fatima .
“ It was n’t an emergency facility and had no facilities for treating a wounded man .
We climbed the stairs , and there was my father lying hooked up to a drip .
He was covered in blood and unconscious .
You could see he had been shot several times .
One of those shots had blown away part of his face .
I kissed him and moved aside .
He never recovered consciousness .
We lost him just after midnight . ”
The two bereaved women went straight to a police station to register a report , but the police refused to take it down .
Benazir Bhutto was then the Prime Minister , and one might have expected the assassins would have faced the most extreme measures of the state for killing the Prime Minister ’s brother .
Instead , it was the witnesses and survivors who were arrested .
They were kept incommunicado and intimidated .
Two died soon afterwards in police custody .
“ There were never any criminal proceedings , ” says Fatima .
“ Benazir claimed in the West to be the queen of democracy , but at that time there were so many like us who had lost family to premeditated police killings .
We were just one among thousands . ”
Benazir always protested her innocence in the death of Murtaza , and claimed that the killing was an attempt to frame her by the army ’s intelligence services : “ Kill a Bhutto to get a Bhutto , ” as she used to put it .
But Murtaza was , after all , clearly a direct threat to Benazir ’s future , and she gained the most from the murder .
For this reason her complicity was widely suspected well beyond the immediate family : when Benazir and Zardari attempted to attend Murtaza ’s funeral , their car was stoned by villagers who believed them responsible .
The judiciary took the same view , and the tribunal set up to investigate the killing concluded that Benazir ’s administration was “ probably complicit ” in the assassination .
Six weeks later , when Benazir fell from power , partly as a result of public outrage at the killings , Zardari was charged with Murtaza ’s murder .
Fourteen years on , however , the situation is rather different .
Benazir is dead , assassinated , maybe by the military , but equally possibly by some splinter group of the Taliban .
Fatima is now a strikingly beautiful 28 - year - old , fresh from a university education in New York and London .
She has a razor - sharp mind and a forceful , determined personality .
Meanwhile , the man Fatima Bhutto holds responsible for her father ’s death is not only out of prison , but President of the country .
The bravery of writing a memoir taking on such a man is self - evident , but Fatima seems remarkably calm about the dangers she has taken on .
As for the book itself , Songs of Blood and Sword is moving , witty and well - written .
It is also passionately partisan : this is not , and does not pretend to be , an objective account of Murtaza Bhutto so much as a love letter from a grieving daughter and an act of literary vengeance and account - settling by a niece who believed her aunt had her father murdered .
Future historians will decide whether Murtaza really does deserve to be vindicated for the hijacking in Kabul and will weigh up whether or not Murtaza , who even Fatima describes as “ impulsive ” and “ honourable and foolish ” , would have made a better leader than his deeply flawed sister ; or indeed whether the equally inconsistent Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto deserves the adulation heaped on him by his granddaughter .
But where the book is unquestionably important is the reminder it gives the world as to Benazir ’s flaws .
Since her death , Benazir has come to be regarded , especially in the US , as something of a martyr for democracy .
Yet the brutality of Benazir ’s untimely end should not blind anyone to her as astonishingly weak record as a politician .
Benazir was no Aung San Suu Kyi , and it is misleading as well as simplistic to depict her as having died for freedom ; in reality , Benazir ’s instincts were not so much democratic as highly autocratic .
Within her own party , she declared herself the lifetime president of the PPP , and refused to let her brother Murtaza challenge her for its leadership ; his death was an extreme version of the fate of many who opposed her .
Benazir also colluded in wider human rights abuses and extra-judicial killings , and during her tenure government death squads murdered hundreds of her opponents .
Amnesty International accused her government of having one of the world 's worst records of custodial deaths , abductions , killings and torture .
Far from reforming herself in exile , Benazir kept a studied distance from the pioneering lawyers ’ movement which led the civil protests against President Musharraf ’s unconstitutional attempts to manipulate the Supreme Court .
She also sidelined those in her party who did support the lawyers .
Later she said nothing to stop President Musharraf ordering the US - brokered “ rendition ” of her rival Nawaz Sharif to Saudi Arabia , so removing from the election her most formidable democratic opponent .
Many of her supporters regarded her deal with Musharraf as a betrayal of all that her party stood for .
Her final act in her will was to hand the inappropriately named Pakistan People ’s Party over to her teenage son as if it were her personal family fiefdom .
Worse still , Benazir was a notably inept administrator .
During her first 20 - month - long premiership , she failed to pass a single piece of major legislation , and during her two periods in power she did almost nothing to help the liberal causes she espoused so enthusiastically to the Western media .
Instead , it was under her watch that Pakistan ’s secret service , the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , helped install the Taliban in Pakistan , and she did nothing to rein in the agency ’s disastrous policy of training up Islamist jihadis from the country ’s madrasas to do the ISI ’s dirty work in Kashmir and Afghanistan .
As a young correspondent covering the conflict in Kashmir in the late 1980s and early 1990s , I saw how during her premiership , Pakistan sidelined the Kashmiris ’ own secular resistance movement , the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front , and instead gave aid and training to the brutal Islamist outfits it created and controlled , such as Lashkar - e - Toiba and Harkat ul - Mujahedin .
Benazir ’s administration , in other words , helped train the very assassins who are most likely to have shot her .
Benazir was , above all , a feudal landowner , whose family owned great tracts of Sindh , and with the sense of entitlement this produced .
Democracy has never thrived in Pakistan in part because landowning remains the base from which politicians emerge .
In this sense , Pakistani democracy in Pakistan is really a form of “ elective feudalism ” : the Bhuttos ’ feudal friends and allies were nominated for seats by Benazir , and these landowners made sure their peasants voted them in .
Behind Pakistan ’s swings between military government and democracy lies a surprising continuity of elitist interests : to some extent , Pakistan ’s industrial , military and landowning classes are all interrelated , and they look after each other .
They do not , however , do much to look after the poor .
The government education system barely functions in Pakistan , and for the poor , justice is almost impossible to come by .
According to the political scientist Ayesha Siddiqa , “ Both the military and the political parties have all failed to create an environment where the poor can get what they need from the state .
So the poor have begun to look for alternatives .
In the long term , these flaws in the system will create more room for the fundamentalists . ”
Many right - wing commentators on the Islamic world tend to see political Islam as an anti-liberal and irrational form of “ Islamo - fascism ” .
Yet much of the success of the Islamists in countries such as Pakistan comes from the Islamists ’ ability to portray themselves as champions of social justice , fighting people like Benazir Bhutto from the corrupt Westernised elite that rules most of the Muslim world from Karachi to Riyadh , Ramallah and Algiers .
Benazir ’s reputation for massive corruption was gold dust to these Islamic revolutionaries , just as the excesses of the Shah were to their counterparts in Iran 30 years earlier : during her government , Pakistan was declared one of the three most corrupt countries in the world , and Bhutto and her husband , Asif Zardari — widely known as “ Mr 10 % ” — faced allegations of plundering the country ; charges were filed in Pakistan , Spain , Switzerland , the United Kingdom and the United States to investigate their various bank accounts , and they stood accused of jointly looting no less than $ 1.4 billion from the state .
When I interviewed Abdul Rashid Ghazi in the Islamabad Red Mosque shortly before his death in Musharraf ’s July attack on the complex , he returned time and again to these issues : “ We want our rulers to be honest people , ” he repeated .
“ But now the rulers are living a life of luxury while thousands of innocent children have empty stomachs and can’t even get basic necessities . ”
This is the principal reason for the rise of the Islamists in Pakistan , and why so many people support them : they are the only force capable of taking on the country ’s landowners and their military cousins .
Benazir Bhutto may have been a brave , gutsy , secular and liberal woman .
But sadness at the demise of this courageous fighter should not mask the fact that as a corrupt feudal who did nothing for the poor , she was a central part of Pakistan ’s problems , rather than any solution to them .
Songs of Blood and Sword is a timely and forceful reminder of this .
Certainly , readers of Fatima ’s book have ahead of them a wonderfully close - focussed and well - constructed memoir from the heart of the most violent and Borgia - like of the South Asian dynasties to savour .
They also , most likely , have further instalments to come .
During a recent interview , I asked Fatima whether she would consider entering politics herself : “ I am political , ” she replied , “ but there are many ways to be political .
I do n’t think that becoming an MP is necessarily the best way to influence people .
For the time being , I want to be a writer .
But who knows ?
If in the future there was a way I could serve my country , one that did not involve becoming yet another part of dynastic birthright politics , maybe I could envisage putting my name forward . ”
Watch this space .

DETROIT 
The 911 call came at 6:35 p.m. on Aug. 28 from a car that was speeding out of control on Highway 125 near San Diego .
The caller , a male voice , was panic - stricken : “ We ’re in a Lexus ... we ’re going north on 125 and our accelerator is stuck ... we ’re in trouble ... there ’s no brakes ... we ’re approaching the intersection ... hold on ... hold on and pray ... pray ... ”
The call ended with the sound of a crash .
The Lexus ES 350 sedan , made by Toyota , had hit a sport utility vehicle , careened through a fence , rolled over and burst into flames .
All four people inside were killed : the driver , Mark Saylor , an off - duty California Highway Patrol officer , and his wife , daughter and brother - in - law .
It was the tragedy that forced Toyota , which had received more than 2,000 complaints of unintended acceleration , to step up its own inquiry , after going through multiple government investigations since 2002 .
If you only read one story about British radio this year , make sure it 's this one .
Grant Goddard has surveyed the ruins of the landscape and come up with some pithy conclusions .
It 's an even - handed piece , but spares nothing in vanity of a sector - public and private - that thought technology ( through DAB ) could substitute for innovative programming .
His reflections are prompted by a lack of growth in listenership of digital - only stations .
For its part , the declining commercial sector has done anything except make great radio :
Commercial radio has talked the digital talk for years about striving to make DAB a successful platform , vaguely promising new digital radio ‘ content ’ that it has still not delivered .
Instead , it has spent the last few years cutting costs , consolidating , lobbying the government , complaining about the BBC , closing its digital stations and contracting out its DAB capacity to marginalised broadcasters ( religious , ethnic , government - funded and listener - supported stations ) that will never attract mainstream audiences to the platform ( and whose listening is not even measured in the RAJAR audience survey ) .
He notes that we 've seen commercial stations such as as OneWord , TheJazz , Core , Capital Life and Virgin Radio Groove disappear , to be replaced by , um ... Traffic Radio , Premier Christian Radio and British Forces Broadcasting Service .
While DAB listening has grown , it 's thanks to traditional stations like Classic FM and Radio 2 , not new unique DAB only content .
The BBC has been the beneficiary of the introduction of DAB , increasing its share against commercial .
But the Beeb 's digital - only stations are under review .
The Asian Network costs £ 12.1 m a year , but the national peak audience is only 31,000 adults - lower than when it launched seven years ago - 11 times the cost of Radio 1 .
It might be cheaper to email each listener the five hours of shows they enjoy , writes Grant .
A more serious problem for the BBC is a mirror image of commercial radio's creative negligence .
The BBC has simply lost the knack of creating popular new stations : the ability " to successfully execute the launch of genuinely creative , innovative radio channels that connect with listeners ( GLR , the ‘ new ’ Radio 1 , the original Radio 5 ) " has deserted it .
That 's a long term problem .
Anyone who 's been within earshot of a BBC radio exec in the last ten years know they 're obsessed with platforms , platforms and more platforms ... not the stuff that goes out over them .
Unless it 's swearing .
The most popular DAB - only station is one that was given the death sentence , then saved by its listeners and fans : Planet Rock .
That 's a sign people want distinctive programming .
DAB is n't going away , but a future government may eventually find a more profitable use for the valuable spectrum , looking to 4G to deliver niche content .
Perhaps .
We all know IP is n't quite there as a multicast technology , even though the IP v6 capability has been built into routers for years , and LTE will be IPv6 .
And streaming IP brings its own high distribution costs .
DAB has always had the potential to offer inventive and useful extras - some of which were described by Tony Moretta of DRDB here - and these are quite unique to the medium .
But we 're still waiting for many of these .
Yet the cost to the public of chucking out the FM sets is £ 3.6bn , according to UTV chief executive Scott Taunton - and the cost of running dual FM / DAB operations is astronomical .
Radio is in the unhappy position where all the digital solutions cost money , and there 's no quick fix .
And whether DAB or LTE emerges as the most popular choice of a ' multiplatform ' future , FM will still provide dirt cheap devices and easy access to the airwaves - a win for broadcaster and listener .
Who 'd want to get rid of that ? ®

You 're probably wondering about Taunton 's maths - as we were .
He reckons 180 million analogue radios need to be replaced at £ 20 a pop .
The identity of a woman jointly accused with a man of raping lone , young women in central Hamilton can be revealed .
Name suppression for Tamahere woman Maureen Samantha Iti lapsed when she appeared in the Hamilton District Court yesterday .
Iti , 32 , is charged with Jason Lloyd Jones , 38 , of three counts of rape and one of unlawful sexual connection .
Jones also faces a charge of doing an indecent act in a public place .
Police allege Jones and Iti lured young women into their vehicle before plying them with alcohol and raping them .
Iti yesterday entered no pleas and was remanded on bail to reappear next month for a post - committal conference .
Iti appeared relaxed as she sat in the public gallery , laughing and chatting to supporters , as Jones appeared in court a short time later .
Jones asked to address the court , saying he was dismayed his name suppression was lifted and expressed concern for his children 's safety .
Jones said he felt like a " condemned man " despite police not providing him with disclosure , and announced he had hired prominent Hamilton lawyer Roger Laybourn .
Iti shouted from the public gallery : " I love you " and " he 's not guilty " .
Jones was led from the courtroom but later returned accompanied by Mr Laybourn who asked Community Magistrate Susan Hovell for a further remand , saying he needed time to study police disclosure and advise his client .
Ms Hovell remanded Jones in custody to reappear later this month .
A court order prevents the Waikato Times publishing any details or photographs which could identify Jones ' face , physical build , ethnicity or features such as hair colour .
GOOD .is brings us the story of an LA resident so disturbed by a freeway 's poor signage that he built his own sign and secretly affixed it .
It stayed that way for almost ten years .
Until now .
— Ed .

The freeway sign arrived in Los Angeles five days after I did .
It appeared out of nowhere , a valiant attempt by one of its citizens to help drivers make sense of their city , just as I appeared in a silver Subaru , valiantly attempting to make sense of what were apparently not called " highways " but " freeways . "
Not that you should ever refer to them that way , I was constantly reminded .
" Just say the number , " a friend sighed — the route number , which I kept forgetting should always be prefaced with the word " the , " a colloquialism my plain - speaking Midwestern brain could n't register .
Nor could I comprehend being strapped into a car for hours a day , the sheer inhumanity of a Sigalert , or a sweeping six - lane interchange as vast as the Pacific Ocean .
I remember , for example , the first time I tried to head north on " the 5 " from downtown , when I missed the exit completely , sailing obliviously towards Pasadena .
The second time I found myself frantically crossing dashed line after dashed line , like Frogger , in a last - minute attempt to relocate from one end of the 110 to the other .
Even once I reached the exit , I was still in danger :
The 5's on - ramp twirls violently to the left like an unfurling banana peel , and it sneaks up far too fast for anyone operating an automobile , especially a non-local .
I sped uncontrollably up the 5's incline , panting all the way to Burbank .

An artist named Richard Ankrom had the same experience , and so he did what any fed - up Los Angeles driver would do :
He created a simple directional tool to help drivers prepare for the 5's poorly marked hairpin exit .
He designed and sewed a Caltrans uniform , cut the shield - like " 5 " shape as well as a " NORTH " from sheet metal , and affixed reflectors to match the existing system .
He even gave the signage a nice dusting of L.A. smog sheen so it would n't look glaringly new .
On August 5 , 2001 , in broad daylight , he hoisted a ladder onto Gantry 21300 , walked onto a catwalk above one of the city 's busiest arteries , and installed his own freeway sign .
The collage of six time - lapse photos at the bottom of this post shows how he did it .
( There are more on Ankrom 's site . )
Maybe Angelenos really are too busy text messaging against the steering wheel and applying mascara with the help of the visor mirror to pay attention to the view out their windshields .
And perhaps we do have a bit of a bureaucracy problem with our state government .
Either way , no one noticed it for nine months .

Ankrom eventually leaked the story to the Downtown News , stunning millions of duped commuters and effectively coming clean to Caltrans .
But Caltrans knew Ankrom was right .
For eight years , the sign remained .
Christopher Knight reviewed it for the Los Angeles Times as if it was a public art piece .
A video and an exhibition were created of Ankrom 's work , and he was featured on every news outlet you could imagine , from local to international .
And every time I saw the hand - applied NORTH 5 , I felt like the ultimate L.A. insider for knowing the story behind it .
To me , it was Los Angeles 's Single Greatest Secret .
It became my single favorite L.A. thing to share with people .
Most people who lived here had never heard the tale , so like a cultural ambassador , I felt it was my duty to tell them .
I worked it into a review I wrote for Print Magazine about a book on effective wayfinding systems .
When giving people directions I would point it out like a landmark .
( " Be sure to look at the sign as you 're heading north on the 110 ... no , no do n't go north on the 5 , look at the sign . " )
Anyone lucky enough to be in a car with me while heading northbound on the 110 would get the full narrative , which I had timed perfectly to a grand reveal as we sailed under the glittery , counterfeit characters .

Last night , I stumbled upon a story in the LA Weekly that said the sign had been removed on the day after Thanksgiving .
Not only had Ankrom not been notified that his signed , dated handiwork was being removed — he actually found out on a local blog — his sign , his art , had been sent to an aluminum recycler .
He spent eight hours trying to find out where it went , only to find these stacks of freeway signage , pressed into neat cubes and readied for their voyage to China .
But there is a somewhat happy ending that should give Ankrom some sense of satisfaction .
His work was n't really gone : Caltrans had " accepted " Ankrom 's suggestion , as it were .
When they replaced the sign during scheduled maintenance , they did it with a shiny new sign that did , indeed , include his edit .
Advertisement
Ankrom called his piece " guerrilla public service , " and that it was :
His action quickly and seamlessly alleviated millions of headaches for those who were able to make their transition to the 5 somewhat less hairy .
( Can you imagine how long it would have taken to petition Caltrans the old - fashioned way ? )
He very likely saved a few lives .
But I see Ankrom 's work as more of a " public service performance . "
It 's an act of faith that 's present in some of my favorite urban interventions of today — the premeditated social choreography of Improv Everywhere , the commuter - appreciation art of Jason Eppink , the toy horses tethered to curbs that make up Portland 's Ponies .
These are celebrated not for their specific improvements of local policy , but for those little moments of unbridled , unexpected delight that they deliver to the residents of a city , who are undercaffeinated and undercompensated , head - down and heartbroken , propelling themselves towards another dreary day of work .
Alerting those people to an incredible experience they 're simultaneously sharing with millions of other people a year ?
And to reward those who paused long enough to pay attention ?
Now that 's public service .
Advertisement
I do n't remember how I originally found out about the sign .
But the reason I had n't noticed the erasure of Ankrom 's work is because my life changed so much in the eight years since it was installed .
I 'm no longer in possession of a car , no longer making daily six - lane negotiations with angry SUVs , no longer commuting twelve miles each way to a job I do n't love .
I think I had to be that person — trapped and terrified — to get the swell of pride I felt every time I headed home on the 110 .
As I came around that bend in the freeway , the shadows of skyscrapers growing long across the ocean of asphalt , I 'd always grow giddy .
I 'd fidget in my seat , peering into the cars around me , wondering who else was in on L.A. 's Single Greatest Secret .
I would smile as I sat , paralyzed by my fellow Angelenos , in crushing rush - hour traffic .

How would you describe your mental state at this precise moment ?
Alert , razor - sharp and crystal - clear ?
Or a tad foggy perhaps , struggling to remember the name of that ... actor who played ...
Now what 's his damn name ?...
Just watched the DVD last week !
Sadly , as advancing years take their toll , many of us fall into the latter camp – unable to remember names and dates that we once plucked from the past with ease , and labouring over the easy Sudoku or the quick crossword .
And age is not our only enemy : chronic stress , persistent overwork , a hectic and energy - draining lifestyle , the attention - span obliterating nature of quick - fire communications such as texting and Twitter – all conspire to make us feel frazzled and dull - witted .
This is merely irritating if it affects our performance at the office , or our ability to help with our kids ' maths homework , but in the darker recesses of our ( poorly functioning ) brain we fear that it 's just step one on the slippery slope towards dementia .
Over the last few years , a vast and hugely lucrative industry has sprung up , in part through an exploitation of this fear .
We are promised that ' brain - training ' , with a little help from a £ 100 games console , will not only improve our memory and cognitive functioning now , but stave off dreaded , age - related conditions like Alzheimer 's disease .
In the vanguard of this brain - training revolution are Nintendo's " edutainment " programmes such as Big Brain Academy and Brain Training , which , the gaming giant claims , can actually boost blood flow to the brain and thus improve " practical intelligence " – and which are aimed at sharpening the minds of children as much as those of forgetful adults .
Nintendo also suggests that these products can make users " two to three times better in tests of memory " and that older people can keep their minds younger by using the console .
On Nintendo's website , Japanese neuroscientist Ryuta Kawashima , who developed Brain Training , claims that " the more you use your brain in a challenging way , the better it can work " .
And with more than 90 m of the Nintendo DS units sold worldwide , his message – endorsed by celebrities such as Nicole Kidman and Cheryl Cole – is clearly working .
Just one problem : a growing band of critics claim that this message is just another example of pseudo - scientific ad - speak .
Last January , a study of 67 10 - year - old children found no evidence to support Nintendo 's claims .
" The Nintendo DS is a technological jewel .
As a game , it 's fine , " said Alain Lieury , a professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Rennes , Brittany , who conducted the survey .
" But it would be charlatanism to claim that it 's a scientific test . "
Professor Lieury believes that grappling with that homework , reading , playing Scrabble or Sudoku , or watching documentaries instead of soap operas , matches or even beats the console as a brain - training strategy .
In his study , he split the children into four groups .
The first two groups did a seven - week memory course on a Nintendo DS , the third did puzzles with pencils and paper , and the fourth went to school as normal .
Before and after , the children were set various tasks .
The DS - using children showed no significant improvement in memory tests .
They did do 19 per cent better in mathematics , but so did the pencil - and - paper group .
In a further blow to the claims of devices like the DS , a panel of experts – including eminent neuroscientists – last year stated that there was no evidence whatsoever that they helped improve memory or stave off conditions like dementia .
These experts , employed by consumer group Which ? , concluded that much of the evidence was " weak " and that other activities , such as playing standard computer games , could have the same effect .
Crucially , none of the brain - training claims has been supported by peer - reviewed research published in a recognised scientific journal .
" If people enjoy using these games , then they should continue to do so – that 's a no- brainer , " said Martyn Hocking , editor of Which ?
magazine .
" But if people are under the illusion that these devices are scientifically proven to keep their minds in shape , they need to think again . "
So is brain - training just a big fat con , or are there concrete , scientifically proven strategies to improve mental function ?
According to the authors of a new book , The Rough Guide to Brain Training , there are – as long as you do n't expect miracles .
The book is co-written by Tom Stafford , a lecturer in psychology at the University of Sheffield , and puzzle maestro Dr Gareth Moore – whose Cambridge PhD in artificial intelligence suggests his brain is working reasonably well .
It features 100 workouts , each containing old favourites like Sudoku as well as new puzzles .
Regular tests break up the workouts and help you track your progress .
The book 's credibility is enhanced by accompanying articles on brain - related matters , busting some oft - repeated myths and explaining what works and why .
" There are two incontestable facts with brain - training , " says Stafford .
" First , humans are amazing at getting better at anything they practice .
We 're the learning species – if you want to learn pi to a hundred digits in a weekend , or to memorise a deck of cards or master Ancient Greek , you can .
Second , it 's very hard to show that when you practice one thing you get better at another .
The problem with all this brain - training stuff is that you might get better at doing puzzles , or remembering number sequences , but no one has found the Holy Grail of brain - training – ' far transfer ' , where you practice one thing and get better at an array of very different things . "
This , according to the sceptics , is the fatal flaw with expensive brain - training gizmos : if you practice doing anything often enough , you will get better at it .
This capacity to learn is what makes the human brain so miraculous .
But if you gorge on , say crossword puzzles , although you will inevitably become more adept at completing them , there 's no evidence to show that this will make you better at memorising historical dates , or doing long division .
There 's also good evidence to show that the most effective brain - enhancing tools have a physical , social and emotional component .
" One study in an old people 's home found that the best tactics to stave off dementia were reading books , playing board games and musical instruments and taking dance lessons .
Three of those are physical as well as mental , " says Stafford .
This throws up another key point : the best exercise to keep your brain in tip - top condition is in fact physical , not mental .
Kawashima 's claim that a healthy supply of well - oxygenated blood to the brain is crucial for its function is accurate .
When starved of oxygen , brain cells , quite literally , die .
This is what happens when we suffer a stroke : the blood supply to the brain is stopped and neurons perish because they lack oxygen , resulting in paralysis or aphasia ( loss of speech ) .
" I freely admit that a book like this is not the best way to train your brain , " says Stafford .
" The best way to do that is through exercise – there 's far better evidence to show that that will help your brain to function well than anything from the brain - training literature . "
Sergio Della Salla , Professor of Human Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh , adds that our current obsession with quick fixes desires a simple , " magic bullet " solution like the electronic games .
In fact , the answer is a multi- faceted one .

All in the mind : Myths about the brain
Omega - 3 boosts brainpower
New research funded by the Medical Research Council and the Food Standards Agency has found that infant intelligence is more likely to be shaped by family environment than by the amount of omega 3 fatty acids , or DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) , they consume in breast milk or fortified formula .
Factors in the home , such as the mother 's intelligence and what mental stimulation children receive , are far more important .
Drinking water makes you sharp
Although it 's true that inadequate hydration has a detrimental effect on brain function , the oft - quoted idea that we need eight glasses of water a day to improve mental performance is a myth .
Our bodies ensure that we are sufficiently hydrated by making us thirsty when we need to drink – and we get much of the water we need from food .
We only use 10 per cent of our brains
Based on SkyTruth ’s latest satellite observations today of the size of the oil slick and published data on the thickness of floating oil at sea that produces a visible sheen ( 1 micron , or 0.000001 meters ) we think the official estimate of the spill rate from the damaged well has been significantly too low .
Immediately after the Deepwater Horizon rig sank on April 22 , the Coast Guard estimated that the well was leaking 336,000 gallons ( 8,000 barrels ) of oil per day .
But for the past few days they ’ve estimated the rate at 42,000 gallons ( 1,000 barrels ) per day .
We think it ’s actually a lot closer to their original estimate .
We have a visible oil slick covering 2,233 square miles ( 5,783 km2 ) .
Given a minimum thickness of 1 micron ( see chart below ) , that is 5,783 cubic meters of oil , or 1,527,706 gallons ( 36,374 barrels ) .
The blowout happened almost 7 days ago on April 20 .
That ’s at least 5,000 barrels of oil per day – assuming none of it was consumed during the two - day fire that raged before the rig sank on April 22 , and none has been collected by the response crews that have been working diligently for days .
Our calculation also assumes the entire slick is a sheen barely thick enough to be visible .
Yet the images we ’ve seen so far , especially the ALI image taken on April 21 , suggest a strong spectral response from the oil slick , and that in turn suggests a much thicker slick .
Today a BP exec claimed that 3 % of the slick was 100 microns thick , and the remaining 97 % is only one or two molecules thick .
We ’re skeptical : 1 micron is the published , generally accepted lower limit for a visible sheen at sea :
Real - time Detection of Oil Slick Thickness Patterns with a Portable
Multispectral Sensor .
CONCAWE chart of thickness and visible appearance of floating oil at sea .
From a Minerals Management Service report
So if 3 % of today ’s slick ( 173.5 km2 ) is 100 microns thick , and the remainder ( 5,609.5 km2 ) is 1 micron thick that ’s a total of 22,960 cubic meters of oil : 6,065,390 gallons .
That ’s right : more than 6 million gallons spilled into the Gulf of Mexico so far .
This is what Dr. Ian MacDonald has to say .
Ian is one of the world ’s foremost experts in remote sensing of oil slicks , and has spent his career exploring the Gulf of Mexico :
By George Friedman STRATFOR argued March 13 , 2008 , that Mexico was nearing the status of a failed state .
A failed state is one in which the central government has lost control over significant areas of the country and the state is unable to function .
In revisiting this issue , it seems to us that the Mexican government has lost control of the northern tier of Mexico to drug - smuggling organizations , which have significantly greater power in that region than government forces .
Moreover , the ability of the central government to assert its will against these organizations has weakened to the point that decisions made by the state against the cartels are not being implemented or are being implemented in a way that would guarantee failure .
Despite these facts , it is not clear to STRATFOR that Mexico is becoming a failed state .
Instead , it appears the Mexican state has accommodated itself to the situation .
Rather than failing , it has developed strategies designed both to ride out the storm and to maximize the benefits of that storm for Mexico .
First , while the Mexican government has lost control over matters having to do with drugs and with the borderlands of the United States , Mexico City 's control over other regions — and over areas other than drug enforcement — has not collapsed ( though its lack of control over drugs could well extend to other areas eventually ) .
Second , while drugs reshape Mexican institutions dramatically , they also , paradoxically , stabilize Mexico .
We need to examine these crosscurrents to understand the status of Mexico .
Mexico's Core Problem
Let 's begin by understanding the core problem .
The United States consumes vast amounts of narcotics , which , while illegal there , make their way in abundance .
Narcotics derive from low - cost agricultural products that become consumable with minimal processing .
With its long , shared border with the United States , Mexico has become a major grower , processor and exporter of narcotics .
Because the drugs are illegal and thus outside normal market processes , their price is determined by their illegality rather than by the cost of production .
This means extraordinary profits can be made by moving narcotics from the Mexican side of the border to markets on the other side .
Whoever controls the supply chain from the fields to the processing facilities and , above all , across the border , will make enormous amounts of money .
Various Mexican organizations — labeled cartels , although they do not truly function as such , since real cartels involve at least a degree of cooperation among producers , not open warfare — vie for this business .
These are competing businesses , each with its own competing supply chain .
Typically , competition among businesses involves lowering prices and increasing quality .
This would produce small , incremental shifts in profits on the whole while dramatically reducing prices .
An increased market share would compensate for lower prices .
Similarly , lawsuits are the normal solution to unfair competition .
But neither is the case with regard to illegal goods .
The surest way to increase smuggling profits is not through market mechanisms but by taking over competitors ' supply chains .
Given the profit margins involved , persons wanting to control drug supply chains would be irrational to buy , since the lower - cost solution would be to take control of these supply chains by force .
Thus , each smuggling organization has an attached paramilitary organization designed to protect its own supply chain and to seize its competitors ' supply chains .
The result is ongoing warfare between competing organizations .
Given the amount of money being made in delivering their product to American cities , these paramilitary organizations are well - armed , well - led and well - motivated .
Membership in such paramilitary groups offers impoverished young men extraordinary opportunities for making money , far greater than would be available to them in legitimate activities .
The raging war in Mexico derives logically from the existence of markets for narcotics in the United States ; the low cost of the materials and processes required to produce these products ; and the extraordinarily favorable economics of moving narcotics across the border .
This warfare is concentrated on the Mexican side of the border .
But from the Mexican point of view , this warfare does not fundamentally threaten Mexico 's interests .
A Struggle Far From the Mexican Heartland
The heartland of Mexico is to the south , far from the country 's northern tier .
The north is largely a sparsely populated highland desert region seen from Mexico City as an alien borderland intertwined with the United States as much as it is part of Mexico .
Accordingly , the war raging there does n't represent a direct threat to the survival of the Mexican regime .
( click here to enlarge image ) Indeed , what the wars are being fought over in some ways benefits Mexico .
The amount of money pouring into Mexico annually is stunning .
It is estimated to be about $ 35 billion to $ 40 billion each year .
The massive profit margins involved make these sums even more significant .
Assume that the manufacturing sector produces revenues of $ 40 billion a year through exports .
Assuming a generous 10 percent profit margin , actual profits would be $ 4 billion a year .
In the case of narcotics , however , profit margins are conservatively estimated to stand at around 80 percent .
The net from $ 40 billion would be $ 32 billion ; to produce equivalent income in manufacturing , exports would have to total $ 320 billion .
In estimating the impact of drug money on Mexico , it must therefore be borne in mind that drugs cannot be compared to any conventional export .
The drug trade 's tremendously high profit margins mean its total impact on Mexico vastly outstrips even the estimated total sales , even if the margins shifted substantially .
On the whole , Mexico is a tremendous beneficiary of the drug trade .
Even if some of the profits are invested overseas , the pool of remaining money flowing into Mexico creates tremendous liquidity in the Mexican economy at a time of global recession .
It is difficult to trace where the drug money is going , which follows from its illegality .
Certainly , drug dealers would want their money in a jurisdiction where it could not be easily seized even if tracked .
U.S. asset seizure laws for drug trafficking make the United States an unlikely haven .
Though money clearly flows out of Mexico , the ability of the smugglers to influence the behavior of the Mexican government by investing some of it makes Mexico a likely destination for a substantial portion of such funds .
The money does not , however , flow back into the hands of the gunmen shooting it out on the border ; even their bosses could n't manage funds of that magnitude .
And while money can be — and often is — baled up and hidden , the value of money is in its use .
As with illegal money everywhere , the goal is to wash it and invest it in legitimate enterprises where it can produce more money .
That means it has to enter the economy through legitimate institutions — banks and other financial entities — and then be redeployed into the economy .
This is no different from the American Mafia 's practice during and after Prohibition .
The Drug War and Mexican National Interests From Mexico 's point of view , interrupting the flow of drugs to the United States is not clearly in the national interest or in that of the economic elite .
Observers often dwell on the warfare between smuggling organizations in the northern borderland but rarely on the flow of American money into Mexico .
Certainly , that money could corrupt the Mexican state , but it also behaves as money does .
It is accumulated and invested , where it generates wealth and jobs .
For the Mexican government to become willing to shut off this flow of money , the violence would have to become far more geographically widespread .
And given the difficulty of ending the traffic anyway — and that many in the state security and military apparatus benefit from it — an obvious conclusion can be drawn :
Namely , it is difficult to foresee scenarios in which the Mexican government could or would stop the drug trade .
Instead , Mexico will accept both the pain and the benefits of the drug trade .
Mexico 's policy is consistent :
It makes every effort to appear to be stopping the drug trade so that it will not be accused of supporting it .
The government does not object to disrupting one or more of the smuggling groups , so long as the aggregate inflow of cash does not materially decline .
It demonstrates to the United States efforts ( albeit inadequate ) to tackle the trade , while pointing out very real problems with its military and security apparatus and with its officials in Mexico City .
It simultaneously points to the United States as the cause of the problem , given Washington 's failure to control demand or to reduce prices by legalization .
And if massive amounts of money pour into Mexico as a result of this U.S. failure , Mexico is not going to refuse it .
The problem with the Mexican military or police is not lack of training or equipment .
It is not a lack of leadership .
These may be problems , but they are only problems if they interfere with implementing Mexican national policy .
The problem is that these forces are personally unmotivated to take the risks needed to be effective because they benefit more from being ineffective .
This is n't incompetence but a rational national policy .
Moreover , Mexico has deep historic grievances toward the United States dating back to the Mexican - American War .
These have been exacerbated by U.S. immigration policy that the Mexicans see both as insulting and as a threat to their policy of exporting surplus labor north .
There is thus no desire to solve the Americans ' problem .
Certainly , there are individuals in the Mexican government who wish to stop the smuggling and the inflow of billions of dollars .
They will try .
But they will not succeed , as too much is at stake .
One must ignore public statements and earnest private assurances and instead observe the facts on the ground to understand what 's really going on .
The U.S. Strategic Problem
And this leaves the United States with a strategic problem .
There is some talk in Mexico City and Washington of the Americans becoming involved in suppression of the smuggling within Mexico ( even though the cartels , to use that strange name , make certain not to engage in significant violence north of the border and mask it when they do to reduce U.S. pressure on Mexico ) .
This is certainly something the Mexicans would be attracted to .
But it is unclear that the Americans would be any more successful than the Mexicans .
What is clear is that any U.S. intervention would turn Mexican drug traffickers into patriots fighting yet another Yankee incursion .
Recall that Pershing never caught Pancho Villa , but he did help turn Villa into a national hero in Mexico .
The United States has a number of choices .
It could accept the status quo .
It could figure out how to reduce drug demand in the United States while keeping drugs illegal .
It could legalize drugs , thereby driving their price down and ending the motivation for smuggling .
And it could move into Mexico in a bid to impose its will against a government , banking system and police and military force that benefit from the drug trade .
The United States does not know how to reduce demand for drugs .
The United States is not prepared to legalize drugs .
This means the choice lies between the status quo and a complex and uncertain ( to say the least ) intervention .
We suspect the United States will attempt some limited variety of the latter , while in effect following the current strategy and living with the problem .
Ultimately , Mexico is a failed state only if you accept the idea that its goal is to crush the smugglers .
If , on the other hand , one accepts the idea that all of Mexican society benefits from the inflow of billions of American dollars ( even though it also pays a price ) , then the Mexican state has not failed — it is following a rational strategy to turn a national problem into a national benefit .
“ Trying to calculate the waste of government by analyzing total expenditures is a poor method .
A large fraction of government spending consists of transfers . ”
C ritics of government intervention have pointed out the waste of resources associated with various programs and regulations .
Yet , even most fans of the free market would be surprised to see how much richer the average American would be if the government restricted its activities to protecting citizens from domestic criminals and foreign armies .
In this article , I sketch out some of government ’s big - ticket wealth - destroying activities to come up with a rough estimate of how much poorer Big Government makes the average citizen .
The bottom line is that getting rid of just these activities would increase the average American ’s real income by 18 percent in a very short period .
Methodology
One method for generating a ballpark estimate is to calculate the fraction of the economy absorbed by government at all levels .
In the 4th quarter of 2009 , federal , state , and local government spending accounted for 35 percent of U.S. GDP .
Now , suppose that an extreme critic of the government thought that , on net , it provides no services — meaning that whatever good things the government does ( locking up murderers , teaching most kids to read , etc. ) is counterbalanced by the bad things it does ( locking up speculators who promote market efficiency , teaching most kids that the New Deal ended the Great Depression , etc ) .
If that critic is right , then getting rid of the government altogether would return that 35 percent of GDP to the taxpayers , immediately increasing the real income of the average American by about 54 percent .
However , trying to calculate the waste of government by analyzing total expenditures is a poor method .
A large fraction of government spending consists of transfers , which do not destroy the actual resources being redistributed .
For example , retired individuals may have railed against “ Big Government ” during their peak earning years , but now many of them would lose out if Social Security and Medicare spending were cut , even if the rollback went hand - in - hand with massive tax cuts .
Similarly , many poor residents in urban neighborhoods might not gain from the “ services ” of local vice squads and the CIA , but they might gain from free ( to them ) public schooling for their children and income - assistance programs .
Because transfer payments create obvious winners and losers , this article does not examine overall government budgets .
Rather , it looks at specific government functions and comes up with quick estimates for how much money is wasted , relative to the private sector providing the same services .
We also consider some of the major categories of “ deadweight loss ” associated with government policies .
Consumption and Investment Spending at Various Government Levels
To avoid the problem of simple transfers , we can focus on government purchases of goods and services .
But because government typically has higher expenses to produce an equivalent output , we ca n’t treat government purchases as equivalent to , say , a private corporation ’s investment spending .
To provide some empirical mooring , we can look at input versus output in K - 12 schooling .
Andrew Coulson recently estimated that the Washington , D.C. public schools spend an average of $ 24,606 per pupil annually .
In contrast , D.C. ’s private schools — which include some of the most elite institutions in the country — spend only $ 14,534 .
Despite their lower funding , private - school students consistently outperform their public - school peers .
However , much of the disparity disappears once differences in student background are taken into account .
Assume for the sake of argument that public and private schools do a comparable job educating equivalent students .
Superficially , these results suggest that even for a local task , subject to immediate feedback from voters ( and parents ) , the government consumes almost 70 percent more resources to produce the same output as the private sector .
Yet , because Coulson ’s figures include some federal funds and because the effect we are measuring might be exaggerated near D.C. , let us conservatively say that for standard services that could be handled just as well by the private sector , local governments spend 50 percent more than the private sector to do an equivalent job .
We have reason to believe that this estimate should be much higher for state and , especially , federal activities .
For one thing , Charles Tiebout suggests that as political jurisdictions grow larger , the political class becomes less responsive to the voters and caters more to special interests .
Surely a compilation of wasteful federal uses of tax dollars would dwarf a compilation of state or local abuses .
Besides weaker accountability to the voters , higher levels of government tend to waste more resources per dollar of expenditure because of the mix of programs offered by the federal versus state and local levels .
When local officials waste money , they might , say , subsidize a convention center or sports stadium and use downtown real estate in a suboptimal way .
But when federal officials waste money , they might spend millions on antitrust prosecutions of large firms that have kept prices low and , thus , made competition too intense for their competitors .
There is no analog in such cases for private provision because it ’s not a “ service ” at all .
It ’s true that local governments provide dubious “ services ” just as federal politicians do , but we assume they constitute a smaller proportion of local activities , leading us to choose a lower estimate of the overall waste per dollar of purchases .
With these considerations in mind , let ’s assume that local governments use 50 percent more resources than necessary to fund their legitimate services , that state governments use 75 percent more , and that the federal government spends twice as much ( 100 percent ) on its legitimate services , compared to a private counterpart .
What this implies , using simple algebra , is that 33 percent of local government payroll , 43 percent of state government payroll , and fully 50 percent of federal civilian payroll is wasteful .
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis , annualized federal nondefense purchases were $ 377 billion in the 4th quarter of 2009 .
State and local governments spent $ 1,786 billion purchasing goods and services during 2009 .
If we apply the 50 - percent discount to the federal figure , and a ( weighted ) 35 - percent figure to the state and local expenditures , we come up with an estimated ( $ 377bn × 50 % + $ 1786 bn × 35 % ) = $ 813 billion in wasted resources .
Subsidized Schooling
Beyond the explicit expenditures , government involvement in schooling has another large cost :
By keeping millions of students cooped up in classrooms who would otherwise be working for pay , mandatory attendance laws and subsidies for post - secondary schooling suppress economic activity .
Of course , there is a potential tradeoff in which attendance laws and student aid reduce potential output from young workers as they stay longer in school , but lead to higher output after they have graduated with better skills .
However , it is not obvious that the massive government support for schooling actually yields a more - educated population , particularly as the education pertains to on - the - job skills .
Indeed , a leading economic model interprets college and advanced degrees as signals to the employer of the aptitude of a particular student .
Many businesses will pay a high starting salary to a 4.0 history major from Harvard , not because they need someone with a thorough knowledge of medieval Europe , but because the type of student who achieves this will probably succeed in many job environments .
To the extent that this “ signaling game ” characterizes formal education , schooling is like an arms race between students .
If they could collectively agree to spend less time in school — with far fewer people going on to grad school and with fewer people taking it for granted that “ everybody should go to college ” — then employers ’ expectations would adjust .
Students , on average , would n’t be hurt in their career prospects and would gain by having the option to start their careers earlier .
Things would be better for the students who remained in school , too .
As a former college professor , I would have much preferred preparing to teach , say , the top half of my students in each class , to having to cater to the ones who always asked , “ Will this be on the exam ? ”
Let us arbitrarily assume that without government encouragement , enrollment in college and graduate programs would fall by half , and that this shift would yield a citizenry ( on average ) just as educated .
With these assumptions , the increase in output from half of the current enrolled students entering the workforce would be a pure gain .
In 1999 , there were 12.6 million Americans enrolled in undergraduate degree - granting institutions .
If we assume that half of these young people would get jobs earning $ 20,000 on average , were it not for government support , we can add another $ 126 billion to our tally .
If we assume that half of the 1.8 million enrolled in graduate programs could get jobs earning $ 35,000 on average , we can add another $ 32 billion .
Military Spending
One of the biggest components of federal spending is the military budget .
Including supplemental funding for the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , total military spending for Fiscal Year 2010 will probably be some $ 720 billion .
It is difficult to evaluate this aspect of government activity because there is no obvious private - sector analog to the operations of the Department of Defense .
However , consider this :
Despite the hundreds of billions spent over the years to influence foreign events and establish a worldwide intelligence network , 19 men with boxcutters were somehow able to bring down the World Trade Center and attack the Pentagon on September 11 , 2001 .
For the sake of argument , let ’s suppose that a “ Fortress America ” defense , in which the United States did not try to police the world but , instead , concentrated a smaller force at home to deter explicit attacks , could provide the same general level of security .
And we ’ll arbitrarily pick $ 150 billion as the annual expense of maintaining this deterrent .
Note that even by spending this smaller amount , the U.S. would still lead the world in military spending , and many of the other contenders are explicit U.S. allies .
With the U.S. already starting with its stockpile of advanced weaponry and trained forces , and still spending more than any other country in the world on its military , it is difficult to see what power would cross the oceans and credibly threaten an invasion , especially considering how many private citizens would rush to join militias and the National Guard in the months before such a large - scale attack .
If , indeed , a “ Fortress America ” strategy costing $ 150 billion annually could provide American citizens with comparable protection from foreign attack , this means that the military currently uses some $ 570 billion per year that could be returned to the private sector .
Tax Compliance and Disincentives
Beyond the actual income extracted from the private sector , the tax codes make the country poorer because of explicit compliance costs ( hiring accountants , keeping separate books , etc. ) and because of the disincentives to produce additional income .
In a December 2005 study , the Tax Foundation projected that 2009 tax compliance costs — focusing just on the burden of households and businesses filling out tax forms — would be $ 347 billion .
In light of the massive income tax cuts that we discuss below , we ’ll chalk $ 300 billion up to the tax compliance costs of Big Government .
In addition to the resources wasted on tax compliance , we also must consider output not produced in the first place , because of incentives .
Mankiw and Weinzierl ( 2004 ) concluded that 17 percent of a tax cut on labor income and 50 percent of a cut on capital taxes are eventually recouped through higher economic growth .
Because most taxes fall on labor rather than capital , we will assume that any tax cut will yield new income ( through greater economic activity ) equal to 25 percent ( a factor weighed toward 17 percent rather than 50 percent ) of the size of the tax cut .
Total federal tax receipts in 2009 were $ 2.1 trillion .
If the federal government restricted itself to providing defense ( “ Fortress America ” ) , making sure the president had a sharp wardrobe , and a few other bare - bones functions , it would have spent only , say , $ 200 billion in 2009 , allowing for an immediate tax cut of $ 1.9 trillion .
State and local governments collected $ 1.9 trillion in receipts in 2008 .
If we assume half of current state and local spending could be eliminated by a return to the traditional role of government , that would allow an additional tax cut of almost $ 1 trillion .
Scaling back Big Government would therefore allow an immediate tax cut of $ 2.9 trillion .
With our weighted 25 percent factor , that means the economy would be an additional ( $ 2.9tn × 25 % ) = $ 725 billion richer , if businesses and individuals did n’t have to forfeit such a large share of their output to the government .
Category Amount Civilian Purchases Waste , All Levels $ 813 billion Undergraduate Over - Enrollment $ 126 billion Graduate Over- Enrollment $ 32 billion Excess Military Spending $ 570 billion Federal Income Tax Compliance $ 300 billion Deadweight Tax Loss , All Levels $ 725 billion Total Wasted Resources : $ 2.6 trillion
Conclusion Government artificially restricts economic activity in hundreds of ways .
These include the restrictions the FDA imposes on new drugs and “ alternative ” medicine ; the hundreds of thousands of drug offenders ( who would otherwise be productive citizens ) living off the taxpayer ; the tremendous macroeconomic uncertainty caused by poor Federal Reserve policies over the decades ; and , finally , the moral hazard engendered by the trillions of dollars in direct and indirect bailouts of the financial sector since 2008 .
This article has considered none of these additional sources of loss .
Doing so would only add to the already high estimate of the gain from reducing the size of government .
Despite this article ’s narrow focus , it has , nonetheless , documented a $ 2.6 trillion increase in annual economic output if the government were to restrict itself to its classic role of protecting the country ’s residents from criminals and invaders .
Such an increase would have meant an 18 percent increase in GDP in 2009 .
It also works out to an average of about $ 8,500 per man , woman , and child in America , per year , starting almost immediately after a hypothetical rollback of Big Government .
The only long - term component in our calculations was the disincentive effect from high tax rates .
The other categories would yield their savings almost immediately , just as soon as businesses could adjust to the new influx of workers ( previous students ) and the influx of cash in consumers ’ pockets .

A UK government ban on the export of " magic wand " bomb detectors to Iraq and Afghanistan becomes effective on 27 January , as the BBC reveals further shocking evidence of the shortcomings of these devices .
The restriction is being imposed following a BBC Newsnight investigation which showed that the supposed detectors were incapable of detecting explosives or anything else .
There are concerns that they have failed to stop bomb attacks which have killed hundreds of people .
The British Foreign Office has told the BBC that they will now be urgently warning all governments who may have bought devices such as the ADE651 and GT200 that they are " wholly ineffective " at detecting bombs and explosives .
The ADE651 is made by a company from Somerset called ATSC .
The director of the company , Jim McCormick , was arrested at the beginning of this month on suspicion of misrepresentation .
The GT200 is sold by Global Technical in Kent .
Global concerns Despite advice from the British embassy in Baghdad , the ADE651 is still in use on checkpoints in Iraq , while an investigation ordered by the Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki continues .
I was horrified .
They had spent a vast sum of money on a modern equivalent of a hazel twig divining rod
Stephen Fry
In the past three days , 58 people have died there in bombings .
In Pakistan , which is not covered by Britain 's export ban , rows have broken out after newspapers highlighted the continued use of similar devices at Jinnah International Airport in Islamabad .
Another country not covered by the UK ban is Thailand , where MPs are calling for the withdrawal of 500 GT200 detectors after a number of deaths were blamed on their failure to find explosives .
Thailand 's Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban has tried to reassure MPs that the GT200 is not like the ADE651 : " We use a different brand , " he said .
The devices are also in use in Mexico , Kenya , Lebanon , Jordan and China .
Analysis
The British government has banned the export to Iraq and Afghanistan of all such devices that claim to be powered by static electricity - like the ADE651 and GT200 .
The UK Department for Business ( BIS ) said " tests have shown " that they are " not suitable for bomb detection " .

Newsnight obtained a GT200 that was sold as a bomb detector and discovered that it was almost identical to the ADE651 .
It consists of an aerial on a handle connected to a black box into which you are supposed to insert substance detection cards .
The head of Global Technical , Gary Bolton , told Newsnight : " There are no electronic parts required in the handle . "
Explosives expert Sidney Alford took apart the " black box " of the GT200 , which is supposed to receive signals from the detection cards .
He was surprised at what he found .
" Speaking as a professional , I would say that is an empty plastic case , " he told us .
Mr Alford also took apart a " detection card " and found there was nothing in it other than card and paper .
Gary Bolton from Global Technical told the BBC that the lack of electronic parts " does not mean it does not operate to the specification " .
Alternative uses Mark Cawardine and Stephen Fry pictured with a black rhino in Kenya
The devices have also surfaced in Kenya where comedian and broadcaster Stephen Fry saw them in use by rangers when he was filming for the BBC series , Last Chance to See .
Mr Fry told the BBC that he thought it was " cynical , cruel and monstrous " that rangers - who were trying to track down poachers - had been told they could detect ivory at vast distances .
" I was horrified .
They had spent a vast sum of money on a modern equivalent of a hazel twig divining rod .
There was no possibility that such a thing could work . "

The Chicago Cubs confirmed on Wednesday what fantasy owners have known for a while -- Carlos Zambrano is n't a very good starting pitcher anymore .
But it 's hard to believe that the best way to use him is as an eighth - inning setup man .
Sure the Cubs ' relievers have been brutal -- ranking next - to - last in the National League in bullpen ERA ( 6.15 ) -- but yanking Big Z out of the rotation to have him set up Carlos Marmol is a questionable move that just about kills whatever fantasy value Zambrano had left .
The Cubs were going to have to make some sort of decision about their rotation when left - hander Ted Lilly returns from the disabled list this weekend .
Zambrano ends up being the odd man out , while Carlos Silva ( 0.69 ERA in two starts , but 6.81 ERA over the past two years ) and Tom Gorzelanny ( 1.93 ERA in two starts , but 6.32 ERA over the past two years ) will continue to get the ball every fifth day .
" This makes all the sense in the world and I appreciate Carlos doing this , " manager Lou Piniella said of the decision .
Ummm , yeah .
In his loss to the Mets Tuesday night , Zambrano pitched a solid game -- allowing two earned runs and six hits in six innings .
He struck out nine and walked three .
And if you take out his disastrous start on Opening Day , he 's 1 - 1 with a 4.00 ERA and 12.5 K/9 rate .
Just two seasons ago , Zambrano threw a no-hitter and led the Cubs to the playoffs .
Now he 's headed to the bullpen to be a setup man at age 28 .
( Yes , he 's only 28 .
I had to look it up in two places just to be sure . )
Who knows what the future holds for him in that role .
He has the stuff to be effective an inning at a time , but if roster spots are precious in your league it 's time to cut Big Z loose .
On the other hand , if you can stash him away on your bench for a while , it 's only a matter of time before Silva or Gorzelanny implode and Zambrano returns to the rotation .
What you 'll get after that is anyone 's guess .
After an unusually long wait , Apple has finally released updated models of its MacBook Pro line of notebooks .
The 15 " and 17 " models offer the latest Core i5 and i7 processors , though the 13 " model still uses a Core 2 Duo processor .
But new processors are n't the only improvement ;
Apple has also seen fit to increase the base RAM configuration to 4GB on all models and bump the hard drive and SSD options .
And Apple claims battery life has been improved , with some models now going as long as 10 hours without plugging in .
The new 13 " MacBook Pro offers 2.4GHz or 2.66 GHz Core 2 Duo processors and 4GB of DDR3 RAM .
The lower - end model gets a 250 GB 5400 RPM SATA drive , while the higher - end option comes with a 320 GB 5400 RPM drive .
A 500 GB 5400 RPM hard drive is a build - to - order option , as are 128GB , 256GB , and 512 GB solid state drives .
Both models come with NVIDIA GeForce 320 M integrated graphics , an update to the 9400 M that previous MacBook Pros used .
Combined with a 63.5 WHr lithium polymer sealed battery , Apple claims these new 13 " MacBook Pro models can run up to 10 hours on a single charge .
The 15 " MacBook Pro is available in three variations , with 2.4GHz or 2.53 GHz Core i5 processors or a 2.66 GHz Core i7 processor .
A 320 GB or 500 GB 5400 RPM hard drive is standard , as is 4GB of DDR3 RAM .
BTO drive options include a 500 GB 7200 RPM drive for higher performance or SSD of up to 512GB .
A 15.4 " 1440 x 900 pixel display is standard , though a new " high - resolution " 1680 x 1050 display is a BTO option .
Both displays also have an antiglare glass option .
The 17 " MacBook Pro comes standard with a 2.53 GHz Core i5 processor , a 500 GB 5400 RPM hard drive , and a 1920 x 1200 pixel glossy display .
The 2.66GHz Core i7 processor is a BTO option , as are the aforementioned drive options and antiglare glass .
All of the 15 " and 17 " MacBook Pros combine the on-package Intel HD integrated graphics with an NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M GPU .
Apple is using something similar to NVIDIA 's Optimus technology ( as expected ) , which switches between the integrated Intel graphics and the discrete NVIDIA GPU on the fly .
However , the technical details differ from NVIDIA 's solution .
Combined with high - capacity , non-replaceable lithium polymer batteries , Apple says these MacBook Pros can get from eight to nine hours of outlet - free runtime .
All other features of these updated models — ports , 8x SuperDrive , 802.11n WiFi , Gigabit Ethernet , SD or ExpressCard slot , unibody aluminum enclosure — remain unchanged .
Prices are still largely the same as well , with 13 " models starting at $ 1,199 , 15 " models at $ 1,799 , and the 17 " behemoth at $ 2,299 .
The MacBook Pro line was last updated in June of last year , when the 13 " unibody model officially gained " Pro " status , the 13 " and 15 " models got an SD card slot , and all models gained a seven hour , sealed battery .
Intel launched a 32nm process shrink of its Nehalem architecture processors , codenamed Arrandale , at CES in January .
The chipmaker " mistakenly " spilled the beans on Macbooks using a Core i5 variant then , but rumors suggested that constrained supply prevented Apple from launching updates earlier this year .
Apple 's entry - level notebook , the white MacBook , was last updated in October when it gained a unibody version of its polycarbonate shell .
That model may be updated in the next few months , possibly with a low - end Core i3 processor .
UPDATE : Apple contacted us to clarify that the technology that it is using to switch between the integrated Intel graphics on Core i5 and i7 - based MacBook Pros is not NVIDIA 's own Optimus .
Instead it is an Apple - developed system that works similarly in concept , but differs significantly in implementation .
We will definitely publish more on those details as the information comes in .
In a bold online video , the environmental group Greenpeace cleverly links candy - giant Nestle to oil palm - related deforestation and the deaths of orangutans .
Clearly angered over the video , Nestle struck back by having it banned from YouTube and replaced with this statement : “ This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Société des Produits Nestlé S.A . ”
However Nestle ’s reaction to the video only spread it far and wide ( see the ad below ) : social network sites like Twitter , Facebook , and Reddit were all flooded with the ad as well as rising criticism against Nestle — one of the world ’s largest food producers — including calls for boycotts .
Greenpeace began sustained action against Nestle on Wednesday when they released new evidence that linked Nestle to illegal deforestation in Indonesia through one of its palm oil suppliers , Sinar Mas .
Oil palm plantation in Sumatra , Indonesia .
While palm oil plantations may look ‘ green ’ studies have shown a drastic reduction in biodiversity and large carbon emissions due to deforestation .
“ While many companies such as Unilever and Kraft are making efforts to disassociate themselves from the worst practices of the palm oil industry , Nestlé has done diddly squat , ” the organization wrote in a blog .
The report spurred Nestle to cancel its contract with Sinar Mas — months after Sinar Mas was shown to be involved in illegal deforestation — but the corporation continues to purchase oil palm from Cargill , which is supplied in part by Sinar Mas .
For its part , Cargill says it is investigating Greenpeace ’s allegations and if Sinar Mas is found to be committing illegal deforestation they will drop them .
Nestle has said in a statement : “ we share the deep concern about the serious environmental threat to rain forests and peat fields in South East Asia caused by the planting of palm oil plantations . ”
To prove this to its consumers , the company says it is committed to purchasing only sustainable palm oil by 2015 .
However , critics contend this is too late .
“ Not only are these areas key habitat for orangutans , but also crucial carbon stores ; the destruction of these areas is a major cause of Indonesia ’s rocketing carbon emissions , ” Greenpeace said in a statement . .
Indonesia is the world ’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to large - scale deforestation across the nation .
Between 1990 and 2005 , Indonesia lost more than 28 million hectares of forest , including 21.7 hectares of virgin forest .
The country has declined from 82 percent forest cover in the 1960s to less than half today .

Deforestation is also the leading cause of biodiversity loss in the region .
While orangutans have come to represent the movement against deforestation by oil palm plantations in the same way that polar bears symbolize climate change , Indonesia is home to tens of thousands of other species , many of which are threatened by deforestation .
Since Wednesday Nestle ’s Facebook page has been hit by growing anger against the multi-billion dollar food giant .
Nestle complained that some Facebook users were posting new images of its logo , which shows three happy birds in a tree , and stated that it will delete any “ altered version of any of our logos as your profile pic ” .
This statement brought another firestorm of criticism , which Nestle has eventually caved to , now allowing ‘ alterations ’ .
This is not the first time Nestle has been called out for its practices .
The company has long - faced criticism for aggressively marketing its baby formula to poor mothers in the developing world .

Orangutans vs palm oil in Malaysia : setting the record straight
( 01/16/2010 ) The Malaysian palm oil industry has been broadly accused of contributing to the dramatic decline in orangutan populations in Sabah , a state in northern Borneo , over the past 30 years .
The industry has staunchly denied these charges and responded with marketing campaigns claiming the opposite : that oil palm plantations can support and nourish the great red apes .
The issue came to a head last October at the Orangutan Colloquium held in Kota Kinabalu .
There , confronted by orangutan biologists , the palm oil industry pledged to support restoring forest corridors along rivers in order to help facilitate movement of orangutans between remaining forest reserves across seas of oil palm plantations .
Attending NGOs agreed that they would need to work with industry to find a balance that would allow the ongoing survival of orangutans in the wild .
Nevertheless the conference was still marked by much of the same rhetoric that has characterized most of these meetings — chief palm oil industry officials again made dubious claims about the environmental stewardship of the industry .
However this time there was at least acknowledgment that palm oil needs to play an active role in conservation .

Consumers should help pay the bill for ‘ greener ’ palm oil
( 01/12/2010 ) Palm oil is one of the world ’s most traded and versatile agricultural commodities .
It can be used as edible vegetable oil , industrial lubricant , raw material in cosmetic and skincare products and feedstock for biofuel production .
Growing global demand for palm oil and the ensuing cropland expansion has been blamed for a wide range of environmental ills , including tropical deforestation , peatland degradation , biodiversity loss and CO2 emissions .
In response to these concerns , a group of stakeholders — including activists , investors , producers and retailers — formed the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) to develop a certification scheme for palm oil produced through environmentally - and socially - responsible ways .
It is widely anticipated that the creation of a premium market for RSPO - certified sustainable palm oil ( CSPO ) would incentivize palm oil producers to improve their management practices .

Actor son of Michael Douglas gets five years in prison
Douglas has battled drugs since he was 13 The son of Hollywood actor Michael Douglas has been sentenced to five years in prison for dealing methamphetamine and possessing heroin .
Cameron Douglas , 31 , pleaded guilty to the charges in January after his arrest last year at a hotel in New York .
" I 'd like to apologise to my family and my loved ones for putting them through this nightmare of my own making , " Douglas said in court on Tuesday .
Michael Douglas sat behind his son in the packed courtroom in Manhattan .
The Academy Award - winning actor had written a letter to the judge asking for leniency , as had his father - veteran actor Kirk Douglas - and wife , Catherine Zeta -Jones .
" My stepson is a caring , considerate , worthy human being , " wrote Zeta - Jones .
' Difficult chore ' Cameron Douglas 's mother , Diandra , was also in court .
She was married to Michael Douglas from 1977 to 2000 .
Cameron Douglas will be credited with time already served , having spent the last eight months in prison on remand .
The defence had requested that he be sentenced to three and a half years at the most .
Prosecutors alleged Douglas was the middle man in a scheme to smuggle large amounts of methamphetamine from California to New York .
He told the court he wanted to lead a drug - free life .
" If I should be so fortunate as to have another chance , I will never squander that opportunity , " he said .
During the sentence hearing , US District Judge Richard M Berman described how Douglas had abused drugs since the age of 13 , noting that he had abstained since going to prison in August last year .
But he said he was doubtful that Douglas could turn his back on drugs for good .
" That will be a very difficult chore .
I think this case and this sentencing may well be his last chance to make it , " added Berman .
Douglas has appeared in a number of films including It Runs In The Family , which also starred his father and grandfather .

* Broadway Bank has become Senate race talking point
* Six other banks fail , bringing year total to 57 ( Adds Giannoulias comment , changes dateline from WASHINGTON )
CHICAGO , April 23 ( Reuters ) - Regulators on Friday seized a Chicago bank owned by the family of the Democratic nominee running for the U.S. Senate seat once held by President Barack Obama .
Broadway Bank was among seven Illinois banks whose failure was announced on Friday .
U.S. regulators have seized 15 banks in the past two weeks , as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ratchets up efforts to clean up the banking industry .
Regulators have closed 57 banks this year .
Amcore Bank AMFI.O was the largest to close on Friday , with $ 3.8 billion in assets and $ 3.4 billion in total deposits as of Dec. 31 , 2009 , the FDIC said .
It will be purchased by Harris National Association , a part of Canada 's BMO Financial Group .
Broadway Bank , a community bank with $ 1.2 billion in assets , had been limping along for months under the weight of bad commercial real estate loans .
The bank is owned by the family of Alexi Giannoulias , the first - term Illinois state treasurer who is in a tight race for Obama ’s previous post to be decided in the November election .
The FDIC said MB Financial MBFI.O is assuming the deposits of Broadway Bank .
Obama backed Giannoulias , a banking scion , for treasurer , and the two have played basketball together .
But White House aides tried unsuccessfully to recruit other prominent Illinois Democrats to run for the seat .
In comments late Friday , Giannoulias called the bank ’s closing “ an incredibly sad and heartbreaking day for me and my family , ” adding when he left the bank in 2006 to become state treasurer “ it was one of the best - performing in Illinois . ”
He said he would only fight harder to win the Senate seat .
Republicans have condemned Giannoulias ’ role in the bank ’s soured real estate portfolio that included loans to such figures as convicted prostitution ring operator Michael “ Jaws ” Giorango .
Loans were also made to convicted influence peddler Antoin “ Tony ” Rezko , who also was a fund - raiser for Obama .
It is these loans , says DePaul University political science professor Michael Mezey , that could hurt Giannoulias even more than the failure of the bank .
“ They ’ve ( the Giannoulias campaign ) been talking about it ( the bank ) and claiming it would fail .
...
It ’s not news at this point , ” he said .
“ The thing that may be more damaging than the closing is the loans to people of questionable character . ”
The bank ’s failure gives further ammunition to Giannoulias ’ Republican opponent , five - term congressman Mark Kirk .
“ While years of risky lending schemes , hot money investments and loans to organized crime led to today ’s failure , it ’s a sad day for Broadway Bank employees who may lose their jobs due to Mr. Giannoulias ’ reckless business practices , ” Kirk campaign spokesperson Kirsten Kukowski said in an email statement .
Giannoulias has characterized Broadway Bank ’s troubles as similar to those of other community banks hurt by the harshest recession in decades .
His links to the failed bank comes at a time when the Illinois Democratic party is already in disarray .
The Illinois legislature impeached and removed Democrat Rod Blagojevich during his second term as governor in January 2009 , after he was charged with racketeering , fraud , and lying to investigators -- including an accusation he tried to sell Obama ’s vacant U.S. Senate seat .
In addition to Broadway and Amcore , the FDIC said five other Illinois banks failed on Friday .
They are : New Century Bank , Citizens Bank &Trust Co , Wheatland Bank , Peotone Bank and Trust Company and Lincoln Park Savings Bank .
MB Financial is assuming the deposits of New Century , while Republic Bank of Chicago is assuming Citizens Bank & Trust Co ’s deposits .
Wheatland Bank will reopen as part of Wheaton Bank and Trust , First Midwest Bank , also in Illinois , will assume the deposits of Peotone Bank and Trust Company and Lincoln Park Savings Bank will become part of Northbrook Bank and Trust Company .
Nearly 500,000
Jews live in more than 100 settlements built since 1967 US Vice - President Joe Biden has condemned Israel 's approval of 1,600 new homes for ultra-Orthodox Jews in East Jerusalem .
Mr Biden , in Israel as part of US attempts to kick - start the peace process , said it was " the kind of step that undermines the trust we need " .
Israel insisted it was a procedural step not connected to the visit .
Mr Biden is now due to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad in the West Bank .
On Thursday , he travels to Jordan for talks with King Abdullah .
' Dangerous decision ' Israel 's approval of the new housing units has infuriated the Palestinians , who want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state .
The international community considers East Jerusalem occupied territory .
Building on occupied land is illegal under international law , but Israel regards East Jerusalem - which it annexed in 1967 - as its territory .
In a strongly worded statement , Mr Biden said : " I condemn the decision by the government of Israel to advance planning for new housing units in East Jerusalem .
ANALYSIS Jeremy Bowen , BBC News , Jerusalem
The Americans will have to work hard to keep the Palestinians in the peace talks they are trying to launch .
That may have been one reason for the strong language Mr Biden used to condemn Israel 's announcement .
The Americans have not accepted Israel 's explanation that the announcement was essentially part of a bureaucratic process that had no connection with the Biden visit .
Israel , deliberately or not , inflicted something close to a humiliation on the Obama administration and the words they chose in reaction reflected that .
The Americans spent much of last year trying and failing to get Israel to freeze all construction in the Jewish settlements , which are illegal under international law .
This row is another reminder of why so many people here , Israelis and Palestinians , are pessimistic about peace talks - and deeply worried about the future .
" The substance and timing of the announcement , particularly with the launching of proximity talks , is precisely the kind of step that undermines the trust we need right now and runs counter to the constructive discussions that I 've had here in Israel . "
UN chief Ban Ki-moon also issued a statement condemning Israel 's settlement plan .
" [ Mr Ban ] reiterates that settlements are illegal under international law , " Reuters news agency quoted the statement as saying .
" Furthermore , he underscores that settlement activity is contrary to Israel 's obligations under the roadmap , and undermines any movement towards a viable peace process . "
Palestinian leaders have only recently agreed to resume indirect contacts with Israel , at Mr Biden 's urging .
Palestinian Authority spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina told AFP news agency : " This is a dangerous decision and will hinder the negotiations .
" We consider the decision to build in East Jerusalem to be a judgment that the American efforts have failed before the negotiations have even begun . "
A spokesman for the Israeli interior ministry said : " The Jerusalem District Planning Committee today approved a plan which has been in the works for over three years .
" This is a procedural stage in the framework of a long process that will yet continue for some time .
The committee meeting was determined in advance and there is no connection to US Vice - President Joe Biden 's visit to Israel . "
There are still various planning hurdles for the East Jerusalem project to clear , and work is not thought likely to start for at least two years .
Under US pressure , Israel has agreed a 10 - month suspension of new building in the West Bank .
But the moratorium excludes East Jerusalem , where the Palestinians want their capital .
' Moment of opportunity '
Mr Biden is the most senior member of President Barack Obama 's administration to visit Jerusalem .
Earlier , at a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , he said there was a " moment of real opportunity " for peace between the Palestinians and Israel .
The Palestinians refuse to hold face - to - face negotiations with the Israelis unless they halt all settlement building in the occupied West Bank .

US Middle East envoy George Mitchell is expected to shuttle between the Palestinians in Ramallah and the Israelis in Jerusalem .
Mr Biden also said the US was committed to Israeli security and determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons .
He added that the best long - term guarantee for Israel 's security was a comprehensive peace between Israel and its neighbours .
Mr Netanyahu said Israel would continue to support the US push for stronger sanctions against Iran , and that he was pleased its efforts to restart Israeli - Palestinian peace talks were " beginning to bear fruit " .
He said the goal of negotiations was a peace deal that included Palestinian recognition of the " permanence and legitimacy of the Jewish state of Israel " .
Correspondents say there is little optimism in the region about what the indirect Israeli - Palestinian talks might achieve .
Periods of direct negotiations over the last two decades have failed to reach agreement .
Mr Netanyahu 's right - leaning government has taken a harder line stance on final status issues than that of the previous administration .
He has ruled out dividing Jerusalem , wants the Palestinians to recognise Israel as a Jewish state , and said he intends to maintain a presence along the eastern border of a future Palestinian state .

I was happy to see Kenichi again , who Takeshi had apparently instructed to serve us our meals .
After he finished he returned with his own tray , bowed , and joined us at the table .
He seemed nervous , or perhaps embarrassed , or maybe he was feigning humility for my benefit .
I could n’t tell , so I smiled politely and left him alone .
Breakfast consisted of grilled river fish , a raw egg on rice , miso soup , a folded egg , a dish with sliced carrots , sesame seeds and a white vegetable I did n’t recognize , and green tea .
I ’d expected at least one serving of whale , or kujira , as they called it , but no such luck .
Perhaps we ’d get a showing at dinner .
The dining area had seating for roughly fifty people .
We had a table on the port side of the galley , but we were on the bottom floor of the ship , so there were no windows .
I sat with my back to the wall .
The room was nearly full , and dead quiet .
Most of the Japanese were focused intently on eating .
A couple of them were reading as they ate , a book or magazine in one hand , chopsticks in the other .
“ Is it always like this ? ” I asked Takeshi in a hushed voice .
“ Like what ? ”
“ So quiet . ”
“ Yes , I think so , ” Takeshi replied , as if he ’d never considered it .
“ Weird . ”
At first no one seemed to be paying any attention to the strange foreigner in their midst , but after a while I realized that they were just hard to catch .
In my periphery I saw many of them sneaking glances , but as soon as I lifted my eyes they had already looked away .
It was an ominous feeling .
“ For the Japanese , it ’s impolite to stare , ” Takeshi said .
I grinned .
“ You catch everything do n’t you ? ”
“ Japanese culture is very different than American . ”
“ Does everyone on the boat know who I am ? ” I said , sliding a pair of wooden chopsticks out of their paper sheath .
“ They know that we rescued you from the sea , ” Takeshi replied .
“ They know you are an American .
But none of us know who you really are , Wayne - san . ”
I snapped the chopsticks into two pieces .
“ Yeah , I ’m beginning to feel that way myself . ”
“ But none of that matters any more .
If you were a spy , Wayne - san , you are out of a job . ”
“ I ’m out of a job no matter what . ”
“ Unn , ” Takeshi hummed , and plucked at his fish .
I eyed my companions as they ate : they drank the miso soup from the edge of the bowl , and held their bowls of rice close as they snagged clumps of the white grains with their chopsticks .
I had never learned how to use them .
I ate like a barbarian , cutting the egg and the fish with a chopstick in each hand , knife and fork style , and speared the pieces one by one .
For the vegetables , kinpira gobou , Takeshi called it , I just held up the bowl shoveled it into my mouth .
It was all very good , especially the fish , but the tea was a little bitter .
I left it alone .
We ate quickly , and afterward the three of us went to the top deck toward the bow and found a room with a few couches and a satellite feed .
We met a girl there named Yumi , beautiful , young Japanese dressed in a business suit , with short black hair cropped just below her ears .
She was seated on the edge of the couch watching the television .
Yumi ignored Takeshi and Kenichi straight out , but when she noticed me , her eyes softened .
It was a look of sympathy .
I nodded at her , but I was immediately taken by the horror on the television .
Most of the shots were satellite photos .
It was impossible to tell what I was looking at .
Random , unrecognizable cities flattened by ICBMs .
The images flew by and Takeshi provided the translation in a somber voice : “ Washington D.C , Kansas , Toronto , San Francisco , New York City , Miami , Moscow , London , Shanghai , Berlin , Sydney , Madrid , Rome , Paris , Dubai , Kiev , Tehran , Baghdad , Budapest , Warsaw , Beijing , Los Angeles… . ”
There was no on ground coverage .
Computers , telecommunications — those that were n’t destroyed — were fried by the EMPs , or simply severed from the grid .
The world had unloaded .
The Russians had loosed their arsenal on America and its allies , and we had responded in kind .
Smaller cities had been spared .
But the fallout was drifting eastward .
I collapsed onto the couch next to Yumi .
“ Saiyakuu , ” she said , drawing the word out with a long breath .
She set the television remote on the coffee table and leaned back , dropping her arms at her sides .
A map of the United States appeared on screen with dark smudges indicating blast sites , and projected fallout patterns in lighter gray arcing to the east .
My parent ’s home in Kansas was somewhere in the middle of a black smudge .
New England — all of it — was reduced to ink .
It looked as if someone had splattered the U.S. with paint and smeared it with his arm .
Similar maps of Russia and Europe flashed on the screen as the journalist chattered away in Japanese .
It did n’t look real .
I had a hard time connecting the images on the screen with the reality of it all .
There were no images of the horror on the ground .
The human cost was vague , extrapolated from charts and graphs .
The coverage moved on , and Takeshi continued the translation .
A number of foreigners in Japan were interviewed .
A weeping American girl from Portland , Oregon had lost contact with her family and did n’t know whether they had survived .
A family visiting Kyoto from San Diego claimed that God had graciously spared them .
Two Chinese brothers living in Tokyo were too distraught to speak .
At a giant intersection in Shinjuku , crowds of Japanese watched coverage of the event on a giant television screen on the side of a building .
Shots of Buddhist temples all over Japan were shown , where people gathered to pray and tie paper notes onto overflowing racks .
At the American embassy in Tokyo mourners surrounded the building with hundreds of thousands of flowers and origami cranes .
I felt Yumi ’s hand on my shoulder .
She said nothing .
I took a deep breath and settled a little further into the couch .
Some local stories followed .
An entire high school senior class had been lost on a trip to Paris .
A politician from Fukuoka had been in the UAE when the bombs rained down .
“ Kurodasan , ” Takeshi sighed .
“ He is from my home town . ”
“ Soudesune , ” Yumi replied .
Some pictures of the politician were shown , then a shot of a cruise ship .
It had been docked in Guam when the island had been bombed .
Family members were interviewed .
Everyone was in tears , even the journalists .
The tragedy was endless .
We watched the coverage for hours .
Occasionally a report came in from someone who had managed to get a message through .
A Canadian on a satellite phone in northern Saskechuan was looking for answers .
His city of La Ronge was intact , but he was unable to reach his brother in Vancouver .
A woman in New Zealand described panic in Christchurch as the clouds of smoke swept over their city .
“ I ca n’t watch this anymore , ” I said , standing up .
“ Some satellite phones are obviously working .
I need to make a call . ”
Takeshi took a breath .
“ Wayne - san , you will not be able to reach anyone in America .
Everything is gone . ”
“ I ’m not calling America . ”
Takeshi scratched his chin , then said something to Yumi .
She stood up , flattened her skirt , and left .
“ Yumichan is my sister , ” Takeshi said , having caught my eye as I watched her leave .
Christ , he never missed anything .
“ I — um . Really ? ”
Takeshi nodded slowly , eying me .
Kenichi smirked and said , “ Sis - tah desuneee . ”
I cringed and rubbed my eyes .
“ I see . ”
I turned back to the coverage and the three of us watched in silence .
A few minutes later Yumi returned with the satellite phone .
She extended it to me with both hands .
“ I am pray for your family , ” she said , bowing deeply .
“ Thank you , ” I said , accepting the phone .
She raised her eyes and blinked away a few tears .
I touched her on the arm and nodded .
“ Arigatou , Yumichan , ” I whispered .
She wiped away the tears , nodding , and turned away .
I took a deep , resolving breath .
There was only one person in the world who I knew would be nowhere near a populated area .
I moved to back of the room and punched in the familiar number .
It rang .
A good start .
I tapped my fingers on the plastic as the ring tone droned on and on .
“ C’mon , man , pick up , ” I whispered .
I paced a bit , then stopped in front of a calendar on the rear wall .
I ran my finger along the glossy paper .
The three icebergs again .
While the ringing continued , I lifted the page to peek at May : an old , rusted , derelict whaling ship beached on an icy shore .
I frowned at it , then sat down in a chair in the corner .
The phone continued to ring .
Jesus , answer the goddamn phone !
Finally , after what seemed like a hundred rings , someone picked up .
“ Telders . ”
The World From Berlin ' Hungary has Turned into a Grubby Hive of Nationalism '
Media commentators in Germany are alarmed at the emergence of the far - right Jobbik party as the third - strongest force in the Hungarian parliament .
Europe should pay more attention to the vicious xenophobia and political polarization wracking the country 20 years after it gained its freedom , editorials say .
I had to write a piece on love as part of my positive psychology course , and as a die - hard bachelor , I was n’t particularly looking forward to it .
But , as I looked into the research on love , I found it to be a fascinating area of research .
Maybe , deep down , I ’m just an old romantic at heart .
Love is a topic that scientists have shied away from – perhaps in the same way as studying humour , they worry that they will take the magic out of it .
But as Helen Fisher , one of the foremost researchers of love says , you can know all the ingredients of chocolate cake and it will still taste delicious .
One of the more popular early theories was Sternberg ’s triangular theory of love .
This theory has immediate appeal because it points out three aspects of loving relationships that we can instantly recognise – intimacy , passion , and commitment .
A relationship can have any two or all three of these , and in the theory , each combination has its own name ( see this article for more on that ) .
It ’s a nice , tidy model .
But one problem I first had with it , is that maybe it only has intuitive appeal because I recognise it in Hollywood movies , rather than in people .
Is this love ?
( Credit : Catlovers )
It may be : Sternberg ’s model matches up nicely with some work in neuroscience and animal behaviour .
It seems that there are discrete but interrelated emotional systems common to most if not all mammals and birds , which solve the ‘ problem ’ of mating .
These are lust , attraction , and attachment , and they correspond roughly to Sternberg ’s passion , intimacy and commitment .
Example behaviours are :
Lust / passion – craving for sexual gratification , associated with elevated levels of estrogens and androgens .
Attraction / intimacy – increased energy spent on the preferred mating partner , in humans this also includes ‘ intrusive thinking ’ about the love interest .
Associated with increased dopamine and norepinephrine , and decreased serotonin .
Attachment / commitment – Characterised by mutual territory / resource defence , nest building , close proximity , separation anxiety .
Associated with the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin .
( see references 1 and 2 for a review of this evidence )
These are powerful chemicals , and the power of love should not be underestimated ; in one study , evidence of romantic attraction was found in 147 of 166 societies ( 3 ) .
People elope together because of love , they sing songs because of love , and they kill themselves – and others – because of love .
Clearly , it is more than a feeling .
What is actually going in this attraction / intimacy part of Fisher / Sternberg ’s models that has such a maddening effect on us ?
To find out , Helen Fisher stuck a bunch of madly - in - love people in fMRI scanners , while showing them pictures of their loved one .
The results ?
It appears that romantic love is located primarily in the ventral tegmental area of the brain .
This is part of the dopaminergic system , involved in reward , want , and craving .
It ’s the same area of the brain that fires up when addictive drugs are taken , particularly cocaine and the amphetamine derivatives .
In other words , love is addictive – literally .
But of course , every rose has its thorn , and love does not always end well .
In another interesting study , Fisher and colleagues stuck people who had recently been dumped into an fMRI ( 4 ) .
Where is this experience located in the brain ?
The same place !
But additionally , there was also activation in the nucleus accumbens , an area associated with judgements of gain and loss ; the area that lights up when we ’re willing to take great risks to achieve a high perceived gain – the same area involved in gambling .
This is why we get people going to great lengths to get their love back – they are simultaneously focused on what they have lost and at the same time more likely to take high risks .
So what is love ?
It is an addiction .
It meets the criteria necessary for something to be classed as an addiction ( tolerance , withdrawal , relapse ) .
The implications of the above findings are massive – if love is associated with the above neuotransmitters , peptides and hormones , then our experience of love could be influence by anything that interferes with these chemicals – recreational drugs and anti-depressants in particular .
In addition to this , the brain areas involved in love seem to suggest that , rather than being an emotion per ce , it is a goal - oriented state .
( Credit : txd )
But , at the risk of leaving on a low note , I ’ll finish by mentioning a recent study by the same research team ( 5 ) .
So fond of sticking people into fMRI scanners , this time they scanned couples who had been married for 25 + years , and still report feeling in love with their partners .
What was the brain activity in these couples ?
As Sternberg would predict , they showed greater activity in areas associated with long - term pair bonding in animals .
But what about attraction / intimacy ?
Well , they found just the same activity as they did in the earlier experiments .
Perhaps true love can last forever .
PS .
The titles of five love songs are hidden in this article .
See if you can find them !

Man Sues Airline for not Looking at His Scrotum
By JEAN - PHILIPPE ARCAND , QMI Agency ( Toronto Sun )
MONTREAL – A Westmount resident ’s lawsuit against Air Transat , for failure to provide him with appropriated medical attention during a flight , was dismissed in small claims court this past Tuesday .
His illness ?
Sudden and mysterious bleeding in the area between his legs .
The curious incident occurred February 15 , 2008 during a flight from Montreal to Puerto Vallarta , Mexico .
Marcel Cote was comfortably seated in business class an hour after takeoff when , for some unknown reason , he felt enough discomfort to make an emergency visit to the washroom , where he discovered spots of blood on his body .
In a panic , Cote asked for the help of a flight attendant , who quickly came to his side .
When the passenger noticed that the agent was female , he asked to be assisted by a male attendant because the bleeding seemed to be coming from his genital area .

When the male attendant came to him , Cote then asked to be closely examined so that the exact nature of the problem can be determined .
The employee declined , giving him absorbent paper instead .
Indignant and distressed , Cote quickly expressed his wish to see a doctor .
Before supplying him with sanitary towels , the members of the flight crew told him they would contact a physician if the illness was grave enough .
On arriving in Puerto Vallarta three hours later , Mr. Cote met with a travel agent he knew and she took him to the hospital in a taxi .
He was examined by a doctor who determined Cote had a ruptured vein near his scrotum .
Three stitches were needed to close the wound .
What started off as a dream trip to a Southern paradise with his wife , in the end turned into a nightmare Cote said , claiming the incident ruined his vacation and has made him anxious about flying .

Cote sued Air Transat and the employees on the flight that day , accusing them of failing to provide appropriate medical assistance , seeking damages of $ 8,000 for the anguish he suffered as a result of their neglect .
But judge Michele Pauze rejected Cote ’s case .
In her decision , she said she agreed with arguments offered by Air Transat representative Chantal Chlala , who explained to the court that flight attendants do not have the right to examine passengers , and even less to make a diagnosis .
“ It was not incumbent upon a flight attendant to conduct the medical examination of a passenger , a measure reserved for the medical profession , ” wrote judge Pauzé .
Although she conceded that Cote could very well have experienced troubling moments in the episode , the judge maintained that “ nothing in the facts ( put before us ) proves that that the situation was dangerous or worrisome to the point of requiring the immediate attention of a doctor . ”
Not only did Pauze rule against Cote , she also ordered him to pay for the court costs incurred by Air Transat , amounting to $ 189 .
Martha says ~ “ I can certainly empathise with the crew .
On a flight to London , I once had a Hindi speaking elderly male passenger traveling alone .
The flight had been delayed , and during the hectic boarding , the poor thing was somehow lost in the shuffle , aided to his seat by airport wheelchair assistants , and without the flight crew aware of his immobile state .
Later , during the meal service , it was brought to our attention he needed help .
The man seemed agitated .
Not able to understand his complaint , or concern , I asked my flying partners if anyone spoke his language ?
No Hindi speaking crew on board , an announcement was made for an interpreter .
A gentleman came forward to help .
He spoke with the man for a few minutes , then explained to us our special passenger was complaining of severe constipation ( and had been like this for several days now ) , he needs to use the lavatory , and is unable to stand or walk on his own .
Great !
Any one of these situations is bad enough , but all three ?
Right now ?
Full flight , and after we ’ve just begun the meal service ?
This required use of the rickety collapsible on - board “ aisle wheelchair ” .
Every airplane has one .
They ’re required equipment .
Where the contraption is stored on this airplane ?
Who knows ?
It ’s seldom used , and with so many fleet configurations , who can ever remember ?
We ’re on a 777 , so the location could be anywhere .
Looking it up the manual , I sent another flight attendant to retrieve it while I stayed with the patient .
In the meantime , Mr. Farfrompoopin is getting more irritated with every passing second .
Once we had the chair erected , we ’d be able to wheel him on the rickety rolling transporting device .
Myself , the interpreter , and another flight attendant , positioned ourselves evenly and gave him the “ heave - ho ” out of his seat and on to the toilet transporter .
After a bit of a struggle , which included knocking his turban off his head , the patient was precariously seated on top of the chair , and the constipated cargo was now safely strapped to the toilet trolley , and we were finally off and running , well almost .
Squeak , squeak , rumble , bump , squeak , tip , squeak , ooops ( again with the turban ) , squeak , , , , , , on and on , until we ’d reached our destination .
Using a ‘ bear hug ’ lift , the interpreter picked him up from the front , as if they were slow dancing .
Now face to face , he began backing the passenger ‘ patient ’ into the toilet stall .
This is where I step in .
Well , not really , more like I crawled in .
Now , you know how tiny airplane bathrooms are , right ?
As I try to assist any way I can , I ’m crouched on all fours , half - in half - out , guiding the patient into position , from above I hear the interpreter say “ okay , I need you to unbuckle his belt and pull down his pants ” .
“ Say again ? ” was my reply .
He repeated , “ unbuckle his belt , and pull down his pants . ”
From my awkward position , I twisted my head around trying to make eye contact with my flying partners .
I needed something , not sure what .
Support maybe ?
A pat on the back ?
The salad tongs from first class ?
For all mankind , as a soldier in the line of doodoo , and out of respect for constipated travelers everywhere , I did what was asked of me , and dutifully dropped his drawers .
With pants now cleared away from danger , he was lowered into position and left to work out his problems ( in private ) .
A while later , it was time to repeat the process , in reverse order , and without knocking off his turban .
Oh , and if you were wondering , nothing happened .
While he was in there alone I mean .
The interpreted said so .
Mission not accomplished .
What - a- Bummer ……..
All that for nothing . ”
Just days after the U.S Government acknowledged that the entertainment industries have misled the authorities with bogus piracy reports , the RIAA and MPAA are using those same statistics to convince the copyright czar to transform the Internet into a copyright police state .
The PRO - IP Act is a United States law that aims to toughen current anti-piracy measures .
As part of the Act , President Obama appointed Victoria Espinel as the new copyright czar last year .
Espinel announced a public consultation a few months ago , looking for comments and suggestions from the U.S. public on how to deal with piracy .
For this consultation the RIAA and MPAA have now jointly submitted ( pdf ) their suggestions , calling for a future without piracy .
As expected , the submission starts with bitter complaints about the massive losses the entertainment industries have to endure because of online piracy .
The same old bogus studies and reports are cited , publications that were heavily criticized and labeled as inaccurate by the U.S. Government earlier this week .
What follows are a set of recommendations that , if they become law , would turn the Internet into a copyright police state .
The EFF has cherry picked some of the most draconian recommendations in a recent blog post , but these are just the tip of the iceberg .
We highlight some of the suggestions below .
If the RIAA and MPAA had their way …
– The public would be encouraged to install anti-piracy software on their computers which would monitor their network for copyright - infringing materials .
They are most likely referring to the Digital File Check application that they ’ve been plugging for a while .
– Internet service providers would have to allow third parties to spy on the files that are transferred by their customers and check them against a reference database of “ fingerprints ” to check whether the files are infringing copyright or not .
– Torrent sites and file - hosters would have to preemptively filter content that is uploaded to or indexed by their sites .
The reasoning behind this suggestion is that the regular notice and takedown procedures are time consuming and ineffective because content quickly reappears .
– Search engines , hosting companies , payment processors , advertising agencies , social networking sites and domain registrars would be encouraged to team up with copyright holders in order to prevent online piracy .
The purpose of this collaboration would be to cut off sites that ‘ facilitate ’ copyright infringement .
– Consumers and websites that repeatedly infringe on the rights of copyright holders would lose their Internet access .
These are just a few of the recommendations that are listed in the submission .
It is quite clear that the copyright industries want full control over the Internet by building a copyright police state .
Let ’s hope that the politicians responsible for drafting the legislation will use their brains , instead of blindly accepting such proposals .
Andy Hunter 's match preview : Another brutal match report from David Sullivan might be preferable to a visit to Goodison Park for Gianfranco Zola , given that West Ham have won only once in their last 13 visits and face an Everton side that has triumphed on its last seven home league games – a club record in the Premier League .
Injury to Mikel Arteta at least deprives Everton of their most creative outlet but with the pressure firmly on the Italian , and his side winning only once on their league travels this season , it will take more than spirit from the struggling Hammers to ease the sense of crisis this weekend .
Match pointers
• If West Ham lose , they will become the 22nd team in Premier League history to lose seven or more consecutive games .
• Everton have lost one of their last 15 home league matches while West Ham have failed to win in 15 away .
• Louis Saha has scored five goals in his last three appearances against West Ham .
• If the season had begun on 1 January , Everton would be in second place behind Manchester United .
• West Ham have conceded 799 Premier League goals in their history .

Referee : Howard Webb ( S Yorkshire )
If Gianfranco Zola Had Ducks
They 'd Drown Dept : Valon Behrami , who had to pass a fitness test this morning , appears to have pulled up with some sort of tweak or strain during the warm -up .
Pre-match niceties : Everton are on a five - match unbeaten run , while West Ham are on a seven - match beaten one .
They 'll have to make do without the box - to - box industriousness of Behrami this afternoon as he's been ruled out of the starting line - up after injuring himself in the warm - up .
Junior Stanislas comes into the side in his stead .
Not long now :
It may be Easter but there is n't a giant bunny or chocolate egg in sight as referee Howard Webb leads both teams out of the Goodison Park tunnel with both sets of players wearing the colours with which they 're most readily associated .
An email from Steve Peake : " Regarding that picture of David Sullivan , " he writes .
" Is he a very small man or is that a very big car ?
Or is he standing in one of New Labour 's new potholes ? "
1 min : Louis Saha and Tim Cahill get proccedings under way on a sunny afternoon on Merseyside .
Can West Ham end their worst losing run for 40 years ?
We 'll soon find out .
2 min : Somewhat unexpectedly for West Ham , Mark Noble has started on the left hand side of midfield , with Junior Stanislas on the right .
The latter chases a long ball up the right flank but there 's too much welly on it and Tim Howard beats him to it .
3 min : Everton win a free - kick wide on the ride , about halfway inside the West Ham half .
The ball 's floated in to the edge of the six - yard box , where Matthew Upson clears .
4 min : From the kick - out , Stanislas wins the ball in midfield and tries to send Carlton Cole on his way with a defence - splitting through - ball .
Offside .
5 min : Nails hard Dutchman Johnny Heitinga sends a speculative punt up the right channel for Louis Saha to chase , but the ball bounces out over the endline .
Meanwhile at St Andrews , Steven Gerrard has put Liverpool a goal up against Birmingham City .
At Craven Cottage , Fulham are a goal down against Wigan Athletic .
7 min : Diniyar Bilyaletdinov gets a spray from the magic can on his calf after a challenge from Jonathan Spector .
He 'll live .
8 min : It 's very scrappy so far .
No chances on goal created by either side in the length of time it takes Manchester City to score three against Burnley .
9 min : Good defending by Phil Jagielka , who concedes a corner by intercepting a cross from the right wing by Junior Stanislas .
10 min : Another corner for West Ham , which is only cleared as far as Scott Parker , a few yards outisde the Everton penalty area .
He swivels and hits a left - footed volley high and wide , but not too high and wide , of the right post .
11 min : " Fulham have equalised against Hull City , " says Sky commentator Martin Ty ... actually it 's Alan Parry .
Even by Fulham 's lofty standards , that 's impressive , considering they 're playing against Wigan .
12 min : Carlton
Cole is hobbling gingerly after a meaty clash with Johnny Heitinga .
He looks like he took a knock on his knee .
13 min : Rather than head it back towards the halfway line , Manuel Da Costa chests down a dropping ball and tries to play it out of defence .
Tim Cahill gets in amongst him and the West Ham centre - half is forced to concede a free - kick .
Luckily for him , Leighton Baines slams the ball into the wall .
15 min : " I cannot believe the football club I have supported for decades is now owned by a dwarf with the dress sense of a partially - sighted cinema usher , " writes Neil Macknish .
" He 's not even big enough to see over his steering wheel .
Lord have mercy because at Goodison we usually get a thorough tonking . "
16 min : Howard Webb shows Scott Parker his 10th yellow card of the season for a foul on Tim Cahill , which means West Ham will be without their best player for their forthcoming matches against Sunderland and Liverpool .
18 min : Everton free - kick about 25 yards from goal .
After a seemingly interminable bout of silly buggers , the West Ham wall gets a ticking off from referee Howard Webb for inching forward as Louis Saha stood over the ball .
Eventually , Saha tries his luck .
Well wide .
19 min : West Ham attack but can find no way through the Everton defence .
Carlton
Cole tees up Mido from the edge of the box , but his powerful drive is blocked .
20 min : Birmingham have equalised against Liverpool , while Fulham have gone 2 - 1 up against Wigan .
It 's all happening ... somewhere else .
21 min : " It was good to see Gianfranco Zola asserting his authority and using a break in play to get some advice to Mido earlier , " writes Gary Naylor .
" Although how much good ' Lose some weight , fatty ' can do at this stage is n't clear . "
That 's harsh , Naylor .
Harsh but fair .
22 min : " There seems to be a biblical message from Job in the reflection on Sullivan 's car door , " writes eagle - eyed Ian Copstake .
" No doubt the big man upstairs is suggesting that with Zola , patience is the key . "
GOAL ! Everton 1 - 0 West Ham ( Bilyaletdinov 24 ) That 's woeful defending from Jonathan Spector , who heads a weighty Leighton Baines cross from the left straight up in the air over the edge of his six yard box instead of away to safety .
Tim Cahill gets a free header to flick it towards Bilyaletdinov , who slots a free header home from five yards .
26 min : The camera pans to West Ham co-owner David Gold sitting in the stand .
He does not look best pleased .
28 min : Matthew Upson tries to pick out Carlton Cole with a long pass , but misses him by about 20 yards .
Cole is looking very isolated up front .
He 's getting no service .
29 min : " My good friend Jez Wyke would like to enquire why such an esteemed chap as yourself should draw the short straw and have to work on Easter Sunday ? " writes Jonathan Gard .
The short straw ?
This ?
31 min : " Is it just me or is Martin Tyler repeatedly referring to someone called Phil Yagyelka ? " asks Sally Ledger .
" Has he been to the John Motson school of overly pretentious pronunciation ? "
33 min : Mido tries to charge up the left touchline , but Phil Neville puts a stop to his gallop with a fine challenge .
In his efforts to win the ball back from the Everton right - back , Mido concedes a free - kick .
34 min :
In mmidfield , Steven Pienaar plays the ball out wide to Leighton Baines on the over - lap .
He pings the ball back inside to Tim Cahill , who scurries across the face of goal before unleashing a diagonal daisy - cutter that fizzes a couple of feet wide of Rob Green 's right post .
36 min : That has to be a penalty ...
36 min : ... and it is .
Sylvain Distin brings down Carlton Cole in the box as they contest a marvellous through - ball from Scott Parker .
Looking at it again it seems it was more of a collision between the two than a foul by Distin and Howard Webb took a long time to point to the spot .
37 min : Mido misses , sending a lethargic effort low and to his left .
Howard guessed the right way and saved fairly easily .
39 min : I do n't think I 've been as confident that somebody would miss a penalty since seeing the terror in Michael Gray 's eyes as he stepped up to take that fateful pspot - kick in in the Championship play - off shoot - out between Charlton and Sunderland on May 25 1998 .
39 min : On Sky , co-commentator Andy Gray is wondering why Howard Webb only booked Sylvain Distin for preventing a clear goalscoring opportunity .
Well he might wonder .
If he blew for the foul , he should have sent the player off off .
As it happens it was a harsh penalty , but Webb obviously thought Distin had deliberately brought down Cole .
44 min :
My tools start playing up and I lose a large chunk of text criticising Mido 's penalty on the strength of a replay I 've just seen .
In short : it was terrible and he clearly signposted which side he was going to put it .
45 min : " Re : Ms Ledger 's question , " writes Naylor .
" I think Mr Tyler is otherwise engaged and that we 're treated to Alan Parry today .
But in response to her question , jes . "
Half - time : West Ham go in a goal down , with Mido having thrown away a great chance to put them level .
I 'll be surprised if he comes out for the second half as his only other contribution of note was picking up a yellow card while he was still fuming after his miss from the spot .
Niall Harden writes : " Remember Republic of Ireland v Spain in 2002 ? " he asks .
" Those were some nailed - on missed penalties right there ! "
" There 's more chance of that Jesus bloke making a come back than west ham coming back in this one , " writes Anthony O'Connell , for the day that 's in it .
" Over here at Craven Cottage we 're witnessing Fulham 's worst home performance of the season by far , " writes Jared Barnes .
" Shocking how bad any team near the drop zone must be if Wigan are n't beating this Fulham performance !
Every year it seems like the relegation candidates are even worse . "
" You 'd think Howard Webb and the rest of the refs would want to help West Ham not get relegated , " writes Aidan Gibson .
" It 's increasingly looking like we get Millwall v West Ham next year in the Championship , and I pity the poor sod who refs that one . "
Jonathan Gard writes , again : " Who do you think would win between a tiger and a shark ? " he asks .
" This is given the lion / tiger debate was clearly in the tigers favour . "
That 's a tough question .
I suppose the outcome would depend largely on whether the bout was staged in the sea or on dry land .
West Ham get the second half started .
Before Howard Webb blew his whistle , Mido was having a great laugh with Carlton Cole .
I 'm not sure what 's more surprising : that he has n't been substituted or that he 's brave enough to crack wise after that penalty miss .
46 min : Play is halted after Leighton Baines goes down injured after miniimal contact with Junior Stanislas .
It looks like his studs got caught in the turf and he gave his left knee a wrench .
47 min : Baines is passed fit to continue , but is immediately called upon to shank a left - footed clearance down the field .
His subsequent wince suggests that really , really hurt .
48 min : Instead of holding up the ball and waiting for some of his team - mates to get into the Everton penalty area , Mido whips a cross into an area he must have known was n't going to be occupied by anyone in a West Ham shirt .
If it sounds like I 'm being harsh on him , it 's only because he 's been more of a hindrance than a help to the West Ham cause today .
50 min : That 's better .
With his back to goal about 40 yards from the Everton goal , Mido knocks the ball down to Carlton Cole , in a deeper position .
Cole bisects the Everton centre - halves with a marvellous throuhgh - ball , which Mido runs on to .
He shoots , but Jagielka recovers well to block .
Even if Mido had scored it would n't have counted as the linesman had flagged him for offside .
I do n't think he was .
53 min : " I 'm unsure as to the venue for the bout , but I believe the tiger would fare far better in water than the shark would on land , " writes Jonathan Gard , before adding the important caveat that the water would have to be " relatively shallow " .
54 min : West Ham are pressing Everton fairly hard at the moment , but without creating anything in the way of goalscoring chances .
Tim Cahill 's name goes into the referee 's notebook for a late challenge which resulted in him scissoring Scott Parker .
Free - kick for West Ham wide on the right , not within shooting range .
57 min : Gah , rubbish !
Mark Noble swings the free - kick high across the penalty area and out over the endline .
Goal - kick for Everton .
58 min : West Ham attack down the right , the ball is pinged into Mido in the Everton penalty area , where his touch lets him down .
He manages to win a corner but should have created a scoring chance .
GOAL !
Everton 1 - 1 West Ham ( Da Costa 58 ) From a corner , the ball drops bewtween Tim Cahill and Mark Da Costa on the edge of the Everton six - yard box .
Cahill does n't react quickly enough , allowing the West Ham defender to gouge the ball out of the turf and over Tim Howard from three or four yards .
It was n't pretty , but they all count .
62 min :
On the balance of second half play , West Ham probably deserve to be level .
They 've really taken the game to Everton since the interval .
In the passage of play leading up to the corner from which they scored , Mark Noble rattled the crossbar with a great effort from 20 yards .
64 min : West Ham continue to turn the screw .
On the bench , David Moyes tells Yakubu to put his game face on .
64 min : From an Everton corner , Radoslav Kovac wins two meaty challenges in quick succession and pings the ball to Junior Stanislas .
He gallops towards the Everton penalty area and slots a perfectly weighted pass into the path of Carlton Cole .
He scuffs his shot and sends a good scoring opportunity trickling harmlessly wide .
66 min : Cole goes down injured after a challenge from Johnny Heitinga .
After receiving treatment , he walks gingerly to the touchline and returns to the fray .
Everton substitution : Bilyaletdinov off , Yakubu on .
68 min : " I know not all my fellow Evertonians will agree ( though many will ) when I say that I 'm very pleased for Zola , " writes Gary Naylor .
69 min : " Re the shark vs the tiger , " adds Naylor .
" I remember reading that a shark keeps moving forward even when its brain is removed - like Mido . "
70 min : Mark Noble gets booked for a foul on ... oh , that has to be a penalty .
71 min : Wow .
West Ham dodge another bullet as Howard Webb fails to point to the spot after Louis Saha was brought down by Manuel Da Costa on the edge of the penalty area .
That should definitely have been a penalty , which may explain the boos currently ringing around Goodison Park .
73 min : It 's getting tasty .
The tackles are flying in all over the park as Howard Webb struggles to keep order .
It 's a lot more entertaining than the first half , that 's for sure .
75 min : Everton win a throw - in on the edge of the final third .
Pienaar takes the ball into the corner and West Ham win a free - kick deep , deep in their own territory for a Yakubu foul on Scott Parker .
75 min : Scott Parker wins a corner for West Ham , which Mark Noble chips in from the left .
As the ball sails in to the mixer , Howard Webb spots an infringement by Matthew Upson and awards Everton a free - kick .
78 min : West Ham susbtitution : Mido trudges off very , very slowly and is replaced by the Brazilian , Ilan , one of the 396 strikers the Hammers signed on transfer deadline day .
80 min : Zola applauds and roars encouragement from the sideline as West Ham continue their quest to find a winner .
" Surely , it 's more important to determine the type of shark involved than the venue ? " asks Ryan O'Connell , who makes an interesting point .
" I mean , a basking shark is n't going to trouble a tiger really , is it ? "
81 min : Everton attack , with Saha playing the ball out wide to Pienaar on the right touchline .
Scott Parker concedes a corner , which Leighton Baines trots across to send in with his left foot .
83 min : Baines sends the ball across the edge of the six yard box , but it 's too high for Tim Cahill .
The ball breaks and with his back to goal , Phil Jagielka tries a spectacular bicycle kick with predictably hilarious consequences .
GOAL !
Everton 2 - 1 West Ham ( Yakubu 85 ) After sustained pressure by Everton , Leighton Baines sends in a cross from the left wing .
Yakubu leaps majestically and powers an unstoppable header into the gap between Rob Green 's fingertip and right upright .
GOAL !
Everton 2 - 2 West Ham ( Ilan 87 ) The substitute Ilan scores with a marvellous diving header from 12 yards after flinging himself forwards to get on the end of a marvellous Julien Faubert cross from deep .
That 's a wonderful goal .
88 min : " What about a tiger versus a tiger shark ? " asks James Longhofer , apropos the serious business of the afternoon .
89 min : Matthew Upson concedes a free - kick in a dangerous position , about 45 yards out from his own goal .
Baines pings the ball into the penalty area , where Upson heads clear .
90 min : Junior Stanislas wastes a good attacking opportunity , shooting from a narrow angle when he should have picked out a team - mate with a cross .
90+1 min : West Ham win a corner , 90 seconds into the three minutes injury time signalled on the board .
90+3 min :
There 's a pause in play as Tim Cahill gets treated for an injury he picked up while helping his side defend a corner .
He appears to have hurt his back , perhaps by landing awkwardly on it after one of his trademark spring - heeled leaps .
West Ham substitution : Junior Stanislas off , Danny Gabbidon on to steady the ship .
West Ham will be delighted with a point here ;
It 'll end their run of seven straight defeats and put them a sliver of daylight between themselves and fellow relegation battlers Hull City .
Peep !
Peep !
Peep !
It 's all over .
West Ham win a priceless point with a marvellous goal from Ilan , the substitute .
Everton will defintiely see this as two points dropped rather than one gained .
West Ham stay in 17th place , but go a point ahead of Hull , albeit having played one game more .
Elsewhere in the Premier League today , Liverpool drew 1 - 1 with Birmingham , while Fulham beat Wigan 2 - 1 .
That 's your lot from me - thanks for your time and enjoy the rest of your Easter Sunday .
In gut einer Woche legt EADS Zahlen vor .
Bis dahin soll auch das leidige Thema A400 M vom Tisch sein - hofft zumindest die Politik .
Neue Gespräche zwischen Konzern und Abnehmerländern sind bereits geplant .
A400M : eine unendliche Geschichte .
( Foto : ASSOCIATED PRESS )
Im Streit über die Zukunft des Militärtransporters A400 M kommen die Staatssekretäre der Abnehmerländer Ende der Woche erneut zu Beratungen zusammen .
Die Beamten wollten das Antwortschreiben des Herstellers EADS auf das finale Angebot der Länder prüfen , sagte der Sprecher des Verteidigungsministeriums , Steffen Moritz .
Einzelheiten nannte er nicht .
EADS legt am Dienstag in einer Woche seine Geschäftszahlen vor und muss dafür seine Bücher schließen .
Die Verteidigungsminister der Abnehmerstaaten hoffen daher spätestens bei ihrem Treffen am Montag in Paris auf eine Einigung .
Der Konzern hatte zuletzt eine technische Vereinfachung des Transporters gefordert und eine größere Reduzierung der Flugzeugorder abgelehnt , mit der die Staaten bei Beibehaltung des alten Preises die Mehrkosten auffangen könnten .
Außerdem beharrt das Unternehmen darauf , Staatsbürgschaften in Höhe von 1,5 Mrd. Euro nicht als normale Kredite , sondern als Vorschüsse auf spätere Exportgewinne zu erhalten .
Andernfalls müsste EADS wohl höhere Rückstellungen ins seiner Bilanz für 2009 treffen .
Großbritannien will die 200 Mio. Euro , mit denen es sich an den Staatsbürgschaften beteiligt , nach Angaben aus Verhandlungskreisen jedoch nur als normale Kredite gewähren .
Deutschland und Frankreich dagegen seien bereit , die Gelder als Vorschüsse zu zahlen .
Imageprojekt mit Kratzern
Außerdem wollen die Abnehmerstaaten EADS um 2 Mrd. Euro Mehrkosten für den A400 M entlasten .
Der
Weg dorthin könnte allerdings noch steinig werden , da einige Länder dafür die Zahl der insgesamt 180 bestellten Flugzeuge kappen wollten .
Zwist könnte es auch zwischen Deutschland und EADS geben , falls die Bundesregierung auf dem Einbau des ursprünglich mitbestellten , aber technisch aufwendigen Tiefflug - Autopiloten besteht .
EADS will dagegen von den Staaten erreichen , dass sie auf teure Zusatzfähigkeiten verzichten .
Deutschland ist mit 60 Flugzeugen größter Abnehmer des A400 M , der bei der Bundeswehr die über 30 Jahre alten Transalls ersetzen soll .
Der Transporter soll im spanischen Sevilla gebaut werden .
Eine Kostenexplosion in Milliardenhöhe sowie die um Jahre verzögerte Entwicklung hatten die Zukunft des Flugzeuges jedoch infrage gestellt .
An dem europäischen Imageprojekt hängen 10.000 Arbeitsplätze .
Researchers at Centre for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications ( CREAF , a Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona - affiliated centre ) shed new light on the evolution of brain size in birds .
Scientists have known for some time that migratory birds have smaller brains than their resident relatives .
Now a new study looks into the reasons and concludes that the act of migrating leads to a reduced brain size .
Authors point to the fact that the causes could be due to a need to reduce energetic , metabolic and cognitive costs .
To reach these conclusions , scientists reconstructed the evolutionary history of one of the most numerous orders of birds , the passeriformes , a group which includes swallows , tits and crows .
Understanding brain evolution is something that has interested scientists since the times of Charles Darwin , who considered that the large size of a human brain went hand in hand with the exceptional cognitive capacities of our species .
One of the classic explanations is the protective brain theory , which suggests that a large brain -- in comparison to body size -- makes learning easier .
This protects individuals from changes in the environment , such as those produced by changes in season .
In the case of birds however not all species respond to seasonal changes in the same way .
Migratory birds avoid these changes by travelling to less inhospitable places when conditions worsen .
This is the strategy followed by swallows or cuckoos .
Resident bird species stay in the same area throughout the year and face strong environmental fluctuations .
Tits and crows belong to this group .
Previous studies showed that both strategies are related to differences in brain size .
The problem however is that it is often difficult to discern the causes and consequences of the differences observed .
CREAF researchers Daniel Sol and Núria Garcia , together with scientists from Canada and England , offer new research advances in an article published in the March edition of the journal PLoS One .
By analysing data from 600 passerine species in regions ranging from tropical to artic , Daniel Sol and colleagues confirm that migratory birds have smaller brains than their resident counterparts .
The question now is whether brain size determines lifestyle ( migratory or resident ) or whether lifestyle determines the size of the brain .
According to the protective brain theory , being a resident bird makes it easier for the brain to grow and this for example facilitates acquiring alternative food - finding strategies for the winter months .
Nevertheless , the study reveals the complete opposite and points to the fact that being a migratory bird is what makes these birds have smaller brains .
Researchers came to this conclusions by reconstructing the evolutionary history of passerine birds and determining the sequence of evolutionary changes which most probably led to the current situation .
In the case of this group of birds " the first step was changing from a resident to a migratory life and the second step was a reduction in the size of the brains of migratory birds , " Daniel Sol explains .
" Therefore , " he adds , " differences in brain sizes are not caused by nature 's need to provide resident species with larger brains , as suggested in the protective brain theory , but to provide migratory species with smaller brains . "
Normally a larger brain offers many advantages .
Then why is it that in the case of migratory birds natural selection has favoured smaller brains ?
The study highlights various explanations , but the general idea focuses on the possibility that a large brain does not necessarily have to be better .
According to Daniel Sol , " the brain is an organ that consumes a lot of energy and develops slowly and this can be too costly for migratory species which must travel far and have little time to reproduce . "
At the same time , the reduction in brain volume could also be caused by a decrease in cognitive functions no longer useful to migratory species .
He goes on to say that , " For birds that travel a lot , exploring their surroundings produces more costs than benefits since the information which is useful in one place is not necessarily so in another .
It also exposes them to more dangers .
For these reasons we believe that for these species , their innate behaviour can be more useful than learned behaviour . "
Based on these conclusions , the authors of the research recommend an in - depth analysis of certain areas of the brain such as the pallium and telencephalon , involved in learning and behaviour innovation processes .
They believe these areas could be less developed in migratory birds than in resident birds since the cost - benefit balance in these processes does not favour the species .

TAIPEI ( Reuters Life ! ) - A Taiwan potter is producing razor - thin ceramic bowls , raising a historic Chinese art form to a fragile , new high and aiming to sell the 0.2 - mm ( 0.008 inch ) thick wares in China at a hefty price .
Taipei - area potter Huang Cheng - nan has made eight of what he says are the world ’s thinnest bowls , some suitable for a scoop of rice and one big enough to mix punch .
But even the clink of a spoon could shatter the ceramics , the smaller of which sell for T$ 200,000 ( $ 6,350 ) .
“ I ’ve been at this for more than 10 years , but I ’ve only made them successfully since last year , ” Huang , 55 , said in his studio where he broke thousands of pieces before cracking the technique .
“ The difficulty is extreme .
A lot of bowls get broken . ”
Chinese have made ceramics over about 2,000 years for utilitarian and religious purposes as well as for decoration , with very thin bowls especially prized .
These wares are often characterized by ornate paintings , support legs and lids with handles .
Huang , a ceramics maker by trade , got started on his bowls after he saw ultra - thin , record - breaking wares in China and brought some back to Taiwan to study .
He says his bowls are more than twice as thin as the thinnest in China .
“ You would n’t want to eat out of one , ” Huang quipped .
“ That would cause breakage . ”
Huang imports specialized clay and hires painters to do patterns on the white bowls .
His shop in Yingge , a Taipei suburb known for ceramics production , aims to exhibit at World Expo 2010 in Shanghai in May .
After that he will set a price for the larger bowls and offer it for sale in China .
Former President George W. Bush ’s memoir , “ Decision Points , ” will be released by Crown Publishers , a division of Random House , on Nov. 9 , the publisher said on Monday .
Mr. Bush will write about political and personal challenges and discuss his handling of events , including the Sept. 11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina , as well as embracing his faith amid an effort to quit drinking .
In a news release , Crown said that Mr. Bush would focus on 14 critical decisions in his life and share his reflections on subjects including the closely fought 2000 presidential election and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Crown said that Mr. Bush had given few speeches or interviews since leaving office .
“ Instead , he has spent almost every day writing ‘ Decision Points , ’ ” the release said , adding , “ He writes honestly and directly about his flaws and mistakes , as well as his historic achievements . ”
The book will be released in hardcover and in audio and e-book formats .
Mr. Bush will also go on a national book tour .
In 1981 , Israel destroyed Iraq ’s nuclear reactor at Osirak , declaring it could not live with the chance the country would get a nuclear weapons capability .
In 2007 , it wiped out a North Korean - built reactor in Syria .
And the next year , the Israelis secretly asked the Bush administration for the equipment and overflight rights they might need some day to strike Iran ’s much better - hidden , better - defended nuclear sites .
They were turned down , but the request added urgency to the question : Would Israel take the risk of a strike ?
And if so , what would follow ?
Now that parlor game question has turned into more formal war games simulations .
The government ’s own simulations are classified , but the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution created its own in December .
The results were provocative enough that a summary of them has circulated among top American government and military officials and in many foreign capitals .
For the sake of verisimilitude , former top American policymakers and intelligence officials — some well known — were added to the mix .
They played the president and his top advisers ; the Israeli prime minister and cabinet ; and Iranian leaders .
They were granted anonymity to be able to play their roles freely , without fear of blowback .
( This reporter was invited as an observer . )
A report by Kenneth M. Pollack , who directed the daylong simulation , can be found at the Saban Center ’s Web site .
It was fun while it lasted .
The " etiquette " posters which a New York artist has put up in the Subway system are apparently themselves an example of bad behavior .
I blogged Wednesday about artist Jason Shelowitz 's " guerilla art " , posters he created based on Subway pet peeves .
The posters encourage Subway riders to keep their hands to themselves , their music to themselves , their religious views to themselves .
My favorite poster warns against clipping fingernails on the Subway .
" It 's crazy that this even needs to be mentioned , " the poster states .
It was a crazy , funny idea .
Subway authorities , however , are not amused .
Putting up posters without permission in the Subway carries a $ 25 fine .
" These posters were not authorized and will be taken down , " the MTA 's Deirdre Parker tells CNBC .
They 're apparently coming down Thursday night .
Shelowitz was not aware of this when I contacted him .
" I have seen MTA workers read them and laugh without taking them down , " he said .
" A friend saw MTA workers putting up actual service change posters around one of mine and they left it up .
This may be a generalization , but it seems that the MTA likes the posters . "
Not everyone likes them at headquarters .
But good luck finding the posters .
Shelowitz says he only put up a hundred of them , and regular riders have taken many of them down as mementos .
" This whole thing is spreading wildly over the internet , " the artist says , " but there are so few physical posters out there .
It 's almost comical .
It just goes to show you that you do n't need to make thousands of these things to get your point across . "
Maybe the MTA should focus on people clipping their nails on the Subway rather than go after some guy who 's trying to remind riders to be civil .
Just sayin' .
But Shelowitz is ... politely ... refusing to back down .
" There are another 200 or so ( posters ) to put up , and I will continue to do so until I am asked to stop . "

CLEVELAND , Ohio --
The 28 - year - old Cleveland woman whose body was left on Interstate 90 was killed for her clothes and jewelry after she and the accused killers were involved in a minor car accident , prosecutors said today .
Angel Bradley - Crockett was dressed nicely to spend the evening of April 4 with friends .
She was driving her mother 's car and got into a minor wreck with a van .
This is what happened , according to prosecutors :
Stephon Davis , 30 , was driving the van and his 33 - year - old girlfriend , Latesha Santos , was with him .
After the accident , they persuaded Bradley - Crockett to follow them to East 66th Street and Charter Avenue , a secluded area near his home .
The couple , who have a son together , pulled Bradley - Crockett into the van , where she was beaten , strangled with a ligature and stripped of her clothes , wallet and jewelry ; two wedding rings , a watch and a necklace .
Her body was pushed out of the van on Interstate 90 under the West 44th Street overpass , where a motorist reported seeing it at 4:30 a.m. April 5 .
Two Cleveland police officers , Matthew Prince and David Muniz , sent to investigate the report mistook the body for a deer carcass .
The officers face a disciplinary hearing next month and could be suspended for up to 30 days or fired .
Santos and Davis both face the death penalty .
They were indicted today on charges of aggravated murder , kidnapping , aggravated robbery , felonious assault , theft , tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse .
Prosecutors said that Davis borrowed the van from a friend .
When the friend found blood in it the next day , he called police .
The Cuyahoga County coroner matched the blood to Bradley - Crockett 's DNA .
The van and Bradley - Crockett 's mother 's car have damage consistent with their being involved in a minor accident , prosecutor 's spokesman Ryan Miday said .
Santos was on probation when the homicide occurred .
Davis was wanted on three warrants for failing to appear in court on traffic charges .
Santos ' criminal history includes drug possession and escape .
She was sentenced Aug. 9 to a year of probation and in - patient treatment for drug abuse .
She has misdemeanor convictions for having an open container of alcohol and disorderly conduct .
Davis ' criminal history includes trafficking in cocaine in 2001 , drug trafficking in 2002 , and a federal conviction for dealing crack in 2004 .
He served time in a juvenile detention facility , until he turned 21 , for killing his aunt 's boyfriend .
Davis is due back in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court at 9 a.m. Friday .
Judge Joseph Russo is handling the case .
As is the fashion in the music industry at the moment , Dizzee Rascal is re-releasing his most recent album Tongue n’ Cheek with a few added bonus tracks .
It ’s a fucking sham honestly .
He has already released a HMV version and a fucking Christmas version too .
Anyway , this new track Dirtee Disco ( is anyone else getting bored of the word dirtee ? ) is going to be released as a single from it , on you guessed it , the 24th May .
I wo n’t be marking that date in my diary , as for me this track is pretty weak .
It ’s in the style of Dance wiv Me and Holiday , ( which is n’t necessarily a bad thing ) but it ’s just getting a bit boring now .
I even kind of miss some of his older stuff .
The verses are decent , and they have a great bassline running through them , but the chorus makes me want to punch him in the face .
I think it ’s atrocious , but decide for yourselves !

A drug trafficking gang shipped a truck kitted up like an off - road racer to the Dakar Rally , transporting 1,800 lb. of cocaine , 15,000 ecstasy tablets and 4.5 kilos of hashish from Argentina to Ibiza .

According to a police statement , the goal of the clever drug gang was to get drugs transported from South America to Spain and then to Ibiza without raising any suspicion .
Police Statement
" The vehicle had been totally transformed to adapt it to its supposed participation in the competition as a support truck , with publicity and logos of the event painted on its side . "

They even had Dakar - spec uniforms made up for the drivers and raced the truck and the drugs out during one of the stages .
It almost worked , but police in Bilbao , Spain and inspected the car and found the gigantic stash .
Perhaps listing " Francisco 's Cartel " as a sponsor was a bit short - sighted .

Apple detractors often like to say that Apple ’s popularity is the result of sexy and persuasive advertising that creates an unjustified aura of “ coolness ” around their products .
Moreover , these detractors argue that Apple initiated hype is the driving force behind their success , never mind a solid track record of delivering thoughtfully designed and well - engineered products .
The truth is that the vast majority of hype surrounding Apple and their products is rooted in the tireless efforts of Apple ’s legion of devoted users .
Call them fanboys if you must , but Apple ’s cachet of “ cool ” comes from the ground up , from the mass of users who still harbor fond memories of their first Apple product .
In short , Apple does n’t need to generate hype because it has millions of consumers who serve as free sounding boards for the company .
The iPad launch , though , was different .
In addition to the expected cadre of tech reviews and news segments , Apple used the 3 - 4 days before launch day to roll out an impressive media marketing blitz that saw the iPad pop up all over the place .
News wise , early reviews of the iPad began to trickle in on Wednesday afternoon with the usual suspects ( Mossberg , Pogue , Inhatko ) offering glowing reviews of Apple ’s latest device .
But in an interesting twist , Apple also lent out review units of the iPad to outlets that do n’t typically receive pre-releases from Cupertino , such as BoingBoing and PC Mag .
Okay , so maybe that ’s not really a “ twist ” per say , but Apple clearly wanted to get the iPad out to more media outlets than usual , a fact which underscores just how important a successful launch was to Apple .
Media wise , things got off to a rousing start with a clever and strategic piece of product placement on the ABC hit show “ Modern Family . ”
A large portion of the plot revolved around the father , Phil Dunphy , desperately wanting an iPad and his family ’s bumbling attempts to actually land him one .
And lest there be any confusion , the episode went full force in its description of the device , with the following exchange taking place early in the episode .
Phil : “ The iPad comes out on my actual birthday .
It ’s like Steve Jobs and God got together to say , ‘ We love you , Phil . ' ”
Claire : “ What ’s so great about that doo - hickey , anyhow ? ”
Phil : “ Doo-hickey , Ellie May ?
It ’s a movie theater , a library , and a music store all rolled into one awesome … pad . ”
The iPad-centric episode of “ Modern Family ” was a homerun for many reasons .
First , it ’s a smartly written show that attracts a more desirable demographic of users than , say , Microsoft ’s attempt to push Windows 7 via Family Guy .
Second , and more importantly , the product placement on Modern Family was seamless to the extent that the plot not only made sense from the vantage point of the father , but that it fit perfectly into the spirit of the show as well .
That being the case , Apple was able to get one of the more popular television shows on the air to paint the iPad as a cool device that you just have to have without making the audience feel that they were having an ad forced down their throats .
And for that , you have to give props to Apple ’s ad team for recognizing the existent chemistry between a show like Modern Family and the iPad .
Driving the point home , imagine how out of place Apple ’s product placement would have been if they had Jim ’s character from The Office going nuts trying to get an iPad .
It just does n’t work .
While many think Apple pays for prominent product placement , that ’s not usually , if ever , the case .
Typically , Apple gives out Apple hardware to popular television shows for free in exchange for subtle product placement .
But how does that explain Apple ’s tour de force iPad plot on Modern Family ?
Well , bear in mind that ABC is owned and operated by Disney .
And oh yeah , a guy by the name of Steve Jobs not only sits on the board of directors at Disney , but is also their single largest individual stockholder .
It pays to have friends in high places … especially if that friend is you .
But Wednesday was just the beginning of Apple ’s TV blitz .
On Thursday evening , the ever popular Steven Colbert showcased an iPad and used it to cut up salsa , while also saving time to make a funny joke about poor iPhone reception and the sad fact that , as opposed to Apple , Amazon has to pay for Kindle coverage .
Funnyman ( and I use the term loosely here ) David Letterman also got in on the iPad action this past Thursday when he devoted an entire Top 10 list to the iPad titled , “ Top 10 question to ask yourself before waiting in line for the iPad . ”
You can check out that gem below .
But last week was n’t just about TV for the iPad .
On Thursday morning April 1 , it was reported that Steve Jobs would grace the cover of the upcoming issue of Time Magazine .
And just in case Jobs ’ mug was n’t enough to attract reader attention , Apple ensured a ton of press coverage due to a rare interview Stephen Fry was allowed to conduct with Jobs for a piece profiling both Jobs and the upcoming iPad .
There ’s no denying that Apple is bigger than Steve Jobs , but Jobs himself remains an icon that attracts eyeballs and attention wherever he goes .
Jobs and Apple are aware of this , and as they did with Time , will use that to their advantage .
Next up , former SNL vet Jimmy Fallon and Engadget editor Joshua Topolsky played with an iPad on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on Friday night , the day before launch .
Now take all of the above and wrap it up with an endless amount of media coverage from national and local news outlets and it was hard to go anywhere without being inundated with iPad related media coverage .
With a new Apple product , you can usually expect to see some new commercials and maybe a Steve Jobs interview on CNBC , but the iPad push last week was unprecedented for a new Apple product .
Apple ’s iPad marketing blitz was overt , in your face , and luckily for Apple , it all worked .
They picked their spots well , hit all the major nerve centers of information and entertainment , and used that to sell 300,000 iPads on Saturday alone .
Nicely done .
Here 's a brilliant story about a woman elected to Westminster who sued the Express for misrepresentation .
The newspaper described Vera , Lady Terrington , newly elected Liberal candidate for Wycombe as heading for a future of " furs and pearls " .
Tragically , even though the focus of her campaign was women 's rights , she lost her libel case .
The jury thought that what women in public life wear was a legitimate matter of public interest .
Apart from the name , ( mmm , where are all the Vera , Lady Terringtons now ? ) it could have been yesterday .
In fact it was 1923 .
Women in parliament were a novelty .
Come to think of it , women with the vote were a novelty .
It is an acknowledged fact , of course , that embedding political change takes time , yet if in the election of 2010 , a similar court case was brought , how easy it is to imagine it producing a similar outcome .
( If in doubt follow this link )
It is as if , remarked one poster recently in response to a piece about the absence of women , the whole election was taking place in about 1950 .
I do n't think this is entirely about women .
All sorts of things are going on : the campaign coverage is dominated by the televised debates and the Clegg factor .
Not many other politicians at all are getting much space on the airwaves or in the press .
The differences on the most pressing policy areas – the economy and Afghanistan – are of timing rather than substance , the " narcissism of small difference " as the Guardian editorial put it on Friday .
Reporting of politics is increasingly trivial ( see politicians ' wives , passim ) .
And of course even if you do n't see the women , they are there .
Harriet Harman and Tessa Jowell still feel they are playing an important role , even if last Thursday 's debate aftermath was my first sighting of either for at least a fortnight .
Across the three largest parties , 25 % of candidates are women , up two points on the last campaign .
Where male MPs are retiring , Labour and the Lib Dems have selected women to replace them in half the seats , the Tories in 27 % .
On the current poll standings , there should be slightly more women in parliament on May 7th , perhaps up to 23 % according to the invaluable work being done by the Centre for women in democracy from 19.8 % .
Not quite measurable on the Richter scale of political upheaval , but progress .
But it is also the case that although the last generation of women MPs toiled hard and sometimes effectively ( the latest crime figures , for example , suggest Jacqui Smith was more useful at the Home Office than some have previously allowed ) , after the first term when Mo Mowlem and Clare Short brought drama and transformation to everyday politics , it seems many decided it was safer to keep their heads down , or to give in and play the media game .
There are few dominant women MPs , and not many men either .
It has hardly been a shining era for big political personalities anywhere at Westminster , only of big political disasters ( an area where women finally appeared to compete on level terms with men ) .
Our whole political culture is in crisis , and the absence of visible women participants is a symptom as well as a cause .
Watch the Lib Dems on this : gender equality is not at the heart of their programme .
But voting reform is .
Changing the way we do politics is beginning to have an effect in the devolved parliaments and assemblies .
It could work at Westminster too .
Imagine a real challenge to the three party leaders who have so much more in common than they have to divide them , a world where every time public spending cuts were mentioned , a voice argued this one disproportionately hurts women , or where Afghanistan was mentioned someone who asked , is this actually working ?
Meanwhile , cling on to the Terrington rules .
For Vera 's fate has turned out to be a foretelling of the life of women in politics for the rest of the 20th century .
Frocks are like sex – great fun , but not part of your politics .
And never , ever make jokes .
At least not about frocks .
From The Plum Line -- Halperin Takes A Stand :
It is n’t every day that a consumate inside - game reporter / pundit type like Mark Halperin aggressively calls out one party for lying , but that ’s exactly what Halperin did early this morning on MSNBC , talking about the GOP claim that the Dem financial reg reform bill will lead to a permanent bailout .
Per the transcript : JOE SCARBOROUGH : Just this once , defend the Republican position .
MARK HALPERIN : I cannot defend what they ’re doing .
MIKA BRZEZINSKI : Oh , please .
SCARBOROUGH : Look at you !
Look at you !
[ CROSSTALK ] HALPERIN :
They are willfully misreading the bill or they are engaged in a cynical attempt to keep the president from achieving something .
Mitch McConnell , when your lies are so bad you 've lost Mark Halperin , you 're in trouble buddy .
As Steve Benen noted , it looks like McConnell is toning down the rhetoric already :
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) had taken the lead in trying to kill Wall Street reform .
Today , on the Senate floor , he struck a less antagonistic tone , and there were signs of possible progress .
... McConnell said the progress is the result of his threats and the letter with 41 Republican signatures vowing to unanimously oppose the legislation .
Democrats are suggesting the progress is the result of a ) McConnell struggling to keep his caucus united ; b ) bad press after McConnell was caught blatantly lying ; c ) bad press after the secretive trip to Wall Street by GOP leaders ; or d ) some combination of all of them .
As Steve noted though , that does n't mean the Republicans wo n't just decide to obstruct later .
It ’s a quiet night .
You ’re driving your girlfriend home from the movies in your dusty , beat - up pickup truck .
The moonlight casts strange shadows in the town square as you slow to a stop under a flickering streetlight .
Something catches your eye in the rearview mirror just as your girlfriend lets out a blood - curdling scream — your truck ’s suddenly surrounded !
By something big , animals ?
No , big , bigger , they ’re … people ?
Bloody arms in tattered rags start smacking the truck and hollow eyes connect with yours through the window .
As your girlfriend frantically pushes down locks you hit the gas and scream down side roads till you get to your aunt and uncle ’s 24 - hour diner .
Swerving into the gravelly parking lot you ’re met with disaster .
You race past blood - splattered shoes and broken glass on the walk before kicking open the screen door to a nightmare scene .
The place is full of zombies and they spot you immediately .
You glance back and see your girlfriend screaming as they ’ve surrounded her and started rocking the truck .
As they awkwardly tipsy - teeter towards you from all directions , you scramble behind the counter , desperate for something , anything , to fight them off .
Suddenly your eyes spot an old wooden box under the counter with a big padlock on it .
You bootkick it open and rip back the lid just as you hear the glass shatter outside and your girlfriend scream .
It ’s a massive stash of weapons .
AWESOME !
Happy April Fool ’s Day !

More 12 year olds have used potentially lethal inhalants than have used marijuana , cocaine and hallucinogens combined , according to data released March 11 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ( SAMHSA ) in conjunction with the 18th annual National Inhalants & Poisons Awareness Week .
The National Inhalant Prevention Coalition ( NIPC ) and SAMHSA kicked off National Inhalants and Poisons Awareness
Week at a press conference featuring information and personal stories about the dangers of inhalant use or " huffing . "
One of the leading participants in this year 's event was the American Osteopathic Association ( AOA ) , which represents more than 67,000 osteopathic physicians ( DOs ) .
The organization urged its members to take continuing education programs designed to help enhance physician awareness of this risk to youth .
The need to increase awareness of this public health risk among physicians , parents and others cannot come too soon for Kevin Talley , the father of Amber Ann Suri , who died in February 2009 after huffing .
Her parents suspected something was going on when they noticed she had a pungent smell , glassy eyes , and complained about sinus problems .
Although she was taken to a doctor , her real problem was not identified and she was treated only for her sinus symptoms .
She died shortly thereafter .
Ashley Upchurch , a 17 year - old recovering from addiction to inhalants and other drugs , spoke at the press conference about the consequences of huffing , the importance of identifying and treating inhalant abuse and the hope of recovery .
" Inhalants were a cheap , legal , and an intense high that would also enhance the feeling I would get from other drugs , " she said .
" These highs nearly destroyed my life . "
In recovery for two years , Ashley now participates in a recovery program and is " giving back by sharing my story of hope with others . "
Young people sniff products such as refrigerant from air conditioning units , aerosol computer cleaners , shoe polish , glue , air fresheners , hair sprays , nail polish , paint solvents , degreasers , gasoline or lighter fluids .
Youngsters intentionally inhale these substances to get high .
Most parents are not aware that use of inhalants can cause " Sudden Sniffing Death " -- immediate death due to cardiac arrest -- or lead to addiction and other health risks .
SAMHSA data from the 2006 - 2008 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health show a rate of lifetime inhalant use among 12 year olds of 6.9 percent , compared to a rate of 5.1 percent for nonmedical use of prescription type drugs ; a rate of 1.4 percent for marijuana ; a rate of 0.7 percent for use of hallucinogens ; and a 0.1 rate for cocaine use .
" We continue to face the challenge of increasing experimentation and intentional misuse of common household products among the youngest and most vulnerable segments of our population -- 12 year olds .
The data are ominous and their implications are frightening because of the toxic , chemical effects of these legal products on growing minds and bodies .
One of the front - line defenses against inhalant use is the family health care provider .
This is why the action of the American Osteopathic Association is so important and why we are so proud that they are joining us and our partners in this public health campaign , " Harvey Weiss , NIPC executive director , said .
A veteran party reporter is rarely struck with abject terror , but just such a moment occurred last night when we got an e-mail regarding a Tribeca Film Festival dinner for the independent movie Get Low .
“ You ’re sitting at Bill Murray ’s table , ” it read .
We have met Murray — who in Get Low plays a thirties funeral director planning a “ live funeral party ” for an aging hermit ( Robert Duvall ) — so we know that he is possibly the most charming and capriciously moody person on earth .
So as a public service to those of you who may someday find yourself in the exhilarating - slash - nerve - racking position of having a meal with Bill Murray , here is a guide so that you may avoid our mistakes .
• Murray , who is unfailingly polite , will remember that he has met you and where it happened .
You will spend the dinner wondering if he also remembers that he seemed to not like you .
• If you are a lady , he will stand up when you take your seat and remain standing until you pull your chair in .
He will do this for every female at his table .
You soon will start making an effort to sit down and stand up faster .
• He will commit to memory the name of everyone at the table , making introductions each time a new person sits down .
• He will make friends with the waiters and give them nicknames .
“ Handsome ” will now be your server .
• He will intentionally mishear offhand comments you make about the food and repeat them endlessly .
You say , “ seafood , ” he hears “ zebra . ”
You call the roasted carrots “ exciting ” ; he hears “ Poseidon . ”
As in , “ Zebra !
I never get to eat zebra !
Want some zebra ? ” or “ Have some Poseidon .
Some Poseidon .
Some Poseidon . ”
• And while you are on the subject of South by Southwest , you may mention that you saw this video of Murray tending bar at a random Austin establishment .
Murray will at first enjoy talking about this — about how he went to see GZA perform and brought him and RZA to the bar , where the bartenders told Murray they ’d make more tips if he helped them serve drinks .
He ’ll tell you that he forgot that , GZA , as a major stoner , has no tolerance for alcohol , and that the rapper got so wasted after Murray gave him a shot and a half of tequila that GZA did n’t make it to his second performance at midnight .
You might become emboldened to ask another direct question , something silly along the lines of , “ I heard that you only served tequila , even when people asked for whiskey ! ”
And without answering , Murray will stand up and excuse himself , never to return .
The table will grow silent and you will nervously titter to your tablemate ( Karen Duffy — Duff from MTV ) , that you ’re worried you just scared Murray off by being too nosy , and she will laugh and say , “ Yeah , you probably did . ”
• He will take charge of the ordering and the serving of family - style dishes .
If you are at Wall & Water , and Handsome brings cranberry chutney instead of the black - currant chutney Murray thinks is just “ divine ” with pecorino and soppressata , Murray will pull Handsome over , hold the chutneys side by side , and say : “ Take a look , Handsome , what ’s wrong with this ? ”
If Handsome places the new supply of meats and cheeses with the cheese facing Murray , he will kindly ask Handsome to turn the plate around .
“ It ’s the ladies who really want this cheese , and I just do n’t want their nails coming for me when they grab it . ”
• He will tell his most animated stories when you have turned away to talk to other people in an effort to make him believe you are not hanging on his every word .
You may hear the word “ tequila ” coming over and over from Murray ’s direction as he mimes the pouring of a bottle into his mouth , and the tale gets louder and , apparently , more hilarious .
When you finally turn back , the story over , and when you ask your laughing dinner companions what you missed , they will say , “ Oh , just Bill talking about his early 20s . ”
• You may , however , hear some stories about Bill Murray from movie producers also seated at the table .
How , for example , he ’s superstitious and wo n’t sign contracts until after a movie is finished , meaning the producers have to secure millions of dollars of financing and insurance on Murray ’s word .
( Which is apparently unshakable once he ’s given it . )
• He might mention the Roebling Tea Room , where his son is a cook , and “ they ’re very proud of their kale . ”
He might then discuss how he likes to walk the nearby streets in Williamsburg late at night , and how he shot a movie on the south side when it was just Hasids and hookers , and the Hasids would stand outside late at night telling dirty jokes .
( “ They were n’t on the street reading the Word , I can tell you that . ” )
• If and when the conversation switches to South by Southwest , you may hear the tale of how some random guy joined the Get Low entourage by pretending to be friends with Sissy Spacek ’s daughter , Schuyler , and only began to arouse suspicion after several hours of not talking to Schuyler and not knowing anything about Schuyler and insisting on riding in Murray ’s car instead of with Schuyler .
You may also hear about how Murray engineered an escape plan that involved their entire entourage jumping from the car into rickshaws , and turned around to find the random guy hanging off the back of the rickshaw .
And you may hear how the next day , Murray and company faked a letter to Schuyler from said stalker , sticking it under her hotel door and leaving for a day on the town , only to come back and find a worried Spacek and Schuyler consulting with hotel security and / or the cops .
You will probably not be surprised to discover that Murray was the member of the group fully committed to continuing the prank for the rest of the festival .
If you crack a joke at this point , he will stare at you and say , “ Do n’t joke ; this is serious ! ”
• And while you are on the subject of South by Southwest , you may mention that you saw this video of Murray tending bar at a random Austin establishment .

Some Princeton researchers made a demonstration video of how it 's possible to steal an election with a Diebold voting machine in under a minute .
Anyone with physical access to the machine can put in malicious software to steal votes — such as election workers who have unsupervised access to the machines before elections .
All they have to do is open up the machine with a key ( or pick the lock ) , remove the old memory card , stick in your own memory card , boot the machine , and it automatically installs any software that was on the memory card .

At the end of the demonstration election , the poll machine prints out the incorrect " stolen election " result .
The internal memory card also stores in the incorrect result .
Every piece of evidence of how the election actually went reflects the " wrong " result .
And , after the election is over , the vote stealing software can delete itself .
There 's no evidence left that the vote has been conducted incorrectly .
There 's even a flaw in Diebold machines that allow a virus to spread from machine to machine , infecting a memory card and using it to spread to other machines .
