The Sputnik launch is n't the only big anniversary this month ; Slashdot is celebrating , too .
The influential " news for nerds " site famous for swamping unsuspecting websites with boatloads of traffic turns 10 in October , and parties are popping up all around the country .
It all started in 1997 , in a time before there was Gmail .
Slashdot founder and editor Rob Malda , aka CmdrTaco , wanted a non-college - affiliated e-mail address , so he simply registered his own domain name .
And while he was at it , he decided to add a little humor and make the url as unpronounceable as possible : " H , T , T , P , colon , slash , slash , slashdot , dot , org . "
What Malda did n't expect was that Slashdot would become one of the most popular geek news sites on the web , overloading so many websites ' servers that the phrase " Slashdot effect " would be coined .
Wired News spoke with Malda by phone Wednesday as he got ready for the Slashdot 10th anniversary celebrations at his home base in Michigan .

Wired News : Did you ever think Slashdot would make it to 10 years ?
Rob Malda : No .
When I registered the domain name it was supposed to be a joke , and I wanted an e-mail address that was n't my college 's e-mail .
The website was built out of my blog – though they did n't call them blogs back then – because I wanted to have a web server I could Perl and hack around on .
There was no premeditation , and it was three or four months before I realized Slashdot meant anything .
WN : So when did you know that Slashdot was turning into something ?
Malda :
There was a log file that would slowly scroll across your screen .
It used to be that I 'd look at the log every few days and see we had X number of hits .
But one night we were just hanging out in our living room and watching the log scroll by and it was just hit , hit , hit .
And they were coming from MIT and Carnegie Mellon and Stanford and Microsoft and Red Hat and big companies and big institutions of higher learning .
Before that , my only real comprehension of the size of Slashdot was that I was getting a lot of e-mail , hundreds of e-mails , but that never mentally translated into , " OMG !
People in Germany are reading this thing ! "
WN : So you had hundreds of articles in your inbox and people all over the world following Slashdot .
Why did you decide to keep Slashdot a user - submitted , editor - evaluated site instead of crowdsourcing the job of posting articles ?
Malda :
When you 're building a system like this you 're balancing the wisdom of the crowds versus the tyranny of the mob .
Sometimes a crowd is really smart , but some things do n't work so well by committee .
Crowds work when you have a tightly knit group of people with similar interests , but when you have a loosely knit community you get " Man Gets Hit in Crotch With Football " and Everybody Loves Raymond , where it 's just good enough to not suck .
At the end of the day I want to be able to say , " These are good stories . "
WN : And the users can tell you whether they think the stories are good in the comments .
When you started this , what made you think comments were going to be as important as they 've become ?
Malda : I never thought of not having comments .
I started with BBSes in the 1980s and was using Usenet .
I do n't understand why you would build a site without comments .
That 's what the internet is for : people communicating .
I think we got lucky that the people reading Slashdot were techies who also grew up with BBSes and Usenet and they also would n't have imagined not having user comments .
WN : What do you think has helped Slashdot reach its 10th anniversary ?
Malda :
Over the years the site has developed something of a personality .
There are certain subject matters that we 're going to discuss and there are certain subjects we 're not going to discuss .
We 're going to cover what 's happening with Linux , who 's building new technology and what companies are taking your right away to play with that technology .
There are n't a lot of websites that are focuses .
Everybody tries to be everything and no one does one thing that they 're really good at .
WN : So it 's all about having your niche ?
Malda :
That 'd be the much more concise way to say it .
WN : Looking back at the last decade , what are your top Slashdot moments ?
Malda : I have to mention that I proposed to my wife on Slashdot .
That was pretty cool .
And then there have been a number of stories where we went out of our normal bubble and stuck our noses in something else .
Those somethings were ( the ) Columbine ( school shootings ) and Sept. 11 .
Sept. 11 was interesting because a lot of the mainstream websites that were online were getting so overburdened with traffic that they were getting shut down .
My team worked really , really , really hard to keep the site up and there was a lot of traffic on the site that day .
We 'll never know the numbers , because we had to turn off the clock to save processor cycles .
But we managed to stay up and that was a real shining day because of what we had to get done .
It was a pretty shitty day , but I was very proud of everybody at Slashdot that day .
And then there was Columbine .
Columbine was weird because the mainstream media really took on a specific view of what happened and the Slashdot audience took a very different view of that event .
The discussions on Slashdot were very heartfelt and meaningful .
Instead of reading the mainstream media stories about videogames causing kids to be evil , you were reading stories about what happens to kids being beaten up for four years .
When the bully jocks kick a helpless kid , it 's not surprising that every now and then someone 's going to snap .
So there 's a happy and two less - happy moments in Slashdot history .
WN : And what 's next for Slashdot ?
Malda :
People always ask me that , and if in 10 years from now Slashdot is the same as it was 10 years ago , I 'll think we 're doing something right .
If we continue to maintain the level of article selection and user discussion then I 'm a happy camper .
A basic tenet of object oriented coding is encapsulation : expose the interface but hide the implementation .
Seductress that it is , Python makes it very tempting to violate this principle .
Since all members of an object are public , it ’s easy to access and modify them from outside .
For example :
class Person : def __init__( self ) : self.age = None jeff = Person ( ) jeff.age = 5 # maturity
Compare this with Java , where you can make a member private , and use “ getters ” and “ setters ” :
class Person { private int age ; public int getAge ( ) { return this .age ; } public void setAge ( int age ) { this .age = age ; } public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { Person jeff = new Person ( ) ; jeff.setAge( 5 ) ; } }
The Java version has better encapsulation .
If you decide later to change “ age ” to , say , a float , a string ( ! ) , or if you move it into another internally linked object , it ’s no big deal .
Just change the body of the getAge ( ) and setAge ( ) methods to do the typecasting or make the extra call , and you wo n’t need to change any other code .
The implementation changes ; the interface stays the same .
Of course , you could write getters and setters in Python , too , but you ca n’t enforce their use ( data members are public , remember ? ) .
A better way is to do some magic using __getattr__ and __setattr__ , although that could get messy , especially if you have a lot of names to intercept .
This has been bothering me for a while .
Then I recently discovered the built - in function property ( ) , which lets you rewrite the example above as follows :
class Person ( object ) : def __init__( self ) : self._age = None def get_age ( self ) : return self .
_age def set_age ( self , value ) : self._age = value def del_age ( self ) : del self .
_age age = property ( get_age , set_age , del_age ) jeff = Person ( ) jeff.age = 5
Sweeeet .
From the outside , nothing seems different : it still appears that you ’re getting and setting age directly , just as before .
But property ( ) calls get_age and set_age transparently , giving you a layer that effectively provides encapsulation , even though you ca n’t tell from the outside .
After all , that ’s the whole point of encapsulation : you should n’t be able to tell from the outside .
In fact , this is actually better than how Java does it .
A first version of Person might very well have age as a member which its users directly modify : this is intuitive and effortless , both conceptually and syntactically .
Only later might you need to bring property ( ) into the picture , as the object ’s internals change or grow more complex .
And that ’s how it should be : more lines of code and more complexity only when you need it .
( Of course , you still ca n’t hide data members , but this still goes a long way towards better , though not complete , encapsulation . )
I ca n’t remember ever seeing property ( ) mentioned anywhere in tutorials or introductory docs ( it ’s in the reference for built - in functions )
That ’s especially odd considering that one of Python ’s strengths is its powerful object features .
It would make sense to talk about this in the context of encapsulation .
Plus I wonder how widespread the use of property ( ) is in real world code .
Stuff like this is why I love Python .

How engaged are workers
What do executives want ?
Raves & Rants
NEW DELHI : Companies , their track record , leadership and HR policies have a significant bearing on how engaged their employees are .
But the state of the national economy , the mood of the country and it ’s growth trajectory , too , have a significant impact on the workers ’ attitudes and expectations , says a recent Watson & Wyatt ’s Work Study , one of the most comprehensive studies to understand workers ’ attitudes .
In the Asia - Pacific , for instance , more than 6,500 full - time employees covering all major employment sectors in 11 countries in the region including India , China , Australia , Japan , Thailand , were surveyed .
Here are some important findings : Regionally , European workers lead with the highest levels of engagement followed by the Asia - Pacific .
American workers are clearly the least engaged .
A combination of rapid growth in eastern European nations , generous employee benefits and various forms of government support it seems has kept the spirits of workers high .
“ Attitudinally , the centrality of work in an executive ’s life in Europe is not as high as in many other places , ” says Watson & Wyatt India country head Anita Belani .
Shorter work week , work - life balance and vacation time keep engagement high , she says .
The sheer growth momentum in the Asia - Pacific is keeping spirits high .
Even though the work conditions in the region may be far below the western nations ’ standards , the buoyancy in the economy and optimistic job outlook have kept workers modestly engaged .
But within the Asia - Pacific , engagement levels vary wildly .
India , with a buoyant economy and a cheery outlook , leads with engagement levels at 78 % , followed by the Philippines .
Japan and its lacklustre economy is visibly taking its toll .
It has the lowest employee engagement in the region .
China , despite its lead over the Indian economy , does n’t score that high on engagement scores .
“ It ’s all about how the Chinese workers perceive the changes — and the economy does not appear that hot to them , ” says Belani .
“ There are still many ways in which Chinese workers feel restricted .
” Both in the US as well as the Asia - Pacific , compensation and benefits remain the top three drivers for employee engagement .
Clearly , the role compensation plays ( never mind the high double - digit hikes ) in employee engagement is very significant .
In the US where corporate scandals have surged , many CEOs have been implicated in frauds and unethical practices , trust in top leaders is also among the top three drivers for employees there .
The study reveals that Indian workers are happiest about their role clarity and how they fit into the entire scheme of things in the company .
The respect at the workplace and outside plays a significant role in a worker ’s life .
“ Work defines who you are here , ” says Belani .
No prizes for guessing the bottom three : salaries and training & development remains big problem areas .
Surprisingly , strategic leadership and direction too find mention here .
“ It need not be the big boss , but the immediate supervisor who might be responsible , ” says Belani .
Frequent promotions and ill - equipped insecure supervisors with poor managerial skills are creating a spiralling discontent within organisations .
Companies dealing with hyper growth will need to find a better way to promote and prepare young executives for bigger roles .
A 51 - year - old systems administrator from New Jersey has received the longest federal prison sentence for attempting a crime designed to damage a computer system .
Yung - Hsun Lin ( also known as Andy Lin ) was given 30 months in jail for planting code on a company server in 2003 that was supposed to destroy a medical drug database .
He was also ordered by US District Judge Jose Linares to pay $ 81,200 in restitution to his former employer , Medco Health Solutions .
The story goes like this : Lin was employed at Medco because he was " proficient in the HP - Unix computer language designed to operate computer servers , " according to court documents seen by Ars .
In the fall of 2003 , Lin learned through the grapevine that the company was planning to lay off some sysadmins , and sent off e-mails to colleagues stating that he was n't sure if he would survive the anticipated layoffs .
A day later , he decided to plant code into Medco 's servers designed to delete almost everything once triggered .
" Among other information , the Destructive Code was designed to delete the [ Drug Utilization Review Database ] , as well as databases identifying subscribers , plan coverage , prescription administration , and billing data , " reads one court document .
The code was set to deploy automatically on April 23 , 2004 — Lin's birthday .
Mr. Lin , your name is not Zero Cool
Well , it turns out that Mr. Lin may have gotten a little bit ahead of himself , because several days later , Medco did in fact lay off four sysadmins — none of them him .
A month after that , Lin attempted to edit the code , presumably to ensure that it would not deploy as scheduled .
It turns out that Lin maybe was n't as good a programmer as he thought , because come April 23 , 2004 , the code deployed anyway .
To Medco 's relief , he was apparently really bad , because when deployed , the code failed to do its duty due to a bug .
Oops .
Oh , but that 's not all .
Lin figured out the bug and decided , " What the hell , I did n't get laid off , but I 'll set this thing to go off on April 23 , 2005 anyway ! "
Fortunately , another Medco sysadmin found the code while looking into another system error in January of 2005 , and Lin was officially caught .
Last September , Lin pleaded guilty to one count of transmitting computer code with the intent to cause damage in excess of $ 5,000 , and he was sentenced this week .
The US Attorney General for New Jersey , Christopher Christie , praised Medco for moving quickly and turning the case over to the government .
" Disgruntled or rogue employees are a real threat to corporate technology infrastructures and can cause extensive damage , " he said in a statement .
" The results of this prosecution send a message to systems administrators and employees ; and industry should feel comfortable and confident in coming to us when such cases arise . "
Functional Roman Numerals in Python
Just as a quck note , I thought I 'd post the cleanest python I could come up with to solve the roman numerals problem I discussed earlier .
It tries to use a functional style while actually avoiding recursion .
To do so , I wrote an iterative python unfold :
def unfold ( f , x ) : res = [ ] while 1 : try : w , x = f( x ) res .
append(w ) except TypeError : return res
And then the answer becomes :
numerals = [ ( " M " , 1000 ) , ( " CM " , 900 ) , ( " D " , 500 ) , ( " CD " , 400 ) , ( " C " , 100 ) , ( " XC " , 90 ) , ( " L " , 50 ) , ( " XL " , 40 ) , ( " X " , 10 ) , ( " IX " , 9 ) , ( " V " , 5 ) , ( " IV " , 4 ) , ( " I " , 1 ) ] def next ( x ) : for n in numerals : if n [ 1 ] <= x : return ( n[ 0 ] , x - n [ 1 ] ) def romanize ( n ) : return " " . join ( unfold ( next , n ) )
Compare to the haskell I posted before :
romanize = concat .
unfoldr next where next 0 = Nothing next x = Just $ second ( x - ) $ head $ filter ( ( <= x ) . snd ) numerals numerals = [ ( " M " , 1000 ) , ( " CM " , 900 ) , ( " D " , 500 ) , ( " CD " , 400 ) , ( " C " , 100 ) , ( " XC " , 90 ) , ( " L " , 50 ) , ( " XL " , 40 ) , ( " X " , 10 ) , ( " IX " , 9 ) , ( " V " , 5 ) , ( " IV " , 4 ) , ( " I " , 1 ) ]
The " where " idiom allows you to group helper functions and constants underneath the main function , and the unimportance of function order means you can highlight the high - level logic .
The haskell code is much shorter and tighter than the python .
Having powerful iterative functions like unfoldr in the standard library is another clear win for Haskell ; it took me more lines to define unfold than it did to define both next ( ) and romanize ( ) .
( By the by , some googling failed to turn up a previous python implementation of unfold ( ) ; I think this code gets a lot uglier without it .
I also do n't see any obvious way to do it with itertools . )
On the other hand , I find the simplicity of the python next ( ) appealing , with its constructive instead of declarative approach .
It 's a less generic solution that 's intuitively simpler ( for me , still an imperative thinker ) .
You could match the haskell more exactly :
from itertools import ifilter def second ( f , ( a , b ) ) : return ( a , f ( b ) ) def next ( x ) : return second ( lambda a : x - a , ifilter ( lambda ( y , z ) : z <= x , numerals ) . next ( )
but the result is pretty ugly .
The inability to compose functions compactly results in a lot of boilerplate , and in having to pick a lot of meaningless variable names that obscure what 's going on .
We could move the lambdas out of the call and give them names :
def next ( x ) : subx = lambda a : x - a ltx = lambda ( y , z ) : z <= x return second ( subx , ifilter ( ltx , numerals ) . next ( ) )
And it 's a little better , but I think we 're now pretty far from idiomatic python .
Conclusion
The python translation of the haskell is n't bad , but I do think it loses something .
The unfold ( ) trick works really well , and translates easily into an imperative , pythonic implementation ; I 'll look for ways to use it in the future .
And , finally , I 'm pretty jealous of Haskell 's function combination abilities .
Updates
In the comments at reddit , nostrademons posts a nicer unfold function :
def unfold ( f , x ) : while True : w , x = f( x ) yield w
And Kay Schluehr prefers the iterative solution :
numerals = (( " M " , 1000 ) , ( " CM " , 900 ) , ( " D " , 500 ) , ( " CD " , 400 ) , ( " C " , 100 ) , ( " XC " , 90 ) , ( " L " , 50 ) , ( " XL " , 40 ) , ( " X " , 10 ) , ( " IX " , 9 ) , ( " V " , 5 ) , ( " IV " , 4 ) , ( " I " , 1 ) ) def romanize ( n ) : roman = [ ] for ltr , num in numerals : ( k , n ) = divmod ( n , num ) roman .
append ( ltr * k ) return " " . join( roman )
David Pollak contributes a Scala unfold and romanize at his blog .
Apple users will have to watch more carefully what they are doing
At some point this evening I am going to have to sit down with my 14 - year - old son and have a quiet , paternal word with him about hygiene and trust .
It 's nothing to do with how frequently he showers or changes his socks , and only indirectly related to how freely he should accept sweets from strangers .
The problem is with his computer , as only six months after he moved from using a virus - prone Windows PC to a Macintosh computer the first serious threat to Mac users has been observed " in the wild " .
It 's a Trojan Horse , a piece of code that pretends to do one thing but actually compromises your computer .
This one spreads through online video sites , taking advantage of the fact that there are many different ways to display video , each requiring slightly different software to encode and decode moving images .
That puts my son right in the middle of the vulnerable population because he likes to watch video clips via sites like YouTube and Flixster .
Although Quicktime , the Apple media player that comes bundles with every Mac , makes a good shot of dealing with most common formats , if it can't figure out what to do with a particular file type it can go online to find the right " codec " .
The Trojan sits behind an online video and when you try to play it you get a message from Quicktime telling you to get a new codec , and if you follow the link you 'll be sent to a site that hosts the malicious software .
Click " ok " and enter your systems adminstrator 's password and it will be installed on your computer with full system access after which you are , to use the jargon , " pwned " , or scuppered .
And you do n't even get to see the video you were after .
I 'll be sad to see his innocence go , but perhaps it is an inevitable part of growing up , like losing belief in Santa Claus or parental infallibility .
Bill Thompson
At the moment the fake codec is being spread via porn sites , but it will quickly spread to more mainstream sites , and that 's when it will get dangerous and could affect a lot of Mac users who believe that they do n't need to worry about system security .
Of course this Trojan relies on social engineering to spread , and it does not mark a breakdown in Mac OS security or anything like that .
These sorts of programs have been around on Unix systems for years , and there were Mac Trojans back in 2004 , all relying on people 's willingness to click on boxes without thinking when they believe they are being offered something they want .
But it does mean I 'm going to have to reinforce my son's understanding of computer security , make him more suspicious and ensure that he appreciates the vulnerability of every computer .
I 'll be sad to see his innocence go , but perhaps it is an inevitable part of growing up , like losing belief in Santa Claus or parental infallibility .
Despite the growing importance of computers and the internet in school I do n't expect that this real threat to home computer users will make it into the school newsletter or be announced in assembly as part of the general school concern for pupil safety .
And this highlights a real failing in the education system , one that betrays a lack of the sort of joined - up thinking that the government is trying to achieve elsewhere .
There is a fair amount of skills - based IT training taking place , so that students leave school knowing how to write a letter , make a spreadsheet and create a presentation , even if their skills tend to be oriented around Microsoft Office instead of being more general .
The trojan claims to help users watch pornographic video clips
But this really is training , not teaching .
IT has been embedded into the curriculum and students learn how to do stuff , but there is no space for discussion and debate that might lead to a deeper understanding of the technology or the issues it creates .
Next week I 'm going into a local school to help with a citizenship day about the media , and I 've been sent a list of topics that they are going to cover .
New media , online journalism , citizen journalism and user - generated content do n't feature , because the focus is on newspapers , radio and TV .
Most of these students will have computers at home and all will use the internet at school , but the move online has all happened so fast that it is simply not present in the curriculum .
There is some attention given to internet safety , but that largely focuses on stranger danger and not malicious software , and even then it does not attempt to teach basic principles .
The tiny amount of money available to teach media literacy has had no noticeable impact on how young people think about the world , and schools continue to ignore the reality of how computers , mobile phones and the internet feature in their students ' daily lives .
It would be nice to think that my son would come home from school to tell me that there was nasty Mac Trojan in the wild because his teachers realised that it might be important to him .
It would be just as nice if he was encouraged to use social network sites to share his insights into the underlying causes of the First World War or MySpace to post his pop art inspired paintings .
But at the moment the pressure for that sort of activity seems to come only from informed and engaged parents , disadvantaging those whose parents have neither the understanding nor inclination to explain new technologies to them .
The Victorians recognised the commercial benefits of general literacy , and created an education system to deliver it to all .
The time is ripe for media literacy to be given the same treatment .

Nation Huckabee could face hurdles from the past Parole of rapist haunts campaign WASHINGTON - To Mike Huckabee , Baptist minister , former governor , and GOP candidate for president , being a good Christian is about redemption and forgiveness and recognizing his own frailties so he can be more understanding of the shortcomings of others .
It 's an attitude that drives much of Huckabee 's political agenda , including the assertion - unusual for a conservative Republican - that prisons are full of people who would be better off in drug treatment than behind bars .
But there is one man Huckabee believed deserved a second chance , convicted rapist Wayne Dumond , who continues to haunt Huckabee 's burgeoning presidential campaign .
Huckabee , whose self - deprecating humor and easy candor have charmed many on the campaign trail , bristles when asked about the case , in which Dumond - now dead - was paroled from an Arkansas prison , with then - governor Huckabee 's endorsement , only to sexually assault and kill a woman in Missouri .
" It was one of those things I just feel horrible about .
You just ache all the way to the bone over what happened , " the former Arkansas governor said in an interview .
" But nobody could know that " Dumond would attack again , he said .
Dumond 's case is notorious in Arkansas .
In 1984 , he raped a 17 - year - old girl .
While awaiting trial at his home , he was castrated by , he said , masked intruders .
Later , after Dumond went to prison for life , some people in Arkansas saw the sentence as excessive , especially given his mutilation .
Huckabee was one , and , after becoming governor in 1996 , he announced his desire to commute Dumond 's sentence .
Dumond 's rape victim , Ashley Stevens , saw it differently .
Stevens , now 40 and living in the western United States , said she tried to persuade Huckabee not to shorten the sentence for Dumond .
" I told [ Huckabee ] :
If you ever let him out , he 's going to do it again , " she said in an interview .
She was able to get a meeting with the governor - who , she said , had not spoken to her before announcing his intention to commute Dumond 's sentence - but realized Huckabee had " made up his mind . "
So Stevens stood up , she said , walked over to Huckabee , who was seated on a sofa , squatted down and thrust her face inches from his .
" I said , ' This is how close I was to Dumond 's face for an hour , ' " Stevens recalled .
" ' I 'll never forget his face , and you 'll never forget mine . ' "
The parole board - following a closed meeting with Huckabee - decided to let Dumond go .
The following year , Dumond committed the Missouri slaying .
He died in prison in 2005 .
If Huckabee , who is creeping upward in the polls , gains more momentum , the case is certain to become an issue .
Stevens said she is prepared to campaign actively against him if he becomes a serious candidates for president or vice president .
Bloggers have already dubbed the matter " Huckabee 's Willie Horton , " referring to the case of a Massachusetts man who was paroled during Michael Dukakis 's tenure as Massachusetts governor , and then raped a Maryland woman and terrorized her fiancé .
The episode tainted the onetime Democratic presidential nominee 's campaign even though Dukakis had not personally intervened on Horton 's behalf .
And a surge in the Huckabee campaign - once seen as a quixotic mission by a man hoping to become the second governor from Hope , Ark. , to make it to the White House - no longer seems unthinkable .
Huckabee placed second in the GOP Iowa straw poll , in which Senator John McCain of Arizona and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani chose not to compete .
Afterward , Huckabee pulled ahead of McCain there in a recent statewide poll , and he is edging up in other early primary states .
Huckabee wins over crowds by reciting his powerful personal story - he was the first male in his family to graduate from high school - and interjecting his signature humor .
Dangerously overweight and diagnosed with Type II diabetes in 2003 , Huckabee lost 110 pounds and used the experience to initiate state programs to counter childhood obesity and support preventive healthcare .
A guitarist who plays in a band called Capitol Offense , Huckabee last year pardoned Rolling Stones star Keith Richards for a 31 - year - old driving violation .
Asked by reporters if he'd do the same for the average citizen , Huckabee said no , but quipped , " If you can play guitar like Keith Richards , I 'd do it for you . "
Huckabee is also considered an attractive contender for vice president , because he is a Southerner and has strong credentials with Christian conservatives unhappy with the leading Republican candidates for president .
" Mine is the only campaign that has n't had any backward motion , " Huckabee said in the interview , scrolling down a message on his Blackberry that showed him inching up in polls in early primary states - even in Michigan , where Huckabee has yet to campaign .
On paper , Huckabee should be the darling of the religious conservatives .
He serves as a Baptist minister and has not given up the title to run for office .
He has a solid antiabortion record , approving several pieces of legislation in Arkansas to limit access to abortion , and supports a constitutional amendment banning abortion .
He opposes using discarded embryos for stem cell research .
He supports a constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman .
But Christian conservatives have yet to rally around Huckabee , despite the fact that they have expressed public unhappiness with the leading contenders , Giuliani , McCain , and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney .
Their reticence has little to do with Huckabee 's record and everything to do with the former governor 's perceived ability to raise money and compete in a general election , according to both Huckabee campaign staff and religious community leaders .
" When we started putting the game plan together we started meeting with leaders of the evangelical community , " said Huckabee 's campaign manager , Chip Saltsman .
" They all said , ' Governor , we really like you .
We think you 're great .
But you can't win . ' " Richard Land , an old friend of Huckabee 's who is a senior official with the Southern Baptist Convention , called Huckabee a " skillful candidate " who suffers from a perception that he is a long - shot contender .
" So far , I do n't think Governor Huckabee has been able to convince enough voters that he can beat " the Democratic nominee , Land said .
Huckabee is different from many politically active evangelicals .
Faith , Huckabee said , does not merely influence his public policy ; it drives it .
He rejects the fire - and - brimstone warnings delivered by some fellow religious conservatives and instead frequently talks about the need for forgiveness and diplomacy .
" When I see people who are very confrontational , you know what they 're against .
You 're not sure what they 're for , " Huckabee said .
" I believe that there 's a place for judgment and for justice - do n't get me wrong .
But I think sometimes people mask their own personal anger in the form of righteous indignation . "
" Being a Christian does not make me think I 'm better than somebody , " Huckabee added . "
It makes me realize that I personally fall short of God 's standards .
. . .
If I can see my own frailties , then I ought to be able to recognize that everyone else has them too . "
Rick Caldwell , Huckabee 's college roommate at Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia , Ark. , said Huckabee 's faith " causes him to have strong convictions , but it also causes him to have a lot of grace with other people , a lot of tolerance and understanding . "
Evangelicals , Caldwell said , will throw their support behind his friend as Huckabee improves in the polls .
Trailing in national polls , Huckabee has yet to draw the excruciating national scrutiny given to several of the leading candidates , and if the former governor continues to rise , he is likely to be quizzed anew about several conflicts he has had in Arkansas .
Huckabee tussled with local Arkansas media about renovations of the governor 's mansion and the destruction of computer hard drives from Huckabee 's office before he left as governor .
He also has had a running feud with the Club for Growth - which he calls " the Club for Greed " - which ran ads attacking him for raising taxes to improve schools .
And the Dumond case is likely to reemerge , dredging up not only the gruesome details of the attacks but the complicated political connections .
Stevens , the rape victim , is a distant cousin of Bill Clinton .
When he was Arkansas governor , Clinton refused requests to reduce Dumond 's sentence .
But while Clinton was off campaigning for president in 1992 , his lieutenant governor , Jim Guy Tucker , commuted Dumond 's sentence to 39 1/2 years , making Dumond eligible for parole .

Moshe Katsav was expected to step down as Israel ’s president after agreeing Thursday to plead guilty to sexual harassment to avoid more serious charges that he raped female staff members .
Under the plea agreement announced by Atty .
Gen. Menachem Mazuz , the 61 - year - old Katsav will escape jail time , which prompted an outcry among women ’s rights activists who saw the case as an important test of Israel ’s commitment to stamp out sexual harassment in the workplace .
The presidency in Israel is largely a ceremonial position ; political power rests with the prime minister .
The Katsav case has been one in a series of scandals eroding Israelis ’ confidence in their leaders .
Justice Minister Haim Ramon quit after being accused of forcibly kissing a female soldier and later was convicted of an indecent act .
Corruption allegations also have swirled around top officials , including Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .

Katsav faced possible indictment on charges that he raped and sexually harassed female subordinates while serving as president and earlier as tourism minister .
In January , Mazuz warned him that authorities had enough evidence to indict on allegations involving four women , but the attorney general had yet to issue formal charges .
Katsav agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges , including sexual harassment , indecent acts and harassment of a witness , Mazuz said Thursday .
Katsav will pay damages , but prison time was suspended under the deal , which requires court approval of his plea .
The court is expected to act next week .
Katsav was expected to resign today , though the move would be largely symbolic because his term ends next month .
The Israeli parliament has already elected a successor , Shimon Peres , who takes over July 15 .

Mazuz defended the decision to drop the more serious charges , saying they were going to be difficult to prove in court .
“ I have reached the conclusion that I cannot in fact determine that we have crossed the threshold of the reasonable chance of conviction , ” Mazuz told reporters .
The plea would spare the country and alleged victims the spectacle of a trial and prevent further damage to the presidency , Mazuz said .
“ From the status of No. 1 citizen , he will have dropped to the status of a man convicted of sex offenses , bearing eternal turpitude and shame , ” Mazuz said .

Women ’s rights advocates accused Mazuz of giving Katsav preferential treatment and undermining efforts to encourage Israelis to step forward with complaints about harassment on the job .
“ We talk about citizens being equal before the law , and here we see a man of stature , power , money , advisors , the finest attorneys -- and all these together succeed in imposing their way on the state of Israel and reach a deal that conveys a grave message , ” Shelly Yacimovich , a lawmaker from the center - left Labor Party , told Israel Radio .
Katsav , elected to a seven - year term in 2000 , had vehemently denied wrongdoing since sexual - misconduct allegations were lodged last summer by a presidential staff member , identified publicly only by her first initial , A .
Other women later stepped forward with additional allegations , but the statute of limitations had run out on some of those charges .

The woman known as A decried the plea agreement during a news conference Thursday in which she described almost constant overtures by Katsav .
She said the two had intercourse on three or four occasions .
“ I feel that sex offenders have been given a license and legitimacy to do anything they want without being punished , ” she said , appearing before cameras on condition that television stations blur her image .
In January , Mazuz notified Katsav that he was prepared to indict him pending the outcome of a subsequent hearing .
But after that hearing in May , Katsav ’s lawyers and prosecutors began discussing a plea bargain .
Katsav ’s lawyers said they persuaded him to admit guilt to lesser charges to avoid the rape indictment .

Moshe Negbi , a legal analyst for Israel Radio , said the outcome would leave few Israelis satisfied .
“ The president maintains he did nothing but is willing to confess so as to spare his family the suffering .
And the women say they are n’t retracting a single word , but the prosecution capitulated to a man in high office , ” Negbi said .
“ The public will believe in either option , but will no longer believe in the system itself . ”

There are times when life imitates art .
Then there are times when life imitates science fiction .
One of the most famous monsters in film history is the extraterrestrial beast of the “ Alien ” series .
It slowly opened its glistening fangs to reveal a second set of jaws that shot forward to kill its victims .
Scientists have now discovered a fish that does the same thing .
Rita Mehta did not have aliens in mind when she began to study the moray eel .
Dr. Mehta , a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California , Davis , where she studies the evolution of feeding , was intrigued by the dining habits of morays .
They are impressively successful predators , able to devour large fish whole , and they grow to more than 10 feet long .
Unlike other big - fish predators , morays have no fins .
They hide their snakelike bodies in the crevices of coral reefs , waiting to strike .
“ No one knew much about their feeding behavior , ” Dr. Mehta said .
Morays belong to a group called ray - finned fishes that includes a vast majority of fish species , like tuna , goldfish , salmon and trout .
Most ray - finned fish use suction to eat .
To catch prey , they suddenly expand their mouth cavity .
The negative water pressure sucks in the prey .

Rachel Leyman had her first baby with partner Lee Beckinsale , now 23 , 10 days after her 16th birthday .
Her youngest , Madison , arrived two weeks ago , joining Felicity , five , Ffion , who will be five on Christmas Eve , Cody , three , and Cerys , one .
" People say I 've got a natural touch with them - I love them all to bits , " said the Swansea teaching assistant .
The couple have been saving all year for Christmas .
I always said I was n't going to have children
Rachel Leyman
" We 've just finished Christmas shopping now .
It has taken a good couple of weeks to get it done .
The kids can't wait .
" I always said I was n't going to have children , but after the first one ... it 's something I like to do and it's not like I can't handle children . "
" I can't blame the contraception for everything - some of it was my fault .
We would not change it for the world , though . "
Christmas promises to be busy , especially with a birthday on Christmas Eve and she said the children were already " bouncing " .
THE FIVE CHILDREN Felicity : born January 2002 Ffion : born Christmas Eve 2002 Cody : born March 2004 Cerys : born January 2006 Madison : born December 2007
" All kids squabble and bicker but they 've got each other , and perhaps children from a smaller family are lonelier . "
The young family moved out of Mr Beckinsale 's parents ' home and into their three - bedroom house five weeks ago .
Ms Leyman wants to return to work at a primary school and Mr Beckinsale as a gas engineer in March .
" We 've just moved in and are just getting the children settled in , but we want to go back . "
Although they want to get married , the couple are waiting for their youngest bridesmaid to grow a little .
" We are planning on it , but in a couple of years .
" We are going to wait for Madison , so she is old enough to walk down the aisle with a dress on , " said Ms Leyman .
In the never - ending war between security researchers and malware authors , each side continually attempts to outmaneuver or out - engineer the other .
The latest security threat to hit the white hat radar involves a new form of system - level DNS hijacking .
DNS hijacking , in and of itself , is nothing new , but it's now apparently possible to reliably initiate such attacks using web - based malware , rather than relying on an end - user to download or activate a suspicious attachment .
According to a recent report by PCWorld , research teams working out of Google and the Georgia Institute of Technology have discovered a series of open - recursive DNS servers that were classified as behaving " suspiciously . "
Open - recursive DNS servers are DNS servers that will answer any lookup request , no matter where it originates .
So long as the DNS servers return accurate information — and the vast , vast , majority do — everything is kosher .
When open DNS servers do n't return valid information , however , they open the door to an entire world of problems .
Poisoning a DNS server allows the malware author to send your computer virtually anywhere he wants .
Since your system is being driven to false web sites based on DNS information , there 's no way for any malware suite running locally to detect or report on the problem — at least , not once the damage has been done .
There are still limitations on what can be done ; a false web site set up to look like PNCBank ( for example ) would n't be able to authenticate with the SSL certificate stored on a users ' system .
Password and logon information could still be gathered in other ways , however , and some users would undoubtedly ignore warning signs by trusting the web address telling them they really were at ( www.securesite.com).
This method of poisoning would also allow for cross -site scripting exploits .
If a user 's computer is set to allow all JavaScript and cookies from , say , MySpace , the fake MySpace web site would be able to run code as if it was the real web site .
This opens the door to all sorts of further exploits and general bad things , all of which might go undetected by the user for quite some time .
This type of attack could also be used to build an effective botnet — and more botnets are something we really do n't need .
Web 2.0 can act as something of an enabler in this process .
Webpage mashups may be a hot marketing term , but pulling content from multiple web sites simultaneously is also one means of infecting the people that visit a site without them knowing what vector the attack initiated from .
Fortunately , there are already some solutions to this particular problem .
Vista 's UAC would actually defend a system from this type of attack by notifying the user that a program was attempting to change the system 's DNS settings .
I 'm not sure if current malware software from various vendors would detect and prevent DNS - level hijacking , but again , such protection and notification could be implemented on a software level .
The availability of user - level protection is by no means a complete solution to the problem ; software companies cannot assume that all users avail themselves of the appropriate level of malware software or install the appropriate patches , but it is a place to start .
Imagine ripping off the visual rendering part of Firefox and replacing it with a hook to Apache instead – roughly speaking that ’s what Jaxer is .
Jaxer is a strange new hybrid application coming from the folks at Aptana ( the makers of the quite - excellent web IDE ) .
Literally , they took the Mozilla platform ( which powers Firefox , Camino , etc. ) and built a stateful platform on top of it .
You can imagine it as a browser that ’s able to render pages , modify them dynamically with JavaScript and the DOM , and even use JavaScript libraries with great ease – with the exception that it ’s living as a standalone server - side process , un-associated with the typical browsing experience .
Aptana has implemented something that ’s greatly interested me ever since I started playing with JavaScript on the server - side ( via Rhino ) .
My friends over at AppJet even took a step towards making this concept easy , hosted , and free .
The difference here is the severe amount of power and leverage that you ’re gaining with this platform : file I/O , network connectivity , database access , and even email access .
Let ’s back up a bit and look at an example of a simple , but representative , Jaxer application .
This simple application is a textarea which , when submitted , quietly saves the results to a text file on the server .
What you see below is the entire application – there is no other server - side language being used save for JavaScript .
< html > < head > < script src= " http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js " runat= " both " ></ script > < script > j Query ( function ( $ ) { $ ( " form " ) .submit( function ( ) { save ( $ ( " textarea " ) .
val ( ) ) ; return false ; } ) ; } ) ; </script > < script runat= " server " > function save ( text ) { Jaxer.File.write ( " tmp.txt " , text ) ; } save .
proxy = true ; function load ( ) { $ ( " textarea " ) .val ( Jaxer.File.exists ( " tmp.txt " ) ?
Jaxer.File.read ( " tmp.txt " ) : " " ) ; } </script > </ head > < body onserverload= " load ( ) " > < form action= " " method= " post " > < textarea ></textarea > < input type =" submit " /> </ form > </ body > </html >
There ’s a bunch of key points here that we need to take a look at in order to understand what ’s going on here , however it ’s most important to note that this application looks just like a normal HTML / JavaScript / DOM web app – there are no significant differences in syntax or style .
Let ’s dig in and see what all there is at play here .
runat = " both " and runat= " server " –
These script blocks are just like normal script blocks , but with an important exception :
They both are capable of running on the server , rather than on the client .
It ’s important to remember that since a Jaxer server is just like a headless Firefox , thus it ’s able to handle the same JavaScript that Firefox can .
In this case that ’s both the whole jQuery library and a couple of helper functions .
The runat = " both " declaration , additionally , states that the script block should be executed on both the client and the server ( in this demo we ’re using jQuery in both places ) .

save .
proxy = true ; – The save ( ) function must exist on the server - side ( since it contains calls to server - side functionality ) however we want to be able to call it from the client - side whenever the user hits the submit button to save their textarea changes .
We can do this by making it a proxy function ( adding an extra proxy property to the function ) .
This actually creates a stub function on the client - side , to allow the code to continue working as it would expect , while obscuring the actual functionality behind an Ajax request .
It ’s all completely seamless and works as you would expect it to , which is impressive .

This attribute gives a simple mechanism for running a piece of server - side functionality on DOM ready .
In this case we ’re loading the contents of the saved text file and injecting it into the textarea , using jQuery .
There ’s also one thing that I want to mention : I built the above mini app after only a cursory glance through the examples and it worked 100 % perfectly out of the box , with no errors whatsoever .
This is really hard to do and even more so with the first release of a project – I ’m quite impressed .
Even taking nothing else into account it ’s pretty obvious that Jaxer is easily the most exciting piece of JavaScript technology to arrive in a long time .
Disclaimer : I ’m a proud member of Aptana ’s advisory board .
I ’ve been greatly impressed with their work and I ’m glad they asked me to join them .
Microsoft managed to buy the vote of Sweden in ISO ?
I have written before about the situation around OOXML , and that Microsoft tries to push it through the standards organisations .
Today ( Monday , Aug 27 ) a meeting took place in WG17 of SIS / ITS that discuss the OODF question .
I already heard Friday last week there where rumors that Microsoft with the help of new partners ( as new members of SIS ) stuffed the meeting as single majority is enough to win a vote .
When a friend of mine arrived , it was clear that it all was stuffing going on from Microsoft side .
All Microsoft partners in Sweden was at that meeting .
People against OOXML got an offer to leave the meeting without paying the fee ( not becoming a member ) .
Everyone left , including IBM that thought it all was a farse .
It will now be interesting to see what the final vote will be from Sweden in ISO .
It is the case that the vote of Sweden can be bought ?
Or will SIS take a decision to go against the WG ?
Update :
My friend nd writes here that Stephane Rodriguez in this text specifies a number of issues with OOXML and the Microsoft implementation of it .
Of course , a detailed writeup should maybe distinguish more clearly between what is a problem with the standard , and what is a bad implementation of a standard .
But the text pretty clearly state we are not there yet .
If we have no implementations of the standard that works , how come we should push it through any standards body ?
Dear ISO , please stop .
Take a deep breath , and go through the specification making sure it really include everything is that is needed for an OOXML editor .
Everything and nothing more .
Then people in procurement processes can require Microsoft ( and others ) to follow that standard and not have proprietary extensions that make documents incompatible .
Update : Another friend of mine , Joakim , write in Swedish about what happened and also list the companies that suddenly where members of the wg .
Out of these , I only see Google with a known view , and that is against OOXML .
The rest I presume where in favor of OOXML becoming a standard .
The result of the vote ? 25 ( positive ) - 6( negative ) - 3( abstain )
I have written before about the situation around OOXML , and that Microsoft tries to push it through the standards organisations .
Today ( Monday , Aug 27 ) a meeting took place in WG17 ...
Evolving the design
I tried something a little different with Cortana this time around .
I 've kept her design pretty simplistic over the course of these comics and my guest spots on One - One - Se7en but I thought it was time to try and make it closer to the source .
You 're opinions are always welcome of course .
Hate it , love it , feel free to let me know either way .
All comments and critiques are appreciated .
Tomgram : Dilip Hiro , Bush 's Losing Iranian Hand
Whatever else the release of the 16 - agency National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on the Iranian bomb may be , it is certainly a reasonable measure of inside - the - Beltway Bush administration decline .
Whether that release represented " a pre-emptive strike against the White House by intelligence agencies and military chiefs , " an intelligence " mini- coup " against the administration , part of a longer - term set of moves meant to undermine plans for air strikes against Iran that involved a potential resignation threat from Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and a " near mutiny " by the Joint Chiefs , or an attempt by the administration itself to " salvage negotiations with Iran " or shift its own Iran policy , or none of -- or some combination of -- the above , one thing can be said :
Such an NIE would not have been written , no less released , at almost any previous moment in the last seven years .
( Witness the 2005 version of the same that opted for an active Iranian program to produce nuclear weapons . )
Imagine an NIE back in 2005 that , as Dilip Hiro wrote recently , " contradicts the image of an inward - looking , irrational , theocratic leadership ruling Iran oppressively that Washington has been projecting for a long time .
It says : ' Our assessment that Iran halted the program in 2003 primarily in response to international pressure indicates Teheran 's decisions are judged by a cost - benefit approach rather than a rush to a weapon irrespective of the political , economic , and military costs . ' "
The Iranians as rational , cost - benefit calculators ?
Only the near collapse of presidential and vice - presidential polling figures , and the endless policy failures that proceeded and accompanied those numbers ; only the arrival of Robert Gates as secretary of defense and a representative of the " reality - based community , " only the weakening of the neocons and their purge inside the Pentagon , only the increasing isolation of the Vice President 's " office " -- only , that is , decline inside the Beltway -- could account for such a conclusion or such a release .
Whatever the realities of the Iranian nuclear program , this NIE certainly reflected the shifting realities of power in Washington in the winter of 2007 .
In a zero -sum game in the capital 's corridors in which , for years , every other power center was the loser , the hardliners suddenly find themselves with their backs to the wall when it comes to the most compelling of their dreams of global domination .
( Never forget the pre-invasion neocon quip : " Everyone wants to go to Baghdad .
Real men want to go to Tehran . " )
Now , as Jim Lobe points out , we probably know why the Vice President and others suddenly began to change the subject last summer from the Iranian nuclear program to Iranian IEDs being smuggled into Iraq for use against American forces .
And why , in August , according to the Washington Post 's Dan Froomkin , the President " stopped making explicit assertions about the existence of an Iranian nuclear weapons program ... and started more vaguely accusing them of seeking the knowledge necessary to make such a weapon . "
They knew what was coming .
Enough power evidently remained in the hands of Vice President Cheney and associates that the final NIE was delayed at least three times , according to Congressional sources speaking to the Los Angeles Times .
The New Yorker 's Seymour Hersh claims that " the vice - president has kept his foot on the neck of that report ...
The intelligence we learned about yesterday has been circulating inside this government at the highest levels for the last year -- and probably longer . "
Still , it 's now out and that is a yardstick of something .
Dilip
Hiro is intent on measuring a more significant decline -- not of the Bush moment in Washington , but of imperial America which , as he points out below , now finds itself on the losing end of an ever more humiliating zero - sum game with a relatively minor power .
If you needed the slightest proof of this , just consider how , on Wednesday , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad termed the release of the NIE a " declaration of victory " for Iran 's nuclear program .
And he has reason to crow .
After all , as the headline of the latest Robert Scheer column at Truthdig.org indicates , when it came to the latest stare - down at the nuclear OK Corral between the President of the planetary " hyperpower " and the president of a relatively weak regional power : " It Turns Out Ahmadinejad Was the Truthful One . "

The Zero-Sum Fiasco
Bush in a Humiliating Zero-Sum Iranian Game of His Own Making
By Dilip Hiro
Bush 's woefully misguided invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003 , carried out under false pretences , has not only drained the United States treasury , but reduced Washington 's standing in the Middle East in a way not yet fully grasped by most commentators .
Whereas Washington once played off Tehran against Baghdad , while involved in a superpower zero-sum game with the Soviet Union , the Bush administration is now engaged in a zero- sum game , as a virtual equal , with Iran .
That is , America 's loss has become Iran 's automatic gain , and vice - versa .
To grasp the steepness of Washington 's recent fall , recall that until Saddam Hussein 's disastrous invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 , the zero-sum doctrine in the region applied only to Iraq and Iran , two minor powers on the world stage .
Having emerged in a self - congratulatory mode as the " sole superpower " after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , the U.S. now finds itself competing with a secondary power in the Middle East .
This humbling realization seems to have finally penetrated the minds of top policy makers in the Bush administration , causing concern .
More than anything else , that explains the sudden spurt of presidential interest in healing the long - running Israeli - Palestinian sore by holding a Middle East conference in Annapolis , Maryland .
The real objective of the Bush team had more to do with mollifying Arab leaders in order to hold them together in its ongoing confrontation with Tehran than realizing a genuine urge to create a viable , independent Palestine within a year .
With his invasion of Iraq in 2003 , George W. Bush diverged wildly from the policies of his two Republican predecessors : his father , George H. W. Bush , and Ronald Reagan .
Both of them had proved erudite enough to maintain the zero-sum game between Iraq and Iran .
The Zero-Sum Doctrine
While the United States and the Soviet Union vied for supremacy in the oil - rich , strategically important Middle East , the rivalry between Baghdad and Tehran was long submerged in the Cold War between the two superpowers .
After the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia in February 1948 , a zero-sum doctrine came to dominate that global " war . "
From then on , each Soviet gain was automatically seen as a loss in Washington , and vice - versa in Moscow .
This status quo held for 30 years .
In April 1978 , a Soviet - inspired military coup in Afghanistan toppled the regime of Daoud Khan -- who had earlier overthrown his cousin , King Zahir Shah , and founded a republic -- replacing it with a pro-Moscow republic .
That alarmed the administration of President Jimmy Carter .
The turmoil that ensued in Afghanistan would last two decades , at the end of which the puritanical , Sunni , Islamic fundamentalist Taliban movement would seize control of almost the entire country .
( Being staunch Sunnis , the Taliban held Shiites in low esteem , which helped raise tensions with Shiite Iran to a fever pitch in 1998 . )
In the Middle East , meanwhile , a historic zero- sum game had prevailed between the pro-American Shah of Iran , re-installed after a CIA coup in 1953 , and the Soviet - leaning regime of Arab nationalist officers in Iraq that followed the overthrow of the pro-British monarch in 1958 .
In the eight - year war between the two neighbors , started by Saddam Hussein 's invasion of Iran in 1980 , President Reagan maintained a pretence of neutrality , while covertly supporting the Iraqi dictator , as some " rogue " officials in his administration sold weapons secretly to Iran 's fundamentalist regime that had toppled the Shah in 1979 .
In the mid-1980s , when Saddam 's defeat became a real possibility , the Pentagon introduced the U.S. Navy into the conflict .
While the ostensible purpose was to escort tankers , carrying Kuwaiti oil , through the Persian Gulf to foreign destinations , this was an overt U.S. tilt toward Iraq .
The war ended in a stalemate , leaving the regional zero - sum equation intact .
Following the expulsion of Saddam Hussein 's occupying Iraqi forces from Kuwait in February 1991 , President George H. W. Bush , leading a coalition of 28 nations , called on Iraqis to rise up against Saddam .
Both the Kurds in the north and the Shiites in the south answered his call .
Bush senior came to the rescue of the Iraqi Kurds under the guise of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 ( relating to " the repression of Iraqi civilian population " ) .
By contrast , he allowed Saddam 's forces to deploy helicopter gun ships to mow down the Shiite rebels in the south .
Why ?
Bush and his top officials , including then - Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney , understood that Saddam 's overthrow would end the classic Iraqi - Iranian zero -sum game .
Once the long - suffering Shiite majority in Iraq was in the driver 's seat in a post - Saddam Iraq , it would naturally ally with predominantly Shiite Iran .
The Zero-Sum Fiasco
The coming to power of the anti-Shiite Taliban government in Afghanistan , culminating in its killing of a dozen Iranian diplomats in the regional capital of Mazar-e Sharif in the summer of 1998 , raised Tehran - Kabul tensions to an explosive point .
Tens of thousands of Iranian Revolutionary Guards gathered along the international border with Afghanistan for " military exercises . "
Although the two governments pulled back from the brink of war , Iran continued to regard the Taliban , a creature of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia , as an intensely hostile entity .
Contrary to Iran 's public posturing , including protests against the Pentagon 's aerial strikes on Afghanistan between October and December 2001 , its government actually shared intelligence on the Taliban with Washington , using back channels .
Like its politicians , the Iranian public was glad to see the Taliban defeated , and Iran 's diplomats cooperated with their American counterparts to install Hamid Karzai as the leader of the post - Taliban Afghanistan .
Then , in the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq , the Shiite - dominated government feared by the first Bush administration came into existence .
The overthrow of its enemies to the east ( in Afghanistan ) and to the west ( in Iraq ) -- wrought by Bush junior to advance his own blinkered agenda -- had now prepared the ground for Iran to assume the regionally dominant role its leaders consider their right .
Iran has the largest population in the region , is four times the size of Iraq , shares land and water borders with nine countries , and has a coastline that runs along the whole Persian Gulf as well as part of the Arabian Sea , not to mention the land - locked Caspian Sea .
It also has the second largest reserves of oil , as well as natural gas , in the world .
In its regional policies , it does not differentiate between Sunnis and Shiites .
It has taken the lead in offering aid , material and moral , to Hamas , even though it is a Sunni Palestinian movement .
Iran 's stance is in line with popular sentiment among Arabs .
Hassan Nasrallah , Ismail Haniyeh , and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- respectively , the heads of the Lebanese Hizbollah movement , the Palestinian Hamas movement , and Iran -- now top opinion polls as favorite leaders in Arab countries .
That is , ordinary Arabs generally ignore sectarian differences , except when it comes to occupied Iraq .
Worried by this fact , Arab rulers have resorted to stressing their sectarian , rather than ideological or policy disagreements , with Iran .
The Bush administration has encouraged them to do so .
Eager to counter rising Iranian influence by any means , its top officials are now trying to rally Arab rulers as Sunnis against Shiite Iran , forgetting that a hasty and unnecessary invasion of Iraq was what has brought about this wretched mess in the first place .
Increasingly , Washington under Bush will be the loser , no matter who prevails in the region -- an apt definition of a superpower in decline and of a genuine zero - sum fiasco .

Don't expect to hear much about it from the corporate media , but Louisiana today begins the process that will determine who 24 , and likely 44 , of it 's 47 Republican delegates will support for President .
Unlike a media - driven primary process , in this setting what matters are " boots on the ground " and strength of commitment to one 's candidates .
Though the final delegates will be picked later , if the ones picked today are for your guy in majority then odds are they will be for your guy when the picking is technically done .
The only way that can change is if some candidate gets a majority of the primary vote on Feb.
9th - an unlikely prospect at this point .
And guess who is expected to get more delegates than anyone else out of Louisiana today ?......... From " best of New Orleans " ..
" The biggest surprise to come out of Louisiana 's GOP delegate process thus far involves Ron Paul , the Texas congressman mounting a quasi-libertarian campaign that has been defined by its grassroots organization .
Dore says the Paul campaign dropped off a ' whole slate " of delegates about two weeks ago " a surprise showing that was n't expected .
If any controversy arises from the delegate process , it will be from Paul 's camp .
' We 're being watchful , though , because we want to make sure all of the delegates were registered Republicans before the Nov. 30 deadline , " Dore says , adding there was a great deal of interest expressed by nonparty voters about switching to the GOP in support of Paul .
' We started contacting registrars of voters in 17 parishes yesterday about roughly 90 people , the vast majority of which were signed up for Ron Paul .
"
" The article did not mention it , but no other campaign had a full slate of delegates .
The world of performance analysis in JavaScript is a strange land .
I ’ve had the “ pleasure ” of being involved in two JavaScript performance - related debates :
The speed of JavaScript - implemented CSS Selector libraries ( via jQuery ) and the speed of native browser implementations of JavaScript ( via Mozilla ) .
I want to go over a couple things that I ’ve learned – much of which , I ’m sure , is universally applicable to all types of speed tests .
It ’s damn easy to sculpt tests to make yourself look good – or others look bad .
I ’d be a liar if I said that I did n’t knowingly write tests that emphasized our best selectors in jQuery .
Of course , everyone does this – it ’s a game of tactics .
The issue , though , is that this sort of strange test writing behavior only arises when you ’re competing on stats – you want your code to look the best that it can .
It ’s only when you divorce yourself from competition , and take a step back , that you can truly start to understand what it is that ’s most important to users and what ’s a true performance problem .
A couple examples :
In jQuery there ’s the CSS 3 ~ selector .
A stupid , stupid , worthless selector .
No one uses it I wish it would go away .
I had actually removed this selector from jQuery as no one used it , it was n’t missed in the slightest .
( I ’ve removed a huge number of others as well – no one has ever complained about the missing : nth - last - of - type pseudo - selector . )
However , once libraries started to compete ( I think it was ExtJS that first released a speed test that compared us on ‘ ~ ’ ) users lose .
They get bloat ( an extra feature that no one used ) , they lose performance elsewhere ( on the overhead of supporting the extra selector ) , and it takes away from the time of the developers to resolve .
In the end I re-implemented the ~ selector to meet this non-existent demand – and later on had to dedicate time to improving its speed ( again , for the speed - test - suite - induced demand ) – all instead of working more important things like bug fixes .
In Firefox , there ’s been a lot of analysis of different speed test suites ( including the one produced by yours truly ) and attempts to figure out what tests are actually meaningful .
One such test was looking at sorting an array of integers using . sort ( ) .
Specifically , however , this test was fundamentally flawed , observe :
var a = [ ] ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 6 ; i++) a.push(parseInt( 1000 * Math.random ( ) ) ) ; a.sort ( ) ; // => [ 1 , 11 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 ]
Notice the problem ?
This test was using the default . sort ( ) method which sorts the contents of the array as if they were strings .
This is a nonsense test .
There is virtually no use use case for doing performance testing of comparing - integers - as - strings .
And yet there it is ; confusing users and wasting developer time .
I could go on - and - on talking about really bad JavaScript performance tests ( like the one that tested the speed of animating elem.style .x and elem.style.y – neither of which are actual CSS properties ) .
However , it ’s probably more important to look towards the future .
What exactly is a good test of JavaScript performance ?
It ’s one that encapsulates real - world user activity and analyzes actual application responsiveness to user interaction .
This is incredibly difficult to both quantify and analyze .
Now , it ’s really easy to test stuff like sorting and looping – that requires no user interaction whatsoever .
But how do you objectively test the speed of things like “ the user clicks this button and this div appears ” or “ how smooth is the animation of this div from point A to point B ” ?
It is n’t completely clear how to make this happen – especially in an unbiased way .
For example , different forms of event triggering could be used to simulate user clicks but do those properly simulate an actual user click ?
Do they happen faster ?
slower ?
What if a browser ’s event trigger system is quite slow but their normal UI experience is excellent ?
It ’s not clear what the right answer is , but no one has solved it yet .
This is something that I hope to be looking into in the upcoming weeks and months .
The problem really boils down to a matter of “ mircotests ” in comparison to “ real world ” tests .
Effectively running a single test hundreds , or thousands , of times trying to get a good statistical result for analysis .
This is ripe for error , cheating , and general unfeasibility .
When was the last time you did document.getElementById(" test " ) back - to - back 500 times or $ ( " #test " ) for that matter ?
You did n’t .
Any sane person would store the result in a variable and access it again later .
The only thing that a test like that does is encourage library , or browser , authors to provide bias for unrealistic tests .
Is the overhead of a caching system worth it if , in reality , there are virtually no cache hits ?
It does n’t matter , though , since competitive testing can lead people to implement unnecessary systems like these , purely for the sake of stats .
Now microtests do have their place – but that place should not be one of public competition but of personal introspection .
The first step to competitive performance analysis should always focus on the users .
It should be all about what the users are actually doing in their day - to - day browsing .
Only after you ’ve identified problem tests that you ’d like to improve do you move to microtests .
Since they do n’t serve as a good basis for public comparison ( leading to unrealistic cheating , etc. ) it ’s best to keep tests like those internal .
Once you can do that they can become quite useful .
User clicks a link and the animation is choppy ?
How ’s our timer performance ?
CSS property manipulation ?
Closure speed ?
DOM element accesses ?
All of these are the type of things that microtests were designed for – looking into the root cause of the real world problems .
In summary , there ’s three things that I think are really important about performance testing :
Use competition to light a fire .
Competitive performance testing has its place .
Personally , seeing poor performance results for my code makes me angry – which is good , because it gets me excited about improving the speed of my code .
This is good as , theoretically , the users will benefit in the end .
Test real world code .
Competitive , or even public , testing should strive to analyze real world code .
Striving to simulate a user ’s natural experience as closely as possible should be the ultimate goal .
It ’s only when you get to this point do you no longer cheat yourself , others , and especially – your users .
Analyze performance against yourself .
You should be your greatest enemy .
Remember that last release of your code ?
It should be your goal to make it look as bad as possible .
In the end your users will be able to see actual results and competition will be healthy ( no one gets hurt ) and clean ( there ’s no incentive to cheat ) .
Here ’s looking forward to a super - fast JavaScript future .
As many as 60 people within the CIA read a cable referring to two of the 19 hijackers involved in the attacks on America on September 11 2001 before the event , yet the information was not shared with the parts of the organisation able to do anything about it , according to the agency 's own internal investigation .
The revelation is one of several damning findings from the CIA 's own watchdog , the inspector general , drawn up in June 2005 .
He accuses the CIA 's top officials in the run-up to 9/11 , including the then director , George Tenet , of failure to devise a strategic plan to counter Osama bin Laden in advance of the attacks .
A 19 - page summary of the inspector 's report was published yesterday under a new congressional law passed earlier this month , having been kept secret since it was written .
It underlines the depth of infighting between the CIA and the National Security Agency which prevented clear lines of responsibility in the fight against al - Qaida .
Though the report found no evidence of misconduct or illegality , it bluntly stated that CIA officers " did not discharge their responsibilities in a satisfactory manner " .
The inspector , John Helgerson , went as far as to recommend further panels of inquiry into the conduct of key individuals within the agency to see whether disciplinary action should be taken against them .
Mr Helgerson said that the actions of Mr Tenet , his number two , Jim Pavitt , and the head of the counterterrorism operation , Cofer Black , should all be put under scrutiny .
However , the summary reveals that the CIA director at the time of the inspector 's report , Porter Goss , ruled out any further action .
In a statement accompanying the declassified summary , the current director , Michael Hayden , said he agreed with his predecessor that no reprimands were called for .
The 2005 internal inquiry concludes that there was no single point of failure or " silver bullet " that would have allowed the CIA to predict or prevent the attacks of 9/11 .
But if systems had been in place to share and analyse critical information that could have led to a more informed assessment of the threat in the lead up to the assault .
The most direct accusation was that information on the hijackers was widely reviewed before 9/11 but was not followed up .
" That so many individuals failed to act in this case reflects a systematic breakdown .
There was no coherent , functioning watch - listing programme , " the summary says .
Though the failings of the CIA in the run-up to the attacks on New York and Washington have been publicly examined by several congressional inquiries and the September 11 commission , the latest report gives a more stinging assessment than any previous account of the inadequate responses of individuals .
Mr Tenet is singled out for particular criticism .
This is a list of what I believe to be the top 10 rarest cloud formations .
And a brief description of each .
No particular order in how ‘ rare ’ they are though .
1. Nacreous Clouds
These rare clouds , sometimes called mother - of - pearl clouds , are 15 – 25 km ( 9 - 16 miles ) high in the stratosphere and well above tropospheric clouds .
They have iridescent colours but are higher and much rarer than ordinary iridescent clouds .
They are seen mostly but not exclusively in polar regions and in winter at high latitudes , Scandinavia , Alaska , Northern Canada .
Lower level iridescent clouds can be seen anywhere .
Nacreous clouds shine brightly in high altitude sunlight up to two hours after ground level sunset or before dawn .
Their unbelievably bright iridescent colours and slow movement relative to any lower clouds make them an unmistakable and unforgettable sight .
2. Mammatus Clouds
Mammatus are pouch - like cloud structures and a rare example of clouds in sinking air .
Sometimes very ominous in appearance , mammatus clouds are harmless and do not mean that a tornado is about to form – a commonly held misconception .
In fact , mammatus are usually seen after the worst of a thunderstorm has passed .
3. Altocumulus Castelanus
Also known as jellyfish clouds due to their jellyfish - like appearance .
These formed around 17,000 ft due to when the rush of moist air comes from the Gulf Stream and gets trapped between layers of dry air .
The top of the cloud rises into a jellyfish shape and long tentacles known as “ trailing virga ” form from rain drops that have evaporated .
4. Noctilucent Clouds
Noctilucent Clouds or Polar Mesopheric Clouds :
This is an extroadinarily rare cloud formation that occurs out on the verge of space between 82 km to 102 km from the earth ’s surface .
Noctilucent clouds appear to be luminous yet they reflect the sunlight from the other side of the earth at night , giving them a glowing appearance

5. Mushroom Clouds
A mushroom cloud is a distinctive mushroom - shaped cloud of smoke , condensed water vapor , or debris resulting from a very large explosion .
They are most commonly associated with nuclear explosions , but any sufficiently large blast will produce the same sort of effect .
Volcano eruptions and impact events can produce natural mushroom clouds .
Mushroom clouds form as a result of the sudden formation of a large mass of hot low - density gases near the ground creating a Rayleigh - Taylor instability .
The mass of gas rises rapidly , resulting in turbulent vortices curling downward around its edges and drawing up a column of additional smoke and debris in the center to form its “ stem ” .
The mass of gas eventually reaches an altitude where it is no longer less dense than the surrounding air and disperses , the debris drawn upward from the ground scattering and drifting back down ( see fallout ) .
6. Cirrus Kelvin- Helmholtz
Appearing as a slender , horizontal spiral of cloud , cirrus Kelvin - Helmholtz is one of the most distinctive cloud formations .
However , it tends to dissipate only a minute or two after forming and , as a result , is rarely observed .
Average height is around 16,500 ft .
7. Lenticular Clouds
Lenticular clouds , technically known as altocumulus standing lenticularis , are stationary lens - shaped clouds that form at high altitudes , normally aligned at right - angles to the wind direction .
Where stable moist air flows over a mountain or a range of mountains , a series of large - scale standing waves may form on the downwind side .
Lenticular clouds sometimes form at the crests of these waves .
Under certain conditions , long strings of lenticular clouds can form , creating a formation known as a wave cloud .
8. Roll Clouds
A roll cloud is a low , horizontal tube - shaped arcus cloud associated with a thunderstorm gust front , or sometimes a cold front .
Roll clouds can also be a sign of possible microburst activity .
Cool air sinking air from a storm cloud ’s downdraft spreads out across the surface with the leading edge called a gust front .
This outflow undercuts warm air being drawn into the storm ’s updraft .
As the cool air lifts the warm moist air water condenses creating cloud , which often rolls with the different winds above and below ( wind shear ) .
9. Shelf Clouds
A shelf cloud is a low , horizontal wedge - shaped arcus cloud , associated with a thunderstorm gust front ( or occasionally with a cold front , even in the absence of thunderstorms ) .
Unlike a roll cloud , a shelf cloud is attached to the base of the parent cloud above it ( usually a thunderstorm ) .
Rising cloud motion often can be seen in the leading ( outer ) part of the shelf cloud , while the underside often appears turbulent , boiling , and wind - torn .
10 . Stratocumulus Clouds
According to the Sapporo Meteorological Observatory , these low - altitude stratocumulus clouds were rolled into long , distinctive ribbons after becoming trapped in air currents .
While it is not uncommon for wind to form such patterns in stratocumulus clouds , photos that clearly show the clouds rolled into strips are rare , says the observatory .

Lost Opportunity to Review Government 's Abuse of " State Secrets " Privilege to Avoid Accountability for Illegal Actions
WASHINGTON - The American Civil Liberties Union today expressed its disappointment with the United States Supreme Court 's decision not to review the case of Khaled El - Masri , an innocent victim of the CIA 's " extraordinary rendition " program .
Khaled El - Masri , an innocent German citizen who was kidnapped , detained , and tortured in a secret overseas prison , had sued former CIA Director George Tenet and others , seeking compensation and an apology for his ordeal .
The Court 's refusal to hear the case lets stand a federal appeals court 's decision in March based upon the government 's assertion of the " state secrets " privilege .
" This is a sad day not only for Khaled El - Masri , but for all Americans who care about the rule of law and our nation 's reputation in the world , " said Ben Wizner , an ACLU staff attorney who argued El - Masri 's case before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals last November .
" By denying justice to an innocent victim of this country 's anti-terror policies , the Court has provided the government with complete immunity for its shameful human rights and due process violations . "
El - Masri , a father of six young children , was traveling to Macedonia when he was kidnapped , abused , and rendered to a CIA - run " black site " in Afghanistan .
He was forbidden from contacting a lawyer or any member of his family .
After several months of confinement in squalid conditions , he was flown from Afghanistan and abandoned on a hill in Albania with no explanation , never having been charged with a crime .
According to the ACLU , even after realizing El - Masri was innocent , the CIA continued to hold El - Masri for two more months .
The ACLU 's lawsuit charges Tenet , other CIA officials and U.S. - based aviation corporations with violations of U.S. and universal human rights laws .
It has been fifty years since the Supreme Court has reviewed the use of the " state secrets " privilege .
In recent years , the U.S. government has asserted state secrecy to justify the refusal to disclose information about its illegal wiretapping program , the use of torture , and other breaches of domestic and international law .
Just last week , it was disclosed that the Justice Department produced secret memos , which it refuses to release , authorizing the use of inhumane interrogation practices widely believed to constitute torture .
" Today 's decision will not end the debate over the government 's use of the ‘ state secrets ' privilege to avoid judicial scrutiny for illegal actions carried out in the name of fighting terrorism , " said Steven R. Shapiro , Legal Director of the ACLU .
" In a nation committed to the rule of law , the government 's unlawful activity should be exposed , not hidden behind a ‘ state secrets ' designation . "
In addition to Khaled El - Masri , the ACLU represents five other victims of the government 's " extraordinary rendition " program in a case against Boeing subsidiary Jappesen Dataplan , Inc .
That case charges that Jeppesen knowingly provided direct logistical support to CIA flights used in the rendition program .
The case is pending in federal court in the Northern District of California .
The ACLU also continues to urge Congress to review and dismantle the rendition program .
More information on the El - Masri case , the Jeppesen case , and the ACLU 's rendition fight is online at www.aclu.org/rendition
In addition to Shapiro and Wizner , El - Masri is represented by Jameel Jaffer , Melissa Goodman and Steven Watt of the national ACLU , Paul Hoffman of Schonbrun DeSimone Seplow Harris & Hoffman , LLP , Rebecca Glenberg of the ACLU of Virginia and Victor Glasberg & Associates .
Telescopes on the ground â€ “ while having all sorts of good qualities â€ “ have the disadvantage of peering through the whole of the atmosphere when looking at the stars .
Space - based telescopes like Hubble are an effective way around this , but launching a telescope into space and maintaining it is not exactly cheap .
What about something in between the two ?
This is where SOFIA ( Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy ) flies in .
SOFIA is a converted 747SP airliner that used to carry passengers for United Airlines and Pan Am , but now only has one voyager : an infrared telescope .
SOFIA recently completed the first phase of flight tests to determine its structural integrity , aerodynamics and handling abilities .
This first series of tests were done with the door through which the telescope will peer closed , and open - door testing will begin in late 2008 .
What makes SOFIA valuable is its ability to fly high in the stratosphere for observations , at around 41,000 feet ( 12.5 km ) .
This eliminates the atmosphere in between the ground and space , which causes turbulence in the light coming through , and also absorbs almost completely some wavelengths of infrared light .
Cloudy nights , normally the bane of observational astronomy , will not impede the ability of SOFIA .
Other advantages are that scientists will be able to add specialized observing instruments for specific observations , and fly to anywhere in the world .
The telescope is 10 feet across , and weighs around 19 tons .
It will look through a 16 - foot high door in the fuselage to study planetary atmospheres , star formation and comets in the infrared spectrum .
During this stage of testing , the ability of the telescope to compensate for the motion and vibrations of the airplane was checked .
After the first open - door tests are run this year , the mobile observatory will begin making observations in 2009 , and will be completely operational in 2014 .
SOFIA is a cooperation between NASA , who will maintain the plane , and the German Aerospace Center , who built and will maintain the telescope .

Cheap cars in Asia may lead to even worse trafic problems there , and rising gas prices the world over .
India 's Tata has just introduced the Nano , a two - cylinder , four - person car with a price tag of $ 2,500 .
The QQ from China 's Chery goes for around $ 4,000 .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The debut of the $ 2,500 car may be billed as a mobility breakthrough for billions of people in the developing world , but for U.S. motorists it could mean one thing : higher gas prices .
Rising demand from the developing world has long been cited as a main driver behind the runup in oil prices .
That demand will only get more intense with staggering growth in car sales - and by extension , gasoline use - in places like India and China .
" We 'll get into a situation where we 'll have to compete with them for gasoline , $ 4 , $ 5 a gallon , who knows how high we could go . " said Peter Beutel , an oil analyst at the consultancy Cameron Hanover .
He says that time could come much sooner than 2015 , when light vehicle sales in India are expected to total over 3 million - doubling 2006 sales - according to J.D. Power & Associates .
In China they 're expected to nearly triple - to over 17 million - roughly on par with projected sales in the United States .
That huge growth does n't even begin to scratch the surface of potential car buyers in those countries though .
The 2 billion - plus combined populations of India and China could one day dwarf the 300 million potential car buyers in the U.S .
China is expected to nearly quadruple its fuel consumption for motor vehicles by 2030 , according to the Energy information Agency .
In India it 's expected to rise nearly three - fold .
By comparison , growth in the U.S. is only expected to be about 40 percent , although fuel use in the U.S. will still be more than twice that of China thanks largely to the bigger vehicles we drive .
Sales of all types of cars and trucks are growing in India and China - as they are in other developing economies like Mexico , Brazil and throughout the Middle East .
But small , super - cheap cars are important because they are marketed to people who do n't have cars .
Earlier this year India 's Tata motors introduced the Nano , a two - cylinder , four - person sedan that gets 50 miles per gallon and is priced at $ 2,500 .
China 's
Chery car company has the slightly more expensive QQ , and Nissan and Renault are reportedly considering similar tiny models .
While the vehicles are efficient - certainly more efficient than gas - guzzling SUV so popular in the U.S. - experts say their effect on gas consumption will nonetheless be significant for two reasons .
First , the people that buy them will mostly be trading in motor scooters , which get much better gas mileage especially due to their ability to whiz through Asia 's traffic - clogged streets , said Lee Schipper , a fellow at EMBARQ , the World Resources Institute 's Center for Sustainable Transport .
Second , these cars are seen as gateway vehicles .
The ultimate goal of the car companies is to move the consumer up the supply chain into bigger - and less efficient - rides .
Environmentalist are uneasy criticizing countries that are basically following the development model of the West .
But in addition to raising gas prices for everyone , they say the rate of growth will put the countries ' roads under serious stress , make cities less livable , and add to pollution .
We 've become utterly auto dependent and now we 're trapped in our car , " said John DeCicco , an automotive strategies fellow at Environmental Defense .
He sees cheap cars creating a vast new constituency for cars and road expansion .
India 's Tata , which builds the Nano , did not respond to an email seeking comment .
China 's
Chery could not be reached .
But Gloria Bergquist , a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers , said cars in developing counties are far more efficient than cars in the U.S. were just 20 years ago .
She also defended the automobiles role in society .
" Modern life could n't exist without the mobility automobiles provide , " said Bergquist .
" Access to jobs , healthcare ... they really form the basis of our quality of life . "
The mobility cars afford is not just relegated to developed nations as evidenced by the skyrocketing sales projections .
The Chinese , Indians , Brazilians and others want these things too .
But if they 're going to follow the West 's development model , some argue that maybe it 's better they use cars that get 50 miles a gallon .
" It was going to happen anyway , and I 'd rather see them in these than in vehicles that get 20 miles a gallon , " said Michael Robinet , vice president of global vehicle forecasts the research firm CSM Worldwide .
Robinet also was n't convinced these cars will compete directly with U.S. drivers for gasoline , as refining blends often vary country to country and refining bottlenecks in the U.S. are a big reason gas prices are so high .
But the the speed at which customers in developing nations are snapping up these cars , and the sheer size of the market , come with an urban planning challenge commensurate in scope .
" If they go too fast down the road of cars , it will take decades before they are finally able to calm the traffic , " said Schipper .

I 'm not entirely sure that the marketing people have gotten this right and I think that this may just cause a backlash , however I might be wrong .
Then again pigs might fly and Uwe Boll might make a good film .
The clip shows us two of the hijackers on one of the flights that crashed into the World Trade Centre as they argue over how many virgins they are going to get their hands on when they receive their martyrdom , and the figure is n't quite what they expected .
Yet , despite the extremely sensitive subject matter , and the incredible fine line that the clip is walking , there are some amusing moments in that exchange of lines between the two .
However the final few moments are veering across that fine line and I think are the ones which will cause the most distress .
I understand the idea of laughing and finding humour at the darkest moments of life , I really do , but sometimes you have to think of others and respect their feelings , and I can't quite help but think this is slightly too graphic .
What do you think ?
Is this going too far ?
Is Uwe Boll pushing Postal too far to get a reaction ?
The clip comes through Rated - M.com , and thanks to them , a reminder of the trailer once again .

Those YouTube trailers move all the time , I 've just replaced the one that was no longer available .

Are scientists publishing more duplicate papers ?
An automated search of seven million biomedical abstracts suggests that they are , report Mounir Errami and Harold Garner .
With apologies to Charles Dickens , in the world of biomedical publications , “ It is the best of times , it is the worst of times ” .
Scientific productivity , as measured by scholarly publication rates , is at an all - time high1 .
However , high - profile cases of scientific misconduct remind us that not all those publications are to be trusted — but how many and which papers ?
Given the pressure to publish , it is important to be aware of the ways in which community standards can be subverted .
Our concern here is with the three major sins of modern publishing : duplication , co-submission and plagiarism .
It is our belief that without knowing whether these sins are becoming more widespread , the scientific community cannot hope to effectively deter or catch future unethical behaviour .
There are legitimate and illegitimate reasons for two scientific articles to share unusual levels of similarity .
Some forms of repeated publication are not only ethical , but valuable to the scientific community , such as clinical - trial updates , conference proceedings and errata .
The most unethical practices involve substantial reproduction of another study ( bringing no novelty to the scientific community ) without proper acknowledgement .
If such duplicates have different authors , then they may be guilty of plagiarism , whereas papers with overlapping authors may represent self - plagiarism .
Simultaneous submission of duplicate articles by the same authors to different journals also violates journal policies .

“ The duplication of scientific articles has been largely ignored by the gatekeepers of scientific information . ”
Previous studies that have tried to gauge the level of unethical publishing have mostly relied on small surveys of specific communities .
One of the largest to date used text - matching software to trawl more than 280,000 entries in arXiv , an open - access archive of mathematics , physics , computer science , biology and statistics papers .
The study suggested a low number of suspected acts of plagiarism ( 0.2 % of arXiv papers ) , but a much higher number of suspected duplicates with the same authors2 ( 10.5 % ) .
In 2002 , an anonymous survey of 3,247 US biomedical researchers3 asking them to admit to questionable behaviour revealed that 4.7 % admitted to repeated publication of the same results and 1.4 % to plagiarism .
In general , the duplication of scientific articles has largely been ignored by the gatekeepers of scientific information — the publishers and database curators .
Very few journal editors attempt to systematically detect duplicates at the time of submission .
The US National Library of Medicine , based in Bethseda , Maryland , curates the primary biomedical citation index , Medline , and currently reports fewer than a thousand cases of duplication since the 1950s , discovered mainly by serendipity .
Yet if the results of the anonymous survey3 are extrapolated to the Medline database ( more than 17 million citations and growing steadily ) , then you would expect to find closer to 800,000 cases .
Where between these two vastly different figures does the true number lie ?
The academic arms race
Establishing a baseline is a crucial first step , but in our view , monitoring trends is even more important to the health of the scientific literature .
As the number of peer - reviewed journals has multiplied , the perceived odds of unethical publications escaping detection have improved .
Fortunately , the advent of new computational text - searching algorithms , along with electronic indexes or full - text electronic manuscripts , is also making it easier to detect unethical publications .
Together , these advances enable not only the methodical discovery of individual incidents , but also a means to study broad trends .
Instead of relying on serendipity to identify duplicate articles , we have chosen to search online databases , such as Medline , using text - similarity software .
The search engine , eTBLAST , is freely available online for anyone to use to search the literature4 .
In recent work , we have used eTBLAST to search a subset of more than 62,000 Medline abstracts from the past 12 years to identify highly similar entries5 .
The 421 potential duplicates found have been deposited in a publicly available database , Déjà vu ( http://spore.swmed.edu/dejavu), and after manual inspection were confirmed as duplicates with different authors ( 0.04 % ; based on inspection of full - text articles ) , or duplicates with the same authors ( 1.35 % ; based on inspection of the abstracts ) .
The rate of false positives in this study was only 1 % .
But without full text it may be difficult to determine if suspected duplicates properly attributed the earlier work .
Whether or not the duplications are legitimate papers has yet to be established .
Extrapolating to the subset of Medline records that have abstracts ( 8.7 million ) , this would correspond to roughly 117,500 duplicates with the same authors4 .
Although this number is far higher than the 739 records currently annotated as duplicates in Medline , these duplication rates are substantially lower than those found in arXiv , perhaps reflecting differences in the database formats ( preprints versus journal papers ) , or disparities between these fields in what is considered acceptable practice .
There is also variation in how these estimates were reached , including the subjective nature of manual inspection ( we used two manual checkers in each case ) .
The Medline database , unlike arXiv , is limited to titles and abstracts , and so automated comparison of full - text articles is not possible , perhaps making it harder to detect more sophisticated duplications .
Closer than close
Because of the sheer size of the Medline database , scaling up the eTBLAST search to all 17 million records would be extremely time consuming even though each search takes only about 40 seconds .
Fortunately , we observed that 73 % of the Medline duplicates identified in our initial study and curated in Déjà vu also feature as the ' most related article ' in Medline ( calculated by a Medline algorithm ) .
So , we downloaded the related abstracts for 7,064,721 Medline records , and compared the original and related abstracts against one another using eTBLAST .
This approach allowed us to complete our analysis in 10 days rather than 10 years .
In this way we have identified a further 70,458 highly similar records , all of which have been deposited in Déjà vu .
Given the limitations of our process , we expect around 50,000 of these to be true duplicates .
This is partly because we used a less stringent duplication threshold for the latest data set and so after manual checking 27 % of the records turn out to be false positives ( see http://spore.swmed.edu/dejavu/statistics).
To date , 2,600 of the Déjà vu records have been manually inspected alongside the original , but until that is done the status of each entry remains unverified .
However , extrapolating to the entire database , we estimate there are potentially more than 200,000 duplicates in Medline , after various correction factors have been applied .
Although manual verification of the Déjà vu database is very much a work in progress , and so analysis of the full data set should be interpreted with caution , we have started looking for trends in the approximately 70,000 candidate duplicates .
With the articles so far captured within the Déjà vu database , merged with analysis of other data extracted from full - text versions of Medline articles available in PubMed Central ( such as publication date , language of article and country of origin ) , it is possible to begin to identify broad trends in publication behaviour .
Perhaps the most obvious is a steady rise in the rate of such publications in the biomedical literature since 1975 ( Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 : Increasing opportunity ?
The number of biomedical papers indexed in the citation database , Medline , has grown steadily over the past 30 years .
A search of 7 million abstracts , using the text - matching software eTBLAST , reveals tens of thousands of highly similar articles ( unpublished data ) , which are also growing in number .
Are these legitimate or illegitimate publications ?

Medline indexes over 5,000 journals published in the United States and more than 80 other countries worldwide .
Rising duplicate publication rates documented in Figure 1 are therefore a global phenomenon .
Potential factors contributing to this trend are the explosion in the number of journals with online content ( increasing opportunities for unethical copying ) , and a body of literature growing so fast that the risk of being detected seems to diminish .
This last factor may be the most important , and we believe that automated detection processes that can provide an effective deterrent may be our best weapon in fighting duplicate publications .
One argument for duplicate publication is to make significant works available to a wider audience , especially in other languages .
However , only 20 % of manually verified duplicates in Déjà vu are translations into another language .
What of the examples of text directly translated with no reference or credit to the original article ?
Is this justified or acceptable ?
And is such behaviour more widespread for review - type articles for which greater dissemination may be justified ?
We do not yet have answers to these questions .
In general , we find that the duplication rate extracted from the total Déjà vu database for each country is roughly proportional to the number of manuscripts that country contributes to Medline ( Figure 2 ) .
The top eight contributors to Medline are the United States , Japan , Germany , China , the United Kingdom , Italy , France and Canada , representing close to 75 % of all Medline records .
However , two of these countries , China and Japan , have estimated duplication rates that are roughly twice that expected for the number of publications they contribute to Medline .
Perhaps the complexity of translation between different scripts , differences in ethics training and cultural norms contribute to elevated duplication rates in these two countries .
Figure 2 : Duplication is a global activity .
The proportion of suspected duplicates in the Déjà vu database for each country was estimated ( unpublished data ) by assigning articles to countries based on the corresponding author 's address .
Also presented is each country 's relative contribution to Medline estimated from 180,000 randomly selected Medline articles .

Simultaneous submission
With few exceptions , the repeated publication of the same results by those who conducted the research is ethically questionable .
It not only artificially inflates an author 's publication record but places an undue burden on journal editors and reviewers , and is expressly forbidden by most journal copyright rules .
Examination of typical submission and publication dates from 10,000 articles randomly selected from PubMed Central , shows that on average the review process takes 4.3 months and that 97 % of articles complete this process within 10 months ( see Supplementary information ) .
Curiously , as many as one - third of the manually verified duplicate abstracts in Déjà vu sharing at least one author are also published less than five months after the original .
Examination of the submission and publication dates of these pairs confirms that many of these duplicates must have been submitted simultaneously to different journals in violation of journal policies and accepted norms .
For instance , the Déjà vu database contains many pairs of highly similar abstracts with overlapping authors that appear in the same month , all apparently acts of simultaneous submission to multiple journals .
Duplication by different authors
“ Automated text - matching systems are used by high schools and universities .
We hold our children up to a higher standard than we do our scientists . ”
Articles sharing excessive similarity with other papers with different authors do not necessarily represent plagiarism , as there are sometimes valid or trivial reasons ( such as a simple author name change ) .
However , considering only those duplicates in Déjà vu where the full text of both articles has been manually inspected , we have found 73 plagiarism candidates , most of which were previously undetected .
Discerning the difference between legitimate and illegitimate duplication is beyond the capacity of automated algorithms ( and apparently many scientists ) , and so it is critical to withhold judgement of any candidate duplicates until evaluated by a suitable body such as an editorial board or a university ethics committee .
As part of our study , we have started to send out requests for additional information for such cases , one of which has initiated an investigation by a journal .
It is our intent to send such requests for information to all individuals and journals involved in , or affected by , duplicate records with different authors .
Many duplicate articles without authors in common go undiscovered .
Are the perpetrators then likely to repeat the offence ?
Searching the Déjà vu database reveals several repeat practitioners , and manual inspection of full - text articles confirms some of these as suspected serial offenders .
As with any potential illegitimate duplication , caution and careful human judgement must be exercised , and detailed comments and manual assessments for these and other duplicate pairs can be found within the Déjà vu database .
Unlike repeated publication by the same authors , simultaneous publication is rarely observed for duplicates that do not share authors ( see Supplementary information ) , undoubtedly due to the fact that it is usually difficult to re-use someone else 's work before it appears in print — unless the duplicating author also happens to have been a referee of the original .
Although anecdotes abound of referees stalling a publication in order to give themselves time to duplicate and publish the same result first , the general lack of duplicates with different authors appearing in rapid succession suggests that this is either rarer than feared , or that the perpetrators do a good job of concealing it .
In general , duplicates are often published in journals with lower impact factors ( undoubtedly at least in part to minimize the odds of detection ) but this does not prevent negative consequences — especially in clinical research .
Duplication , particularly of the results of patient trials , can negatively affect the practice of medicine , as it can instill a false sense of confidence regarding the efficacy and safety of new drugs and procedures .
There are very good reasons why multiple independent studies are required before a new medical practice makes it into the clinic , and duplicate publication subverts that crucial quality control ( not to mention defrauding the original authors and journals ) .
What can be done ?
“ The fear of having some transgression exposed in a public and embarrassing manner could be a very effective deterrent . ”
Although duplicate publication and plagiarism are often discussed , it seems that discussion is not enough .
Two important contributing factors are the level of confusion over acceptable publishing behaviour and the perception that there is a high likelihood of escaping detection .
The lack of clear standards for what level of text and figure re-use is appropriate ( for example in the introduction and methods ) is a well known problem ; but the belief that one can get away with re-use is probably the single most important factor .
Addressing these two aspects could be relatively quick and easy .
If journal editors were to use more frequently the new computational tools to detect incidents of duplicate publication — and advertise that they will do so — much of the problem is likely to take care of itself .
We find it odd that automated text - matching systems are used regularly by high schools and universities , thereby enabling us to hold our children up to a higher standard than we do our scientists .
In our view , it would be fairly simple to fold these tools into electronic - manuscript submission systems , making it a ubiquitous aspect of the publication process .
Although text - comparison algorithms have come a long way in the last decade , they are still in their infancy , and experience with student software shows that as tools to detect duplicate publication improve , determined and skilled cheats will find ways to defeat them .
But as in any arms race , the winners are usually determined by the cost–benefit balance , and the costs entailed in unethical duplication practices will quickly rise to a level that makes them prohibitively expensive to all but the most desperate ( or most skilled ) practitioners .
There are additional practical avenues for improving Medline and other databases , such as more aggressive enforcement of copyrights by journals , and the creation of an ' update ' publication category under which clinical updates and longitudinal surveys in sociology or psychology could be categorized , and these should be explored .
But above all , the fear of having some transgression exposed in a public and embarrassing manner could be a very effective deterrent .
Like Dickens 's Ebenezer Scrooge , the spectre of being haunted by publications past may be enough to get unscrupulous scientists to change their ways .

“ There is clearly room for bipartisan cooperation , ” she said , adding that Mr. Bush appeared to be looking “ more at the tax code ” as a way of lifting the economy while her package would provide a mix of spending increases and tax relief .
The plan from Mrs. Clinton , Democrat of New York , is the first specific stimulus package to be proposed by a presidential candidate from either party , or by a Democratic leader in Congress , but it is not likely to be the last .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has signaled that House Democrats will propose their own stimulus package when they return to Washington next week .
Senate Democratic leaders are tentatively talking about something similar .
Brendan Daly , Ms. Pelosi ’s spokesman , said Thursday that her proposal had yet to be worked out but that it would be “ temporary , timely and targeted ” to the middle class , a phrase that has gained currency among many Democrats as they prepare for likely Republican attacks on them as profligate spenders .
President Bush has said he is studying the possibility of a stimulus package that Republicans say would most likely emphasize tax cuts rather than spending .
They say Mr. Bush will probably not decide whether to make such a proposal or settle on details until later this month .
Mrs. Clinton has also called for increased spending on energy , housing and other needs over the next several years , paid for by savings elsewhere .
But her stimulus package would not be financed by tax increases or other spending cuts .
[ Python - Dev ] Monkeypatching idioms -- elegant or ugly ?
I ran into the need of monkeypatching a large number of classes ( for what I think are very good reasons :-) and invented two new recipes .
These do n't depend on Py3k , and the second one actually works all the way back to Python 2.2 .
Neither of these allows monkeypatching built - in types like list .
If you do n't know what monkeypatching is , see see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch.
I think it 's useful to share these recipes , if only to to establish whether they have been discovered before , or to decide whether they are worthy of a place in the standard library .
I did n't find any relevant hits on the ASPN Python cookbook .
First , a decorator to add a single method to an existing class : def monkeypatch_method ( cls ) : def decorator ( func ) : setattr( cls , func.__name__ , func ) return func return decorator
To use : from < somewhere > import < someclass > @monkeypatch_method(< someclass >) def < newmethod >( self , args ) : return < whatever >
This adds < newmethod > to < someclass >
Second , a " metaclass " to add a number of methods ( or other attributes ) to an existing class , using a convenient class notation : def monkeypatch_class ( name , bases , namespace ) : assert len( bases ) == 1 , " Exactly one base class required " base = bases [ 0 ] for name , value in namespace.iteritems ( ) : if name != " __metaclass__ " : setattr ( base , name , value ) return base
To use : from < somewhere > import < someclass > class < newclass >(< someclass > ) : __metaclass__ = monkeypatch_class def < method1 >(... ) : ... def < method2 >(... ) : ... ...
This adds < method1 > , < method2 > , etc. to < someclass > , and makes < newclass > a local alias for < someclass > .

Assume that a friend makes available to you a generous line of credit to your firm at very agreeable terms : low interest rates , loose repayment requirements , and ( nod- nod , wink - wink ) the implicit agreement that if you can't make your payments in the future there will be more dough forthcoming .
Assume that all of your neighbors have similar agreements with the same friend and seem to be doing fine .
All you have to do is sign on the bottom line .
Of course , there are some strings attached .
You have to arrange your finances in ways that are acceptable to your friend , who claims the right to oversee your finances and can tell you exactly how to arrange them if he does n't like your current business plan .
Your friend also claims the right of constant oversight of your activities and in fact opens several offices near your place of business , employing a cadre of people whose only job it is to watch how you spend your money .
What 's more , your friend has monopoly power on the ability to print the money you need at will , allowing him to become the de facto only lender available , because his bad money tends to drive out any alternatives that might otherwise be available to you .
When you find yourself deeper in debt than you ever imagined possible , you have no alternative but to comply with his solutions , or risk becoming a pariah .
Some friend , right ?
Only the most desperate and shortsighted of individuals would be drawn to him .
But since desperate and shortsighted describes most governments today , it explains why the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have so many customers .
Several countries have become dependent on the money spigot these taxpayer - supported organizations make available to unpopular and corrupt governments , and it is rare for any country to stand athwart the system it manipulates .
That is why the case of Argentina is so compelling .
When its economy reeled from the aftereffects of the Peronist episode in the 1950s , a period of time during which a nation once admired for being the world 's breadbasket became one of the world 's basket cases , Argentine authorities welcomed the intervention of world credit agencies .
Instead of suffering the consequences of its policies , its rulers opted for a deal that allowed them to remain in power for several decades and to avoid paying the political price for the effects of its brand of socialism .
For Argentina , the perverse effects of Peronism persist to this day .
Economists call such policies examples of moral hazard : a skewing of incentives resulting from not holding people or institutions responsible for the consequences of their actions .
Moral hazard is the primary product peddled by the World Bank and the IMF .
They encourage governments to engage in those policies that bring positive short - run effects that allow them to remain in power .
When negative long - run effects eventually kick in , effects that are consistent with economic theory , more loan money becomes available to mask them while ushering in new rounds of short - run stimulus .
And so it goes , over and over again , with new loans being approved by the credit agencies on a periodic basis .
It requires some interesting intellectual reasoning by economists to justify this system — which perhaps explains why World Bank economists are not required to pay taxes , effectively making them an anointed class of government employees .
It also causes World Bank and IMF - dependent countries to constantly alternate from economic miracles ( resulting from the initial injection of new money into their economies ) to economic crises ( the inevitable result of malinvestments made possible by it ) .
This explains , for example , why the Mexican government is good for a major currency devaluation every decade .
That this scheme works this way is obvious to everyone but the governments who operate it and the sycophantic economists that are employed by it .
So it is significant that after a year of protracted and severe suffering by the Argentine people , with pockets of the country being reduced to barter and with starvation being reported in some of its provinces , Argentine officials have recently announced that the country is defaulting on a $ 1 billion World Bank loan .
Such a policy is practically unprecedented — only Zimbabwe and Iraq have defaulted on such loans in the past .
Though this policy is not the first choice solution of the country 's politicians , it represents both the pressure they are under to reclaim Argentina 's economic sovereignty and popular disgust with never - ending boom and bust cycles .
Both the World Bank and the IMF assumed one year ago that its payments could continue if only Argentina would agree to new loan terms , but government authorities began rejecting terms willingly accepted by their counterparts in Brasilia , Líma , and Bogotá .
" We 're not saying the blame for what 's wrong should be pinned on the fund ( IMF ) , " Alfredo Atanasof , Argentine President Edwardo Duhalde 's cabinet chief , told the BBC .
" We assume the responsibility as a country ... but what we are saying is the bureaucracy at the Fund has promoted the policies that put us in this situation . "
It was only a year ago that the IMF halted loans to Argentina , forcing the government into the largest foreign debt default in history .
The country halted payments on about $ 95 billion of its $ 141 billion in foreign debt .
Shortly thereafter , the cash - strapped government in Buenos Aires confiscated private dollar holdings in its banks , replacing them with Argentine pesos , a move reminiscent of Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's confiscation of gold holdings in the 1930s .
Bank runs and holidays , coupled with massive protests against the government , became commonplace as the economy collapsed into itself .
Since then , the government has been slow to accept the Keynesian stimuli offered by IMF officials .
Much of the new money ( which would add to the country 's debt ) would arrive earmarked to pay for new projects such as AIDS programs , high schools , and farm aid at a time when it owes billions of dollars to private sector creditors .
New layers of government would be created when public disgust with state interventionism is at an all - time high .
Needless to say , the stakes of Argentina 's decision are huge .
After all , what if other countries dependent upon IMF and World Bank loans also announced , " We are not going to pay , " as Atanasof did last week ?
Most likely , it would represent a necessary first step toward freeing their economies from the deleterious effects of such dependency .
Like the private firm that files for bankruptcy , countries might even notice that there is an upside to default .
Of course , a country that defaults on a World Bank loan cannot be compared to a firm that defaults on a commercial loan originating in the private sector .
The theory of banking requires some form of collateral be in existence to assuage the risk that is a part of any loan contract .
While the collateral does not eliminate loan defaults , it instills a sense of urgency on the part of the borrower to repay the loan that may not otherwise exist .
Collateral reduces moral hazard effects .
Such contingencies do not exist when countries borrow money .
First , IMF and World Bank loans are comprised of coerced capital appropriated from taxpayers , not from voluntary deposits made available by investors participating in financial markets .
The directors of the IMF do not face the same penalties as the directors of a private sector bank when loans perform poorly .
They are less likely to lose their jobs , and they are immune from profit and loss constraints .
What 's more , operating in an era of fiat currencies , such organizations have the ability ensure repayment in ways that private banks would never be allowed in a free market .
While Visa and MasterCard cannot loan customers enough money to make minimum payments , the IMF and World Bank routinely do .
Second , countries do not have collateral in the sense that conventional borrowers do .
Only the threat of coercion — in the form of reduced access to credit in the future — compels countries to repay loans .
Since government bureaucrats that allocate such funding do not stand to benefit from utilizing it in ways that maximize its social benefit , they are more likely to use it in ways that bring short - term political gain .
Cronyism reigns .
In such a situation , private banks in the U.S. would rarely loan private capital to foreign governments on their own accord , unless pushed to do so by public authorities .
They very well might loan to private firms operating in countries such as Argentina .
But this is the type of funding that IMF and World Bank loans crowd out of the global financial system .
And that is the crux of the problem .
While capital will flow anywhere in the world where it is secure from violations of property rights , governments routinely violate property rights through taxation and inflation — two of the primary effects of IMF and World Bank regulations .
Since IMF and World Bank loans inherently increase the levels of taxation and inflation , they institutionalize an environment in which private capital is less secure and in which wealth becomes depleted .
Argentina , and a myriad of other countries dependent on IMF and World Bank funding , will always be at a disadvantage in attracting sorely needed investment capital as long as property rights are not protected .
By defaulting on one loan , Argentina may be acknowledging that no country ever became wealthy depending on public financing organizations from another hemisphere .
One can hope .
Such ideas can lead to economic sovereignty and wealth creation .
Such ideas , if spread , can cause industrial revolutions .
Expectations of a rate cut had risen in recent days after figures indicated that economic conditions had deteriorated over the past few weeks .
The BBC 's economics editor Evan Davis said the rate cut - the first since August 2005 - was aimed at preventing the slowdown getting out of control .
Mortgage lenders Halifax and Nationwide cut their rates in line with the move .
Financial website Moneyfacts said that lower borrowing costs would save between £ 15 and £ 20 a month on a £ 100,000 mortgage .
It is about making sure that the slowdown , which seems to be happening , does not get out of control
Evan Davis
BBC economics editor
Evan 's blog : Apocalypse now ?
Mortgage lenders react to cut
Experts had predicted that some lenders may not pass on the rate cut in full to consumers .
However , the speed of the response from the UK's two largest mortgage lenders will now put their rivals under pressure to follow suit .
" A reduction in interest rates is exactly what the market needs and will benefit consumers , " said Michael Coogan , director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders ( CML ) .
" This will reduce the risk of payment shock for the 1.4 million borrowers coming off fixed rates in the next year . "
Tough call
Chief economist at Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets , Trevor Williams , said that the Bank of England 's decision to cut rates had been an " incredibly tough one " .
He said that worries about inflation , with rising food and oil prices , " could easily have swayed the Bank to hold rates " .
However , surveys this week have shown falling house prices and a slump in consumer confidence .
HAVE YOUR SAY
For the first time that I can remember , renting now seems preferable to buying

On Wednesday , Halifax reported that UK house prices dropped 1.1 % in November , while Nationwide showed that its measure of consumer confidence had seen the biggest monthly decline since the survey began in 2004 .
A number of retail and leisure companies have also warned of problems and that they are seeing a slowdown in demand on the High Street .
Our economics editor said that Thursday 's rate cut was aimed at making sure the economy did not slow too quickly .
" It is about making sure that the slowdown , which seems to be happening , does not get out of control , " he explained .
' Sensible move '
Another of the key factors behind the rate cut was an increase in Libor - the rate at which banks to lend to one another .
Libor has been rising because of problems in the US mortgage market and the subsequent credit crunch , and the fear is that this will make banks less willing to lend to consumers and companies .
Analysts said the Bank should worry about growth not inflation
" The credit crunch - which seemed to be resolving itself in October - has recently taken a nasty turn for the worse , " said Peter Spencer , chief economist of Ernst and Young 's Item Club .
EEF , the manufacturers ' organisation welcomed the rate cut .
" Though manufacturing remains in good health a number of warning lights for the economy are now flashing amber , " said Steve Radley , EEF 's chief economist .
" This is a sensible pre-emptive move which will reassure business that the bank is on the case and help to cushion the economy from the worst effects of instability in the financial markets , " he added .
More cuts ?
The British Chambers of Commerce ( BCC ) praised the MPC's " commendable flexibility " saying the rate cut would help to alleviate potential dangers facing the economy and give a much - needed boost to business confidence .
" A cut in rates was clearly needed to counter the growing international threats emanating from the US , and to unblock the dangerous obstacles preventing the banking system from operating smoothly , " the BCC 's David Kern said .
" Threats to growth are much bigger now than risks of higher inflation . "
Mr Kern added that if credit conditions remained too tight , a further cut in rates may be required early next year .

Wash in winter , too
If you rarely wash your car during messy winter weather , you are not alone .
The cars you see on the road make it obvious that lots of folks figure , “ Why bother ?
The car is going to look awful the next time I drive it . ”
The problem with this thinking is that washing is more important in the winter than other times of the year .
All that sand , slush , and ice mixed with road salt is exactly what makes your car rust .
The fastest corrosion occurs when the temperature repeatedly rises above and then falls below freezing .
Especially during the messy months , be sure to rinse the undercarriage and hard - to - reach areas that are susceptible to rust , such as the bumpers and inside the wheel wells .
If the temperature outside is going to stay above freezing long enough for your car and driveway to dry , fill a bucket with warm water and tackle the job at home .
If not , pay a visit to your local car wash and be sure they dry the car thoroughly .

The Clintons are decades long servants of the Bush Dynasty .
What is thy bidding , my Master ?

This is n’t just a Bush / Clinton thing .
While they represent the longest running and most sickening example it , this is standard operating procedure in the U.S. as the regime pretends to change every four or eight years .
In Tragedy and Hope : A History of the World in our Time , Carroll Quigley wrote :
The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies , one , perhaps , of the Right and the other of the Left , is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers .
Instead , the two parties should be almost identical , so that the American people can “ throw the rascals out ” at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy .
Keep that one in mind as you try to read the following without your guts and valves seizing up on you .
Via : Examiner :
President Bush is quietly providing back - channel advice to Hillary Rodham Clinton , urging her to modulate her rhetoric so she can effectively prosecute the war in Iraq if elected president .
In an interview for the new book â€ œThe Evangelical President , â€  White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten said Bush has â€œbeen urging candidates : â€ ˜Donâ€™t get yourself too locked in where you stand right now .
If you end up sitting where I sit , things could change dramatically .
â€™ â€ 
Bolten said Bush wants enough continuity in his Iraq policy that â€œeven a Democratic president would be in a position to sustain a legitimate presence there.â€ 
â€ œEspecially if itâ€™s a Democrat , â€ the chief of staff told The Examiner in his West Wing office .
â€œHe wants to create the conditions where a Democrat not only will have the leeway , but the obligation to see it out.â€ 
To that end , the president has been sending advice , mostly through aides , aimed at preventing an abrupt withdrawal from Iraq in the event of a Democratic victory in November 2008 .
Elite , War | Posted in Dictatorship Top Of Page
Whenever the administration is challenged regarding the success of the Iraq war , or regarding the false information used to justify the war , the retort is : " Are n’t the people of Iraq better off ? "
The insinuation is that anyone who expresses any reservations about supporting the war is an apologist for Saddam Hussein and every ruthless act he ever committed .
The short answer to the question of whether the Iraqis are better off is that it ’s too early to declare , " Mission Accomplished . "
But more importantly , we should be asking if the mission was ever justified or legitimate .
Is it legitimate to justify an action that some claim yielded good results , if the means used to achieve them are illegitimate ?
Do the ends justify the means ?
The information Congress was given prior to the war was false .
There were no weapons of mass destruction ; the Iraqis did not participate in the 9/11 attacks ; Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein were enemies and did not conspire against the United States ; our security was not threatened ; we were not welcomed by cheering Iraqi crowds as we were told ; and Iraqi oil has not paid any of the bills .
Congress failed to declare war , but instead passed a wishy - washy resolution citing UN resolutions as justification for our invasion .
After the fact , we ’re now told the real reason for the Iraq invasion was to spread democracy , and that the Iraqis are better off .
Anyone who questions the war risks being accused of supporting Saddam Hussein , disapproving of democracy , or " supporting terrorists . "
It ’s implied that lack of enthusiasm for the war means one is not patriotic and does n’t support the troops .
In other words , one must march lockstep with the consensus or be ostracized .
However , conceding that the world is better off without Saddam Hussein is a far cry from endorsing the foreign policy of our own government that led to the regime change .
In time it will become clear to everyone that support for the policies of preemptive war and interventionist nation - building will have much greater significance than the removal of Saddam Hussein itself .
The interventionist policy should be scrutinized more carefully than the purported benefits of Saddam Hussein ’s removal from power .
The real question ought to be : " Are we better off with a foreign policy that promotes regime change while justifying war with false information ? "
Shifting the stated goals as events unravel should not satisfy those who believe war must be a last resort used only when our national security is threatened .
How much better off are the Iraqi people ?
Hundreds of thousands of former inhabitants of Fallujah are not better off with their city flattened and their homes destroyed .
Hundreds of thousands are not better off living with foreign soldiers patrolling their street , curfews , and the loss of basic utilities .
One hundred thousand dead Iraqis , as estimated by the Lancet medical journal , certainly are not better off .
Better to be alive under Saddam Hussein than lying in some cold grave .
Praise for the recent election in Iraq has silenced many critics of the war .
Yet the election was held under martial law implemented by a foreign power , mirroring conditions we rightfully condemned as a farce when carried out in the old Soviet system and more recently in Lebanon .
Why is it that what is good for the goose is n’t always good for the gander ?
Our government fails to recognize that legitimate elections are the consequence of freedom , and that an artificial election does not create freedom .
In our own history we note that freedom was achieved first and elections followed  not the other way around .
One news report claimed that the Sh’iites actually received 56 percent of the vote , but such an outcome could n’t be allowed for fear of a theocracy forming .
This reminds us of the statement made months ago by Secretary Rumsfeld when asked about a Shi’ite theocracy emerging from a majority democratic vote , and he assured us that would not happen .
Democracy , we know , is messy and needs tidying up a bit when we do n’t like the results .
Some have described Baghdad , and especially the Green Zone , as being surrounded by unmanageable territory .
The highways in and out of Baghdad are not yet secured .
Many anticipate a civil war will break out sometime soon in Iraq ; some claim it ’s already underway .
We have seen none of the promised oil production that was supposed to provide grateful Iraqis with the means to repay us for the hundreds of billions that American taxpayers have spent on the war .
Some have justified our continuous presence in the Persian Gulf since 1990 because of a need to protect " our " oil .
Yet now that Saddam Hussein is gone , and the occupation supposedly is a great success , gasoline at the pumps is reaching record highs approaching $ 3 per gallon .
Though the Iraqi election has come and gone , there still is no government in place , and the next election  supposedly the real one is not likely to take place on time .
Do the American people have any idea who really won the dubious election at all ?
The oil - for - food scandal under Saddam Hussein has been replaced by corruption in the distribution of U.S. funds to rebuild Iraq .
Already there is an admitted $ 9 billion discrepancy in the accounting of these funds .
The over - billing by Halliburton is no secret , but the process has not changed .
The whole process is corrupt .
It just does n’t make sense to most Americans to see their tax dollars used to fight an unnecessary and unjustified war .
First they see American bombs destroying a country , and then American taxpayers are required to rebuild it .
Today , it ’s easier to get funding to rebuild infrastructure in Iraq than to build a bridge in the United States .
Indeed , we cut the Army Corps of Engineers ’ budget and operate on the cheap with our veterans as the expenditures in Iraq skyrocket .
One question the war promoters do n’t want to hear asked , because they do n’t want to face up to the answer , is this : " Are Christian Iraqis better off today since we decided to build a new Iraq through force of arms ? "
The answer is plainly no .
Sure , there are only 800,000 Christians living in Iraq , but under Saddam Hussein they were free to practice their religion .
Tariq Aziz , a Christian , served in Saddam Hussein ’s cabinet as foreign minister  something that would never happen in Saudi Arabia , Israel , or any other Middle Eastern country .
Today , the Christian churches in Iraq are under attack and Christians are no longer safe .
Many Christians have been forced to flee Iraq and migrate to Syria .
It ’s strange that the human rights advocates in the U.S. Congress have expressed no concern for the persecution now going on against Christians in Iraq .
Both the Sunni and the Shi’ite Muslims support the attacks on Christians .
In fact , persecuting Christians is one of the few areas in which they agree  the other being the removal of all foreign forces from Iraqi soil .
Considering the death , destruction , and continual chaos in Iraq , it ’s difficult to accept the blanket statement that the Iraqis all feel much better off with the U.S. in control rather than Saddam Hussein .
Security in the streets and criminal violence are not anywhere near being under control .
But there ’s another question that is equally important : " Are the American people better off because of the Iraq war ? "
One thing ’s for sure : the 1,500 - plus dead American soldiers are n’t better off .
The nearly 20,000 severely injured or sickened American troops are not better off .
The families , the wives , the husbands , children , parents , and friends of those who lost so much are not better off .
The families and the 40,000 troops who were forced to reenlist against their will  a de facto draft  are not feeling better off .
They believe they have been deceived by their enlistment agreements .
The American taxpayers are not better off having spent over $ 200 billion to pursue this war , with billions yet to be spent .
The victims of the inflation that always accompanies a guns - and - butter policy are already getting a dose of what will become much worse .
Are our relationships with the rest of the world better off ?
I ’d say no .
Because of the war , our alliances with the Europeans are weaker than ever .
The anti-American hatred among a growing number of Muslims around the world is greater than ever .
This makes terrorist attacks more likely than they were before the invasion .
Al - Qaeda recruiting has accelerated .
Iraq is being used as a training ground for al - Qaeda terrorists , which it never was under Hussein ’s rule .
So , as our military recruitment efforts suffer , Osama bin Laden benefits by attracting more terrorist volunteers .
Oil was approximately $ 27 a barrel before the war , now it ’s more than twice that .
I wonder who benefits from this ?
Because of the war , fewer dollars are available for real national security and the defense of this country .
Military spending is up , but the way the money is spent distracts from true national defense and further undermines our credibility around the world .
The ongoing war ’s lack of success has played a key role in diminishing morale in our military services .
Recruitment is sharply down , and most branches face shortages of troops .
Many young Americans rightly fear a coming draft  which will be required if we do not reassess and change the unrealistic goals of our foreign policy .
The appropriations for the war are essentially off - budget and obscured , but contribute nonetheless to the runaway deficit and increase in the national debt .
If these trends persist , inflation with economic stagnation will be the inevitable consequences of a misdirected policy .
One of the most significant consequences in times of war that we ought to be concerned about is the inevitable loss of personal liberty .
Too often in the patriotic nationalism that accompanies armed conflict , regardless of the cause , there is a willingness to sacrifice personal freedoms in pursuit of victory .
The real irony is that we are told we go hither and yon to fight for freedom and our Constitution , while carelessly sacrificing the very freedoms here at home we ’re supposed to be fighting for .
It makes no sense .
This willingness to give up hard - fought personal liberties has been especially noticeable in the atmosphere of the post - September 11th war on terrorism .
Security has replaced liberty as our main political goal , damaging the American spirit .
Sadly , the whole process is done in the name of patriotism and in a spirit of growing militant nationalism .
These attitudes and fears surrounding the 9/11 tragedy , and our eagerness to go to war in the Middle East against countries not responsible for the attacks , have allowed a callousness to develop in our national psyche that justifies torture and rejects due process of law for those who are suspects and not convicted criminals .
We have come to accept preemptive war as necessary , Constitutional , and morally justifiable .
Starting a war without a proper declaration is now of no concern to most Americans or the U.S. Congress .
Let ’s hope and pray the rumors of an attack on Iran in June by U.S. Armed Forces are wrong .
A large segment of the Christian community and its leadership think nothing of rationalizing war in the name of a religion that prides itself on the teachings of the Prince of Peace , who instructed us that blessed are the peacemakers  not the warmongers .
We casually accept our role as world policeman , and believe we have a moral obligation to practice nation building in our image regardless of the number of people who die in the process .
We have lost our way by rejecting the beliefs that made our country great .
We no longer trust in trade , friendship , peace , the Constitution , and the principle of neutrality while avoiding entangling alliances with the rest of the world .
Spreading the message of hope and freedom by setting an example for the world has been replaced by a belief that use of armed might is the only practical tool to influence the world  and we have accepted , as the only superpower , the principle of initiating war against others .
In the process , Congress and the people have endorsed a usurpation of their own authority , generously delivered to the executive and judicial branches  not to mention international government bodies .
The concept of national sovereignty is now seen as an issue that concerns only the fringe in our society .
Protection of life and liberty must once again become the issue that drives political thought in this country .
If this goal is replaced by an effort to promote world government , use force to plan the economy , regulate the people , and police the world , against the voluntary desires of the people , it can be done only with the establishment of a totalitarian state .
There ’s no need for that .
It ’s up to Congress and the American people to decide our fate , and there is still time to correct our mistakes .

Good God , is there nothing we can eat any more ?
So use whole milk and have a heart attack or low - fat milk and help your prostate cancer go malignant .
Ugh .
You know , I go to France every year , I eat food that is rich in fat , cream , butter , oil and all the rest , and I lose weight every time ( and I actually do n’t drink that much , even there ) .
I ’m really beginning to wonder if the processing of food we do here in the states is slowly poisoning us .
Google ’s Android project , an open platform for mobile devices , has been hitting the news a lot in the last couple of days with it ’s open APIs , Java - based development platform and optimized virtual machine which includes the lovely set of typefaces from Ascender known as the Droid family .
Check out previous coverage of the well - known and lesser - known coding fonts .
There are a number of Droid fonts including Droid Sans and Droid Serif but of particular interest for developers is the Droid Sans Mono font that looks great in Visual Studio not only at my favorite 10 point … but from 7 point upwards with either ClearType or standard font smoothing although some might find the fact it smooths at all sizes a little soft ( or Mac - like ) .
Here it is at 9 point with Rob Conery ’s Vibrant Ink ( WekeRoad Ink ) theme :
Here it is at 11 point with my Humane theme :
And here it is 12 point in Xcode on the Mac :
The only issues are :
the lack of a bold weight or italic variant which limits the syntax highlighting options
the 0 is currently not slashed ( there could be some other indistinguishable character pairs )
Being that the Droid family is Apache licensed no doubt somebody will fill that gap ( okay , okay , I ’ll give it a shot when I get some time ; -)

A new map of Antarctica displayed last week at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , combines 1,100 digital satellite images into a mosaic with the most geologically accurate , true - color , high - resolution views of the frozen continent now possible .
The map , with a resolution 10 times greater than before , shows features half the size of a basketball court clearly , and is not pure white .
It captures the textures and color variations of mountains , valleys and ice rivers and is available to researchers and the public online .
“ This mosaic of images opens up a window to the Antarctic that we just have n’t had before , ” said Robert Bindschadler , a NASA scientist who conceived the project .
“ This innovation is like watching high - definition TV in living color versus watching the picture on a grainy black - and - white television , ” he said .
“ Anyone with a computer and a Web connection can now travel to Antarctica . ”
A NASA site concentrating on educational material about the mosaic is at http://lima.nasa.gov.
The map and detailed scientific information are also at a United States Geological Survey site at http://lima.usgs.gov.
I rarely discuss presidential politics in my reports , because I think a presidential election is a half - billion dollar Punch and Judy show whose practical outcome is orchestrated well in advance .
The presidential campaign is held for tradition ’s sake and for its entertainment value , the better to shill the voters .
Let ’s face reality : when the outcome of the 2004 presidential race had to be the election of a member of Skull and Bones , a Yale undergraduate secret society that initiates 15 students a year , the available two choices were not the result of the system we read about in our high school civics textbooks .
Ever since 1932 , the presidential campaigns have been conducted between Council on Foreign Relations Team A vs. Council on Foreign Relations Team B .
In 2004 , the range of choices narrowed : Skull and Bones Team A vs. Skull and Bones Team B .
Phyllis Schafly complained in print back in 1964 about the orchestrated party primary system ’s never allowing voters a choice rather than an echo .
Her complaint is still valid .
These days , the choice is mainly between which Yale graduates you want : the two Clintons vs. the two Bushes , with Kerry thrown in for amusement value .
It ’s like one of those TV reality shows .
“ Which Yale graduate will be eliminated this time ? ”
You might respond by saying that Gore was an exception .
Good point !
He graduated from Harvard .
Then there was Dukakis , who graduated from the Harvard Law School .
George W. Bush has been the most broadly based candidate we have had since 1984 .
He graduated from Yale and also the Harvard Business School .
Do you feel reassured ?
Democracy marches on !
So , I have not written much about presidential campaigns since the fall of 1980 , when Reagan accepted George H. W. Bush as his Vice Presidential candidate .
He had promised his supporters that he would not do this .
I wrote an issue of Remnant Review titled “ The Fix Is In . ”
It was .
Bush ’s right - hand man , James Baker , took over running the White House staff .
All of the Reaganites at the White House — there were very few — departed within a year .
If conservatives had been honest , their slogan would have been : “ Let Reagan be Reagan . . . he ’s the only Reaganite still there . ”
But I have decided to change my policy , briefly .
Something happened this week that deserves comment , for it points to a change that is unprecedented .
GUY FAWKES DAY , 2007
On November 5 , Guy Fawkes Day , a privately run Web site took in over $ 4 million for Ron Paul ’s presidential campaign .
In one day .
Dr. Paul had not organized this .
This was 100 % word of mouse .
The Establishment news media were stunned — almost speechless .
This was impossible , as far as they were concerned .
This was completely unprecedented in American political history .
They do not understand what is going on .
A revolution is going on .
The word “ revolution ” is used all the time .
Occasionally , it is accurately applied .
This time , it is .
The Internet really does constitute a revolution .
This revolution is based on two factors : a new technology and unprecedented price competition .
There has never been price competition like this in the field of communication .
Digits that can be viewed as images — words , pictures , and videos , with audio files thrown in for good measure — are delivered instantaneously on demand ( or even without it : spam ) without paper , printing costs , or postage costs .
The primary limit on communication today is the time cost of reading .
This technological reality is creating nightmares for Establishments in every nation .
Why ?
Because the cost of access to voters is now limited to time and marketing creativity .
It is not limited by either space or mass .
This has never happened before in recorded history .
For over four centuries , the structure of Establishment rule has rested on one assumption above all others : the high cost of delivering images to large numbers of people .
This assumption has become increasingly ludicrous ever since 1996 .
THE ESTABLISHMENTS
A series of seemingly competitive Establishments are interlocked domestically and also internationally , despite competition at the margins among them .
There is basic agreement on competitive rules and strategies .
The Bilderberger organization conducts closed meetings where representatives of these Establishments get together to discuss in private the range of outcomes acceptable for the various international Punch and Judy shows .
These Establishments are an institutional mixture of long - term senior advisors to this year ’s crop of presidents and prime ministers , multinational bankers , foreign policy specialists , oil industry decision - makers , university educators , mainstream media representatives and their well - paid and completely housebroken salaried intellectuals , plus hundreds of low - level candidates who dream of entry into the inner ring .
( Read C. S. Lewis ’ wonderful essay , “ The Inner Ring . ”
It is on the Web . )
Entry into any of these Establishments is screened by senior members .
The system is self - policed .
The key to this policing is control over the barriers to entry .
Officially and legally , these various organizations are private and voluntary .
Their carefully crafted barriers to entry are not mentioned in the United States Constitution .
These barriers are not mentioned in the foundational judicial documents of any nation .
This means that , legally speaking , non-Establishment interlopers can breach these barriers and take over the society .
The ideology of democracy guarantees this .
Democracy is the reigning religion of our era .
But , as Forest Gump ’s mother would say , “ Democracy is as democracy does . ”
In every democratic nation , non-democratic barriers to entry into the various controlling Establishments have kept democracy on a very tight leash .
Here , I am speaking of politics .
But society is far more than politics .
Politics is only one aspect of society .
The Establishments ’ system of controls is not limited to politics .
Nevertheless , they maintain their control primarily through politics .
This is their supreme institutional weakness .
They are holed up inside a castle that has been built in terms of political control over the social order .
The social question is :
How can the public get off the existing leash ?
As economists would put it , at what price can the public get off the leash ?
If the cost of maintaining the leash increases , the public is more likely to get off the leash .
The cost of maintaining the leash is now rising exponentially .
Why ?
Because the cost of individuals ’ operating off the leash is collapsing .
THE CRUCIAL BARRIER TO ENTRY
Today ’s Establishments are an unofficial confederation of multiple interlocking directorates .
These are self - policed directorates .
The designers of this almost 500 - year - old piecemeal system have based their control on a single highly specific barrier to entry : the cost of delivering pieces of paper .
This barrier is now collapsing .
The last major communications - based revolution in the West began on October 31 , 1517 , when Martin Luther nailed his 95 proposed debate topics onto the door of the church in Wittenberg .
He thought he was launching a serious academic debate in Latin .
He was in fact launching a social revolution : a change in law , attitudes , and religion .
Luther could not have launched the Protestant Reformation had Gutenberg not invented movable type two generations earlier .
The nameless printers who translated Luther ’s 95 theses into German and then mass marketed them were the key to this revolution .
By never paying Luther royalties for his writings and pocketing all the profits , they made him the most important person of the sixteenth century .
Most historians would put him in the top five or ten men over the last 500 years .
But Gutenberg is higher on the list : no Gutenberg = no Luther .
It was impossible for the existing Establishment to stop Luther and his followers at a price they were willing to pay : the systematic destruction of all unregulated printing .
Subsequent political rulers recognized the threat and tried to control printers , but , political revolution by revolution , they failed .
The cost - effectiveness of printing was too great .
The lure of profit for printers was too great .
Printers cheated .
They broke the law .
The European Establishments in 1517 had been built on the older , pre-Gutenberg image - communications system .
By 1517 , the cost of delivering pieces of paper had fallen too far for the Establishments to adjust to the new pricing conditions .
They had not recognized the enormous threat to their power for two generations .
Luther spotted his opportunity by the end of 1517 .
The printers had made it visible to him within a matter of weeks .
He took advantage of it .
He became the greatest master of the pamphlet in the history of the world .
He retains the title .
Peter Drucker years ago wrote that when a new technology reduces costs by 90 % , it can not be stopped .
It will take over any market that has been maintained by an existing technology .
The Internet has reduced communications costs — not counting our time — by far more than 90 % .
It can not be stopped .
Any Establishment that fails to adjust to this new pricing structure for communications will not survive .
This means that the single most important foundation of the present reigning Establishments is in its final stages unless the Establishments adjust .
So far , they have n’t .
The information gatekeepers in every field except one are losing market share : newspapers , FCC - regulated television networks , K - 12 public education , and movies .
Radio long ago fell to the right - wing talk shows .
All that the Establishment has left in radio are the news shows on National Public Radio : narcoleptic radio .
( “ The surgeon general has warned : Do not drive while listening to NPR . ” )
In only one area do they still maintain almost complete control : higher education .
This control is maintained by means of a system of state - enforced accreditation .
But there is a monster inside the gates of the halls of ivy : the for - profit University of Phoenix .
It has at least 250,000 students enrolled today .
It is mainly Web - based .
It takes in over $ 2 billion in tuition each year .
It is the harbinger of the future .
Drucker ’s rule is about to manifest itself in higher education .
He saw it coming .
Distance learning cuts costs by 90 % .
“ Universities wo n’t survive .
The future is outside the traditional campus , outside the traditional classroom .
Distance learning is coming on fast . ”
http://www.mises.org/story/2013
I have shown how a student can earn a distance learning B.A. degree from an accredited university for about $ 15,000 in three years — maybe two .
http://www.LowestCostColleges.com
The Establishments are losing control .
They hold the leash , but it is wearing thin .
Ron Paul ’s $ 4 million day is indicative of how voters have begun to slip the Establishment ’s leash .
The time cost of reading is an inescapable cost .
Time is our only truly irreplaceable resource .
Here , the Establishments have no insurmountable cost advantage over anyone else .
If anything , they are on the defensive .
They are not digital media savvy .
This is why they are losing ground .
Through the dual technologies of Web addresses and graphics - based browsers , the Internet in just one decade , 1996 to 2006 , stripped the cost of communicating ideas to the bedrock limit : the time cost of reading .
I am sure there will be many more innovations , but the main one is now behind us : delivery costs .
This outcome was not foreseen by anyone in the U.S. military who designed the original Internet back in 1969 .
The outcome just happened .
Assuming that the Internet stays up , the revolution was .
The fallout has begun .
ADAPTING
Decentralization is now the wave of the future .
No single plan of social transformation will dominate the Internet .
There are too many players .
The cost of entry is too low .
Google will be a big part of successful plans .
That is about all I feel confident in saying .
This will be a trial - and - error procedure , which is weighted in favor of error .
Most plans fail .
This is good for liberty and bad for tyranny .
Tyranny is limited to one plan per power unit : whatever the central planners agree to .
Liberty is based on open entry : “ Come one , come all ! ”
The fact that most plans fail is the Achilles heel of central planning .
Consumers determine who succeeds or fails — mostly fails — in the free market .
Never has there been a market with entry costs lower than the Internet ’s .
The number of ways for private decision - makers to succeed is enormous and growing , due to low entry costs .
The number of ways for central planners to fail is growing just as fast .
Innovation is a characteristic feature of decentralization .
Stagnation is a characteristic feature of civil government .
This is because of rival systems of funding , as Ludwig von Mises showed in his 1944 book , Bureaucracy .
Funding for voluntary , decentralized agencies is dependent on creative promoters in the agencies or supportive of the agencies .
Success is based on whatever pleases consumers or donors .
In contrast , funding for civil government is based on taxes , unamortized debt , and monetary inflation .
All three produce losses for most consumers and therefore growing resistance .
Thus , my motto :
“ Nothing is sure except death and taxes and people ’s attempt to cheat both . ”
The inability of large , tax - funded , centralized government agencies to respond rapidly to innovative pathways around government controls is universal .
The lower the costs of entry , the more overwhelmed the state and its licensed institutions become .
Every Establishment therefore relies on the state to create barriers to entry .
These barriers are being undermined daily by the Internet .
This has happened so rapidly , under the radar of bureaucrats , that all of the various Establishments have been caught flat - footed .
If there was a single event that illustrates this tipping point , it was Matt Drudge ’s 1998 story on President Clinton and the unnamed intern .
Within hours , the attempted weekend suppression of the story by Newsweek ended in howls of derisive laughter .
To Newsweek , the world said : “ Close , but no cigar . ”
The breach in the gatekeepers ’ wall became visible to tens of millions of people within days .
This breach has gotten wider ever since .
The gatekeepers are frantic .
The mainstream news media immediately branded Drudge an amateur .
He was not credentialed in any way .
He was just a high school graduate operating out of a room in an apartment .
This attack had no effect .
Today , his site is ranked in the top 1,300 by Alexa .
It has a higher ranking than the Los Angeles Times or CBS .
As for MSNBC , it ’s about 16,000 — lower than LewRockwell.com , the Ron Paul information site .
WHAT ARE THE STAKES ?
The stakes are enormous .
The stakes are these : control over the flow of information , money , and power — in that order in importance .
This issue can be encapsulated by one question :
“ Will semi-public monopolistic agencies that are licensed by the central governments of the world be able to control the flow of information to individual decision - makers who have both money and brains ?
If you want it in percentages , it is this :
“ Will the 1 % on top be able to protect today ’s semi-monopolistic positions of the 4 % who shape the thinking of the 20 % who decide on behalf of the 80 % who officially have the votes , but who rarely show up on election day ? ”
There are three primary trends that suggest that the answer is “ no . ”
First is the Internet .
Second is the inability of most civil governments to protect the broad mass of the population from rising crime .
Third are the promises by politicians regarding long - term retirement income — promises not funded by the accumulation of income - generating assets .
Consider the Internet .
The denizens of the World Wide Web have more money than the typical voter .
They have more formal education .
They also have skills in navigating the Web .
They have Google .
They have e-mail .
They are international .
These people are on the cutting edge of social change .
In the way that literate people were on the cutting edge in 1517 , so are people who use the Internet as their primary source of information .
In effect , the world ’s Establishments have based their control on their ability to control the flow of information to illiterates — digital illiterates .
They are in the condition that the Catholic Church was in back in 1517 .
The Church controlled the preachers , more or less , through a system of compulsory accreditation and licensing .
The state backed up the Church .
Most people in Western Europe got their information from preachers in 1517 .
Then one of the preachers , Drudge - like , got his hands on a lot of printing presses — not directly , but indirectly .
The printers built his audience for him .
They kept the money ; he kept the audience .
Power after 1517 spread to local units of civil government in what we today call Germany .
Protestant princes challenged the Catholic Emperor .
The Church relied on the Emperor to enforce its system of accreditation and licensing .
It rested on a weak reed .
The process of decentralization , informed by low - cost pieces of paper , could not be reversed .
Today , the same process has accelerated .
Digits have replaced pieces of paper .
Electrons have replaced atoms .
It is very expensive for governments to control digits , which recognize no borders or jurisdictions .
Yet without such control , the Establishments ’ jointly held leash gets frayed .
Digits can cross borders .
This means that two things are now beyond low - cost control by any national government : information and money .
Information and money are conveyed in digital form .
The gatekeepers have always used control over information and money as their primary means of control .
In our era , for the first time in recorded history , the self - screened gatekeepers have lost control over both the flow of information and the flow of money .
They can try to influence both , but influence is not control .
Ron Paul ’s campaign indicates that Establishment influence is waning where it counts most in the long run : the flow of information .
The evidence for this is the flow of money : $ 4 million in one day .
That got the attention of the gatekeepers .
Money talks .
In their world , it talks louder than anything except votes .
WHEN DIGITAL MONEY FAILS
Karl Marx called this the cash nexus .
It ’s the digital nexus today .
Central banks control the creation of digital money .
They cannot control the response of speculators to monetary policy .
At most , they can influence speculators at the margin .
The key political fact in every Western nation is this : the supply of political promises has exceeded the supply of capital to fulfill these promises .
The system of political promises is unamortized .
This will produce a crisis of faith .
Today , there is society - wide faith in democracy and faith in civil government .
Both faiths are waning .
The evidence of this decline in faith is seen in rising prices and rising crime rates .
This process seems to be irreversible throughout the West .
This is the conclusion of Jacques Barzun in the final section of From Dawn to Decadence ( 2000 ) .
It is also the conclusion of Martin van Creveld in the final section of The Rise and Decline of the State ( 1999 ) .
The politicians dare not openly repudiate their promises of retirement safety nets .
To do so would be political suicide .
Yet these nets cannot be funded for even one more generation .
Their repudiation will therefore be papered over , not with paper money but with digital money .
When the flow of digital money from the world ’s capital cities ceases to maintain the flow of economic goods and services to those with bank accounts filled with digits , the world will change dramatically , just as it changed in the generation after Luther nailed his debate topics on the church door .
What matters most now is the flow of information , not the flow of funds .
The flow of funds is pretty much set .
Neither the government nor the public has much discretionary income .
The budget next month will look pretty much like the budget this month and last month .
What is changing is the budget for time .
People are re-allocating their precious time in terms of the new cost conditions .
Here , price competition has created a new world order .
Most denizens of the Web already have their favorite sites and e-letters .
To get them to change is costly .
Their attention cannot be bought with money alone , any more than the attention of pamphlet readers in Northern Europe could be bought with money alone after 1517 .
Today ’s political Establishment cannot respond effectively on the Web .
It can respond in the traditional media , but these are shrinking in influence .
The handwriting is on the screen : “ Thou hast been weighed in the balance and found wanting . ”
CONCLUSION
Ron Paul ’s success on November 5 has sent new information to the political Establishment : a small but Internet - savvy hard corps — a vanguard , to use Lenin ’s term — is putting its money where its mouse is .
He is now in a position to begin to mobilize this vanguard for a 20 - year political battle that will reach into every local community — to train people in the techniques of political mobilization through digital communication , and to provide them with the materials to challenge the existing political Establishment .
Why 20 years ?
Because we are in an early phase of a war whose outcome will be decided when digital money no longer buys what aging voters have been led to expect .
The revolution of rising expectations will be thwarted by rapidly depreciating digital money .
Thwarted expectations are the equivalent of century - old dry underbrush in a large political forest .
One lightning bolt will set it ablaze .
Lightning bolts in general are predictable .
Specific bolts are not .
We know what is going to happen .
We just do n’t know when .
I close with this ancient rule of politics : “ You ca n’t beat something with nothing . ”
It applies to every area of life .
It is not enough for today ’s Establishments to lose .
We must replace them with something better — something decentralized , privately funded , and unlicensed .

After a weekend hack session with Øyvind Kolås , I got WebKit / GTK +‘s Cairo backend rendering straight to OpenGL with Cairo ’s new OpenVG backend and ShivaVG :
At first the colours were a bit off and performance was nothing to write home about .
But Øyvind promptly pushed a fix and cooked up a patch to prevent static images being re-uploaded , and things started to fly .
The performance boost is most noticable for SVG and Web pages with large , animated graphics and dynamic content .
We ’re looking at full repainting is in the hundreds - of - FPS range .
I then turned my attentions to accelerating the canvas element .
WebKit / GTK +’s canvas is already the fastest free implementation around , but traditional approaches to rendering the canvas will only get you so far .
Sure enough , with a little more work I had Ilmari Heikkinen ’s Canvas Animation Kit Experiment ( CAKE ) running faster :
( The screenshot was caught during a GL buffer swap , it ’s all very smooth in reality . )
Accelerating the canvas was slightly tricky since canvas makes some assumptions about image data , but as we see here it ’s quite possible to make it go fast .
Patches should start to appear on # 16885 .
There ’s work to be done to improve rendering quality , get text smoothing back etc. , but it ’s a start .
This feature can be used both to acelerate WebKit / GTK + and in a standalone configuration with only a GLib dependency , as requested by Linden Lab who are looking at integrating WebKit into their virtual 3D environment .
It should also be usable with the brand new Cairo - based WebKit Windows port ( # 16979 ) that ’s on its way .

Deaths directly and indirectly attributable to the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq have neared one million people , a body count higher than the genocides in Rwanda and Sudan combined , according to a new report released by Just Foreign Policy .
That brings the U.S. caused death count in the Middle East to over three million people , and that 's not even counting fatalities in Afghanistan or Palestine .
The Just Foreign Policy report is an update to two controversial studies published by the prestigious British medical journal the Lancet .
In 2003 , the Lancet reported over 100,000 excess deaths in Iraq were attributal to the U.S. invasion .
That study may be read here .
In 2006 , the Lancet updated their study and found over 600,000 excess deaths in Iraq since the U.S. invasion .
That study may be read here .
The killing of Iraqis since the U.S. invasion includes violence caused by the overwhelming air and ground power of U.S. military forces , mortalities caused by the destruction of civilian infrastructure , and disappearances and murders caused by sectarian conflict and internal power struggles among different Iraqi factions .
The report 's methodology is controversial because it bypasses the normal model of death verification - which requires documenting each and every individual body tallied by governments , hospitals , and morgues - and instead uses a model first developed to estimate deaths caused by earthquakes , hurricanes , tornadoes , and other natural disasters , where bodies are often never found .
Many defenders of the occupation of Iraq claim that a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq would spark a genocide as sectarian conflict and civil war escalated out of control .
Indeed , violence may increase temporarily in the short term following a U.S. withdrawal .
Nature abhors a vacum and competition among Iraqi factions for power may increase as they rush to fill the void .

However , what is clear is that the U.S. invasion and continuing occupation of Iraq in and of itself constitutes a kind of genocide .
American economic sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s killed one million civilians , according to a 2003 study by the Centre for Population Studies .
And the U.S. funded both sides of the Iran / Iraq war in the 1980's , contributing to well over one million Arab and Persian casualties , according to Farhang Rajaee in a 1993 article published by the University of Florida titled The Iran - Iraq war : the politics of aggression .
Now an additional 996,836 Iraqis have been killed since the U.S. invasion in 2003 .
The instability and sectarian conflict were stoked by this unilateral , preemptive , and illegal invasion , and there is little hope of the internal conflict ending while Iraq is under foreign military occupation .
This situation is historically similar to the colonial period , where infighting between African and other indigenous tribes around the globe increased because of the havoc wreaked by colonial powers and their divide - and - conqueor strategies .
Indeed , the seeds of conflict and disputes between ethnic groups , e.g. in Rwanda , were planted by Western colonialism .
People of color around the world reap what we sow .
The immediate future of Iraq looks grim , with solutions ranging from bad to worse .
Our only hope of ending the senseless violence is an unconditional and immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq , followed by some kind of responsible assistance by the U.N. and Arab peacekeeping forces .
If the Iraqis have to go to civil war to sort out the mess that our government has left them in , let them .
It will eventually burn itself out like in Lebanon and , without any further interference from the West besides reconstruction and reparations , the Iraqis will be able to begin rebuilding their devastated country .

Home values in major U.S. cities continued to fall at a record pace in November , with Southern California posting some of the steepest declines in a national index released Tuesday .
Miami saw a 15.1 % drop in November compared to a year earlier , the worst among 20 metropolitan areas in the Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller composite index .
But San Diego was close behind with a 13.4 % decline .
The November index of 10 metropolitan areas saw a year - over - year annual decline of 8.4 % , the sharpest annual plunge since the index began in 1987 .
It was the second - straight record decline for the index , following a 6.7 % drop in October .
The index shows that home prices in Los Angeles and Orange counties are now almost 12 % below their peak month , which Case - Shiller places at September 2006 .
Advertisement
That drop was close to the median sales price declines recorded by DataQuick Information Systems .
The La Jolla - based firm reported the median price paid for homes in Los Angeles and Orange counties in December fell 10 % from the previous year .
Unlike the DataQuick median sales figures , the Case - Shiller index does not include condominium units or new homes .
The index compares the latest sales of individual houses to their previous sales .
It screens out foreclosures and accounts for remodeling work and other variables that affect pricing .
From that information , an index number is created .
The index is meant to be a benchmark of the housing market in the area , rather than a median sales figure .
Instead of stating prices , the index uses a score measuring percentage changes , based on a score of 100 for January 2000 .
The November score for 20 cities of 188.8 means prices are 89 % above January 2000 levels .
The S&P ; / Case - Shiller index began with a comparison of 10 cities but has since expanded to a group of 20 .
November saw record declines in 13 of the 20 metro areas .

Robert J. Shiller , the Yale University economist who co-founded the index , called the November figures “ another grim milestone in the housing market . ”
Only three metro areas showed annual price gains -- Charlotte , N.C. ; Seattle ; and Portland , Ore .

Welcome to the fifth and final installment of the Scholars & Rogues year - end wrap - up .
Today we tackle the dirty , but oddly riveting world of politics .
We ’ll take a couple shots at the even dirtier world of media that makes it all possible .
Let ’s start at the top , shall we ?
George Walker Bush : I ’ve been telling my Republican friends for five years now that Dubya was going to do more damage to their party than an army of Hillarys could dream of doing .
And 2007 was the year where I think the truth of this proposition finally started becoming evident .
Scandals at the Justice Department and World Bank did him no favors , nor did the conviction of Scooter Libby ( which necessitated the most politically debilitating pardon / commutation sequence since Ford saved Nixon ) .
Iraq got worse by the day and we ’re not seeing a lot of GOP presidential hopefuls looking to surf that Bush legacy .
Many people are saying he ’s the worst president ever .
I ca n’t make that claim because I ’m not really a presidential scholar and there ’s a lot I do n’t know about a lot of past presidents .
He ’s certainly the worst in my lifetime , and from what I can tell you have to go all the way back to Hoover to even get a good argument going on the subject .
History is n’t going to be kind to George Bush , and 2007 was just the beginning .
The Dick : Most days it seems like the only reason he has n’t been impeached is because the Democrats saw how the GOP hounded the Clintons .
I think they feel like impeachment would be taken as a purely partisan act , and a lot of them are sifting through their own closets and realizing that the last thing they want is to make impeachment seem like an acceptable thing to do .
But maybe I ’m just being cynical .
Here ’s what we know .
Scooter Libby did n’t think that shit up all by himself .
And it ’s almost impossible to imagine that a thorough , honest , hard - charging investigation could avoid exploring treason .
And by “ thorough , honest , hard - charging , ” I ’m suggesting that we should throw at least as much at the outing of a CIA operative as we would at , say , a land deal gone bad , mmmkay ?
So , President Bush Commuted the Perjury Sentence for Scooter Libby :
We learned in History of the World , Part 1 that it ’s good to be da king .
If you ca n’t be da king , we now know that next best thing is to be the guy who has evidence against da king .
Alberto Gonzales :
We once figured you had to be pretty damned smart to be Attorney General .
Turns out you do n’t even have to be smart enough to remember your own name .
Mike Mukasey :
You do n’t have to be able to recognize that Spanish Inquisition techniques constitute torture , either .
2007 was n’t just about The Dubya & The Dick Show , though .
There were all these people lining up auditioning to replace Mr. Bush .
Hillary Clinton :
We ’re not sure what tells you more about Hillary – her Bush - wannabe stance on Iraq or her taste in campaign theme songs .
Neither has us 100 % in love with her vison for America , though .
Barack Obama :
In our minds the defining moment of his campaign so far is n’t his Obama / Oprah in 2008 Tour or his alleged stances on the issues .
No , it ’s Chris Dodd busting his ass to prevent a blanket retroactive grant of immunity to telecoms for what look like serious violations of the law while Barack continues smiling for the cameras on the Campaign Trail .
He likes to talk about real change , but in what way , exactly , is this a change ?
John Edwards :
He ’s going about it wrong , but he ’s the only candidate among the frontrunners who ’s willing to talk about some of the real issues facing American families .
Rudy Giuliani :
Thanks to Rudy , we now know that mistresses are only a bad thing when Democrats have them .
Mike Huckabee : Preacher - in - Chief wannabe had a great 2007 – out of nowhere to legit threat .
He ’s got a tough road ahead , though .
There seem to be all kinds of things in his past that he might not want to talk about , like some positively Spears - esque parenting missteps that should give pause to his Christian followers .
And that ’s just the start .
John McCain : [ sigh ]
What might have been .
Will the defining moment of his career boil down to a badly rendered performance of “ Bomb Iran ” ?
John Fitzgerald Mitt Romney : JFK once gave a famous speech designed to convince Protestants that it would be okay to elect him , a Catholic , because he ’d protect the separation of church and state .
Drawing on that precedent , Romney gave a speech designed to assure people that it would be okay to elect him , a Mormon , because he ’d ignore the separation of church of state .
Fred Thompson : Wow .
In a few months he went from “ the next Ronald Reagan ” to a guy who ’d kill for Ron Paul ’s numbers .
Ron Paul :
We think there are tremendous problems with Mr. Paul ’s record and platform , but you have to give credit where credit is due .
His supporters are simply rabid , and there ’s always a value in having a legion of backers who are n’t willing to let anything get in the way .
Like facts , for instance .
Mike Gravel :
Old guy got mad skilz .
Next year look for a collaboration with Jay -Z .
Dennis Kucinich : Went on Colbert and revealed that his pockets contain a rip in the space / time continuum , allowing him to store a veritable warehouse of stuff .
And by the way , how do you look like that and score a wife who looks like this ?
He ’s like the Ric Ocasek of politics .
We do n’t have time to tackle all the fun stuff that happened on the politics and media front this year , but there are a few things we ’d like to observe in passing .
Nancy Pelosi Became the First Woman Speaker of the House :
Then promptly makes us wonder what we thought the difference was going to be .
Harry Reid Became First Woman Senate Majority Leader :
And promptly made us wish for the kind of strong , masculine leadership that Pelosi is providing across the hall .
The Wild Willy Follies !
Starring Larry Craig , Ted Haggard and David Vitter :
In Act 1 of our Republican morality play we learn that diddling hookers is bad , but not fatal , so long as they ’re chicks .
In Act 2 it is revealed that diddling “ escorts ” is bad , and exceedingly fatal , if they ’re packing the same equipment you are .
So remember , preachers and GOPlayas , before stepping out on the missus , be sure to conduct a thorough anatomy check .
News that Sen .
Vitter patronized the DC Madam raises a really important question : is there any low to which a prostitute wo n’t stoop ?
( By they way , Mr. Vitter has now discovered that “ I ’m a Republican Congressman from Louisiana ” is n’t technically a valid plea . )
Like most Americans , though , I ’m just grateful that Dick Cheney was n’t involved .
The thought of him attempting to roger something both human and alive makes me want to take a brillo pad to my eyeballs .
Scott McClellan on the Road to Damascus : “ So I stood at the White house briefing room podium in front of the glare of the klieg lights for the better part of two weeks and publicly exonerated two of the senior - most aides in the White House : Karl Rove and Scooter Libby .
There was one problem .
It was not true .
I had unknowingly passed along false information .
And five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so : Rove , Libby , the vice President , the Presidentâ€™s chief of staff , and the president himself . ”
Scotty , we ’re looking forward to your book and we hope it helps put some richly deserving criminals where they belong .
But there ’s one little problem with your story .
We knew you were lying .
If you did n’t , you ’re either a raging moron or a man of “ tremendous faith . ”
Katie Couric : Amidst much controversy , took over Cronkite ’s old chair .
Has since revolutionized broadcast journalism by offering hard - hitting analysis and relentless critiques of high government corruption .
Oh , wait a second – no , that was Keith Olbermann .
Don Imus :
Some ill - conceived comments on his radio show destroyed his career for a few months .
But now he ’s back , all rehabilitated and swearing that it ’ll never happen again .
To make sure it wo n’t happen again he ’s surrounding himself with all the people who made it happen in the first place .
We hope 2007 was good to you and that 2008 will be even better .
Our resolution is to make Scholars & Rogues an even better source of analysis and insight in the coming year , which is going to be a big one , especially here in the US .
We invite you to make us part of your everyday reading list and join in when we say something interesting .
Happy New Year .

( AP ) -
The recording industry won a key fight Thursday against illegal music downloading when a federal jury found a Minnesota woman liable for damages for sharing copyrighted music online .
Jurors ordered Jammie Thomas , 30 , to pay record companies $ 220,000 - or $ 9,250 for each of 24 songs for which the companies sought damages .
They could have awarded damages as low as $ 750 per song .
Thomas and her attorney , Brian Toder , declined comment as they left the courthouse .
In the first such lawsuit to go to trial , six record companies accused Thomas , 30 , of Brainerd , of offering 1,702 songs online through a Kazaa file - sharing account .
Thomas had denied wrongdoing and during the trial testified that she did n't have a Kazaa account .
Record companies have filed some 26,000 lawsuits since 2003 over file - sharing , which has hurt sales because it allows people to get music for free instead of paying for recordings in stores .
Many other defendants have settled by paying the companies a few thousand dollars .
During the three - day trial , record companies presented evidence they said showed the copyrighted songs were offered by a Kazaa user under the name " tereastarr . "
Their witnesses , including officials from an Internet provider and a security firm , testified that the Internet address used by " tereastarr " belonged to Thomas .
Toder had argued at closing that record companies never proved that " Jammie Thomas , a human being , got on her keyboard and sent out these things . "
" We do n't know what happened , " Toder told jurors .
" All we know is that Jammie Thomas did n't do this . "
Richard Gabriel , the industry 's lead attorney , called that defense " misdirection , red herrings , smoke and mirrors . "
And he asked jurors to find Thomas liable to send a message to other illegal downloaders .
" I only ask that you consider that the need for deterrence here is great , " he said .
Copyright law sets a damage range of $ 750 to $ 30,000 per infringement , or up to $ 150,000 if the violation was " willful . "
Jurors ruled that Thomas ' infringement was willful , but awarded damages in a middle range .
Before the verdict , an official with an industry trade group said he was surprised it took so long for such a lawsuit to come to trial .
Illegal downloads have " become business as usual , nobody really thinks about it , " said Cary Sherman , president of the Recording Industry Association of America , which coordinates the lawsuits .
" This case has put it back in the news .
Win or lose , people will understand that we are out there trying to protect our rights . "
Though Thomas denied wrongdoing , her testimony was complicated by the fact that she had replaced her computer 's hard drive after the sharing was alleged to have taken place -- and later than she said in a deposition before trial .
The hard drive in question was not presented at trial by either party , though Thomas used her new one to show the jury how fast it copies songs from CDs .
That was an effort to counter an industry witness 's assertion that the songs on the old drive got there too fast to have come from CDs she owned -- and therefore must have been downloaded illegally .
Record companies said Thomas was sent an instant message in February 2005 , warning her that she was violating copyright law .
Her hard drive was replaced the following month , not in 2004 , as she said in the deposition .
The record companies involved in the lawsuit are Sony BMG , Arista Records LLC , Interscope Records , UMG Recordings Inc. , Capitol Records Inc. and Warner Bros.

DES MOINES , Iowa ( CNN ) --
The 2004 election was about terrorism .
The 2006 election was about Iraq .
As the stock market continues to suffer losses , the economy is now the top issue in the presidential race .
What 's the big issue going to be for 2008 ?
Remember " the economy , stupid " ?
That was in 1992 -- the last time the U.S. had an economic election .
Another Bush , another Clinton , and that year the nation experienced an economic downturn .
Now , for the first time in more than four years , a majority of Americans , 57 percent , believe the nation is in a recession , according to a CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll released Tuesday .
The poll 's margin of error on that question was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
The economy is now the biggest issue in the presidential campaign .
Twenty - nine percent of poll respondents said the economy was their top issue , compared with 23 percent who listed the Iraq war -- a reversal from October 's results , when 28 percent listed the war and 22 percent pointed to the economy .
Rounding out the list of top five issues , health care was the top issue for 20 percent of respondents , illegal immigration was the most important issue for 14 percent and terrorism was the key issue for 10 percent .
The poll 's margin of error on the top issues was plus or minus 3 percentage points .
Is the economy really that bad ?
Democrats say yes .
" I 'd describe the economy as kind of a trap door where you 're one medical diagnosis or a pink slip or a missed mortgage payment away from dropping through and losing everything , " said Sen .
Hillary Clinton of New York , the front - runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Republicans prefer to look at the big picture .
" What country has had more success in creating a society of fairness and decency , in creating a society in which people move out of poverty , in which people have social mobility , have a chance to succeed ? " said former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , one of the leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination .
Undoubtedly true , but what about gas prices , home foreclosures , lagging wages and stock market jitters ?
Can Republicans look to national security to save them ?
Terrorism -- Giuliani's issue -- ranks fifth in importance out of five issues right now .
The security situation in Iraq may be improving , although that , too , is in dispute .
" The senator from New York , Sen. Clinton , said , quote , ' I would have to suspend disbelief in order to believe that the surge is working , ' " said Sen . John McCain of Arizona , another Republican presidential hopeful .
" Well , anyone today would have to suspend disbelief to not believe that the surge is working . "
But there 's no evidence of any increase in public support for the war in Iraq .
According to the poll , 69 percent , the highest number yet , want to withdraw some or all U.S. troops .
There 's been some good news about Iran .
A National Intelligence Estimate finds that Iran may have halted its nuclear weapons program for the time being .
But that news may not do Republicans much good .
Nearly half of Americans , 54 percent , believe the Bush administration deliberately misled them about whether Iran was attempting to develop nuclear weapons .
The poll 's margin of error on that question was plus - or - minus 4.5 percent .
President Bush 's job approval is 32 percent .
No wonder Republicans as well as Democrats are trying to run as agents of change .

The Panopticons are a set of four futuristic sculptures set in the rural settings of Blackburn , Burnley , Pendle and Rossendale districts of East Lancashire , England .
The powers - that - be commissioned the sculptures as gateway pieces and a symbol of the renaissance of the area .
Whatever the reason , the results are some fantastic works of art :
The Atom

The Atom , a giant egg - shaped , bronze - coated sculpture designed by Peter Meacock with Katarina Novomestka and Architects WCW .
It is located in the Wycoller Country Park in Pendle .

The Panopticon for Blackburn is Colourfields , a collaboration between Jo Rippon Architecture and artist Sophie Smallhorn .
The piece , which apparently is some sort of a striped walkway ( correct me if I 'm wrong , guys ) , is built on a former cannon battery .
Haslingden Halo

The Halo , designed by John Kennedy of LandLab , is a steel lattice structure on a tripod .
After dark , it 's lit with LEDs to give the sculpture the effect of hovering above the town of Haslingden in Rossendale .
Singing Ringing Tree
Photo : StewieD [ Flickr ]
Last ( and my favorite ! ) in the series is the Singing Ringing Tree , a musical sculpture overlooking Burnley .
The sculpture was designed by MIke Tonkin and Anna Liu , and was made from galvanized steel pipes .
When the wind blows , the " tree " sings an eerie tune :
Twelve - year - old Lama Al - Arian looked up into a camera with a broad smile two years ago and called her father a " political prisoner . ”
But her eyes betray her playfully shy exuberance  they are wracked by uncertainty about the future of a man who has been in a United States prison for five years this February .
South Florida University professor and pro-Palestinian activist Sami Al - Arian ’s highly publicized arrest on terror - related charges during the winter of 2003 was hailed as a major step forward in defending the US against terrorism by then Attorney General John Ashcroft .
On Feb. 20 , 2003 , the FBI arrested Al - Arian after indicting him and seven others on 50 charges including some related to terrorism and funding of terrorism .
At the time Ashcroft alleged that Al - Arian was the North American head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) , and the secretary of the PIJ ’s international organization .
One of the few public trials of a terrorism suspect in open US courts has called into question whether or not the Justice Department is a misnomer  leaving a man not convicted by any jury in US prisons indefinitely .
" There is a pattern in the United States of taking out this type of extrajudicial punishment against people who refuse to be convicted , " said Jonathan Turley , a member of Al - Arian ’s legal team who teaches law at George Washington University and specializes in national security and constitutional issues .
" A jury was not going to give them what they wanted , and they would have to take it some other way .
And that ’s what they ’re doing right now .
They ’re giving out punishment to a man they could n’t convict , " he said .
The documentary film by Line Halvorsen , USA vs. Al - Arian , tells the story of the trial through the strains it has put on Al - Arian ’s family .
The painful images of a mother crying , children too young to cope sent to live with relatives , and the befuddlement of Al - Arian ’s older children as they contend with surprise after surprise , reveal a sinister dark side of the US government ’s " war on terror . ”
The astonishing legal drama started when Al - Arian was arrested and charged with terror - related crimes .
After two and a half years in jail  often in solitary confinement 
Al - Arian stood trial and was eventually found not guilty on some counts , with the jury returning no verdict on the others .
The film crew caught one of the jurors emerging from the courthouse being asked a question by the press about what it would have taken to return a guilty verdict .
" Evidence , " said the juror dryly .
After Al - Arian ’s overwhelming victory , the Justice Department decided to pursue the undecided charges again in what could have been another long ordeal before Al - Arian even appeared in front of another jury .
Faced with the prospect of putting his family through the process again , Al - Arian pled guilty to lesser charges of aiding people associated with terror .
In addition to another long trial , had Al - Arian fought the charges in court and won , he still would have likely faced deportation from the US .
" That entire time he would ’ve been locked up .
He would have had to fight deportation .
That process could take five to 10 years .
But at the end of the day he would have been deported , " said Georgetown University law professor David Cole in the film .
" What does that do to the family when your father or your husband is locked up for 10 years fighting to make a point ? "
The resulting agreement  the end of the case covered by the documentary  gave Al - Arian credit for time served and left him with 11 months of his sentence to serve out in federal prison .
But the Justice Department saw to it that the high hopes of the family for an imminent reunion would not pan out in just a year .
" Unfortunately , much of what you saw was prelude to even worse acts by the US government .
At this moment , Dr. Al - Arian is sitting in Northern Neck prison with an uncertain future , " said Turley , who was part of a panel discussion after a screening of the film .
Despite the absence of a clause in the plea requiring cooperation with the government , which was negotiated away by Al - Arian ’s defense team , he was called to testify before a federal grand jury in Virginia and  upon refusal  was held for civil contempt .
" Tonight two years have gone by since the events that we ’ve seen in that film , and the story is not yet over .
In fact , it ’s gotten quite more complicated , " said Al - Arian ’s eldest son and family spokesperson Abdullah during the panel .
" It was a difficult journey and it was something we had hoped would already have come to an end .
And it seems that it was headed in that direction , but that ’s not what ended up happening . "
What did end up happening is the indefinite detention of Al - Arian .
An overzealous prosecutor from the US attorney ’s office in Virginia subpoenaed Al - Arian in the unrelated case of a northern Virginia Islamic charity and think tank accused of financing terror .
The prosecutor , Gordon Kromberg , has been accused of an anti-Muslim bias revealed in a rant he made about " the Islamization of America " as part of a discussion about whether it was appropriate to move Al - Arian during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan .
In a court motion , one of Al - Arian ’s legal team quoted Kromberg as saying , " If they [ Muslims ] can kill each other during Ramadan , they can appear before the grand jury . "
By law , when a subpoenaed witness is held in civil contempt , it freezes any other sentences that are being served .
Al - Arian ’s detention for contempt started with just five months left on his plea agreement sentence .
When the term of the Virginia grand jury expired last week , the contempt charges were dismissed .
But Al - Arian potentially faces their reinstatement when the grand jury reconvenes in January .
In the unlikely scenario that the government does end its campaign against Al - Arian this way , he could be deported by April .
Because civil contempt charges are designed to be used as coercive measures to compel uncooperative witnesses to testify , the Justice Department will eventually need to face the reality that Al - Arian will not testify .
But even when that occurs , criminal contempt charges could be brought .
These charges have no upper limit on sentence , though Cole told IPS that it likely would n’t be more than a few years .
The real cost , however , of indefinite detentions and abuses by the Justice Department may take a larger toll than just the strains put on the Al - Arian family  these cases , argue Cole , actually have a negative impact on the war on terror as a broader effort .
" This has backfired and has , in fact , caused this whole preventive paradigm in which we take harsh coercive measures  particularly against Arabs and Muslims  that are seen broadly as illegitimate and unjust , " Cole told IPS after the recent screening of Halvorsen ’s film in Washington .
" It plays into al - Qaeda ’s hands .
It gives them the very propaganda they want .
And so I think that ’s very costly . "
Defence lawyers had argued Montgomery was mentally ill
After four hours of deliberation , they rejected Lisa Montgomery 's plea that she had been delusional when she killed Bobbie Jo Stinnett and stole the baby .
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Montgomery , convicted of kidnapping resulting in death .
The baby , a girl , survived and was later returned to her father .
' Voodoo science '
Montgomery met the Stinnetts at a rat terrier dog show in Kansas in April 2004 .
Having learnt of Bobbie Jo's pregnancy , in December 2004 she used a fake online profile to set up a meeting at the Stinnett family home saying that she wanted to buy a terrier puppy .
Victoria Jo Stinnett is now nearly three years old
A doctor testifying in the trial said that Bobbi Jo was probably still alive when Montgomery started removing her child .
Montgomery 's lawyers had sought to portray their client as a victim of severe mental illness whose delusion of being pregnant - pseudocyesis - was being threatened , causing her to enter a dreamlike state when the killing took place .
They also argued that she had post - traumatic stress disorder brought on by mental , physical and sexual abuse in her childhood .
Federal prosecutor Roseann Ketchmark called the claim of pseudocyesis " voodoo science " .
Healthy child
Instead , the prosecutor argued that Montgomery had feared her ex-husband , Carl Boman , would expose that she was lying about being pregnant and use it against her as he sought custody of two of the couple 's four children .
" It 's not pseudocyesis or post - traumatic stress disorder , " Ms Ketchmark said in closing arguments .
Mrs Stinnett thought her visitor was coming to buy a puppy
" And even if you wrap them up and put delusions around them , it 's not insanity . "
Mrs Stinnett , 23 and eight months pregnant when she was killed , fought for her life and that of her child , the trial heard .
Nodaway County Sheriff Ben Espey , who was the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the Stinnetts ' home in Skidmore , Missouri , said in his testimony :
" You could see swirls in the floor in the blood , showing there was a struggle . "
Her killer was arrested the day after the crime having spent the morning showing off the infant as her own in her hometown of Melvern , Kansas .
" The only good thing that comes from this tragedy is that little Victoria is a healthy baby and is reunited with her family , " US Attorney John F Wood said .
And THEN
They 'd do something
He hated the most !

Marine Cpl. Jacob
Schick says he was ready to die in Iraq .
He was n't prepared to come home in pieces .
The bomb that tore through the floor of his Humvee in the fall of 2004 shredded his legs and left arm .
Forty - six surgeries later , Schick is an amputee still learning to cope with physical limitations that as a star high school athlete he never dreamed he would face .
Perhaps just as daunting has been learning to navigate the veterans ' health care system , which he says demeans the sacrifice of all veterans .
" When you have to deal with the VA ( Veterans Affairs ) or TRICARE ( the federal health insurance program ) , you feel beaten down , " Schick said .
" You are a number , and you feel like a number .
It 's a total , total beat - down . "
Schick , 25 , who grew up in Texas and Louisiana and now lives in Gretna , is one of the 10 injured veterans featured in an HBO film , " Alive Day Memories : Home from Iraq , " that airs tonight .
The title of the documentary , produced by " Sopranos " star James Gandolfini , refers to the date that the injured narrowly escape death and realize that they are still alive .

Democratic presidential candidate , Senator Chris Dodd , appeared on Tuesday 's Countdown to discuss his victory on the Senate floor yesterday , by forcing an amendment to the FISA legislation that would have given retroactive immunity to telecom companies that spied on Americans without warrants , to be tabled till next January - or February .
Senator Dodd showed the same passion and leadership talking with guest host Alison Stewart as he did last night on the Senate floor , vowing once again to filibuster the bill in January if immunity is still included and saying that to do so would be pretending like these crimes never happened .
Dodd , unlike most of the Democratic leadership , shows no fear of President Bush , excoriating him for trampling all over our Constitution .
Dodd : " ... The president said he'd veto the legislation if that immunity were not in the bill .
Imagine this , passing a bill that would allow us to get better information about those who would do us harm and protect our rights .
He 'd squander all of that to protect a few phone companies .
I 'm not going to stand for it , I 'll go back and filibuster it if I have to .
[ snip ]
" I 've been asked , what 's the first thing I 'd do as president in the year 2009 , and January 20th .
And I 'm going to give you back your Constitution , because this administration has gone out of it's way to do just the opposite and the Constitution does not belong to a political party or a candidate and they 've been trampling all over it . "
Sadly , the New York Times followed much of the liberal media and buried the story of Dodd 's historic fight on page A29 .
Surviving victims still demand an apology more than 60 years on
The motion sponsor , opposition MP Olivia Chow , said the episode constituted " crimes against humanity " .
The women affected were mainly Chinese , Korean , and Filipina , but other nations have demanded Japan apologise .
In 1993 Japan issued an official apology over so - called " comfort women " , but parliament never approved it .
Former Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe caused uproar earlier this year when he said there was no proof of state involvement - a statement he later played down .
' Formal and sincere '
The symbolic , non-binding Canadian motion calls on Japan to " take full responsibility for the involvement of the Japanese Imperial Forces in the system of forced prostitution " .
Many victims hid their past for years out of shame
It must offer " a formal and sincere apology expressed in the Diet to all of those who were victims " .
Japan said it regretted the vote , and it would not help bilateral relations .
Similar motions have been adopted in the US and the Netherlands .
Speaking to the AFP news agency after the vote , Ms Chow said : " For me , this is n't crimes against 200,000 women .
It 's crimes against humanity and all of the world 's citizens have a responsibility to speak out against it . "
" Fifteen - year - old young girls were subjected to torture and raped by countless men for weeks , months and years on end , " she added .
Old wounds
The comfort women were forced into brothels for Japanese soldiers in the 1930s and during World War II .
Japan 's failure to apologise and issue official compensation remains an irritant in relations with the nations affected .
In South Korea , surviving " comfort women " still demonstrate every Wednesday outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul .
Many did not reveal their involvement for decades out of a sense of shame .
Japan set up a private compensation fund in 1995 as a way of offering recompense without officially acknowledging wrong .
But many women have rejected the offer , saying it should come from the government itself .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The Bush administration waived environmental and other laws on Monday and ordered construction to proceed on an environmentally sensitive section of the border fence between the United States and Mexico .
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff issued the waiver , which bypasses a federal judge ’s temporary restraining order against building the 1.5 - mile ( 2.4 - km ) section of fence in a natural conservation area in Arizona .
Chertoff acted because any further delay would present “ unacceptable risks ” to security , the Homeland Security Department said .
He acted on authority of various immigration and security laws .
“ We need to move forward on building this fence , ” department spokeswoman Laura Keehner said .
The environmental groups Defenders of Wildlife and the Sierra Club had sought to block construction on grounds the fence ’s environmental impact had not been sufficiently studied , and a federal judge on October 10 temporarily blocked further construction .
The fence is being built in southeastern Arizona in the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area , which the environmental groups describe as unique and biologically diverse , with more than 250 species of migratory birds having been recorded there .
The fence is part of 380 miles of border fencing the department has committed to build by the end of 2008 .
The department said the conservation area has also been an increasingly popular corridor for illegal immigration .
It said there were more than 19,000 apprehensions and 21,000 illegal entries in the area in fiscal 2007 , which ended last month .
Fourteen immigrants died in the “ inhospitable ” surroundings during the period , it said .
The immigrants also cause environmental damage due to trash , soil erosion and wildfires caused by campfires , it said .
A statement by the two environmental groups accused Chertoff of bypassing environment laws to push through a “ destructive , ineffective plan . ”
“ Bulldozing the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area and our important environmental protections is not necessary to manage the border , ” said Sean Sullivan with the Sierra Club ’s southeastern Arizona chapter .
Chertoff had twice before exercised his waiver authority to complete construction on other sections of border fencing , Keehner said .
Twitter ベイジアンフィルタプロキ シ
Twitter で following が増えてくるにつれて、タイムラインに目を通すのが大変になってきた( という程きちんと見ている訳ではないが ) 。
さっとタイムラインをなめて面白そうな情報をピックアップしたい時は、「おはよう」とか「風呂入った」とか「トイレ」とかは除外して読みたい(そういう書き込み自体は嫌いじゃないのだが、人生はあまりにも短い ) 。
Twit や P3 : PeraPeraPrv では NG ワード指定ができて、それらを含むステータスは表示しないようにできるのだが、Twitter の書き込みは揺らぎが激しすぎて指定しきれないという弱点がる。
ということでベイジアンフィルタでフィルタリングしてみることにした。
自前で Twitter クライアントを作る気はないので 、proxy の形でさっと実装してみた 。
#!/usr /bin/perl use strict ; use warnings ; use HTTP :: Proxy ; use HTTP :: Proxy :: BodyFilter :: complete ; my $ proxy = HTTP :: Proxy ->new ( port => 8088 ) ; $ proxy -> push_filter ( response => HTTP :: Proxy :: BodyFilter::complete->new , mime => ' application /xml ' ) ; $ proxy->push_filter ( response => Bsfilter -> new , mime => ' application /xml ' ) ; $ proxy -> start ; { package Bsfilter ; use File : : Temp qw / tempfile / ; use XML :: XPath ; use base qw( HTTP :: Proxy :: BodyFilter ) ; sub filter { my ( $ self , $ dataref , $ message , $ protocol , $ buffer ) = @_ ; return unless defined ( $ $ dataref ) && $ $ dataref ne '' ; eval { my $xml = XML :: XPath -> new ( xml => $ $ dataref ) ; my @nodes = $ xml->findnodes ( '/ statuses/status/text/text ( ) ' ) ; return unless @nodes ; for my $ node ( @nodes ) { my $ text = $ node -> getNodeValue ; if ( is_NG ( $ text ) ) { $ node->setNodeValue ( " [ NG ] $ text " ) ; } } $ $ dataref = qq ( <?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>
) ; $ $ dataref .= $ xml->get_context ->toString ; utf8 ::encode ( $ $ dataref ) ; } ; if ( $@ ) { warn $ @ ; } } sub will_modify { 1 } sub is_NG { my ( $ text ) = @_ ; my ( $fh , $ filename ) = tempfile ( ) ; utf8 ::encode ( $ text ) ; print $ fh $ text ; close ( $fh ) ; my $ result = system ( " bsfilter -- homedir ~/.twitter - bsfilter -- ignore - header -- auto-update $ filename " ) ; unlink ( $ filename ) ; return !
$ result ; } }
HTTP proxy の作成
Perl で HTTP proxy を作ろうとして真っ先に思い浮かんだのは POE だけれど、ちょっとヘビーなので今回 は
HTTP :: Proxy をチョイス。 もともとフィルタリング HTTP proxy を作ることを念頭に置い た
Perl モジュールなので今回の目的にぴったり 。
1つはまった点といえば、filter の呼び出しがレスポンス全てを取得してからではなく一部分ずつの呼び出しになるところ。その仕様に気がつくのにちょっと時間がかかってしまった。 例えば XML 形式のレスポンスをフィルタしようとしても、普通に
HTTP :: Proxy を使うと XML の一部ずつがフィルタに渡されるため、XML のパースがうまくいかない 。
これについて は HTTP :: Proxy :: BodyFilter::complete を使うことで、まとめてフィルタに渡せるようになった。
レスポンスの処 理
Twitter のタイムライン取得について は P3 : PeraPeraPrv が XML 形式で取得しているので、そのタイプのレスポンスをフィルタするようにした。
XML ::XPath でステータス部分を抜き出して NG 判定し 、NG であれば先頭に [ NG ] を追加する。 これで Twitter クライアント側 で [ NG ] を NG ワード指定すれば、表示されないようにすることができる。
bsfilter による NG 判定
NG 判定は普段メールの spam フィルタとして使っている bsfilter を使った。 単純に system 関数で呼び出して結果を取得するだけ 。
今回は対象がメールではないので -- ignore - header を指定。また自動的に学習するように -- auto - update を指定。 それと普段メールのフィルタリングに使っているのとは bsfilter のデータベースを別にしたいので、 -- homedir も指定しておく 。
NG と非 NG の学習 。
NG ワードを twitter - NG. txt に、非 NG ワードを twitter - clean.txt に書いて以下のコマンドを実行。
bsfilter -- add- clean -- ignore - header -- homedir ~/.twitter - bsfilter twitter-clean.txt bsfilter --add- spam -- ignore - header -- homedir ~/.twitter - bsfilter twitter -NG.txt bsfilter --update -- homedir ~/.twitter -bsfilter
自分の環境 ( Debian GNU / Linux sid ) では、UTF - 8 で書いておいて問題なかった。
フィルタリングしてみる
あとは先の proxy を起動し 、P3 : PeraPeraPrv でプロキシとして localhost : 8088 を指定すれば OK 。
タイムラインを取得するたびに bsfilter が動いて NG なステータスには [ NG ] が挿入される 。
フィルタリングの精 度
これについては、まだまだチューンの必要ありかな。
事前の学習データが少ない。
-- auto - update していることもあり、最初に NG 判定が多いとそちら側に強化されすぎる。
毎回 bsfilter を呼んでいるため、同じステータスが何度も学習される。
まだ使える精度まで上がってないけれど、教師データを増やせばそれなりにいけるかもしれない。
proxy の枠組ができたので 、( @～は抜いてから bsfilter に渡すとか、前後の文脈も含めるとか ) いろいろ試して遊べそうではある。 別に bsfilter にこだわらず、正規表現による判定などをしてもよいし。
この辺り P3 は Java で書かれているので、プラグインを書いて拡張できるよう将来になると面白いなと思ってみたり。
To protect their young against rattlesnakes , California ground squirrels have evolved a special defense — they heat their tails .
Squirrels in the wild wave their bushy tails at snakes in order to look bigger and more threatening .
This upsizing defense is a common tactic in the animal kingdom — cats puff up their fur for the same reason when alarmed .
Curiously , squirrels wave their tails at rattlesnakes even more vigorously in the dark , when the snakes ' eyes can not see squirrel tails .
Still , rattlesnakes can sense heat or infrared radiation .
Behavioral biologist Aaron Rundus at the University of California , Davis , and his colleagues suspected squirrel tails were sending heat signals to rattlesnakes that were invisible to the human eye .
How it works
" One way squirrels regulate their body temperature is through their tails , " Rundus explained .
" They dump heat to cool down by increasing blood flow through their tails , or reduce blood flow there to keep warm .
So there 's already a system there where they can manipulate tail temperature . "
Using an infrared camera , the researchers filmed encounters between California ground squirrels ( Spermophilus beecheyi ) and snakes in the laboratory , such as northern Pacific rattlesnakes ( Crotalus oreganus ) or Pacific gopher snakes ( Pituophis melanoleucus ) .
When facing rattlesnakes , the squirrels waved their tails and turned on the heat , likely by increasing blood flow into their tails and fluffing up the fur there .
When engaging gopher snakes , which cannot sense infrared , the squirrels waved their tails , but kept them cool .
" There is this hidden communication system going on , " Rundus said .
" There 's a whole world going on out there that we as humans do n't detect , hidden processes that other animals with different perceptual capabilities take advantage of that we have still yet to uncover . "
The findings are detailed online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Robot squirrel
Rundus and his colleagues also tested rattlesnakes with a stuffed , highly lifelike robotic squirrel model fitted with a heatable tail .
The rattlesnakes were wary of the waving " squirrel - bot " tail , but especially so when it was heated to the same temperature as the tail of a live squirrel confronting a rattlesnake .
In the future , the researchers would like to improve their squirrel - bots enough to take them out into the field and test them in more natural settings , as well as build in other squirrel behaviors , such as sand or gravel tossing .

The man had inflicted a serious injury on himself , police said
Police were called to a house in Goldington , Bedford , after reports of a dispute between a mother and her son .
The man , who was already injured , threatened the officers with a knife and was shot with the stun gun before going back into the house .
He was then found with further self - inflicted wounds and was taken to hospital where he died .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) has been informed and is likely to investigate the incident , which happened at 1900 GMT on Saturday .
A post -mortem examination to determine the cause of death is due on Monday .
A police spokeswoman said : " Armed officers went to the address after being called to a domestic dispute involving a mother and son .
" On arrival at the property , police found the man in his 30s suffering from injury and armed with a knife .
" He threatened officers and , as a result , the taser was discharged .
" The man then retreated into the house alone and when found shortly afterwards by police officers , he was in need of urgent medical attention because of subsequently self - inflicting serious injury to himself . "
Terry Banthorpe , a neighbour , said the man who died had been threatening his own mother with a knife .
He said : " We had our door open and heard the quiet , muffled voice of an old lady saying that her son was trying to kill her . "
QUEBEC --
Any attempt to counter terrorists war - torn Afghanistan will not succeed without an intervention in neighbouring Pakistan , Liberal Leader Stephane Dion said Wednesday .
Mr. Dion hinted NATO could take action in Pakistan , which has a porous border with Afghanistan , if the Pakistani government does n’t move to track terrorists .
“ We are going to have to discuss that very actively if they ( the Pakistanis ) are not able to deal with it on their own .
We could consider that option with the NATO forces in order to help Pakistan help us pacify Afghanistan , ” said Mr. Dion in Quebec City , commenting after his two - day trip to Afghanistan last weekend .
“ As long as we do n’t solve the problem in Pakistan , I do n’t see how we can solve it in Afghanistan . ”
The Liberal leader explained that Afghan officials told him they know where the extremist strongholds are in Pakistan .
But he said the Afghans do n’t take action .
“ One day , we are going to have to act because our soldiers are cleaning out some areas , but in fact very often they are only clean in principle .
The insurgents go take refuge in Pakistan and they are going to come back ( to Afghanistan ) at the earliest opportunity .
This could last very long if we do n’t tackle the problems that often originate from Pakistan , ” Mr. Dion said .
Defence Minister Peter MacKay told Canwest News Service Dion ’s comments were off base .
“ Mr. Dion ca n’t be serious to suggest NATO “ intervene , ” in another country while simultaneously saying Canada should abandon its United Nations - mandated NATO mission in Afghanistan , ” he said in an e-mail .
“ He has to explain to Canadians why he wants an “ intervention ” but wants to turn his back on Afghanistan , which has asked and continues to ask for Canada ’s help .
It ’s inane . ”
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf acknowledged last August that Islamic extremists are operating in tribal areas on his nation ’s side of the border with Afghanistan and providing support to insurgents fighting U.S. and NATO troops .
Mr. Musharraf and his Afghan counterpart Hamid Karzai have been urged by the U.S. and other allied countries to work together to counter the extremists ’ presence in the tribal belt that straddles their 2,400 - kilometre border .
But Mr. Dion said that more pressure has to be put on the Pakistani government for immediate action .
Although Mr. Karzai rejected the Liberal position that Canada should end its combat mission in southern Afghanistan by February 2009 , Mr. Dion reiterated his party wants a halt to the 2,500 - soldier combat mission in Kandahar as scheduled .
But he said he wants some troops to remain in Afghanistan to play a different role , for instance in training police , civilian protection and reconstruction in safer zones .
“ We saw how much Canada is needed for development and security purposes and we should focus on that , ” stressed Mr. Dion , who added he was “ impressed ” by the job done by the Canadian Forces .
“ We were proud to be Canadians when we were in Afghanistan , ” he said .
But nonetheless , Mr. Dion thinks that Canada ’s “ enormous ” involvement in the combat must come to an end .
“ For the mission to succeed , NATO must apply the principle of rotation .
When a country is in the most difficult combat mission during three years , there must be a time for rotation , ” he said .
The House of Commons will have to vote on whether to extend the mission , following recommendations brought forth by the panel headed by former Liberal deputy prime minister John Manley .

New video and photographic evidence that puts three senior CIA operatives at the scene of Robert Kennedy ’s assassination has been brought to light .
The evidence was shown in a report by Shane O’Sullivan , broadcast on BBC Newsnight .
It reveals that the operatives and four unidentified associates were at the Ambassador Hotel , Los Angeles in the moments before and after the shooting on 5 June , 1968 .
The CIA had no domestic jurisdiction and some of the officers were based in South - East Asia at the time , with no reason to be in Los Angeles .
‘ Decoy ’
Kennedy had just won the California Democratic primary on an anti-War ticket and was set to challenge Nixon for the White House when he was shot in a kitchen pantry .
A 24 - year - old Palestinian , Sirhan Sirhan , was arrested as the lone assassin and notebooks at his house seemed to incriminate him .
However , even under hypnosis , he has never been able to remember the shooting and defence psychiatrists concluded he was in a trance at the time .
Witnesses placed Sirhan ’s gun several feet in front of Kennedy but the autopsy showed the fatal shot came from one inch behind .
Dr Herbert Spiegel , a world authority on hypnosis at Columbia University , believes Sirhan may have been hypnotically programmed to act as a decoy for the real assassin .

Classic Bush .
Never , ever lets facts get in the way .
Today , Bush attacked Democrats over a bill he has n’t even seen :
“ Although the Administration has not seen the legislation , according to press reports it would include $ 18 billion in additional domestic and emergency spending above the president ’s budget , ” Nussle said .
“ When added to emergency domestic spending Congress already included in the Defense Appropriations bill , this so - called compromise would result in more excess spending than even the Democrats ’ original budget included . ”
Have n’t seen it , but that does n’t stop the Bush team .
Hill Dems . blasted back :
In a joint statement , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) blasted the White House statement .
“ Although he admits he has not even seen the bipartisan legislation that would fund critical priorities such as border security , homeland security , and putting more police officers on the street , the president has recklessly threatened to veto it , ” the Democratic leaders said .
“ For a President already lacking in credibility , it is dangerous to issue veto threats based on press reports alone . ”
This is all fun and games for Bush .
After all , he invaded Iraq and started an endless war without any facts .

Literary Atmospheres
She 's been inhaling fumes from a nearby shoe factory .
The author " claimed to have become so intoxicated " by the fumes that " she was reduced to writing thrillers . "
Indeed , the fumes grew so intense " that she was unable to concentrate on writing her highbrow novel , Cool Wind from the Future , and instead wrote a brutal crime story , Bleedout , which she found easier . "
That book went on to sell 10,000 copies .
So there are several unspoken arguments being put forward by her claim .
Such as :
1 ) Literary judgement .
Why is one " reduced " to writing crime thrillers ?
Perhaps Henning Mankell is more interesting than , say , Zadie Smith .
This writer thinks so , at least .
I.e. me .
Perhaps the traumatized British author under discussion here should actually owe money to the shoe factory – a small percentage of her royalties , for instance – or at least an acknowledgment in the book .
2) Environmental causality .
Perhaps BLDGBLOG is caused by the fact that I do not inhale fumes from a nearby shoe factory .
Perhaps I find it difficult to concentrate on anything but architecture because of my city 's aroma ...
I 'd thought it'd been all the coffee .
3 ) Paranoia .
Perhaps you , right now , are inhaling something that prevents you from writing your own Ulysses .
Perhaps you are being held back by untraceable smells .
Perhaps your life is being quietly reshaped by something you can neither see nor properly talk about , some vast and mysterious influencing machine that manipulates you from the outside .
Perhaps that machine is a giant shoe factory .
4 ) Theft , unauthorized use of services , and / or copyright infringement .
Perhaps this woman has been using the shoe factory 's fumes without permission .
Perhaps , Delphi - like , they have been wafting through the neighborhood for someone else 's use , mesmerizing home scribblers into a state approaching
Put the pen down , love .
These fumes are n't for you .
It 's a form of neurochemical shoplifting .
5 ) Scapegoating .
Perhaps you can't finish the novel you started writing last summer because of London .
You do n't live in London – in fact , you 've never been there – but it 's distracting you .
It 's forcing you to write emails to friends , instead .
You have n't touched your novel in ages .
You should sue London ...
Or perhaps all those buildings you see everyday are preventing you from being a good architecture critic .
It 's not your eye for detail – it's the buildings you 're forced to write about .
Perhaps the streets you take to work each day are not inspiring you to travel abroad and be interesting and do something fun with your life .
Perhaps your coworker 's cubicle makes you terrible at data entry .
Perhaps nothing is your fault at all .
Perhaps the color of Manhattan taxi cabs prevents you from writing good music .
You 're now homeless .
You prepare to sue .
6 ) Aromatherapeutic innovation and / or the future of global perfume .
In 2010 , Burberry will release a new scent .
It will smell like the fumes of British shoe factories .
Within days of buying your first bottle you begin to convulse – and write thrillers ...
So is your neighborhood causing you to write – or not write – highbrow novels ?
Can you prove it ?
Or do you only cook spaghetti because of the sad little street you live on – when , really , you 're a gourmet chef ...?
What is your city doing to you ?

In rejecting a key element of a legal challenge to the government ’s warrantless wiretapping program , federal appellate judges on Friday demonstrated once again the willingness of U.S. courts to give the Bush administration considerable latitude in handling the war on terror .
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco , by a 3 - 0 vote , barred an Islamic charity from using a confidential government document to prove that it had been illegally spied upon , agreeing with the administration that disclosure would reveal “ state secrets . ”
The lawsuit , filed by Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation and two of its attorneys , challenged the National Security Agency ’s spying endeavor , the Terrorist Surveillance Program , launched after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
The U.N. Security Council has declared that Al - Haramain , which operates in more than 50 countries , belongs to or is associated with Al Qaeda .
The suit was one of 50 legal challenges brought across the country after the program ’s existence was revealed in the New York Times .

Other courts have shown similar deference to the Bush administration on the state secrets privilege , which permits the government to bar disclosure in court of information if “ there is a reasonable danger ” it would affect national security .
But the ruling in this case was particularly striking because it came from a panel of three liberal jurists , all appointed by Democratic presidents .
Moreover , the charity , unlike other plaintiffs , says it has evidence of surveillance -- a call log from the National Security Agency that the government inadvertently turned over in another proceeding .
In the ruling , Judge M. Margaret McKeown wrote that the judges accepted “ the need to defer to the executive on matters of foreign and national security and surely cannot legitimately find ourselves second - guessing the executive in this arena . ”

Erwin Chemerinsky , a liberal constitutional law professor at Duke University law school , said the court showed “ how much deference even a liberal panel of judges is willing to give the executive branch in situations like this , and I find that very troubling . ”
Doug Kmiec , a conservative constitutional law professor at Pepperdine law school , said “ the opinion is consistent with ” a ruling by the federal appeals court in Cincinnati earlier this year striking down a challenge to the surveillance filed by the American Civil Liberties Union .
He said the dual rulings indicated that “ federal courts recognize that the essential aspects of the Terrorist Surveillance Program both remain secret and are important to preserve as such . ”
The court ’s ruling was not an absolute victory for the government .
McKeown rejected the Justice Department ’s argument that “ the very subject matter of the litigation is a state secret . ”

That finding could prove important in numerous other cases in which the government contends that even considering legal challenges to warrantless wiretapping would endanger national security .
In addition , the 9th Circuit panel sent the case back to a lower court to consider another issue : whether the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which requires approval by a special court for domestic surveillance , preempts the state secrets privilege .
McKeown said that issue “ remains central to Al - Haramain ’s ability to proceed with this lawsuit . ”
Georgetown University constitutional law professor David Cole said he thought Friday ’s ruling showed partial victories for both sides .
Indeed , lawyers for the government and for the charity said they were happy with the outcome .

“ The 9th Circuit upheld the government ’s position that release of this information would undermine the government ’s intelligence capabilities and compromise national security , ” the Justice Department said .
Oakland attorney Jon Eisenberg , who argued for Al - Haramain before the 9th Circuit , said : “ The government wants this case dead and gone .
It is not .
We are alive and kicking . ”
Eisenberg expressed optimism that his client would prevail under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , a statute enacted in the aftermath of revelations of illegal spying on civil rights and antiwar activists in the 1960s and ‘ 70s .
“ That provision would be meaningless if the government could evade any such lawsuit merely by evoking the state secrets privilege , ” Eisenberg said .

In support of her opinion , McKeown detailed statements by government officials -- including President Bush , then - Atty .
Gen. Alberto Gonzales and Gen. General Michael V. Hayden , principal deputy director for national intelligence -- acknowledging the existence of the Terrorist Surveillance Program and extolling its importance .
“ In light of extensive government disclosures about the TSP , the government is hard - pressed to sustain its claim that the very subject matter of this litigation is a state secret , ” wrote McKeown , an appointee of President Clinton .
“ Unlike a truly secret or ‘ black box ’ program that remains in the shadows of public knowledge , the government has moved affirmatively to engage in public discourse about the TSP . ”
Nonetheless , after privately reviewing the secret document , McKeown said she and her colleagues Michael Daly Hawkins , another Clinton appointee , and Harry Pregerson , a Carter appointee , agreed it was protected by the state secrets privilege .
“ Detailed statements underscore that disclosure of information concerning the Sealed Document and the means , sources and methods of intelligence gathering in this context of this case would undermine the government ’s intelligence capabilities and compromise national security , ” she said .

The state secrets privilege was first utilized successfully by the government in a case shortly after the Civil War .
The leading case in the area , U.S. vs. Reynolds , was issued by the Supreme Court in 1953 to block a lawsuit after the crash of a B - 29 bomber .
Three widows of crewmen sued and sought the official accident reports .
The Air Force said the reports could not be revealed because the bomber was on a secret test mission .
( When the reports were declassified in 2000 , they revealed that the aircraft was in poor condition , evidence that might have helped the widows ’ suit . )

The Bush administration has evoked the state secrets privilege numerous times in recent years .
In most instances , courts have accepted the word of government lawyers , often with a fairly cursory review , according to George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley , who , like Cole , has challenged the privilege in court .
McKeown took pains to say that the 9th Circuit had carefully scrutinized the government ’s assertions .
She said the judges had taken “ very seriously our obligation to review the documents with a very careful , indeed a skeptical eye , and not to accept at face value the government ’s claim or justification of privilege . ”
But she said the panel could go no further than what already has been publicly disclosed that “ the Sealed Document has something to do with intelligence activities . ”

When the court heard the Al - Haramain case in August , it also entertained arguments in a related case , Hepting vs. AT&T ; Corp .
In that case , lawyers representing millions of AT&T ; customers are seeking damages from the telecommunications giant for allegedly sharing their private records with the National Security Agency as part of the surveillance program .
On Friday , the 9th Circuit panel issued a brief order saying that the AT&T ; case had been severed from the Al - Haramain matter .
A decision is expected in the next several months , although there is no deadline .

Imagine a matching game .
Imagine also that you always get the same outcome .
It might be a happy relationship , a sad relationship , a repeating pattern of dysfunctionality , lots of affairs with librarians , or whatever .
In many models , an unusual similarity of outcomes means that we let partners choose us , rather than choosing partners ourselves more actively .
The other side of the matching process is doing the work .
How can this be ?
The intuition is that " you searching for hidden matches in the rough " is a process that will have higher variance in outcomes than " lots of hidden matches in the rough searching for you . "
If you do n’t observe that much variance in your outcomes ( e.g. , lots of librarians ) , it means one of two things .
Maybe you are choosing the non-varying quality very directly and very intentionally , such as having a fetish .
That possibility aside , maybe it is a sign that you ’re not really choosing but rather being chosen and thus you live in a world of thick search processes and low variance outcomes .
Imagine a man who will take whatever comes his way , and spends lots of time in libraries .
If there are recurring outcomes of this kind in your life or relationships , perhaps you are being chosen , whether you know it or not .
[ WikiEN - l ] The Statistical Decline of the English Wikipedia Community
I 've been taking an extended wiki - break during the last 6 weeks , but during that time I 've also reflected on the state of Wikipedia .
Rather than simply relying on my own observations , I started asking questions and went looking for statistical answers .
As many of you are probably aware , the statistics package hosted at http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm has not been updated in about a year due to the failure of all recent attempts to create a complete database dump for enwiki .
Given the lack of any recent official stats , I set out to generate my own using a dump of the Wikipedia log files and by systematically downloading ( over many days ) the history page contents for 100,000 articles .
My analysis from doing this gave me a big surprise .
Since early this year , and for the first extended period in Wikipedia 's history , the activity rate of the Wikipedia community has been declining .
This can be seen in the rate of editing articles ( - 17 % ) , the rate of new account registration ( - 25 % ) , blocks ( - 30 % ) , protections ( - 30 % ) , uploads ( - 10 % ) , article deletions ( - 25 % ) , etc .
Some exceptions are the article creation rate ( +25 % ) and image deletions ( +80 % ) , but overall the community appears to be doing less now than it was 6 months ago .
Given Wikipedia 's long history of nearly exponential growth , any decline in our editing rate is surprising , but I also find the sharpness of the turn - around to be remarkable .
Though it may merely be coincidence , the timing of the change is near the breaking of the Essjay story in the news .
At the same time the frequency of reverts ( as a fraction of all article edits ) continues to increase , while administrators now devote more than 1/3 of their article space edits to making reverts .
For charts and additional information see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dragons_flight/Log_analysis
I 'm not going to launch into an extended discussion of what 's wrong with Wikipedia , but I do think we need to be paying attention to these trends and taking steps to intervene where possible .

Enough with the gloom and doom over peak oil and climate change you say .
You want an empowering story of change ?
Alright here ’s an example of a personal adjustment I ’ve made in my own life in an attempt to address both the above events because after all , the basic answer to both peak oil and climate change is roughly the same .
Stop using fossil fuels ; or at least cut way back on using them .
But that ’s so hard everyone says .
It ca n’t be done .
Nonsense .
Or as Tom Athanasiou recently said , Change is necessary and because it is necessary it is possible .
I decided 2007 would be the year I got rid of my car .
Not completely , but I ’ve known for some time that driving a car keeps me dependent on the oil economy and pollutes this planet .
I ’ve known I needed to cut back on my automotive oil addiction .
But it was n’t until 2007 that I got serious about making change .
Here are the numbers for the year so far .
At the beginning of the year I was driving 52 miles a day to work in a larger city nearby , and roughly 40 miles on the weekend .
300 miles a week .
15,600 miles a year .
Then I convinced my employer to let me adopt a 4 day work week .
248 miles a week .
12,896 miles a year .
A 17 % reduction .
Then I found a new job closer to home , and convinced my new employer to let me keep my 4 day work week .
120 miles a week .
6,240 miles a year .
A 60 % reduction .
Then I got a bike and started biking to work which further reduced my time in the car .
25 miles a week .
1,300 miles a year .
A total reduction of 91 % a year !
Now in addition to spending considerably less time in a metal box driving over asphalt I getting more exercise , and spending thousands of dollars less per year on auto related expenses , not to mention gas .
I should add that these miles reflect my daily car usage .
I have driven to the beach for vacation and to visit my parents a few towns away on occasion .
I have also taken a train to Washington D.C. for a conference - there is more still to do in changing my habits , but I think a 91 % reduction in daily driving is pretty great .
What made such a change possible ?
My mindset .
I do n’t live in an overly bike friendly town .
I do n’t have professional experience that companies are clamoring for .
I ’m a fairly ordinary guy who just wanted to change .
And I did and you can too .
It is the idea that we ca n’t change that is holding us back .
That is all that stands between us and a reasonable response to peak oil and climate change .
“ i used to fantasize about living in a healthier place , one where i could ride my bike , for example .
then , one day , i started riding my bike .
now , without having fled or escaped to anywhere , i live in a place where i can ride my bike . ”
This of course is partly due to the excellent , and very sound , Python bible of programming style : PEP 8 .
There is also a sensible list of Python coding style guidelines at Python Idioms and Efficiency Suggestions .
Personally I find it slightly painful to read code that deviates too far from these standards , but always bearing in mind that a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little mind .
This was originally posted as a blog entry in April 2006 , just before I lost my amateur status and became a professional software developer .
I recently saw it referred to in a newsgroup posting and revisited it .
After nearly two years my programming style tastes have changed surprisingly little .
Python uses indentation to give you a visual indication of the structure of your code .
Additionally we have an interactive interpreter which provides a default representation for many objects and data structures .
Consistency of style , and using the interpreters representation for objects , will make it easier for you to parse and absorb the meaning of the code .
Python is a beautiful language , so keep your source code beautiful too ...
Four Space Indentation
And definitely no tabs .
Docstrings I prefer docstrings with either of the following two styles : def function_class_or_method ( object ) :
" " " A single line docstring . " " " or def function_class_or_method ( object ) :
" " "
Several lines of docstring .
Preferably using ReST ' markup ' .
" " "
Line Length
Over long lines hurt readability , but so does breaking lines purely because of setting an arbitrary maximum line length .
A limit of 79 characters is a good guideline , but readability should come first .
Longer lines should be wrapped by surrounding expressions in parentheses rather than using \ .
Long strings can be split across several lines using parentheses : ( ' This is an excessively long string . '
' So , what we can do is split it across , '
' several %s. Instead of one long one .
Good hey ?' %
' lines ' )
Note that the single value for string formatting does n't have a trailing comma to turn it into a tuple ( a one - ple ? ) .
They annoy me .
( But they can be necessary if the object you are interpolating is itself a tuple . )
I also prefer single quotes to double quotes , however I prefer double quotes to escaped single quotes .
( We have both quote marks , we might as well use them .
It 's not as if we need to persuade some compiler that the string that follows really is more than one character long . )
Where long expressions go over more than one line , it is helpful to indent lines after the first one .
This shows that they belong to each other .
result = ( question1 ( ) + question2 ( ) + question3 ( ) +
question4 ( ) + question5 ( ) + 27 ) ( Damn - my CSS / font screws up the alignment of the above snippet , you 'll have to work it out ...)
If possible the indented lines should all line up .
For multiline containers the following style is fine though : values = [
value1 ,
value2 ,
value3
]
Line Spacings Functions and methods should be separated with two blank lines .
Class definitions with three blank lines .
Normally variable definitions do n't need a blank line between them , unless they are logically distinct and you want to separate them .
Logical chunks of code within function / method definitions can have a blank line if you want to visually separate them .
With these rules the blank lines provide a visual guide to the structure of the code .
( I often omit the blank lines between the class decoration and __init__ . ) " " " Module docstring . " " "
var1 = ' Some Value '
var2 = " Another value . "
CONST1 = ' Important constant '
CONST2 = ' Another constant '
class ClassName ( object ) :
" " " Class docstring . " " "
class_attribute = 3
def __init__ ( self ) :
" " " Method docstring . " " "
pass
def another_method ( self ) :
" " " Another docstring . " " "
print ' A method . '
x = 3
class AnotherClass ( object ) :
Parentheses Round Expressions
Some expressions can get complicated .
Parentheses can ( and should ) be used to make them less ambiguous .
This is for the sake of people who read the code , even if it does n't matter to the Python parser . if ( test1 and test2 ) or ( test3 or test4 ) :
Object Representations
Where you use lambdas and dictionaries in code , they should use the same style as their repr ( note the lack of spaces before the colons ) : lambda : somefunction ( 3 )
lambda x : function ( x )
dictionary = { ' a ' : 1 , ' b ' : 2 }
Programming Rules
These few rules apply to how you code , rather than just style .
When testing for None , use is .
if obj is None
This is because None is a singleton and the identity test is more efficient than testing for equality .
Where what you really mean is an identity rather than equality test then is can also make your code more clearly convey its intent .
Classes should inherit from object .
If a class has no base classes , then it is better to make it a new style class and inherit from object .
class Something ( object ) :
No mutable objects as default arguments .
Default arguments are created on parsing , not when a function / method is called .
This means you must n't use mutable objects ( like dictionaries or lists ) as default arguments .
Instead you should do : def function ( default = None ) :
if default is None :
default = { }
No bare excepts .
If you really want to catch all exceptions , then use except Exception : , but it is many times better to only trap exceptions that you expect .
Doing otherwise will suppress a multitude of bugs .
If you are writing a module , always define __all__ .
Multiple Statements per Line
Do n't do it !
Python indentation gives you a visual indication of structure ; putting multiple statements per line breaks this .
I find all of the following ugly .
if x : print y
a = f ( x ) ; print a
try : dosomething ( )
except : dosomething_else ( )
Imports A few simple rules : Imports at the top of modules ( or the top of functions if they are local ) .
Never use from xxx import * .
Even for importing a lot of names it is better to be able to see where your names come from .
Tools like pylint and PyFlakes can help warn you about unused imports .
I think it looks nicer to put imports on separate lines .
import xxx should come before from xxx import ... .
Standard library before extension modules .
A single module import per line .
I now prefer this : import os
import sys to this : import os , sys
Not a big deal though .
Where you are importing lots of names , and targeting Python 2.4 or more recent , you can use the following syntax : from namespace import (
name1 , name2 , name3 ,
name4 , name5 , name6
)
Naming Conventions
There are various Python naming conventions I use .
Consistency here is certainly good as it helps to identify what sort of object names point to .
I think the conventions I use basically follow PEP8 .
Module names should be lowercase with underscores instead of spaces .
( And should be valid module names for importing . )
Variable names and function / method names should also be lowercase with underscores to separate words .
Class names should be CamelCase ( uppercase letter to start with , words run together , each starting with an uppercase letter ) .
Module constants should be all uppercase .
E.g .
You would typically have module .
ClassName.method_name .
Module names in CamelCase with a main class name identical to the module name are annoying .
( e.g. ConfigParser .
ConfigParser , which should always be spelt configobj .
ConfigObj .)
Also , variables , functions , methods and classes which are n't part of your public API , should begin with a single underscore .
( using double underscores to make attributes private almost always turns out to be a mistake - especially for testability . )
A federal judge Friday blocked Oregon 's new domestic partnership law for gays and lesbians from taking effect next week , allowing opponents to continue their efforts to try to get voters to overturn the law .
The surprise ruling comes four days before the law would allow gay couples to gain most of the same legal benefits of marriage .
Couples across Oregon were planning to show up at county offices Wednesday to register as partners .
But U.S. District Judge Michael Mosman ruled that they will have to wait .
He set a Feb. 1 hearing to decide a lawsuit challenging the state 's methods for verifying signatures on a November 2008 referendum .
Mosman said attorneys for opponents showed that the rights of voters may have been violated if their signatures were wrongly rejected .
Setting the next hearing in a month reduces the harm to people who would be affected by the new law , he said .
Supporters of the new law were stunned at the judge 's decision .
" It 's unfortunate that families are once again bearing the brunt of this ongoing struggle , " said Jeana Frazzini , executive director of Basic Rights Oregon .
" This is a long term movement for equality in Oregon . ...
In this case , I still believe we will prevail . "
In a survey on its Web site , Basic Rights Oregon counted 526 couples who said they planned to register for domestic partnerships .
Multnomah County was bracing for as many as 200 couples seeking domestic partnerships on Wednesday .
The ruling does not affect another state law going into effect next week that bans discrimination against gay residents in work , housing and public places .
Opponents are a group that opposes gay rights and fought against the law during the Legislature earlier this year , calling it an attempt to thwart the 2004 statewide vote that rejected gay marriage .

Politics " British Twins separated at birth who later married " - I 'm calling BS
The details :
The article : CNN - Unknowing twins marry each other
The details :
Twins , a brother and a sister , were adopted shortly after birth by different parents .
They later accidentally married each other .
They later found out and got a divorce .
David Alton , a member of the House of Lords ( UK parliament ) , told a story as an argument that people who are adopted should be able to later find out who their parents are .
That 's it .
Alton does n't name the people , he does n't name the high court judge involved in their subsequent divorce , he does n't give a timeframe when this happened .
He 's also a politician pushing a pet issue through a lawmaking body of government .
Politicians lie to get laws passed , folks .
Yes shocking I know .
This " news " story is complete crap .
Judging from the article CNN ran , the big media folks think so too .
CNN 's article pins all the details on the UK Press Association .
The CNN article in it 's distilled basic form is : " UK Press Association says stuff . "
The UK Press Association 's information , distilled to basic form , is : " David Alton says stuff . "
Both articles are therefore factually correct , these things were said .
It 's a hedge used often by media companies use to get around taking blame later on for accidentally reporting unsubstantiated facts as news .
You see it fairly often in gossip articles , quoting unnamed sources for juicy celebrity details .
I have yet to see any article about these supposed married twins that did any fact checking to see if there was any truth to this story .
No one bothered .
Why ?
Because it 's sensational .
Brother and Sister Hardcore Action .
It 's a top story on every major international news outlet today .
Whose fault is this ?
Do n't blame the media , blame the audience .
This stuff is red hot as far as clicks and pageviews go .
You can see this on CNN , FoxNews , and any other site that displays Top Stories of the Day based on traffic .
Do n't blame media for serving this stuff up as news , blame the media - consuming public for wanting it to be news .
The chances of adopted twins marrying each other actually happening are damn near impossible .
Two people adopted and separated at birth would have to randomly meet , fall in love , and get married .
They would have to not suspect anything during this courtship , even though they both know they 're adopted , they kind of look like each other , and they have the same birthday .
Their parents would know they both came from the same adoption agency .
To me this would raise all kinds of red flags .
Maybe these two people were that dumb .
Maybe the impossible happened and they met and got married without suspecting anything .
Or maybe , just maybe , David Alton , a politician , made the whole thing up to get legislation passed .
Which do you think is more likely ?

In this years Omnibus bill that funds NASA , there is specific language that prohibits " any research , development or demonstration activities related exclusively to the human exploration of Mars . "
This language , while seemingly benign and innocent , could have a chilling effect on innovation , creativity and science at NASA .
When I worked at Johnson Space Center in the late 1990's , there was a similar ban on all things human Mars related .
Anyone with a small research project or grant now had to hide any Mars connections .
Exciting , innovative , research that young engineers were excited to work on got canceled .
The anti-human Mars exploration language is impractical .
I am perfectly clear that we are not likely to be sending humans to Mars in the next 20 years .
But this is about having basic science and engineering advance and making Mars taboo does not , as John F. Kennedy put it , " serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills . "
What would be possible if the greatest minds of NASA were asked to innovate ?
If our best and brightest were encouraged to swing out and push the boundaries of what is possible ?
It is like Google 's 20 % policy .
Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20 % of their time innovating , creating and working on problems , project , ideas that inspire them .
Why ?
Because when people are working on what inspires them , they can often come up with great ideas and push them harder and further .
So if a young scientist is working on the basic science of biological adaptation to 1/3 Earth 's gravity , or how to deal with the dust problems on Mars that are distinct from the dust challenges of the moon , or the propulsion and aerobraking systems you would need to go to Mars , and they manage to carve out a small grant to do so – let them .
These are such long lead items and such low dollar amounts that it is appropriate to allow young scientists and engineers to work on it .
If we do n't , when humanity does get to the point where we can responsibly mount a mission to the our neighboring planet – we wo n't have the minds needed to do it .

As a step towards designing tomorrow 's super - fast optical communications networks , a Duke University - led research team has demonstrated a way to transfer encoded information from a laser beam to sound waves and then back to light waves again .
Swapping data between media like this would allow information to be captured and retained for very brief intervals .
Data could be stored within pockets of acoustic vibration created when laser beams interact along a short strand of optical fiber , the team reported in the Dec. 14 , 2007 issue of the journal Science .
The Duke experiments address a barrier to efforts at developing computer networks that can run on light instead of electrons .
" The real gist of the work is how to create a memory for optical pulses , " said Duke physics professor Daniel Gauthier , the report 's corresponding author .
Computers in use now manipulate the flow of electrons to shunt the data they carry into memory .
But light has proved to be stubbornly resistant to similar traffic controls .
" We do n't have random access memories for light the way electronic computers do , " Gauthier said .
The new method , suggested by Gauthier 's postdoctoral research associate Zhaoming Zhu , uses a phenomenon called " stimulated Brillouin scattering . "
Opposing laser beams passing though each other along an optical fiber create acoustic vibrations known as phonons within the glass .
" To efficiently create such acoustic waves , you have to have two laser beams of slightly different frequencies interacting with each other , " Gauthier said .

In a series of experiments at Duke , Zhu found that if he encoded information onto one of those laser beams , the data could be imprinted on newly - created phonons .
Such phonon sounds are much too high - pitched for humans to hear , Gauthier said .
Zhu , the Science report 's first author , documented that phonons could retain the data for as long as 12 billionths of a second .
The information could then be successfully re-transferred from sound to light again by shining a third laser beam through the fiber .
" While short by human standards , 12 billionths of a second is long in comparison to the time scales used in optical data transmission , " said coauthor Robert Boyd , a professor of optics and physics at the University of Rochester 's Institute of Optics .
While Zhu conducted the experiments , Gauthier and Boyd examined the findings ' theoretical underpinnings .
The new method works at room temperatures and at wavelengths of light compatible with optical fibers already used in telecommunications , giving it several advantages over competing techniques for manipulating light .
More work will be needed before this approach becomes workable in optical computation , Gauthier acknowledged .
First , the power used for the write and read pulses is about 100 watts , " rather high for any type of telecommunications application , " he said .

" The other issue is that we 're only storing the data for about 10 nanoseconds , " Gauthier added .
" There may be a few applications where such short storage times would be okay .
But , for many applications , you would like to store it for seconds . "
In their report , the authors suggest other kinds of fiber optic materials that might yield better results .
" I 'm hoping that other scientists around the world will come up with new ideas based on our work , " Gauthier said .
" The Duke team will also be pushing the state of the art in this field with our own ideas . "
The work was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 's Defense Sciences Office Slow - Light Program .

United States President George Bush made one of his characteristic pronunciation bungles this morning welcoming business leaders to the " OPEC " meeting instead of the APEC meeting .
But with a dose of Texan charm Mr Bush grinned and said OPEC - which stands for Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries - was a meeting he is due to attend next year .
Later in his speech , Mr Bush recounted how Mr Howard had gone to visit " Austrian troops ' ' last year in Iraq .
There are , in fact , no Austrian troops there .
But Australia has about 1500 military personnel in and around the country .
As the days wind down toward the presidential primaries , the candidates are pulling out all the stops in an effort to capture all those uninspired Iowa and New Hampshire Republican voters .
Huckabee pulled out the not - so - sublimal cross that appeared to ordain him as the candidate .
Then he set out with his gun ( and a press gaggle ) to show how tough he is by gratuitously shooting a bird for the cameras .
Romney is frantically trying to re-position himself to be the candidate that is all things to all conservatives - something he never has been and never will be .
McCain is rightfully pointing out all of Romney 's flaws and helping to solidify Romney 's well - deserved image as a man who will say anything to win .
Yes , the same McCain who sold his own soul to the devil in 2000 .
And last , but certainly not least , we have Rudy .
The NYT notes a sad trend for Rudy ..... his crowds are shrinking .
The small crowd was enthusiastic , but the phone bank sign - up sheets on the walls did not list many volunteers for the lead up to the voting here .
With the news of the millions of dollars that he has accepted from shady clients at his equally shady law investment security firm , and the news that his mistress may have cost NYC taxpayers millions of dollars , things have n't been looking all that great for Rudy lately .
And that can only mean one thing .
It 's time for Rudy to go back to what Rudy does best ---- the tragedy of 9/11 .
He is hammering the theme home with a new campaign spot .
Mr. Giuliani ’s retooled stump speech compares the Sept. 11 generation to the generation that won World War II .
He is running a new television advertisement that shows firefighters atop the smoldering ruins of the World Trade Center site .
And this week , Mr. Giuliani , who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination , seized on the assassination of Benazir Bhutto and the suicide bombing in Pakistan to warn audiences that it " reminds us of the kind of world that we live in . "
I have to say , that is some impressive multi-generational pandering .
The resolve of all Americans during that tragic time was impressive , but I can hardly say that we have sacrificed the way our parents and grandparents did during WWII .
The last time I checked , we were all leading very normal lives .
Unless you believe that having to take your shoes off at the airport is the same as watching your husband / father / brother / son and every other able - bodied male go off to war while you make bullets in a washing machine factory and grow all of your own food just to survive ..... I do n't see how those things are comparable .
I 'm not saying that there are n't plenty of people out there saying their goodbyes to the brave soldiers going off to Iraq and Afghanistan , or that people are n't making important sacrifices .
But , as as whole , we are n't making anything close to the sacrifices that our parents or grandparents did during WWII .
Not content to only remind voters of how awesome he was on 9/11 , Rudy also wanted to explain why the Bhutto assasination is so personal to him :
" For me this is a particularly personal experience , " Mr. Giuliani said in Florida as he discussed the assassination of Ms. Bhutto on Thursday , " because I lived through Sept. 11 , 2001 , and then I lived through the attacks in London a few years later . "
London ?
Did I miss something here ?
Did Rudy fly over to London after the subway bombing and run that city as well ?
Of course not .
But somehow in his world , it 's all about Rudy .
Except for the victims of those horrific attacks , did n't we all live through those events ?
Were n't we all deeply impacted by those events ?
And that image in the campaign ad of those firefighters atop the smoldering rubble of the WTC ?
How dare Rudy include them .
I can't think of a group more opposed to a Rudy Giuliani presidency than the Firefighters and their union .
The video below , which was created by the IAFF , is a stunning indictment of Rudy Giuliani 's leadership - or lack thereof .
I will caution that watching the real 9/11 heroes and their families describe Giuliani 's piss poor management is upsetting and is liable to make you angry .
There you have it .
Straight from the mouths of our brave firefighters .
Rudy Giuliani is the last person they want to see as President .
Let 's help their voices be heard in Iowa , New Hampshire , and beyond .
Not just for this election , but to permanently set the record straight on Rudy's " leadership " before and after 9/11 .
Their courage and the memories of those lost deserve nothing less .
History phooey !
Or , more mildly , Americans traditionally are n't much interested in it and the media largely do n't have time for it either .
For one thing , the past is often just so inconvenient .
On Monday , for instance , there was a front - page piece in the New York Times by Elisabeth Bumiller on Robert Blackwill , one of the " Vulcans " who helped Condoleezza Rice advise George W. Bush on foreign policy during the 2000 election campaign , Iraq Director on the National Security Council during the reign in Baghdad of our viceroy L. Paul Bremer III , and the President 's personal envoy to the faltering occupation ( nicknamed " The Shadow " ) , among many other things .
He is now -- here 's a giant shock -- a lobbyist .
And , among those he 's lobbying for ( in this case to the tune of $ 300,000 ) is Ayad Allawi , former CIA asset and head -- back in Saddam 's day -- of an exile group , the Iraq National Accord .
Bumiller identifies Allawi as " the first prime minister of the newly sovereign nation -- America 's man in Baghdad . "
She also refers to him as having had " close ties to the CIA " and points out that he was not just Bremer 's , but Blackwill 's " choice " to be prime minister back in 2004 .
Now , he 's Blackwill 's " choice " again .
Allawi is , it seems , yet once more on deck , with his own K - Street lobbyist , ready to step in as prime minister if the present PM , Nouri al - Maliki , were to fall ( or be shoved aside ) .
But there 's another rather inconvenient truth about Allawi that goes unmentioned -- and it's right off the front page of the New York Times , no less -- a piece by Joel Brinkley , " Ex- C.I.A .
Aides Say Iraq Leader Helped Agency in 90's Attacks , " published in early June 2004 , just at the moment when Allawi had been " designated " prime minister .
In the early 1990s , Brinkley reported , Allawi 's exile organization was , under the CIA 's direction , planting car bombs and explosive devices in Baghdad ( including in a movie theater ) in a fruitless attempt to destabilize Saddam Hussein 's regime .
Of course , that was back when car bombs were n't considered the property of brutes like Sunni extremists , al - Qaeda in Iraq , and the Taliban .
( Just as , inconveniently enough , back in the 1980s the CIA bankrolled and encouraged the training of Afghan " freedom fighters " in mounting car - bomb and even camel - bomb attacks in a terror campaign against Soviet officers and soldiers in Russian - occupied Afghan cities ( techniques personally " endorsed , " according to Steve Coll in his superb book Ghost Wars , by then - CIA Director William Casey ) .
But that was back in the day -- just as , to randomly cite one more inconvenient piece of history also off the front page of the New York Times ( Patrick Tyler , " Officers Say U.S. Aided Iraq in War Despite Use of Gas , " August 18 , 2002 ) , years before we went into Iraq to take out Saddam 's by then nonexistent weapons of mass destruction , we helped him use them .
The Reagan Pentagon had a program in which 60 officers from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency " were secretly providing detailed information on Iranian deployments " to Saddam 's forces , so that he could , among other things , wield his chemical weapons against them more effectively .
( " The Pentagon ' was n't so horrified by Iraq 's use of gas , ' said one veteran of the program .
' It was just another way of killing people -- whether with a bullet or phosgene , it did n't make any difference . ' " )
Of course , when it comes to America 's oily history in Iraq , there is just about no backstory -- not on the front page of the New York Times , not basically in the mainstream .
Even at this late date , with the price of crude threatening to head for the $ 100 a barrel mark , Iraqi oil is -- well , not exactly censored out -- just ( let 's face it ) so darn embarrassing to write about .
In fact , now that all those other explanations for invading Iraq -- WMD , freedom , you name it -- have long since flown the coop , there really is no explanation ( except utter folly ) for Bush 's invasion .
So , better to move on , and quickly at that .
These last months , however , Tomdispatch has returned repeatedly to the subject as a reminder that history , even when not in sight , matters .
And the deeper you go , as Michael Schwartz proves below , the more likely you are to find that gusher you 're looking for .
Tom
Lately , even Democratic candidates for president have been weighing in on why the U.S. must maintain a long - term , powerful military presence in Iraq .
Hillary Clinton , for example , used phrases like protecting our " vital national security interests " and preventing Iraq from becoming a " petri dish for insurgents , " in a major policy statement .
Barack Obama , in his most important speech on the subject , talked of " maintaining our influence " and allowing " our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda . "
These arguments , like the constantly migrating justifications for invading Iraq , serially articulated by the Bush administration , manage to be vaguely plausible ( with an emphasis on the " vaguely " ) and also strangely inconsistent ( with an emphasis on the " inconsistent " ) .
That these justifications for invading , or remaining , are unsatisfying is hardly surprising , given the reluctance of American politicians to mention the approximately $ 10 - $ 30 trillion of oil lurking just beneath the surface of the Iraq " debate " -- and not much further beneath the surface of Iraqi soil .
Obama , for example , did not mention oil at all in his speech , while Clinton mentioned it twice in passing .
President Bush and his top officials and spokespeople have been just as reticent on the subject .
Why then did the U.S. invade Iraq ?
Why is occupying Iraq so " vital " to those " national security interests " of ours ?
None of this makes sense if you do n't have the patience to drill a little beneath the surface -- and into the past ; if you do n't take into account that , as former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz once put it , Iraq " floats on a sea of oil " ; and if you do n't consider the decades - long U.S. campaign to control , in some fashion , Middle East energy reservoirs .
If not , then you ca n't understand the incredible tenaciousness with which George W. Bush and his top officials have pursued their Iraqi dreams or why -- now that those dreams are clearly so many nightmares -- even the Democrats can't give up the ghost .
The Rise of OPEC
The United States viewed Middle Eastern oil as a precious prize long before the Iraq war .
During World War II , that interest had already sprung to life :
When British officials declared Middle Eastern oil " a vital prize for any power interested in world influence or domination , " American officials agreed , calling it " a stupendous source of strategic power and one of the greatest material prizes in world history . "
This led to a scramble for access during which the United States established itself as the preeminent power of the future .
Crucially , President Franklin Delano Roosevelt successfully negotiated an " oil for protection " agreement with King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia .
That was 1945 .
From then on , the U.S. found itself actively ( if often secretly ) engaged in the region .
American agents were deeply involved in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government in 1953 ( to reverse the nationalization of Iran 's oil fields ) , as well as in the fateful establishment of a Baathist Party dictatorship in Iraq in the early 1960s ( to prevent the ascendancy of leftists who , it was feared , would align the country with the Soviet Union , putting the country 's oil in hock to the Soviet bloc ) .
U.S. influence in the Middle East began to wane in the 1970s , when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) was first formed to coordinate the production and pricing of oil on a worldwide basis .
OPEC 's power was consolidated as various countries created their own oil companies , nationalized their oil holdings , and wrested decision - making away from the " Seven Sisters , " the Western oil giants -- among them Shell , Texaco , and Standard Oil of New Jersey -- that had previously dominated exploration , extraction , and sales of black gold .
With all the key oil exporters on board , OPEC began deciding just how much oil would be extracted and sold onto international markets .
Once the group established that all members would follow collective decisions -- because even a single major dissenter might fatally undermine the ability to turn the energy " spigot " on or off -- it could use the threat of production restrictions , or the promise of expansion , to bargain with its most powerful trading partners .
In effect , a new power bloc had emerged on the international scene that could -- in some circumstances -- exact tangible concessions even from the United States and the Soviet Union , the two superpowers of the time .
Though the United States was largely self - sufficient in oil when OPEC was first formed , the American economy was still dependent on trading partners , particularly Japan and Europe , which themselves were dependent on Middle Eastern oil .
The oil crises of the early 1970s , including the sometimes endless gas lines in the U.S. , demonstrated OPEC 's potential .
It was in this context that the American alliance with the Saudi royal family first became so crucial .
With the largest petroleum reserves on the planet and the largest production capacity among OPEC members , Saudi Arabia was usually able to shape the cartel 's policies to conform to its wishes .
In response to this simple but essential fact , successive American presidents strengthened the Rooseveltian alliance , deepening economic and military relationships between the two countries .
The Saudis , in turn , could normally be depended upon to use their leverage within OPEC to fit the group 's actions into the broader aims of U.S. policy .
In other words , Washington gained favorable OPEC policies mainly by arming , and propping up a Saudi regime that was chronically fragile .
Backed by a tiny elite that used immense oil revenues to service its own narrow interests , the Saudi royals subjected their impoverished population to an oppressively authoritarian regime .
Not surprisingly , then , the " alliance " required increasing infusions of American military aid as well political support in situations that were often uncomfortable , sometimes untenable , for Washington .
On its part , in an era of growing nationalism , the Saudis found overt pro-American policies difficult to sustain , given the pressures and proclivities of its OPEC partners and its own population .
The Neocons Seize the Unipolar Moment
The key year in the Middle East would be 1979 , when Iranians , who had lost their government to an American and British inspired coup in 1953 , poured into the streets .
The American - backed Shah 's brutal regime fell to a popular revolution ; American diplomats were taken hostage by Iranian student demonstrators ; and Ayatollah Khomeini and the mullahs took power .
The Iranian revolution added a combustible new element to an already complex and unstable equation .
It was , in a sense , the match lit near the pipeline .
A regime hostile to Washington , and not particularly amenable to Saudi pressure , had now become an active member of OPEC , aspiring to use the organization to challenge American economic hegemony .
It was at this moment , not surprisingly , that the militarization of American Middle Eastern policy came out of the shadows .
In 1980 , President Jimmy Carter -- before his Habitat for Humanity days -- enunciated what would become known as the " Carter Doctrine " : that Persian Gulf oil was " vital " to American national interests and that the U.S. would use " any means necessary , including military force " to sustain access to it .
To assure that " access , " he announced the creation of a Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force , a new military command structure that would be able to deliver personnel from all the armed services , together with state - of - the - art military equipment , to any location in the Middle East at top speed .
Nurtured and expanded by succeeding presidents , this evolved into the United States Central Command ( Centcom ) , which ended up in charge of all U.S. military activity in the Middle East and surrounding regions .
It would prove the military foundation for the Gulf War of 1990 , which rolled back Saddam Hussein 's occupation of Kuwait , and therefore prevented him from gaining control of that country 's oil reserves .
Though it was not emphasized at the time , that first Gulf War was a crystalline application of the Carter Doctrine -- that " any means necessary , including military force , " should be used to guarantee American access to Middle Eastern oil .
That war , in turn , convinced a shaky Saudi royal family -- that saw Iraqi troops reach its border -- to accept an ongoing American military presence within the country , a development meant to facilitate future applications of the Carter Doctrine , but which would have devastating unintended consequences .
The peaceful disintegration of the Soviet Union at almost the same moment seemed to signal that Washington now had uncontested global military supremacy , triggering a debate within American policy circles about how to utilize and preserve what Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer first called the " unipolar moment . "
Future members of the administration of Bush the younger were especially fierce advocates for making aggressive use of this military superiority to enhance U.S. power everywhere , but especially in the Middle East .
They eventually formed a policy advocacy group , The Project for a New American Century , to develop , and lobby for , their views .
The group , whose membership included Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz and dozens of other key individuals who would hold important positions in the executive branch after George W. Bush took office , wrote an open letter to President Clinton in 1998 urging him to turn his " administration 's attention to implementing a strategy for removing Saddam 's regime from power . "
They cited both the Iraqi dictator 's military belligerence and his control over " a significant portion of the world 's supply of oil . "
Two years later , the group issued a ringing policy statement that would be the guiding text for the new administration .
Entitled Rebuilding America 's Defenses , it advocated what would become known as a Rumsfeldian - style transformation of the Pentagon .
U.S. military preeminence was to be utilized to " secure and expand ' '
American influence globally and possibly , in the cases of North Korea and Iraq , used " to remove these regimes from power and conduct post - combat stability operations . "
( The document even commented on the problem of defusing American domestic resistance to such an aggressive stance , noting ominously that public approval could not be obtained without " some catastrophic and catalyzing event -- like a new Pearl Harbor . " )
Saddam 's Iraq and Oil on the Brain
The second Bush administration ascended to the presidency just as American influence in the Middle East looked to be on the decline .
Despite victory in the first Gulf War and the fall of the Soviet Union , American influence over OPEC and oil policies seemed under threat .
That sucking sound everyone suddenly heard was a tremendous increase in the global demand for oil .
With fears rising that , in the very near future , such demand could put a strain on OPEC 's resources , member states began negotiating ever more vigorously for a range of concessions and expanded political power in exchange for expanded energy production .
By this time , of course , the United States had joined the ranks of the energy deficient and dependent , as imported oil surged past the 50 % mark .
In the meantime , key ally Saudi Arabia was further weakened by the rise of al - Qaeda , which took as its main goal the overthrow of the royal family , and its key target -- think of those unintended consequences -- the American troops triumphantly stationed at permanent bases in the country after Gulf War I .
They seemed to confirm the accusations of Osama bin Laden and other Saudi dissidents that the royal family had indeed become little but a tool of American imperialism .
This , in turn , made the Saudi royals increasingly reluctant hosts for those troops and ever more hesitant supporters of pro-American policies within OPEC .
The situation was complicated further by what was obvious to any observer :
The potential future leverage that both Iraq and Iran might wield in OPEC .
With the second and third largest oil reserves on the planet -- Iran also had the second largest reserves of natural gas -- their influence seemed bound to rise .
Iraq 's , in particular , would be amplified substantially as soon as Saddam Hussein 's regime was freed from severe limitations imposed by post - war UN sanctions , which prevented it from either developing new oil fields or upgrading its deteriorating energy infrastructure .
Though the leaders of the two countries were enemies , having fought a bitter war in the 1980s , they could agree , at least , on energy policies aimed at thwarting American desires or demands -- a position only strengthened in 1998 when the citizens of Venezuela , the most important OPEC member outside the Middle East , elected the decidedly anti-American Hugo Chavez as president .
In other words , in January 2001 , the new administration in Washington could look forward to negotiating oil policy not only with a reluctant Saudi royal family , but also a coterie of hostile powers in a strengthened OPEC .
It is hardly surprising , then , that the new administration , bent on unipolarity anyway and dreaming of a global Pax Americana , wasted no time implementing the aggressive policies advocated in the PNAC manifesto .
According to then Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill in his memoir The Price of Loyalty , Iraq was much on the mind of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld at the first meeting of the National Security Council on January 30 , 2001 , seven months before the 9/11 attacks .
At that meeting , Rumsfeld argued that the Clinton administration 's Middle Eastern focus on Israel - Palestine should be unceremoniously dumped .
" [ W ] hat we really want to think about , " he reportedly said , " is going after Saddam . "
Regime change in Iraq , he argued , would allow the U.S. to enhance the situation of the pro-American Kurds , redirect Iraq toward a market economy , and guarantee a favorable oil policy .
The adjudication of Rumsfeld 's recommendation was shuffled off to the mysterious National Energy Policy Development Group that Vice President Cheney convened as soon as Bush took occupancy of the Oval Office .
This task force quickly decided that enhanced American influence over the production and sale of Middle East oil should be " a primary focus of U.S. international energy policy , " relegating both the development of alternative energy sources and domestic energy conservation measures to secondary , or even tertiary , status .
A central goal of the administration 's Middle East focus would be to convince , or coerce , states in that region " to open up areas of their energy sectors to foreign investment " ; that is , to replace government control of the oil spigot -- the linchpin of OPEC power -- with decision - making by multinational oil companies headquartered in the West and responsive to U.S. policy needs .
If such a program could be extended even to a substantial minority of Middle Eastern oil fields , it would prevent coordinated decision - making and constrain , if not break , the power of OPEC .
This was a theoretically enticing way to staunch the loss of American power in the region and truly turn the Bush years into a new unipolar moment in the Middle East .
Having determined its goals , the Task Force began laying out a more detailed strategy .
According to Jane Mayer of the New Yorker , the most significant innovation was to be a close collaboration between Cheney 's energy crew and the National Security Council ( NSC ) .
The NSC evidently agreed " to cooperate fully with the Energy Task Force as it considered the ' melding ' of two seemingly unrelated areas of policy : ' the review of operational policies towards rogue states , ' such as Iraq , and 'actions regarding the capture of new and existing oil and gas fields . ' "
Though all these deliberations were secret , enough of what was going on has emerged in these last years to demonstrate that the " melding " process was successful .
By March of 2001 , according to O'Neill , who was a member of both the NSC and the task force :
O'Neill also reported that , by the time of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , the plan for conquering Iraq had been developed and that Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld indeed urged just such an attack at the first National Security Council meeting convened to discuss how the U.S. should react to the disaster .
After several days of discussion , an attack on Iraq was postponed until after al - Qaeda had been wiped out and the Taliban driven from power in Afghanistan .
It took only until January 2002 -- three months of largely successful fighting in Afghanistan -- before the " administration focus was returning to Iraq . "
It was n't until November 2002 , though , that O'Neill heard the President himself endorse the invasion plans , which took place the following March 20th .
The Logic of Regime Change
With this background , it 's easier to understand the recent brief , but highly significant , flurry of controversy over a single sentence in The Age of Turbulence , the bestselling , over - 500 - page memoir by longtime Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan .
He wrote simply , as if this were utterly self - evident : " I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows : the Iraq war is largely about oil . "
As the first major government official to make such a statement , he was asked repeatedly to explain his thinking , particularly since his comment was immediately repudiated by various government officials , including White House spokesman Tony Fratto , who labeled it " Georgetown cocktail party analysis . "
His subsequent comments elaborated on a brief explanation in the memoir : " It should be obvious that as long as the United States is beholden to potentially unfriendly sources of oil and gas , we are vulnerable to economic crises over which we have little control . "
Since former ally Saddam Hussein was , by then , unremittingly unfriendly , Greenspan felt that ( as he told Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward ) " taking Saddam out was essential " in order to make " certain that the existing system [ of oil markets ] continues to work . "
In an interview at Democracy Now !
he elaborated on this point , explaining that his support for ousting Hussein had " nothing to do with the weapons of mass destruction , " but rather with the economic " threat he could create to the rest of the world " through his control over key oil reserves in the Persian Gulf region .
Greenspan 's argument echoes the logic expressed by the Project for a New American Century and other advocates of aggressive military solutions to the threat of OPEC power .
He was concerned that Saddam Hussein , once an ally , but by then a sworn enemy of U.S. interests in the Middle East , would control key oil flows .
That , in turn , might allow him to exercise economic , and so political , leverage over the United States and its allies .
The former Fed chief then elaborated further , arguing that the threat of Saddam could be eliminated " by one means or another " -- either by " getting him out of office or getting him out of the control position he was in . "
Replacing Saddam with a friendly , pro-American government seemed , of course , like such a no - brainer .
Why have a guy like that in a " control position " over oil , after all ?
( And think of the possibility of taking those embarrassing troops out of Saudi Arabia and stationing them at large permanent bases in nearby , well - situated , oil - rich Iraq . )
Better by far , as the Cheney Energy Task put it , " to open up areas of [ Iraq 's ] energy sectors to foreign investment . "
Like the Task Force members , Greenspan believed that removing oil -- not just from Saddam 's control , but from the control of any Iraqi government -- would permanently remove the threat that it or a broken OPEC could continue to wield economic leverage over the United States .
Revealingly enough , Greenspan saw the invasion of Iraq as a generically conservative action -- a return , if anything , to the status quo ante that would preserve unencumbered American access to sufficient Middle Eastern oil .
With whole new energy - devouring economies coming on line in Asia , continued American access seemed to require stripping key Middle Eastern nations of the economic and political power that scarcity had already begun to confer .
In other words , Greenspan 's conservative urge implied exactly the revolutionary changes in the political and economic equation that the Bush administration would begin to test out so disastrously in Iraq in March 2003 .
It 's also worth remembering that Iraq was only considered a first pit stop , an easy mark for invasion and occupation .
PNAC - nurtured eyes were already turning to Iran by then as indicated by the classic prewar neocon quip , " Everyone wants to go to Baghdad .
Real men want to go to Tehran . "
And beyond this set of radical changes in the Middle East lay another set for the rest of the world .
In the twenty - first century , expanding energy demand will , sooner or later ( probably sooner ) , outdistance production .
The goal of unfettered American access to sufficient Middle Eastern oil would , if achieved and sustained , deprive other countries of sufficient oil , or require them to satisfy U.S. demands in order to access it .
In other words , Greenspan 's conservative effort to preserve American access implied a dramatic increase in American leverage over all countries that depended on oil for their economic welfare ; that is , a radical transformation of the global balance of power .
Notice that these ambitions , and the actions taken to implement them , rested on a vision of an imperial America that should , could , and would play a uniquely dominant , problem - solving role in world affairs .
All other countries would , of course , continue to be " vulnerable to economic crises " over which they would have " little control . "
Only the United States had the essential right to threaten , or simply apply , overwhelming military power to the " problem " of energy ; only it had the right to subdue any country that attempted to create -- or exploit -- an energy crisis , or that simply had the potential and animus to do so .
None of this was lost on the unipolar - minded officials who made the decision to invade Iraq -- and were more ready than any previous administration to spell out , shock - and - awe style , a new stronger version of the Carter Doctrine for the planet .
According to Treasury Secretary O'Neill , Rumsfeld offered a vision of the grandiosity of these goals at the first Bush administration National Security Council meeting :
An even more grandiose vision was offered to the New York Times by presidential speech writer David Frum a few days later :
As worldwide demand for hydrocarbons soared , the United States was left with three policy choices :
It could try to combine alternative energy sources with rigorous conservation to reduce or eliminate a significant portion of energy imports ; it could accept the leverage conferred on OPEC by the energy crunch and attempt to negotiate for an adequate share of what might soon enough become an inadequate supply ; or it could use its military power in an effort to coerce Middle East suppliers into satisfying American requirements at the expense of everyone else .
Beginning with Jimmy Carter , five U.S. presidents chose the coercive strategy , with George W. Bush finally deciding that violent , preemptive regime change was needed to make it work .
The other options remain unexplored .

Harry Potter and the Order of Typography
18 Nov 2007
After seeing Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix my lasting impression of the film was the gorgeous attention to detail to type style .
From Daily Prophets to Weasly products , the loving care with which typefaces where chosen or drawn is to be praised .
Rather than fall back on clichéd serif faces , chunky , slightly distressed , sans - serifs and slab serifs are used to give the film a unique feel .
So when the DVD finally arrived last week , I could n’t wait to take some screengrabs :
( If the slideshow does n’t appear , you view the Original set on Flickr )

We all know that internet chatters use their own slang , and we have a dictionary to help translate that ; but another trend among web users is not using the correct version of words .
Because of the net and text messaging , many teens simply do n't know the difference between words that sound the same , or which version of a homonym to use ( let alone how to spell homonym .. it 's not hominym ) .

Trackbacks Filtering For Copyrighted Content and Liability Under the Wiretap Act :
At a small panel discussion about digital piracy here at NBC 's booth on the Consumer Electronics Show floor , representatives from NBC , Microsoft , several digital filtering companies and telecom giant AT&T said the time was right to start filtering for copyrighted content at the network level .
Such filtering for pirated material already occurs on sites like YouTube and Microsoft 's Soapbox , and on some university networks .
Network - level filtering means your Internet service provider -- Comcast , AT&T , EarthLink , or whoever you send that monthly check to -- could soon start sniffing your digital packets , looking for material that infringes on someone 's copyright .
" What we are already doing to address piracy has n't been working .
There 's no secret there , " said James Cicconi , senior vice president , external & legal affairs for AT&T .
Mr. Cicconi said that AT&T has been talking to technology companies , and members of the MPAA and RIAA , for the last six months about implementing digital fingerprinting techniques on the network level .
" We are very interested in a technology based solution and we think a network - based solution is the optimal way to approach this , " he said .
" We recognize we are not there yet but there are a lot of promising technologies .
But we are having an open discussion with a number of content companies , including NBC Universal , to try to explore various technologies that are out there . "
I hope that " open discussion " includes a frank discussion of legal liability under the federal Wiretap Act .
The Wiretap
Act makes it a federal crime and a civil wrong permitting the recovery of
To avoid liability , these providers probably would need to amend their Terms of Service so that users would explicitly consent to allowing their ISPs to monitor them for copyright violations .
Assuming customers did n't revolt against this , that would permit monitoring under the consent exception , at least when a user who actually signed the contract was being monitored .
But even the explicit okay in the Terms of Service would n't allow all monitoring .
The consent would only cover those who signed the contract and the parties to communications with them , and would not automatically extend to those who used the network but had not consented ( such as family members of those who agreed to the ISP contract ) .
And of course the ISPs would n't know who was being the keyboard , so they would never know if the monitoring was lawful .
I suppose ISPs could then argue that the monitoring was not an " intentional " intercept , as required by the statute , 18 U.S.C. 2511 .
But that raises a difficult question of how the mens rea requirements of liability interact with the consent exception — in particular , whether an intentional interception that is not intentional as to the lack of consent counts as intentional .
I do n't know of any cases on this , but off the top of my head it seems like a 50/50 issue .
And then there 's the issue of liability under state wiretap laws that go beyond the federal wiretap act , and especially those that require all party consent to monitoring .
Would ISPs risk massive liability under the Wiretap Act to try to combat copyright infringement ?
I can't imagine why they would do that , but I suppose that 's a question to ask them and their lawyers .
Thanks to The New York Times " Bits " Blog reports : I hope that " open discussion " includes a frank discussion of legal liability under the federal Wiretap Act .
The Wiretap
Act makes it a federal crime and a civil wrong permitting the recovery of punitive damages and attorney 's fees for intercepting the contents of a person 's communications over an interstate communications network .
Although there are no cases directly on this , network - level scanning of traffic for copyrighted content is likely to be deemed an " intercept " of the contents of communications .
And while there are exceptions for interceptions by parties to communications ( 18 U.S.C. 2511 ( 2 ) ( d ) ) and for monitoring narrowly tailored to protect the network provider ( 18 U.S.C. 2511 ( 2 ) ( a ) ( i ) ) , it 's hard to see how those exceptions would apply to network - level monitoring for copyrighted information .
To avoid liability , these providers probably would need to amend their Terms of Service so that users would explicitly consent to allowing their ISPs to monitor them for copyright violations .

Researchers investigating the role of cannabinoids - chemical substances contained within cannabis – in the treatment of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , have found they could significantly enhance therapy , not only by reducing nerve damage and erratic nerve impulses , but perhaps even by hindering development of the condition .
The findings , published online today ( 1 April , 2007 ) in Nature Medicine demonstrates for the first time how cannabis might actually slow down the progression of MS and could have major implications for the estimated 2.5 million sufferers worldwide .
Using a mouse model , a team of UK , European , Japanese and US scientists , led by David Baker , Professor of Neuroimmunology at Queen Mary , University of London , found that doses of the active component within cannabis , tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) could significantly inhibit the development and severity of MS .
Cannabis works because it stimulates molecules known as cannabinoid receptors within the body .
The group had previously reported that THC could alleviate disease symptoms , and also save nerves from the damaging effects of the disease - thus potentially , via the cannabinoid receptor CB1 , slowing down the development of progressive disability .
They had not previously examined the influence of cannabinoids on immune aspects of the disease .
Now their most recent study has successfully separated the roles of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 on neurons and T cells , and investigated their effect in controlling central nervous system autoimmunity .
It showed that CB1 receptor expression by nerves in the brain , but not T cells , could suppress the development of an experimental MS - like disease , by stimulating the release of anti-inflammatory molecules , whilst in contrast direct stimulation of CB2 receptors by T cells was also able to control inflammation associated with the condition .
This suggests that cannabis - like drugs may have the potential to block the autoimmune response which drives disease development .
Professor David Baker said : “ Whilst targeting CB1 receptors for therapy runs the risk of causing the unwanted “ high ” to achieve these effects , we can get the same result by targeting CB2 receptors , which avoids these risks .
Therefore , we can start to think about using new drugs that harness the potential medical benefits that cannabis has to offer but move away from the issues over the legality and recreational use of the plant product ” .

Rosslyn Chapel was built in the 15th Century
Stuart Mitchell , 41 and his father Tommy , 75 , said they had deciphered a musical code locked in the stones of Rosslyn Chapel for more than 500 years .
They will perform the music in May at a concert in the 15th Century chapel .
Visitor numbers to the chapel have increased rapidly since it featured in Dan Brown 's novel The Da Vinci Code .
Stuart Mitchell discovered a series of figures which he calls an " orchestra of angels " at the base of elaborate arches round the altar , with each angel holding a musical instrument .
He worked with his father to decipher the patterns on cubes which jut out from the arches .
Over the years this became more of an obsession than anything else and we decided we had to find out what was going on
Tommy Mitchell
Tommy Mitchell said the markings concealed a tune which they were determined to crack .
He said : " We were convinced from the position at the top of the pillars of the angels and they are all directly under the arches where the cubes occur that there was music there .
" We got clues from other books as well .
Over the years this became more of an obsession than anything else and we decided we had to find out what was going on . "
" If these patterns and cubes had not contained music anything we turned up would have been purely random and would not have sounded hauntily beautiful . "
Stuart Mitchell said the tunes could have been hidden because knowledge of harmonics may have been seen as dangerous , even heretical , by 15th Century church authorities .
He said : " What we have here is a recorded piece of music , it is almost like a compact disc from the 15th Century . "
Your comments
Music , like mathematics , is based on patterns .
Mr and Master Mitchell are free to translate patterns into music , though the harmonious proportions they have found in the architecture of Rosslyn Chapel are no more significant than those found in a ' 50s high rise .
Perhaps the magnificent symmetries of the Forth Bridge will provide the inspiration for their next opus .
Jim , London
Yes I think this is very possible with the use of cymatics which shows the shapes created by notes of sound .
Whether the code was hidden there intentionally I 'm not sure , it will depend on how the piece of music comes out .
Hannah Ireland , Shoreham - by - Sea , West Sussex
It will be very interesting to see how the code has been translated into the exact musical notes , and what decisions have been made about musical scale and modality .
The snippet of the motet sound clip suggests melodic and harmonic characteristics of a later period .

WASHINGTON ( Hollywood Reporter ) - A bipartisan group of lawmakers including a Democratic presidential hopeful is calling on the makers of video games to review the industry ’s ratings system .
In letter to the Entertainment Software Rating Board , the lawmakers complained about its decision to give an “ mature ” rating Rockstar ’s “ Manhunt 2 ” game .
Sens. Joe Lieberman , I - Conn. , Sam Brownback , R - Kan. , Evan Bayh , D - Ind. , and Hillary Rodham Clinton , D - N.Y. , said the game ’s violent content , which includes “ many graphic torture scenes and murders , ” should have garnered an “ adults only ” rating .
Clinton , the front - runner for the Democratic nomination for president , has long pressed for tougher ratings and has called for a unified ratings system for movies , games and TV shows .
“ We ask your consideration of whether it is time to review the robustness , reliability and repeatability of your ratings process , particularly for this genre of ‘ ultraviolent ’ video games and the advances in game controllers , ” the senators wrote .
“ We have consistently urged parents to pay attention to the ESRB rating system .
We must ensure that parents can rely on the consistency and accuracy of those ratings . ”
Rockstar also makes the controversial “ Grand Theft Auto ” series of games .

Cafferty File viewers : Let 's start another revolution Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday October 26 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This CNN commentator Jack Cafferty speculated on Wednesday about how George W. Bush 's unilateral grab for presidential power might be reversed .
" The president of the United States did n't have the power to spy on Americans ... operate secret prisons ... suspend due process ... torture ... hide the conduct of the government from the public , " Cafferty stated .
" It 's not like anybody gave President Bush any of these powers -- he took them , as a brain - dead Congress just stood there and watched . "
Cafferty pointed out that Hillary Clinton has said she would relinquish some of those powers if elected -- but without saying which ones .
" What powers should the next president be willing to surrender ? "
Cafferty asked his audience .
In the follow - up segment , Cafferty read a selection of emails from clearly outraged -- and outspoken -- viewers .
" Remember the 60's ? " wrote one Baby Boomer .
" Well , they 're back .
Only this time it 's not a decade .
It 's the age on our driver 's licenses .
Let 's start another revolution .
...
It 's time to overthrow the government . "
Another viewer stated more cynically , " King Bush .
Queen Hillary .
America is now a democratic dictatorship , nobody is going to change that .
Power is everything ; get used to it . "
And a third suggested .
" George Bush is the next president .
He and Darth Cheney will be surrendering none of their bounty .
Forty years of planning to hand it all to Hillary Clinton ?
Not a chance .
If you think there 'll be a November 8 election , give my regards to the Easter Bunny . "
The following video is from CNN's Cafferty File Jack Cafferty , broadcast on October 24 , 2007 Correction : A headline on Raw Story 's front page suggested Cafferty told viewers to overthrow Bush .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
More than one million Iraqis have died as a result of the conflict in their country since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 , according to research conducted by one of Britain ’s leading polling groups .

The survey , conducted by Opinion Research Business ( ORB ) with 2,414 adults in face - to - face interviews , found that 20 percent of people had had at least one death in their household as a result of the conflict , rather than natural causes .
The last complete census in Iraq conducted in 1997 found 4.05 million households in the country , a figure ORB used to calculate that approximately 1.03 million people had died as a result of the war , the researchers found .
The margin of error in the survey , conducted in August and September 2007 , was 1.7 percent , giving a range of deaths of 946,258 to 1.12 million .
ORB originally found that 1.2 million people had died , but decided to go back and conduct more research in rural areas to make the survey as comprehensive as possible and then came up with the revised figure .
The research covered 15 of Iraq ’s 18 provinces .
Those that not covered included two of Iraq ’s more volatile regions -- Kerbala and Anbar -- and the northern province of Arbil , where local authorities refused them a permit to work .
Estimates of deaths in Iraq have been highly controversial in the past .
Medical journal
The Lancet published a peer - reviewed report in 2004 stating that there had been 100,000 more deaths than would normally be expected since the March 2003 invasion , kicking off a storm of protest .
The widely watched Web site Iraq Body Count currently estimates that between 80,699 and 88,126 people have died in the conflict , although its methodology and figures have also been questioned by U.S. authorities and others .
ORB , a non-government - funded group founded in 1994 , conducts research for the private , public and voluntary sectors .
The director of the group , Allan Hyde , said it had no objective other than to record as accurately as possible the number of deaths among the Iraqi population as a result of the invasion and ensuing conflict .
I spent 5 - 15 January visiting U Penn and attending PADL , POPL , and Plan - X in Charleston , SC .
At U Penn I served on the thesis committee for Vladimir Gapayev , a student of Benjamin Pierce , on the design and implementation of Xtatic , an extension of C# to support XML processing in the style of Xduce .
This is one of the few doctoral examinations I have been involved with where the committee agreed to tick off the very first box on the form : absolutely no substantial revisions required .
Well done , Vladimir !
I also had many interesting discussions , notably with Benjami , Geoffrey Washburn , and Steve Zdancewic , and a great dinner at Django .
At PADL I delivered an invited talk on Links .
The audience had scores of useful suggestions afterward ; notably Zoltan Somogyi and Manuel Hermengildo suggested I look at updatable predicates in the logic programming community as an approach to integrating database update with a declarative language .
My favorite presentations included Steve Kollmansberger on Modeling Genome Evolution with a DSEL for Probabilistic Programming , Kris De Volder on A Generic Code Browser with a Declarative Configuration Language , Zoltan Somogyi on several new twists in the implementation of Mercury , and Erik Meijer 's invited talk on LINQ .
Then it was on to POPL .
Tim Sweeney , founder of Epic Games , gave a fascinating talk on " The next mainstream programming language : a game developer 's perspective " .
Matthias Felleisen categorized it as " an advertisement for Haskell " .
This talk reiterated a point I head John Hennessy make when he picked up an honorary degree at Edinburgh : the advent of multicore hardware has made concurrency ( and hence functional programming ) immensely more important .
Sweeney noted that most of the processing in a game is rendering , which can be viewed as purely functional .
But there are also about 10,000 objects interacting , which are best treated imperatively .
What I found most surprising is that communicating processes ( as in , say , Erlang ) would not work well for objects in a game : one needs transactions to ensure that when one character transfers hit points or momentum to another that nothing is lost ( just as one needs transactions to ensure that when one bank account transfers money to another that nothing is lost ) .
My other favorite talks were Yitzhak Mandelbaum ( with Kathleen Fisher and David Walker ) on The Next 700 Data Description Languages ; Nils Anders Danielsson ( with Jeremy Gibbons , John Hughes , and Patrik Jansson ) on why Fast and Loose Reasoning is Morally Correct ; and Cormac Flanagan on Hybrid Typechecking .
Erik
Meijer posed me the problem of how to integrate groupBy neatly into a list comprehension .
I think I found a neat answer based on " Theorems for Free " .
Watch this space !
Charleston is a lovely city , and I did not see enough of it .
It has some fine restaurants : Fig is very good , and Cordavi is superb .
Finally , there was Plan - X .
My favorite talk was Alain Frisch on " Ocaml + Xduce " , a clever way to integrate Xduce typing into the Ocaml compiler with minimal changes .
Other favorites were Mary Fernandez ( with Kathleen Fisher , Robert Gruber and Yitzhak Mandelbaum ) on PADX ( a follow up to the " Next 700 " paper ) amd Vladimir Gapeyev , François Garillot and Benjamin Pierce on " An Xtatic Experience " , a practical example based on Michael Kay 's XMLSpec example program for XSLT .
This paper covers some of the most interesting results in Vladimir 's thesis , taking this entry full circle !
George Bush has been likely caught in another lie , another cover up , and another scandal .
One that may debunk his entire justifications for violating FISA , or worse yet , show that the 9/11 attacks were not prevented due to gross incompetence !
Bush simply can't have it both ways .
Impeachment , not immunity , or blank war checks without aggressive congressional checks and balances , is more warranted than ever now .
As first reported on Daily Kos , and summarized by Bob Fertik on Democrats.com , the Bush administration has been pursuing dragnet data mining operations well in advance of September 11 , 2001 .
Of course , once again , Bush has been mendacious and totally erroneous about when the illegal warrantless wiretapping began and for what purpose .
Quoting Mr. Fertik ,
â€ œThis week Joseph Nacchio , the former CEO of Qwest , revealed the Bush Administration started muscling telephone companies to wiretap American citizens without a warrant on Feb. 27 , 2001 .
When Qwest refused , they were cut out of government contracts and Nacchio was prosecuted for insider trading .
So we now know Bush began violating FISA and the 4th Amendment just 1 month after stealing the White House .
And since the 9/11 attack was 7 months later , Bush has lied about 9/11 being the justification for warrantless wiretapping for the past two years.â€ 
Therefore , Bush either lied about the programâ€™s intended purpose or the program failed to prevent the 9/11 attacks !
At this point , Joseph Nacchioâ€™s revelation strongly suggests that the Bush administration was grossly incompetent on September 11 , 2001 , which negates any and all claims that the warrantless wiretapping has , or continues to , prevent any terrorists attacks at all .
Otherwise , it has been involved in a Watergate - like abuse of power , for nefarious reasons , over the past six - plus years .
Impeachment , not future elections , is the only way to halt this runaway exploitation of claimed plenary power by President Bush .

About author Frank J. Ranelli is an independent scholar , skeptic and critic , author and essayist .
Vali Nasr offers a troubling analogy :
The longer Musharraf stays in power the more Pakistan will look like Iran in 1979 : an isolated and unpopular ruler hanging on to power only to inflame passions and bring together his Islamic and pro-democracy opposition into a dangerous alliance .
I keep veering between a sense that since this Pakistan business is one of the most important things going on right now I should write about it , and a sense that there 's no reason for me to play fake Pakistan expert .
On the other hand , I do think this kind of talk from Nasr throws into sharp relief the nonsensical nature of the Bush administration 's democracy - talk .
If you want to create a reasonable interpretation of the " lack of democracy causes terrorism " theory then the one Nasr 's bringing up here seems like by far the best candidate .
You have your American - backed dictatorship , you have your popular anger at the dictatorship , and you have some of that anger being displaced onto the United States .
Something like that certainly seems to have happened in Iran in the 1970s and it's a plausible account of at least some of what 's going on in places like Pakistan , Egypt , and Saudi Arabia today .
But even if you want to credit the Bush administration with a great deal of sincere belief in the desirability of spreading the blessings of democracy to Iraq , nothing they did ever addressed that dictatorship problem .
Instead , democracy was always and everywhere seen as a tool to be used to displace troublesome regimes -- Iraq , Iran , Syria , the Palestinian Authority , North Korea .
These were n't governments that were disfavored because they were undemocratic , they were targeted for democratization because they disfavored .
Now " reward your friends and punish your enemies " is n't a crazy approach to world affairs .
But in this case it does run directly contrary to the entire theory of why democracy mattered .
After all , you 'd have to be a real idiot to turn into an anti-American radical because you did n't like Saddam Hussein or the Assads or the Mullahs in Iran .
Opposition groups in those places you can expect to be friendly to America .
It 's in Egypt and Pakistan and Saudi Arabia that you need to worry .
Those are the countries where lack of democracy can , in principle , lead to an anti-American backlash .
But those are precisely the countries where Bush never did anything other than tinker around the edges always leaving it clear that incumbent regimes ' red lines would be respected .
That , though , is just backwards and stupid and has nothing to do with the nominal problem at hand .

Sales Tactics Revealed – Win the War Over Your Paycheck
You ca n’t follow a budget !
You do n’t have self control !
You ca n’t manage your money !
You , you , you ……
Money Foolish ?
Is it really all about you ?
Is it all your fault ?
As we go through life , we do n’t always do what we ’re “ supposed ” to do with our money .
When things do n’t go right financially , we tend to get discouraged and down on ourselves .
Where does all our money go ?
Why ca n’t we manage our money ?
Did you ever stop to think maybe it ’s not all your fault ?
What if the problem is n’t just your lack of self control or inability to stick with a budget ?
It ’s definitely possible to have a budget and decent self - control and still overspend .
Gimme Your Money !
Every dollar you spend is just one side of a transaction .
The party on the other side is taking the money you ’re using and chances are they played a role in convincing you to spend that money .
As a matter of fact , we have people trying to sell us things all day long !
They come at us in magazines & newspapers , in radio ads , on the Web , and now with direct sales even at work and in our homes .
And we wonder why it is so hard to hold onto our money !
Taking a Different View
One view you could take is that we overspend because we are weak consumers .
Another way to look at it is that companies are overcoming our self - control and better judgment with sneaky sales tactics .
What do you think about that perspective ?
Does it put your focus on the companies selling to you and their ability to persuade you to buy something instead of wallowing in financial self - deprecation ?
Forget Defense , Go on Offense
Which do you think is the more effective argument as you try and talk yourself out of spending money :
“ I should n’t buy it because I do n’t need it . ”
“ These people are tricking me into buying what they ’re selling ! ”
It seems to me the first approach does n’t motivate you not to buy , it is simply is a defensive attempt at trying to stick to your budget .
It reminds us we ’re constrained by money and we feel disappointed that we ca n’t buy something we want .
The second approach on the other hand gets my blood boiling !
It reminds me that I worked hard to earn my money and I ’m not going to hand it over to someone just because they have a few good sales tactics up their sleeve !
The War Over Your Paycheck
The sellers are waging a full assault against our wallets .
They have an array of sales consultants , market research , cutting edge technology , & advertising agencies working to convince us to spend our money .
So what are we to do ?
A ) Keep spending away and blame it on the sellers
B ) Refuse to buy anything because they ’re out to get us
C ) Be aware of their tricks and learn how to beat them
The Art of Distraction
As a father , I ’ve learned a large part of keeping a child happy is the art of distraction .
If you can take their attention off the issue at hand , they forget why they are unhappy .
The sellers have learned the same thing about us .
If they can use their selling tactics to distract us from the fact we ’re spending money , we ’ll hand over the cash and leave happy customers !
The most insidious thing about these sneaky sales tactics is that we do n’t realize the effect they ’re having on us .
They ’re not illegal ; you wo n’t see them featured on the news because they actually are legitimate business practices .
There are many more businesses selling with these tactics than selling with scams .
So why call them sneaky ?
They are so well accepted that we do n’t realize the effect they are having on us !
Sales Tactics Revealed
So what are these tactics we ’re so vulnerable to ?
Stay tuned to the “ Sales Tactics Revealed ” series as we document the most effective & frequently used tricks and ways we can recognize and overcome them .
Each installment of the series will use a similar format to study a sales tactic .
First the tactic will be described and the warning signs listed .
Then an example will be given of someone who has been caught in the trap and finally , we suggest different actions that you can take to protect your paycheck .

Olbermann : ' Infinity minus 140,216 improper emails ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday June 19 , 2007 Print This Email This " In Watergate , America was astounded by the fact that 18 1/2 minutes of secret presidential recordings were missing , " stated Keith Olbermann on Monday .
" Tonight the latest Bush administration scandal , as yet unchristened , makes that figure seem like a drop in the proverbial bucket .
Try this number : Infinity minus 140,216 .
Karl Rove 's improper emails .
The 140,000 are the ones still preserved .
The rest -- the infinity part -- the ones that were destroyed . "
Olbermann went on to describe the " jaw - dropping scandal " uncovered by Congressional investigators , where , in the most serious breach of the Presidential Records
Act since its enactment , hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of emails improperly sent by White House officials through outside emails servers may have been illegally destroyed .
As one example of the vast scope of the destruction , only 130 of Karl Rove 's emails still preserved on the Republican National Committee 's servers date from Bush 's first term , and none of those is from prior to November 2003 .
Rove was only one of at least 88 White House officials apparently using those RNC servers to transact political business on government property -- which under the Hatch Act is illegal in itself .
Other outside servers , such as those of the Bush - Cheney ' 04 campaign organization , were used as well .
Olberman then showed a clip of Presidential Press Secretary Tony Snow being asked about the scandal and claiming , " We 've seen a number of times right now , people have been putting together investigations to see what sticks .
They have had very little success so far .
This is an administration that is very careful about obeying the law . "
Olbermann spoke to correspondent David Shuster about the growing scandal , which might have involved as many as 100 White House officials in an organized and widespread effort to engage in illegal activity .
Suspicions that these officials were improperly mixing politics with government are increased by the fact that 51 of the known email accounts are missing entirely , including those of highly political figures like then - White House political director Ken Mehlman .
Shuster explained that two different laws are involved , the Presidential Records Act , " which requires officials not to destroy or delete official correspondence , " and the Hatch Act , which prohibits engaging in political business on government property .
When asked what happens next , Shuster said that Congressional subpoenas have been issued for White House officials in the attorney scandal , and they can now be asked about the RNC emails as well .
The Office of Special Counsel has also started investigating possible Hatch Act violations and could make criminal referrals .
Olbermann then asked Newsweek 's Howard Fineman , " Other than something drastic that they 're not going to do -- impeachment , a special prosecutor to pursue erased emails -- what can Congress do about that ? "
Fineman responded that " they 're working their way up the chain " and he expects to see subpoenas for Mehlman and Rove .
However , " The White House Counsel 's office will laugh at the subpoenas and not honor them , and we 'll be back in the [ Supreme ] Court , which is where the Bush presidency began . "
Fineman concluded by linking the email scandal to the US attorneys scandal , saying " This administration was dedicated to destroying whatever barriers there were between politics and the operation of the government . "
The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast on June 18 .
The Bush administration , continuing its fight to stop states from expanding the popular Children ’s Health Insurance Program , has adopted new standards that would make it much more difficult for New York , California and others to extend coverage to children in middle - income families .
Administration officials outlined the new standards in a letter sent to state health officials on Friday evening , in the middle of a month - long Congressional recess .
In interviews , they said the changes were aimed at returning the Children ’s Health Insurance Program to its original focus on low - income children and to make sure the program did not become a substitute for private health coverage .
After learning of the new policy , some state officials said today that it could cripple their efforts to cover more children by imposing standards that could not be met .
Ann Clemency Kohler , deputy commissioner of human services in New Jersey , said : “ We are horrified at the new federal policy .
It will cause havoc with our program and could jeopardize coverage for thousands of children . ”
Rangers have been recording footage of the gorillas they protect
The Democratic Republic of Congo's Virunga National Park and the surrounding Virunga volcanoes region are home to more than half of the world 's population of mountain gorillas .
To ensure the long - term survival of this threatened species , teams of rangers monitor and patrol the park 's Gorilla Sector .
Two of the rangers , Diddy and Innocent , have been keeping a weekly diary for the BBC News website that offers an insight into life on the frontline of conservation .
Here , they also share video footage that they have been recording over the past few months .
GETTING TO GRIPS WITH GORILLA TALK
Diddy , who has been a ranger for more than 16 years , gives an entertaining first lesson on gorilla communication .
MEET THE GORILLAS
Here is footage of some of the park 's gorilla groups , known as " families " , which are named after the dominant male or " silverback " .
' MY FAVOURITE GORILLA '
Innocent , head of gorilla monitoring , is able to recognise every gorilla within the sector .
Each animal has a unique " nose print " that enables rangers to tell them apart .
Here , Innocent explains why the giant ape nicknamed " the bald gorilla " is his favourite .
THE JULY MASSACRE
In July 2007 , the Virunga National Park grabbed headlines around the world for all the wrong reasons .
Several gorillas were shot dead by gunmen ; an act described as " senseless and tragic " by conservationists .
Innocent recalls how he felt when he heard the news , and the aftermath of the " massacre " .

Our agency receives its share of RFPs , and sometimes these requests stipulate that our proposal include layouts .
Even if the project looks promising , we just say no .
There are good reasons never to design on spec :
It ’s a lot of unpaid work .
Design is only partly decoration .
Mainly it is problem solving .
Unless the RFP spells out site goals and user needs in phenomenal detail , you ca n’t create an appropriate design because you do n’t yet know what problems need to be solved .
( Even if the RFP spells out goals and needs , it ’s unlikely that the people who wrote it know what all their site ’s problems are .
Most times you need to talk to people who use the site and study how they use it to get a handle on what works and does n’t .
It also helps to interview stakeholders .
Doing that at your own expense is risky business at best . )
It ’s unsafe for agency and potential client alike .
The annals of the AIGA are filled with stories like this one :
Per Acme Anvil Co. ’s request , Joe ’s agency designs comps on spec in hopes of winning the Acme redesign project .
Acme Anvil Co. informs
Joe ’s agency that someone else got the job .
Six months later , Acme Anvil Co. launches its redesigned website .
Joe ’s VP of new business visits the site and discovers that it looks similar to one of the supposedly rejected designs Joe ’s agency had submitted .
Joe ’s agency calls Joe ’s attorneys .
A nasty lawsuit ensues .
No matter who wins the suit , it will be costly and annoying — a drag on resources and morale — for all .
If Joe ’s agency wins , word goes out that they are the kind of agency that sues if they do n’t get a job .
If Joe ’s agency loses , they may have to lay off staff or close their doors .
All because they were willing to design on spec .
“ No work on spec ” was an advertising mantra until the mid-1990s .
When we left advertising , it was routine for ad agencies to compete by presenting clients with free print campaigns , TV animatics , and sometimes even branded caps , match packs , or other promotional tie-ins .
Agencies would temporarily add award - winning freelancers to their staff , spending thousands on these spec campaigns .
Agencies that did not get the account almost always laid off fulltime staff to make up for the money they lost .
We do not know if this is still a standard practice in advertising .
Fortunately it is not standard practice in web design .
The AIGA strongly advises its members never to design on spec , and we know of no professional web agency that disregards that advice .
Most potential clients who ’ve initially requested that we submit designs along with our proposals understand our reasons for saying no .
Those who insist on getting free designs anyway are simply advertising the fact that they would not be good clients to work for .
If business is slow , especially if you are a freelance web designer / developer , you may be tempted to say yes to unfair requests for free layouts .
Designer , beware : the risks outweigh the potential benefits .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. employers added 110,000 jobs in September and August ’s job losses were revised into a gain in a Labor Department report on Friday that lifted some worry about a recession in the near term .
A sign in a shop window advertises available jobs in Arvada , Colorado October 5 , 2007 .

But analysts said the data still showed a modest pace of job growth able to support only a less - than - robust economic expansion , which meant the Federal Reserve may be compelled to lower interest rates further to add stimulus to the economy .
“ Job gains starting in the spring have not been particularly good , ” said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. in Holland , Pennsylvania .
“ They have continued at a pace that is enough to keep the economy out of recession , but not enough to generate strong growth . ”
The department said 89,000 jobs were created in August , rather than the 4,000 that it originally reported were lost .
It also said 93,000 jobs were created in July instead of 68,000 it previously reported -- a total of 118,000 more jobs in the July - August period than it had earlier estimated .
That averaged out to about 97,000 jobs a month during the third quarter , down from 126,000 in the preceding quarter .
The monthly unemployment rate -- compiled from a separate survey -- edged up to 4.7 percent from 4.6 percent in August .
VIBRANT , OR NOT ?
U.S. President George W. Bush said the figures signaled “ a vibrant economy ” but a poll of top Wall Street economists found more than half still think the Fed will trim rates again this month to help the economy get past a housing slump and a surge in mortgage defaults .
The poll showed 10 out of 18 primary dealers -- big firms that deal directly with the Fed -- expect U.S. central bank policy - makers to reduce the benchmark federal funds rate a quarter percentage point at the end of an October 30 - 31 meeting .
Stocks posted solid gains on prospects for continued growth and higher corporate profits .
The Dow Jones industrial average .
DJI added 91.70 points to end at 14,066.01 after briefly touching a record high 14,124.54 .
The high tech - laden Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC rose 46.75 points to close at 2,780.32 .
But prices for U.S. Treasury securities fell as investors bet the revised jobs report reduced chances for further interest - rate cuts soon .
The bellwether 10 - year U.S. Treasury note dropped a full point in price as its yield jumped to 4.64 percent from 4.52 percent late on Thursday , and 30 - year bonds tumbled 1- 19/32 points , pushing their yield up to 4.86 percent from 4.76 percent .
The Fed cut official interest rates by an aggressive half percentage point on September 18 , which Fed Vice - Chairman Donald Kohn said on Friday will temper but not totally ward off some softening in future economic activity .
“ Our policy action will not be able to avert all of the weakness in the economy that may be in train for the next several months , ” he told the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The September total for jobs created outside the farm sector was modestly higher than the 100,000 that economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast but it was overshadowed by the big upward revisions in July and August hiring .
The reason cited for the reversal in the department ’s August hiring estimate was the government underestimated the hiring of teachers to start a new school year .
STRAINS CONTINUE
The bulk of the gains in September hiring came in service industries , including an addition of 44,000 in education and health services and 37,000 in the government .
In the goods - producing sector , 18,000 factory jobs were shed and 14,000 construction jobs were lost .
Some analysts cautioned that even although the labor market showed resilience in the third quarter , the pace of hiring may soften .
The U.S. housing sector remains in decline and the consequences of disruptions in financial markets stemming from subprime mortgage problems have not yet been fully felt .
“ It shows that in the immediate aftermath of all the turmoil on Wall Street in July and August , Main Street jobs were still growing , particularly in the private sector , at a moderate pace , ” said Stuart Hoffman , chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group , Pittsburgh .
“ Maybe it does say that the Fed skips the month of October on a rate cut , but there is still evidence here that job growth is not growing like it was , ” Hoffman said .

Congratulations President Bush : You Broke the Record !!!
Heartfelt congratulations to President Bush , who on Friday August 19th breaks Ronald Reagan 's all - time record for most vacation days .
The old record was 335 days , though Reagan took his sweet time of eight years to accomplish this feat .
President Bush did it in nearly half the time .
And with another two weeks of vaction on tap , he 's obviously not content with simply breaking the record , he 's going to smoke that record right out of the hole .
Great going , President Bush !
We knew you could do it !

Do n't Forget -- Reagan was 25 years older ( a genuine senior citizen ) and -- wait for it -- was shot within 100 days of taking office , so his vacation time naturally had to be high .
Maybe then we should have called it sick leave ?
And you know what , this frosts my balls because I 've been working here for 10 years and like most Americans I do n't get either vacation pay or sick leave .
Well since he does n't , has n't , and never will do a damn thing right , it is probably for the best interest of our country that he is on vacation .
I mean with the empty space that is between his ears , one could conclude he is / has always been on vacation .
I wish he were in Iraq fighting for what his father started instead of here in the U.S. .
I am sure our soldiers would be proud to watch him actually serve his country in the best interest of his fellow man kind .
Did somebody say GW was high ?
;-)

This is a post - 9/11 world .
The world has changed .
You cannot compare the past with today 's political climate .
This guy has worked ALOT harder than Reagan ( R.I.P. ) with the War On Terror .
Regan had the ' cold war '- this is a REAL war .
In addition to feeling bad for you , Anonymous 2 , for having to go without vacation or sick leave , I also sympathize about your frosted balls .
That 's something no man should have to live through .
No wonder you need sick leave . ;-)
A REAL patriot should know that were it not for questioning the sensibilites of spoiled - rich leaders , we would n't have a country .
Let me ask you this - if your boss took approximately 1.5 years vacation over the course of 4.5 years , would you respect him ?
Why do you feel the need to keep defending this man ?
He 's a black mark on your party and he's a black mark in our nation 's history .
Worst .
President .
Ever .
Really .
Real Patriot .
Gimme me a break with the post 9/11 world BS .
FDR worked himself to death fighting WWII .
A war the Democrats won in less time than Bush has had fighting the war on terror .
Bush is a disgrace and his excessive vacationing is a national embarassment .
He is scared to leave because the mothers movement may want some answers .
That would mean telling the truth when they ask him why thier children are dead because of his lies .
Ant to the " real patriot " .... GET OFF THE CRACK !!!
If you had listened to Nancy you would have been able to see the liar for what he really is .
Ignorance is bliss , not a license to be wrong without penalty .
Sigh .
I really want to know why more people are truly pissed off with what Bushy is doing / has done ...
I 'm interested to see all the backlash that will come in the next few years as more and more Americans start to see the similarities between Iraq and a certain country in South East Asia ...
Hmm ...
typical rich guy , sit on his laurels while " his Children of America " are being asked to work triple time in Afghan and Iraq .
Way to go " W " , you set such a great standard ..... one of underachieving and futility ( Bring em On ) !!
...
So , he basically took
a day off EVERY WEEK ?!
Like taking every Friday off
since he took office in 2000 ?
jesus , we are at war , are n't we ?
...
That 's really rich ...
Bush is on vacation so much - because - we 're in a tougher war than the country has ever faced ?
* laugh * Stop for just a moment and consider what you 're saying .
Can you honestly repeat that with a straight face ?
REAL Dork says :
This is a post - 9/11 world .
The world has changed .
You cannot compare the past with today 's political climate .
I want to second what others have pointed out -- to say that Bush should be taking more vacation because we 're at war is probably the most laughably dumb thing I 've heard all week .
excellent !
Sorry if I really got anyone angry ..
Maybe my sarcasm was too subtle ...
But , honestly , the greatest part about it : I made the most asinine comment that I could think of , and it sounded like the typical con troll ...
I do n't know about you , but I find THAT funny ...
it 's been a long week .. needed to entertain myself ...
He could leave the ranch except that sleep - deprived mothers of dead soldiers might jsut have had enough and attack him like zombies looking to eat brains ( not that they 'll find any in that head . )
Do n't forget what we learned from the presidental debate .
It 's hard work .
Perhaps next time the one that gets elected will be able to actually handle all the hard work without having to vacation like the French ...
( I 've got nothing against the French btw )
wre
A tip of the old Ten Gallon to Dubya ... the " Hardliest Workin ' Man in Politics " ( with apologies to James Brown ) ...
In the real world , we call it " detoxing " .
No Bush has ever worked a day in their lives .
Why start now ?
He 's too busy dodging mothers of dead soldiers just like he dodged Vietnam .
The psycho is a true traitor .
Not to rain on anyone 's parade here but it looks like Reagan did n't hold the all time record .
Bush 's father has him beat in this one .
from : http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20031001.html
" George Bush Sr. took all or part of 543 vacation days at Camp David and in Kennebunkport .
Ronald Reagan spent 335 days at or en route to his Santa Barbara , California , ranch during his eight years in office .
Of recent presidents , Jimmy Carter took the least days off -- only 79 days , which he usually spent at his home in Georgia . "
Thanks to bernstein for the above note .
There 's a glitch though ...
Yes , the article says that George Bush the Senior took over 500 days in office , but it also says he took them during his two terms in office .
Problem is , he only had one term in office .
Unless you count the vice presidency , and then it 's three terms .
Considering Bush was a coke - sniffing , alcoholic , neer - do - well , deserter the first 40 years of his pathetic life , America is lucky to get any honest work out of this failed criminal
This guy has worked ALOT harder than Reagan ( R.I.P. ) with the War On Terror .
Regan had the ' cold war '- this is a REAL war .
Is that right ?
All this time I thought it was " Mission Accomplished " .
But hey , it 's OK .
Your man 's credibility is in its last throes .
This criminal President Bush should be spending more vacation time in Leavenworth Prison .
If one never actually works , it 's all a vacation .
Bush is noble , ah , that is nobility .
Until we , the people , begin to actually choose leadership by joining or establishing political parties of our own making , not beholding to corporate interest , we 'll keep getting what we 've been getting .
Begin now by reviewing the rules and laws of your state about how to establish a party of the people .
Want one already there ?
Use Reform .
The Reform National Committee won a little know court case in the Florida Supreme Court in Nove 04 , to be recognized as a political party despite it 's lack of a big big central office , a DC legal team , political consultants , massive corporate donations or elected congressional members .
Reformers see it like this , the only part of the list we wish to change is having congressional members .
People are not human resources , nor is our party a resource for corporate gain .
I do political visions , freelance editorial cartoons .
For the latest , see www.cafepress.com/whitehousecrazy
Does that include Clinton ?
Everyday he spent in the White House was a vacation .
I really do n't want to argue here because I think that Bush is a liar , a criminal , and possibly guilty of treason but I do n't see where in the article I sited above that it states that the figure of 500 + days off for GHW Bush includes his Vice Presidency .
I 'm all for seeing GW Bush and his gang behind bars , but we must make our case with logic , reason , and evidence .
To rely on anything not only risks discrediting our side but corrupts our position as well .
The last sentence in the above post should have begun , " To rely on anything ELSE ... "
You 're right Bernstein .
I misread " during his eight years in office " relating to the first president Bush , when instead it related to Reagan .
Did G. Bush the Senior really spent 500 + days of vacation in four years ?
I 'll look into it , and would welcome if anyone else would too .
I 'd like to have more than one source before I update The Pick .
Thanks Bernstein .
War on terror my ass !
He did it for the oil plain and simple .
How many other countries like Iraq do people get killed and tortured , yet the world does nothing ?
I think President Mugabe is a much worse threat to innocent people 's lives than Saddam ever was .
" George Bush Sr. took all or part of 543 vacation days at Camp David and in Kennebunkport .
Must..not...let...Daddy ...win...
Given that a president is on call 24 hours a day , 7 days a week ( the world does n't take weekends , after all , and is n't all in our time zone ) , and that most " vacations " they take are , in fact , working vacations ( which means they are still basically doing all the same things , just not in DC ) , I think it is hard for any of us to understand their lives to properly be able to criticize them for " vacations . "
The other side always finds anything to harp on , though .
I remember the republicans making noise about Clinton , too , when he took a break .
Sheesh .
It 's a pretty stressful job and it doesnt exactly pay that great for what is required ; I wonder how many of us would be willing to do it ?
If you do n't like Bush 's politics , fine , attack that , but this is a really stupid issue , for either party to attack on .
After two years and thousands of casualties , the only Weapon of Mass Destruction ever found in Iraq was Donald Rumsfeld ... What will it take for my fellow Americans to see the contempt these pious frauds have for our nation , our flag , and our citizens .
Personally , I think the presidency should be like any other job in America : 2 weeks vacation for the first five years ( but none until after 6 months on the job ) , and three weeks after five years of service .
DONT YOU GUYS HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO ALL DAY THAN BASH PRES .
BUSH ... IF AMERICA THOUGHT THAT KERRY COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB THEN BUSH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RE - ELECTED .... THE COUNTRY IS OBVIOUSLY DIVIDED ON THIS ISSUE .
HOWEVER , YOUR CONSTANT ANGER AND BASHING WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM , NOR WILL IT SWERVE ANYONE ELSES OPINION .... THE BEST THING THAT YOU DEMS CAN DO IS FIND A CANDIDATE THAT CAN STEP UP AND WIN IN '08 ... UNTIL THEN , YOU ARE ACCOMPLISHING NOTHING BY SPEWING ALL OF THIS NEGATIVE ENERGY ...IF FACT , IF YOU SPENT MORE TIME ON YOUR PERSONAL BUSINESS AND LESS TIME ON HOW MUCH TIME OFF THE PRES IS TAKING ( WHICH BY THE WAY HAS NOT BEEN VERIFIED ) YOU WOULD ALL BE MUCH BETTER OFF ...

REALPATRIOT was being sarcastic ( I hope ) .
Bush deserves to break the record .
He simply does not know the difference between " vacation " and " AWOL " .
maybe we should have Star look into it .. you know spend another couple million to see what ole Bush is up to on his days off GIVE ME A BREAK MISTER ALL CAPS do you have eyes and ears the repubs are no better ... money wasting vacation taking tards ... the lot of them !
you were here like the rest of us WASTING time .
That is the problem you do n't lead by example you lead with your ever dwindling pocketbook and talk out your .....
I got to this site because I was wondering if George W. Bush can now claim to have the MOST Americans die on American soil during a Presidential vacation .
Having already looked up the most American deaths in America , I was looking for stats on which president took the longest vaca .
So , " anonymous " who posted at 4:42 PM , here 's my answer to your comment , " If you do n't like Bush 's politics , fine , attack that , but this is a really stupid issue , for either party to attack on . "
No , now that uncounted numbers of Gulf Coast residents have DIED it 's not STUPID .
Between the last few days and the vacation Bush took in August 2001 ( while memos were going around about Bin Laden ) , it 's no longer about who took the most vacation .
I believe unequivocally that this IDIOT has killed the largest number of Americans while on Presidential vacations .
Refute that , Mr. ALL CAPS ANONYMOUS who posted at 9:34 AM .
Bush was not elected -- he STOLE another election ( ask the voters who were still in line in Ohio at 4:30 a.m. after Fox announced Bush won the previous evening ! ) .
Yes , if John Kerry were President now , people would have been airlifted out of New Orleans days ago ( not after the tragedy ) -- especially those who were too poor to own a car or buy gasoline for it .
If Katrina had hit Dallas and the oil billionaires instead of poor black New Orleans do you think there would have been a lot more immediate planning , action and concern out of the Bush mob ?
Now they are talking $ 10 Billion in aid .
This is disgusting and reprehensible considering this disaster will make 9 - 11 look like a car accident by comparison in terms of human suffering and damage .
9-11 was a horrible tragedy but it has mainly served as a stupid excuse to go to war in Iraq and make George W a " war " president .
How many hundred BILLION has the Iraq " war on terror " ( quagmire ) cost ?
And do you feel any safer ?
THAT ******** told Diane
Sawyer when she asked about the forign response to Katrina that we have not asked others for help ???????????
What the hell we give but we can't receive due to the complete arrogance of our Pres.
PLEASE !!!
TAKE A LONGER VACATION AND LET SOMEONE , ANYONE ELSE TAKE OVER AND HELP THESE PEOPLE .
Amazing what the left dwells on , vacation days ha .
Although , thanks for the humour guys , at least we have another two years of you children crying about Bush .
I 'll just sit back enjoy the comments and thank god Al Gore lost !
see , theres your problem .... " thank GOD ... "
ever heard of separation of Church and State ?
apparently not .
Why does the man that has killed more people in his presidency get ANY support whatsoever ???
Because you religious , redneck , buck - toothed morons have NO BRAIN IN YOUR HEADS !
Do n't support the man just because he 's a white christian ... clue us in on your reasoning for agreeing with his demonic powers , and lust for dictatorship .
If you cannot tell that Bush is an evil man , then you need to open your eyes , and step foot on the real world .
Slightly off the topic of whether president X ( regardless of party ) should be taking vacations of this extent ...
Now , I am not at all for forcing my religion down anyone 's throats .
I do n't mind , however , correcting this certain issue without taking EITHER side ( if we 're going by data and logic and all ... ) :
Constitution for the United States , Amendment 1 :
" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances "
We have NO right to tell someone that their declaration of religious sayings are wrong or even inappropriate by citing the constitution ;
The constitution holds no power over what a person can and cannot say .
Come on .
Do n't cite a government document when things like " there ’s your problem " are clearly your opinion .
Let me also word the first part of the amendment in a different way :
The way I would translate it ( my opinion ) is that the government ( that would be congress ) can make no law respecting an establishment of religion .
But wait – that ’s what ’s there .
No laws saying to practice a religion .
No laws saying that a religion cannot spread to the extent that the ( or any ) religion requires .
I believe that this means if we want to push a religion or religious party back , we must do it on our own terms , not involving the government ( or its founding documents ) at all .
Religion cannot be shut up by the government just as journalists cannot be shut up by the government .
It 's just that way .
If it were the other way around , movie stars and the like would have a field day mopping Hollywood with every paparazzi who annoyed them in the least .
Yes , I understand that religious zealots are annoying and angering .
But in America , it 's their right to be that way ( do n't get me wrong , if they commit a CRIME while being " religiously inspired " , certainly punish 'em for it ) .
On the note about clinging tenaciously to every word the constitution says , has anyone taken a clear look at what Amendment 13 says ( right after the first five words ) ?
Please comment on this ;
The way I read it states that slavery is NOT illegal in every form .
That 's disturbing .
Glad someone has not taken THAT to court ( shudder ) .
In the meantime , perhaps it would be smarter to listen to what the public thinks ( hooRAY for politically biased opinions , but still ) and push Americans to decide how much vacation should be appropriate within one term ( or at least what the max should be ) .
Please excuse me for being lengthy , but I like when people debate about things ; it 's a constitutional right . ;)
- Aiden ( I KNOW I 'll receive responses from this one ... ca n't just leave it ' Anonymous ' ) :)
AMENDMENT XIII
Passed by Congress January 31 , 1865 .
Ratified December 6 , 1865 .
Note : A portion of Article IV , section 2 , of the Constitution was superseded by the 13th amendment .
Section 1 .
Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the United States , or any place subject to their jurisdiction .
Section 2 .
Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation .
This clearly says that slavery and involuntary servitude are illegal , except if one considers penal servitude as a form of slavery or involuntary servitude .
Considering the prison industrial complex , penal servitude certainly is akin to involuntary servitude .
Also , I am a liberal and I feel that if there is a God , he is certainly on my side .
I mean all of the teachings of Jesus , Buddha , Mohammed , et al. favor helping the poor , treating others as one wishes to be treated , not casting the first stone , etc .
Just a thought ...
Thanking God is not the problem .
If you truly are a child of God you can not put this on or take it off like a coat , it is a part of who you are .
GW has passed no laws about his religion or forced it down anyone 's throat .
It is apart of his being .
I think he is a wonderful president a much needed breath of fresh air .
Our country was founded on religious beliefs and blessed for it .
It becomes very tiring hearing the whining of the liberals everytime something does n't go their way.ie:vacations
If the election were stolen ( ha ) ..due to fox news announcing Bush the winner ... ( how many liberals watch fox news anyway .. if they did they would not be liberals . )
Thank God !
Ok OK back to the origional issue .
The president should get the same vacation as the majority of Americans ... 18 days a year .
This guy has outdone the French they get on average 39 days a year .
certinally wish he was their President they could and Would fire his a** and start over .
If Bush needs vacations so badly because being President is too much “ hard work ” maybe he should consider his other career options .
I ’m pretty sure that someone must have told Bush that North Korea started shooting long - range test missiles last week .
I do n’t think this is a good time for our “ President and Chief ” to take a vacation .
Not that he can really do anything like negotiate or enact any type of foreign policy – he ’ll just declare war on Korea to solve his problem .
Do n’t worry about the troops – this will be good for the country by giving Haliburton one more country to work in and this can drive oil prices even higher , so his oil exec friends can earn ever higher profits .
I am an Australian .
I see all the constant arguments along lines of Democrats vs Republicans and wonder can't you all just stop and think objectively .
Bush is a criminal ... but I do n't think the other side were going to be any better .
Its the same in Australia , , , our Prime Minister is a proven liar but the alternative is just as useless .
History will look back at these ' leaders ' - they will be remembered but none will be considered great .
No leader solved the Middle East conflict , no leader brought prosperity , no leader helped the dying in Africa , no leader has improved standards at home let alone in the third world .
They just achieve a continuation of the status quo .
Sorry to get on my soap box but once I was proud to be an Australian but now everyone just wants to attack everyone .
Would n't you think with today 's technology and our world view leaders could do more .
Imagine if instead of invading countries the army went into a third world country and built roads and irrigation systems and farms and schools and asked nothing in return .... what would the terrorists attack .
All won over and for no deaths !
OK so I am anidealist and a bleeding heart ... your turn to attack me .
Robert
so out of the total number of days president ( 2 terms ) howmany of them have been vacation days ?
Impeach G W before its too late
In time of war , The united States only has a part time President ?
The anti-impotency treatment you are going to adopt just after being identified with erectile dysfunction is not likely to yield any fruitful result if you do not abide by the precautionary instructions recommended by the physician .
For instance , after procuring viagra online if you administer cheap viagra without providing the necessary details to the doctor with regard to your medical history then there are chances that viagra intake might prove disastrous to you .
Most particularly , if you are taking nitrate based medicine such as nitroglycerin patches to treat a specific medical condition you should inform the doctor immediately so that he does n’t suggest you to buy viagra .
The usage of Viagra by any person using nitrate - based medicines can trigger off health disaster and as such you can definitely avoid the imminent harm by explaining your medical history to the doctor and avoiding to buy viagra online if the drug is not meant for you .

THE TORN CURTAIN
The curtain has been torn , and I
Will help to tear it , to the sky ,

Rancid infested at their core .
Viagra is the world renowned medicine for erectile dysfunction and most men have forgotten they ever had a problem with erections after its use .
Take it on empty stomach and it will work in 30 minutes .
Erections can be achieved on stimulation .
Generic Cialis is a new group of medication which allows adequate sexual stimulation , relaxes the blood vessels of the penis and helps erection .
First off all I would like to thank you for that great post .
It 's very interesting to read your posts .
As I can see , a lot of people here knows much about ED treatment maybe they can help me .
For a log time I can't decide what is better : to buy viagra , to buy cialis or to buy levitra ?
I found this Canadian pharmacy to buy all this things , so can somebody help me to make a decision ?
Generic Cialis is slightly different from the other erectile drugs available in the market as it may work up to 36 hrs after dosing .
Generic Levitra orks along with sexual stimulation to help achieve an erection when taken 30 to 60 minutes before sexual activity .
Generic Viagra is used in the treatment of Erectile Dysfunction ( impotence ) , but it is not a cure .
Impotence can be caused by a number of factors , either physical or psychological .
Viagra can help maintain an erection but it will not stimulate arousal .
Really you have done great job , There are may person searching about that now they will find enough resources by your post .

MOKCHEON , South Korea —
The compound — part boot camp , part rehab center — resembles programs around the world for troubled youths .
Drill instructors drive young men through military - style obstacle courses , counselors lead group sessions , and there are even therapeutic workshops on pottery and drumming .
But these young people are not battling alcohol or drugs .
Rather , they have severe cases of what many in this country believe is a new and potentially deadly addiction : cyberspace .
They come here , to the Jump Up Internet Rescue School , the first camp of its kind in South Korea and possibly the world , to be cured .
South Korea boasts of being the most wired nation on earth .
In fact , perhaps no other country has so fully embraced the Internet .
Ninety percent of homes connect to cheap , high - speed broadband , online gaming is a professional sport , and social life for the young revolves around the “ PC bang , ” dim Internet parlors that sit on practically every street corner .
But such ready access to the Web has come at a price as legions of obsessed users find that they cannot tear themselves away from their computer screens .
Compulsive Internet use has been identified as a mental health issue in other countries , including the United States .
However , it may be a particularly acute problem in South Korea because of the country ’s nearly universal Internet access .
It has become a national issue here in recent years , as users started dropping dead from exhaustion after playing online games for days on end .
A growing number of students have skipped school to stay online , shockingly self - destructive behavior in this intensely competitive society .
Up to 30 percent of South Koreans under 18 , or about 2.4 million people , are at risk of Internet addiction , said Ahn Dong - hyun , a child psychiatrist at Hanyang University in Seoul who just completed a three - year government - financed survey of the problem .
They spend at least two hours a day online , usually playing games or chatting .
Of those , up to a quarter million probably show signs of actual addiction , like an inability to stop themselves from using computers , rising levels of tolerance that drive them to seek ever longer sessions online , and withdrawal symptoms like anger and craving when prevented from logging on .
To address the problem , the government has built a network of 140 Internet - addiction counseling centers , in addition to treatment programs at almost 100 hospitals and , most recently , the Internet Rescue camp , which started this summer .
Researchers have developed a checklist for diagnosing the addiction and determining its severity , the K - Scale .
( The K is for Korea . )
In September , South Korea held the first international symposium on Internet addiction .
“ Korea has been most aggressive in embracing the Internet , ” said Koh Young - sam , head of the government - run Internet Addiction Counseling Center .
“ Now we have to lead in dealing with its consequences . ”
Though some health experts here and abroad question whether overuse of the Internet or computers in general is an addiction in the strict medical sense , many agree that obsessive computer use has become a growing problem in many countries .
Doctors in China and Taiwan have begun reporting similar disorders in their youth .
In the United States , Dr. Jerald J. Block , a psychiatrist at Oregon Health and Science University , estimates that up to nine million Americans may be at risk for the disorder , which he calls pathological computer use .
Only a handful of clinics in the United States specialize in treating it , he said .
“ Korea is on the leading edge , ” Dr. Block said .
“ They are ahead in defining and researching the problem , and recognize as a society that they have a major issue . ”
The rescue camp , in a forested area about an hour south of Seoul , was created to treat the most severe cases .
This year , the camp held its first two 12 - day sessions , with 16 to 18 male participants each time .
( South Korean researchers say an overwhelming majority of compulsive computer users are male . )
The camp is entirely paid for by the government , making it tuition - free .
While it is too early to know whether the camp can wean youths from the Internet , it has been receiving four to five applications for each spot .
To meet demand , camp administrators say they will double the number of sessions next year .
During a session , participants live at the camp , where they are denied computer use and allowed only one hour of cellphone calls a day , to prevent them from playing online games via the phone .
They also follow a rigorous regimen of physical exercise and group activities , like horseback riding , aimed at building emotional connections to the real world and weakening those with the virtual one .
“ It is most important to provide them experience of a lifestyle without the Internet , ” said Lee Yun - hee , a counselor .
“ Young Koreans do n’t know what this is like . ”
Initially , the camp had problems with participants sneaking away to go online , even during a 10 - minute break before lunch , Ms. Lee said .
Now , the campers are under constant surveillance , including while asleep , and are kept busy with chores , like washing their clothes and cleaning their rooms .
One participant , Lee Chang - hoon , 15 , began using the computer to pass the time while his parents were working and he was home alone .
He said he quickly came to prefer the virtual world , where he seemed to enjoy more success and popularity than in the real one .
He spent 17 hours a day online , mostly looking at Japanese comics and playing a combat role - playing game called Sudden Attack .
He played all night , and skipped school two or three times a week to catch up on sleep .
When his parents told him he had to go to school , he reacted violently .
Desperate , his mother , Kim Soon - yeol , sent him to the camp .
“ He did n’t seem to be able to control himself , ” said Mrs. Kim , a hairdresser .
“ He used to be so passionate about his favorite subjects ” at school .
“ Now , he gives up easily and gets even more absorbed in his games . ”
Her son was reluctant at first to give up his pastime .
“ I do n’t have a problem , ” Chang - hoon said in an interview three days after starting the camp .
“ Seventeen hours a day online is fine . ”
But later that day , he seemed to start changing his mind , if only slightly .
As a drill instructor barked orders , Chang - hoon and 17 other boys marched through a cold autumn rain to the obstacle course .
Wet and shivering , Chang - hoon began climbing the first obstacle , a telephone pole with small metal rungs .
At the top , he slowly stood up , legs quaking , arms outstretched for balance .
Below , the other boys held a safety rope attached to a harness on his chest .
“ Do you have anything to tell your mother ? ” the drill instructor shouted from below .
“ No ! ” he yelled back .
“ Tell your mother you love her ! ” ordered the instructor .
“ I love you , my parents ! ” he replied .
“ Then jump ! ” ordered the instructor .
Chang - hoon squatted and leapt to a nearby trapeze , catching it in his hands .
“ Fighting ! ” yelled the other boys , using the English word that in South Korea means the rough equivalent of “ Do n’t give up ! ”
After Chang - hoon descended , he said , “ That was better than games ! ”
Was it thrilling enough to wean him from the Internet ?
“ I ’m not thinking about games now , so maybe this will help , ” he replied .
“ From now on , maybe I ’ll just spend five hours a day online . ”

The economies of many big oil - exporting countries are growing so fast that their need for energy within their borders is crimping how much they can sell abroad , adding new strains to the global oil market .
Experts say the sharp growth , if it continues , means several of the world ’s most important suppliers may need to start importing oil within a decade to power all the new cars , houses and businesses they are buying and creating with their oil wealth .
Indonesia has already made this flip .
By some projections , the same thing could happen within five years to Mexico , the No. 2 source of foreign oil for the United States , and soon after that to Iran , the world ’s fourth - largest exporter .
In some cases , the governments of these countries subsidize gasoline heavily for their citizens , selling it for as little as 7 cents a gallon , a practice that industry experts say fosters wasteful habits .
“ It is a very serious threat that a lot of major exporters that we count on today for international oil supply are no longer going to be net exporters any more in 5 to 10 years , ” said Amy Myers Jaffe , an oil analyst at Rice University .
Alwaleed has owned his Citi stake since the early 1990s and helped engineer a previous rescue plan for the bank more than a dozen years ago .
According to a report on the Wall Street Journal 's Web site , he is likely to keep his total stake in the bank below 5 percent to avoid regulatory scrutiny .
By raising so much captial , CEO Pandit is hoping layoffs can be kept to a minimum .
Although word of the expected layoffs was having little impact on Citigroup shares , the company 's options were among the most actively traded Monday .
The activity was most concentrated in the January contract , implying investors are positioning for an announcement Tuesday , according to Andrew Wilkinson , a senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers .
However , some investors also were taking defensive positions in the February contract with traders entering long positions on a total volume of more than 12,000 lots at the 27.50 strike , he said .
Merrill Lynch is seeking about $ 4 billion in a second capital raising .
According to Financial Times , the Kuwait Investment Authority is expected to be a significant investor in the deal .
A deal could be announced as soon as midweek , the FT reports .
Merrill has already begun laying off people , but layoffs will be minimal .
Eight hundred people are expected to leave , with a number of employees already heading for the exits because of diappointment at the size of bonuses .
Merrill 's writedown is expected to be in the neighborhood of $ 12 billion to $ 15 billion as newly appointed CEO John
Thain raises funds from around the world .
( Merrill Losses Could Hit $ 15 Billion ) .
China Opts Out
The Wall Street Journal reports that state - owned China Development Bank has decided not to buy a $ 2 billion stake in Citigroup .
The report , citing people familiar with the situation , said senior Chinese government opposition surfaced over the weekend , but that the reason for the
decision is unclear .
In November , Citi accepted $ 7.5 billion in new capital from the The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority only weeks after its former chief executive officer , Charles Prince , was forced out amid news of the heavy losses related to bad bets on mortgage securities and an ailing housing markets .

* A year ago to the day , China knocked a weather satellite out of orbit , and threw the international community into panic .
Some figured the satellite - killer test was the harbinger of a future war in space – the kind of conflict that could cripple a tech - dependent United States military .
Geoffrey Forden , PhD – an MIT research associate and a former UN weapons inspector and strategic weapons analyst at the Congressional Budget Office – examines the possibilities of an all - out Chinese assault on American satellites .
This is part one .
Click for parts two and three .

High above Asia , as the bars and clubs of Beijing begin to fill up at the end of another work day , a US early warning satellite spots the tell - tale plume of a missile streaking out of the wastes of Western China .
Warning bells sound all through the Pentagon .
Tensions have been running high between China and the United States , as the two countries struggle to resolve the latest installment of the Taiwanese crisis .
And China has had a run of unprecedented activity in space : the past two days have seen China launch four large missions into deep space , three within the last six hours ..
Fortunately , a high - resolution American spy satellite will be over that second launch site within minutes , giving the US a unique ability to determine what is going on .
But even though tasking orders are given to photograph the suspected launch site , none are returned .
The satellite , code - named Crystal 3 , no longer responds to commands .
Within minutes , US Space Command reports that four NAVSTAR / GPS satellites —used to guide American drones and precision bombs — have stopped broadcasting .
China ’s space war against the United States has started .
For years , the American armed forces have worried about an attack on US satellites ; this could be how it begins .
The United States military has become increasingly dependent on space .
It uses photo - reconnaissance satellites to observe potential adversaries , GPS satellites to guide munitions with pin-point accuracy , communications satellites to handle the flow of information into and out of a theater of operations , and early warning satellites to detect and track enemy missile launches to name just a few of the better known applications .
Because of this increasing dependence , many analysts have worried that the US is most vulnerable to asymmetric attacks against its space assets ; in their view US satellites are “ sitting ducks ” without any sort of defense and their destruction would cripple the US military .
China ’s test of a sophisticated anti-satellite ( ASAT ) weapon a year ago , Friday – 11 January 2007 , when it shot down its own obsolete weather satellite – has only increased these concerns .
But is this true ?
Could a country — even a powerful country like China that has demonstrated a very sophisticated , if nascent , ability to shoot down satellites at all altitudes — inflict anything close to a knock - out blow against the US in space ?
And if it was anything less than a knock - out , how seriously would it affect US war fighting capabilities ?
The answers to these questions should influence how the US responds to the threats China ’s ASAT represents .
There is at least one way to answer these questions : “ war - gaming ” a massive Chinese attack on US satellites , where China is only limited by the laws of physics and the known properties of their ASAT , and see how much damage could be done .
Such an exercise also reveals what the US could do , and what it could not do , to minimize the consequences .
The results of my calculations are reported here .
They assume that China launches a massive attack and that everything works exactly as planned : every ASAT launches , the US does not respond until after the attacks are launched even though it will have overwhelming evidence ahead of time , and every ASAT hits its target .
Thus , this is a worst case scenario for the United States .
In the end , we 'll show , the US would still has sufficient space assets to fight a major conventional war with China , even after such an attack .
America 's military capabilities would be reduced , for a few hours at a time .
But they would not be crippled .
Back in 2001 , a commission lead by Donald Rumsfeld warned of a " space Pearl Harbor , " a single strike that could cripple America 's satellite network .
It turns out , there is no such thing .
Let 's start with what we know about China 's ASAT capabilities today .
And we know quite a bit .
Because there are few , if any , secrets in space .
Amateurs around the world track most , if not all , of the classified US military satellites from their backyards , posting their positions on the internet .
NORAD , is capable of tracking objects as small as four inches across .
In fact , NORAD 's measurements of the debris caused by China ’s January 2007 test were posted on the web .
In the case of the Chinese test , the orbital tracks of that debris can be used to reveal the capabilities and limitations of China ’s ASAT weapon by reconstructing the collision – much like forensic scientists reconstruct a crime scene .
By backtracking the debris to the point where they all converge , we can determine the two most important aspects of the Chinese ASAT : how China destroyed that satellite , and just how capable its satellite - killer really is .
The interception was almost head on at a combined speed of almost 18,000 miles per hour .
The pieces of debris wound up with the greatest speeds — much higher than the original satellite .
This means that China accomplished the most sophisticated of space maneuvers : a hit - to - kill interception , the equivalent of hitting a bullet with a bullet .
This is equivalent to what the US is trying to develop in its national missile defense system and is much more sophisticated than the ASAT the Soviet Union was working in the 1980s : little more than a space mine that slowly snuck up on its target and detonated near by .
We also know that the ASAT was highly maneuverable .
Yes , the target satellite ’s orbit was known well ahead of the interception .
However , that does not mean that the satellite ’s position was known well enough that the ASAT did not need to steer itself to hit the target .
In fact , it is very likely that the interceptor needed to maneuver at high speeds , perhaps as much as six times the acceleration of gravity , to hit its target .
The orbital speed of the target satellite , which is determined by its altitude , also provides us with significant insight into the interceptor ’s capability .
The closing speed of the interception , which is a combination of the target satellite ’s orbital speed and the speed of the interceptor , determines how much time is available to make final adjustments .
For instance , just one second before the collision on January 11th , the interceptor and target were five miles apart .
During that one second , the interceptor had to make any final adjustments to its trajectory to hit a target smaller than six feet across .
Any decrease in the closing speed makes the attack that much easier .
Since orbital speeds decrease with increasing altitudes , the Chinese interceptor would find it considerably easier to hit a target in higher orbit .
Finally , the interceptor needed to track its target , so that it could determine where it should move to place itself in front of the obsolete weather satellite ; we have a good sense of how that was done , too .
The most likely method it employed to track the oncoming satellite was an on - board telescope using visible light .
Locking onto a target this way – as opposed to focusing on the infrared light emitted by the heat of the target , the way the US missile defense interceptor does – imposes significant limitations on the system .
In particular , until it develops a far - infrared capability , which is probably decades away , its ASAT will be forced to attack satellites while they are in bright sunlight .
Indeed , even though the site from which the interceptor was launched was cloaked in darkness , the target satellite was high enough to be brightly illuminated by the sun .
Until China does develop better sensors , this imposes a very severe constraint on how and when it could attack other satellites : it must wait to attack low Earth orbit satellites when they are in bright sunshine .
Attacks against satellites in significantly higher orbits , such as GPS or geostationary satellites , are less constrained by this requirement since they are almost always in direct sunlight .
China has informally stated a number of times that it will “ never do this again . ”
But after having paid a very high price for testing the system once , both in resources and in political capital , it seems unlikely that they would abandon it altogether .
Fortunately for China , it can continue to develop the system — including its on board tracking , guidance , and control systems — in the guise of a missile defense system .
Such interceptions could be arranged at similar , or even greater , closing speeds as the January 2007 test .
Only now , China could arrange to have both the target and the interceptor collide when they are both in downward portions of their trajectories , much like the US does during its missile defense tests .
That way , they can test their system again – without creating orbital debris that might harm their own and other nation ’s satellites .

Sperm Could Be the Slave Drivers of the Nanobot Future
Scientists are investigating the possibility of using the “ tiny assembly line that powers the whip - like tail of sperm ” to send medical nanobots racing throughout the body .
In order to work , these devices would have to be made from biomedical components — and at that size , “ biology would provide the best functional motors . ”
This approach seems bizarre , but apparently it could help solve the problem of supplying energy to thousands of minuscule internal devices that can fight or ward off disease .
How long it will be before these spermbot slave drivers become a reality is anyone ’s guess .

Meet Warren Buffetts Daddy
The American Enterprise ^ | July / August 2003 | Bill Kauffman
Posted on by Antiwar Republican
Meet Warren Buffetts Daddy Bill Kauffman From The American Enterprise , July / August 2003 , p. 48 Warren Buffett , the legendary investor whose taste for hamburgers and life in Omaha , Nebraska gives him a reputation for Middle American eccentricity in the world of high finance , is just another colorless gray - pinstriper when compared with his father : Rep. Howard Buffett ( R - NE ) , who half a century ago was perhaps the most radical and principled Republican member of Congress .
The Buffetts were pillars of Omaha .
Howard Buffett was a stockbroker , " gentle and sweet - natured , " in the words of Warren 's biographer Roger Lowenstein .
His politics , though , were to " the right of God , " cracked one local banker .
Buffett was elected to Congress in 1942 with a pledge to keep FDR from " fasten [ ing ] the chains of political servitude around America 's neck . "
He marked himself an oddball by returning a pay raise to the Treasury and by subjecting each piece of legislation to a simple test : " Will this add to , or subtract from , human liberty ? "
Very few House bills passed Howard Buffett 's test .
In four non-consecutive terms representing Omaha in the U.S. House of Representatives , the radical backbench Republican compiled an almost purely libertarian record .
He opposed whatever New Deal alphabet - soup agencies and Fair Deal bureaucracies emerged from the black lagoon of the Potomac .
As the historian Joseph Stromberg has written , " the only [ current ] member of Congress who bears comparison with Buffett is Ron Paul , " the Texas Republican and courageous naysayer .
Buffett was also a strict isolationist , denouncing NATO , conscription , the Marshall Plan ( " Operation Rathole " ) , and the incipient Cold War , which he believed would enchain Americans in " the shackles of regimentation and coercion ... in the name of stopping communism . "
Foreign aid was a Buffett bugaboo .
The story is told that as the family drove past the British Embassy late one night , Howard , seeing the lights still on , quipped , " They even stay up late to think of ways to get our money . "
Buffett summed up his views of America and the world in a speech on the House floor condemning the Truman Doctrine : " Even if it were desirable , America is not strong enough to police the world by military force .
If that attempt is made , the blessings of liberty will be replaced by tyranny and coercion at home .
Our Christian ideals cannot be exported to other lands by dollars and guns .
Persuasion and example are the methods taught by the Carpenter of Nazareth , and if we believe in Christianity we should try to advance our ideals by his methods .
We cannot practice might and force abroad and retain freedom at home .
We cannot talk world cooperation and practice power politics . "
Dissent must be its own reward ; seldom does it bring promotion .
Howard Buffett retired from politics after losing the 1954 Republican Senate nomination to Roman Hruska , who would achieve immortality in 1970 , when he defended Nixon 's doomed Supreme Court nominee G. Harrold Carswell from charges of " mediocrity " with the immortal effusion , " Even if he were mediocre , there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers .
They are entitled to a little representation , are n't they ? "
Even his critics conceded that Howard Buffett was no mediocrity .
To The Nation , he was " an able young man whose ideas have tragically fossilized . "
In retirement , he had the good fortune to befriend an energetic young economist named Murray Rothbard , who would in time become the Happy Warrior of the libertarian movement .
For years , Rothbard touted the wisdom of Howard , the Buffett who was neither billionaire nor beachbum wasting away again in Margaritaville .
Congressman Buffett 's son , while revering Pop as a tower of integrity and honesty , seems not to have inherited the old man 's libertarian streak .
Warren Buffett is a liberal Democrat whose favorite political causes are legalized abortion and population control .
But surely the father bequeathed the son a confident contrariety , for if Warren Buffett lacks Howard Buffett 's politics , he shares his disdain for the eastern citadels of commerce and power , choosing to live in his hometown of Omaha : a radically decentralist act of which Rep.
Buffett would have heartily approved .

Actually , Billons In Debt ( to his unrequited heirs ) Buffett is not at all like Hillary .
She is so like her parents , religiously , it is actually scary .
See Gary North on this topic .
Buffey is more like the evil child who bit his fathers 's hand .
What a tortured child .
Sick pup .
In " The Demographics of Saving and Growth " today , on Mises.org
" ... Sumner also used the example of a snowball , to illustrate how the advantages of capital accumulate over time .
" Its first accumulation is slow " he wrote , " but as it proceeds the accumulation becomes rapid and the element of self - denial declines . "
Sumner thought this was incontrovertibly true , because if it were not , there would rapidly come a point at which further self - denial , or saving , would not pay .
Discoveries and improvements require less additional capital when you have more to work with .
It is easier to get computer technology to a certain level today than it would be to achieve that same level when computers were still in their infancy and the computing power of today 's common desktop filled a whole room .
That it takes fewer resources is intuitively obvious , and that is Sumner 's point ... "
So Buffett is a flake .
A nare do well of his fathers capital both intellectually and physically .
The staggering good this man could have done with his fortune is prostrate in front of what he has done .
What a coward he is .
An evil force in the universe .
The Oracle of Omaha ?
Ha
What a fake .
Have a cola , steak , and a dairy - queen .
Consume on behalf of Warren .
All errors , mis-quotes , and typos are mine alone .

Warren Buffett was a diehard Pubbie until his early 30's .
He was the Chairman of the Young Rebublicans and was very much for Goldwater over Johnson .
He became a liberal after he started making a lot of money .

I forgot to add he is also a socialist in his own words .
He thinks Gov't should give everyone equal rights from birth meaning nobody should get ahead of another with wealth .
The idiot is also leaving billions to pro abortion groups to keep the women 's right to do what they want with their own body .

Hillary 's father was a Republican and was pretty stern .
Hill got involved with civil rights groups at a young age through her church , which some of them went on to become very fringe .
By the time she got to college ( and beyond ) she was full fling lefty , rebelling against her old man .
That is the paralell between the two .

He marked himself an oddball by returning a pay raise to the Treasury and by subjecting each piece of legislation to a simple test : " Will this add to , or subtract from , human liberty ? "
This makes me feel like God is smiling at me .

White House , Justice Department , Congress told CIA not to destroy interrogation tapes Katie Baker
Published : Friday December 7 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Update : " White House and Justice Department officials , along with senior members of Congress , advised the Central Intelligence Agency in 2003 against a plan to destroy hundreds of hours of videotapes showing the interrogations of two operatives of Al Qaeda , government officials said Friday , " according to the New York Times .
" The chief of the agencyâs clandestine service nevertheless ordered their destruction in November 2005 , taking the step without notifying even the C.I.A.âs own top lawyer , John A. Rizzo , who was angry at the decision , " the Times said .
" Top C.I.A. officials had decided in 2003 to preserve the tapes in response to warnings from White House lawyers and lawmakers that destroying the tapes would be unwise , in part because it could carry legal risks , the government officials said . "
Read the full Times story here .
Rep. Jane Harman said in an interview with MSNBC on Friday that she told the CIA not to destroy videotapes of the interrogation of Al Qaeda terrorist suspects .
" My view then and my view now is it was a bad idea to consider destroying any tapes , and it was a very bad idea to do it , " said California Democrat Harman , who is the chair of the House Homeland Security Committee on Intelligence and Terrorism Risk Assessment .
Harman said she wrote a " classified " letter to the CIA telling them of her opinion when she learned of the existence of these videotapes in 2003 .
Harman said that she is unsure if the tapes were truly destroyed in order to protect identities , as CIA director Mike Hayden asserted in a letter he wrote yesterday to his employees .
" He was n't the guy who made the call , " Harman said , adding that she finds it " quite incredible " that Porter Goss , the CIA director in 2005 , alleges that he had no idea that the tapes were destroyed .
" This is a big deal , " Harman said .
" If I were running the CIA , I would want to be told that some critical evidence was being destroyed . "
When asked if there should be an investigation into whether a cover - up took place , Harman said that the House and Senate Intelligence Committees should " demand all the facts . "
Pressed further , she admitted that " it looks very bad . "
Harman has been barraged with criticism for not preventing the destruction of the tapes .
" What the hell was Jane Harman doing ? " wrote prominent blogger Andrew Sullivan on Friday , in an entry entitled , " Pusillanimous Harman . "
Sullivan called Harman 's actions " pathetic , " and wondered how she could have stayed silent : " A leading Democrat is told that the CIA is destroying evidence of its own war crimes and says and does nothing ? "
Glenn Greenwald of Salon.com also criticized Harman for confining her objections to " private expressions of ' concern ' to the CIA . "
" She took no steps -- no press conferences , no investigations , no demands for a criminal referral , no court action -- to impede this destruction - of - evidence plan in any way , " wrote Greenwald .
Harman said classification laws prevented her from taking any course of action .
ï¿½Too much is classified .
But I signed an oath as a member of Congress , and an additional oath as a member of the Intelligence Committee , to abide by the law and I do , ï¿½ Harman said .
ï¿½This was a highly classified intelligence briefing .
That was the deal .
I could not talk to anyone and I didnï¿½t.ï¿½ Sources : MSNBC and Federal News Service

The average British person drinks three cups of tea a day , believes in God , is more than £ 3,000 in debt , has sex eight times a month , is caught on CCTV camera 300 times a day and drives a Ford Fiesta .
At least that 's what the statistics tell us .
But who is this Mr - or Mrs - Average ?
Do they exist in the real world ?
What do they look like ?
Where do they live ?
And what can they tell us about the state of our country in the 21st Century ?
Earlier this year , I spent three months trying to track down the average Briton for a Channel 4 documentary .
Scroll down for more ...
During my odyssey into all that is average about Britain today , I discovered the average body shape , visited the most average town , garnered the opinions and concerns of the average person and met a surprising number of people who were happy to describe themselves as average .
What I found challenged my prejudices about averageness and made me re-evaluate my own life and values .
I began my quest by collecting every statistic that I could find about the average Briton .
These ranged from the serious ( the average Briton is overweight ) to the amusing ( the average British male spends one month of his life looking for lost socks ) to the downright pointless ( the average Briton says ' sorry ' an incredible 1.9 million times in a lifetime ) .
" Lies , damned lies and statistics , " goes the saying , and I steered clear of the swathe of fictitious claims circulating on the internet .
My personal favourite : " The average person swallows eight spiders a year while asleep . "
My figures came from a variety of sources , ranging from the Office for National Statistics to market - research surveys .
Scroll down for more ...
Using this data as a guide , I set off to track down Mr Average .
I began by trying to work out what the average Briton looks like .
Using key physiological statistics - for example , the average man is 5ft 91 / 2in tall and the average woman has a 36 C bust - I constructed white plywood outlines of the average British male and female body shapes and took them out to compare with shoppers on London streets .
The reaction was mixed .
Most people were shocked that the average Briton is so large but several women were thrilled to discover that they were smaller than the average size 16 .
My statistics told me that the average person would most likely be married , own their own home and have two children ( 1.8 is average , down from 2.4 in the Eighties ) .
So I travelled across the country tracking down potential candidates .
But every time I thought I 'd found Mr or Mrs Average , they revealed something about themselves that was annoyingly unaverage .
There was the Army wife from Surrey who matched many of my criteria and was about to turn 40 - the average age in Britain today .
Unfortunately , when I attended her birthday party and questioned her friends , I discovered that her pastimes included running marathons , skydiving and riding her Harley - Davidson .
Hardly average behaviour .
There was the couple in Wigan who , along with their two children , were looking for a house close to the average price of £ 200,000 .
Frustratingly , it emerged that he was self - employed and ran a successful business from home .
I had high hopes for the school caretaker from Dartford who earned close to the median wage of £ 23,556 and claimed he drove a car so average that he regularly could not find it in supermarket car parks .
Frustratingly , his car turned out to be a Vauxhall Zafira .
I knew from my research that Britain 's most statistically average car is the Ford Fiesta .
Another dead end .
The Kaiser Chiefs might have had a hit with the song Everything Is Average Nowadays .
But I was n't so sure .
In the age of X Factor , Big Brother and YouTube , it sometimes seems as if everyone wants to be different , special or famous .
But does constantly striving for success and recognition make us any happier than average ?
Ben Page , chairman of the Ipsos - Mori Social Research Institute , told me : " Our society is now much richer than it was 30 years ago but absolutely no happier .
" There is some evidence to suggest that people who are average and are content with what they have will be happier than those of us who are always striving for more . "
I certainly was n't happy - my hunt for Mr Average was going nowhere .
I decided to narrow the search to one particularly average part of the UK .
I visited a company called CACI , which specialises in a technology called geodemographic profiling .
Given any UK postcode , CACI can tell you what type of people are likely to live there .
Using a range of criteria from house size to car ownership , CACI calculated that the most average UK postcode is CO4 - the northern part of Colchester in Essex .
So I spent days traipsing around its average - looking cul - de - sacs in the rain , knocking on doors and posting flyers in an attempt to find someone who would match all of my criteria .
Apart from having the odd door slammed in my face - " Average ?
Are you taking the p*** ? " - I met some fantastic people in Colchester .
But none of them was average enough .
They were either the wrong age , shape , had the wrong number of children or drove the wrong car .
By this point , I was on the verge of giving up .
But then others began to pick up on my search for the average Briton .
Several national newspapers printed a list of 20 questions that I had drawn up to help me identify Mr Average .
These included :
Are you married with two children ?
Do you know the words to God Save The Queen ?
Do you consider yourself working - class ?
Do you go to the toilet six times a day ?
The truly average Briton will answer " yes " to all .
Over the following week , I was inundated with responses from people , each convinced that they were the average Briton .
But one call stood out from the rest - a woman from Swindon called Michelle was certain that her husband , Peter Williamson , matched virtually all of my criteria .
Swindon may not be as average as north Colchester but it is renowned among market - research experts as one of Britain 's most average towns .
They even use it to conduct focus groups for their new products because residents ' views accurately represent those of the wider UK population .
As I approached the Williamson family 's home on the outskirts of Swindon , the signs looked good .
The quiet , new housing development was reassuringly average .
Better still , parked outside their house was a silver Ford Fiesta .
With my heart pounding , I knocked on the door .
The man who opened it was wearing an England football shirt and listened calmly as I excitedly tried to explain my search for the average Briton .
He invited me in for a cup of tea .
It soon became apparent that Peter was everything I 'd been looking for .
A married father of two , he is a Fiestadriving office worker who has 14 close friends , size 10 feet , knows the words to God Save The Queen , considers himself working - class and goes to the toilet six times a day .
He matched virtually all of my criteria .
Peter 's philosophy on averageness chimed with what I 'd learned during my journey .
" If you spend all your time trying to achieve instead of looking at what you 've got and being happy with it , it can destroy you , " he said .
" Whereas if you 've got a loving family and are content with your life - even if you have n't achieved greatness - then you 'll be happy . "
When I began my search for Britain 's Mr Average , I could not imagine anything worse than being labelled average .
But the more I spent time with Peter , his lovely wife Michelle and their two boys Tyler , nine , and Kieran , five , the more I realised that , far from being dull and boring , averageness could be a recipe for contentment .
Over dinner , I announced to Peter that I believed him to be my Mr Average .
He was amused and took it in very good grace , saying it made him proud to be British .
As I said my farewells , Peter reassured me that the title would not change him .
" Do n't worry , " he said .
" You 're not going to see me on next season 's Big Brother . "
I 've thought a lot about what I learned on my journey .
It seems that those of us who spend our lives obsessing about success and money and fame could learn much from people such as Peter Williamson .
Perhaps he knows something we do n't .
Perhaps we should celebrate the average in all of us .

You 've got to like any article that describes the Republicans as , " taken by surprise , " and where they , " excoriated Democratic leaders " :
Just one week after failing to override President Bush 's veto , House Democrats will put a new version of their $ 35 billion expansion of the State Children 's Health Insurance Program to a vote today , hoping that minor changes will win enough Republicans to beat Bush this round . [...]
At a contentious House GOP meeting with Leavitt on Tuesday night , wavering Republicans pledged that they would stand with the president .
But others quietly voiced concerns that the SCHIP showdown is taking a toll on their political prospects .
Decisions , decisions .
Vote for a bill that has the overwhelming support of the American people or stand with Mr. 24 % and endanger your own job security ?
What 's a rubber stamp Republican to do ?
Update [ 2007-10-25 8:51:44 by DemFromCT ] : In related SCHIP news :
Rep. Heather Wilson ( R - N.M. ) said she believed Democratic lawmakers would be willing to cap eligibility at three times the federal poverty level .
She also said the modified bill would give states greater authority to confirm the validity of applicants '
Social Security numbers in an effort to confirm U.S. residency status ( Babington / Freking , AP / Philadelphia Inquirer , 10 /24 ) ...
Dingell Letter
In related news , House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair John Dingell ( D - Mich . ) in a letter to Leavitt on Tuesday took issue with the administration 's claim that the original bill would have expanded SCHIP eligibility to families earning up to 400 % of the poverty level , or about $ 83,000 .
That eligibility limit was requested by New York state and was rejected by the administration .
Democrats " seethed " when Bush then cited that figure as an example , according to The Hill .
In his letter , Dingell asked Leavitt to highlight the passage of the vetoed bill that the administration claims would extend eligibility to 400 % of the poverty level .
Dingell also disputed the claim that the cigarette tax would unfairly impact lower - income residents , citing government data finding that 60 % of adult smokers have incomes above 200 % of the poverty level ( The Hill , 10/24 ) .
The problem for the GOP is that an expedited vote gives them less time to lie about what 's in the bill .

The long - eared jerboa , a tiny nocturnal mammal that is dwarfed by its enormous ears , can be found in deserts in Mongolia and China .
Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) scientist Jonathan Baillie said the footage was helping researchers to learn more about the mysterious animal .
The species is classified as endangered on the IUCN Red list .
These creatures hop just like a kangaroo ; it is amazing to watch
Dr Jonathan Baillie , ZSL
The unusual animals were filmed in the Gobi desert during an expedition led by Dr Baillie .
Until now , the creatures had proven extremely difficult to study , thanks to their minuscule size , nocturnal nature and the harsh desert environment that they inhabit .
Big ears
Dr Baillie told BBC
News that he was " ecstatic " to have tracked down the jerboas .
" These creatures hop just like a kangaroo ; it is amazing to watch .
Little hairs on their feet , almost like snow shoes , allow them to jump along the sand , " he explained .
" And in terms of mammals , they have one of the biggest ear - to - body ratios out there . "
The footage revealed that the creatures spent daylight hours in underground tunnels beneath the sand , and that their diet was mostly made up of insects .
" The long - eared jerboa is a bit like the Mickey Mouse of the desert , cute and comic in equal measure , " Dr Baillie said .
By setting pitfall traps , the researchers were also able to look at the rodents close - up and to begin to estimate their population .
Dr Baillie added that although there was still much to learn about the rare rodent , it was already believed to be under threat from habitat disturbance .
" We travelled to the Gobi to find out about the animal 's status and learn more about it so we can develop a thorough long - term action plan . "
Desert bounties
The expedition formed part of ZSL's Edge programme , which focuses its efforts on conservation plans for animals that are both endangered and evolutionarily distinctive .
The long - eared jerboa is one of 10 species that the programme is looking at this year .
" These amazing , remarkable creatures are on the verge of extinction and we know almost nothing about them , " warned Dr Baillie .
He added that it was important not to overlook desert habitats in conservation .
" Everyone thinks the desert is a totally desolate area , void of biodiversity , and often when conservation planning is done , deserts are overlooked .
" But there are some remarkable species in the desert , so we really need to start paying attention to this environment . "
An Edge scientist has now been appointed to further study the species .

If I have offended any Croatians , they have my deepest apologies
Singer Tony Henry
Tony Henry belted out a version of the Croat anthem before the 80,000 crowd , but made a blunder at the end .
He should have sung ' Mila kuda si planina ' ( which roughly means ' You know my dear how we love your mountains ' ) .
But he instead sang ' Mila kura si planina ' which can be interpreted as ' My dear , my penis is a mountain ' .
Now Henry could be one of the few Englishmen at the Euro 2008 finals in Austria and Switzerland as Croatian fans adopt him as a lucky omen .
They believe his mistake relaxed their chuckling players , who scored an early goal in the 3 - 2 win that put Croatia top of the group and knocked out England .
The singer , who hails from St Albans in Hertfordshire but now lives in Inverness , Scotland , has performed at stadiums around the world .
He was once known as the Voice of Arsenal after Gunners fans were impressed with his rendition of Abide with Me before the FA Cup final in 2003 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff .
Henry came unstuck when he sang Lijepa Nasa Domovino ( Our Beautiful Homeland ) at a rain - swept Wembley on Wednesday night .
" I can't even defend myself at the end of the day .
It was apparently the last line on the second verse which I made the mistake on , " he told BBC Radio 5 Live .
" Coming to Wembley and the stadium , it must have got to me , is all I can say .
" It was the last thing that I would intentionally do , and all I can say is if I have offended any Croatians , then they have my deepest apologies . "
The Croatians have invited him to sing at Euro 2008
Henry 's agent Douglas Gillespie
" I can't take the blame for that .
The last thing I would do is brag about my parts like that - especially to make it so public , " said Henry .
BBC TV presenter Adrian Chiles , whose mother is Croatian , acknowledged the language could pose problems .
" As a speaker of poor Croatian , I have a proud record of getting things calamitously wrong , " said the Match of the Day 2 host .
" My personal best was telling a campsite owner that I had a small rat ( mali stakor ) rather than small tent ( mali shator ) .
However , Tony 's put all my lifetime 's efforts into the shade now . "
Zeljka Tomljenovic , secretary of the British - Croatian Society , added : " I do n't envy the guy at all because the pronunciation is so difficult .
" He had a big challenge , to sing the national anthem in a language he knows , I assume , nothing about . "
Henry 's agent Douglas Gillespie said it was a genuine mistake , but admitted the publicity could boost his career .
" He 's been given the lyrics correctly , but he has enough trouble with English , never mind Croatian , " joked Gillespie .
" There were 80,000 people in the crowd and millions of people watching .
It was just the pressure of the moment .
" He did sing it very well and made a very , very small mistake for someone doing his best and singing in a language that is alien to him .
If you 've ever tried to speak Croatian , it 's very difficult .
" The Croatians think it 's great , and they 've invited him to come over and sing at Euro 2008 , and asked if he will be their mascot . "
With the Iowa caucus fast approaching , the candidates are getting less shy about flinging a little mud .
Take this jab from Barack Obama , for example : “ I think the fact of the matter is that Sen .
Clinton is claiming basically the entire eight years of the Clinton presidency as her own , except for the stuff that did n’t work out , in which case she says she has nothing to do with it . … “
( via Political Wire )
ABC News :
Last week , Clinton — apparently feeling the heat — took one of her sharpest jabs yet at Obama , mocking his claim that his childhood years in Indonesia provide him with unique insight into foreign affairs .
“ Now voters will judge whether living in a foreign country at the age of 10 prepares one to face the big , complex international challenges the next president will face , ” Clinton said .
Obama fired back in an interview with “ Nightline ” co-anchor Terry Moran : “ You know , we must be doing pretty well in Iowa .
She was n’t paying much attention to what I said before then . ”
And then , Obama went out of his way to belittle Clinton ’s experience as first lady .
“ I think the fact of the matter is that Sen .
Clinton is claiming basically the entire eight years of the Clinton presidency as her own , except for the stuff that did n’t work out , in which case she says she has nothing to do with it , ” Obama said , and added , referring to his relationship with his wife , Michelle , “ There is no doubt that Bill Clinton had faith in her and consulted with her on issues , in the same way that I would consult with Michelle , if there were issues . …
On the other hand , I do n’t think Michelle would claim that she is the best qualified person to be a United States senator by virtue of me talking to her on occasion about the work I ’ve done . ”
With this line of attack , Obama is openly calling Clinton out on one of the basic arguments of her candidacy and her career — that her experience at Bill Clinton ’s side in the White House and before make her the most qualified person in the race .

You are in a small underground chamber , no bigger than a prison cell .
The door is locked and the lights are switched out .
It is not just dark ; it 's pitch black .
In these conditions , it would be impossible to see even the faintest hint of your hand were it inches from your eyes .
And the silence is all - encompassing .
The only noise you can hear is the sound of your own breathing . . . in and out , in and out .
The sense of isolation is not just eerie , it 's as if you had been cast into the furthest reaches of space , or into the deepest subterranean cavern .
Now imagine staying in these conditions for hours on end .
With no way to tell whether it was night or day , would you pass the time asleep ?
Or , if awake , how would you stay alert in the absence of a single sight , sound or stimulus ?
Could any human , in fact , endure such total sensory deprivation without losing their sanity ?
That was what British scientists sought to discover in one of the most extreme and controversial experiments to be conducted on the human mind .
They put a group of six volunteers into a total isolation chamber , constructed in a former nuclear bunker in Hertfordshire , to monitor the effects it would have on their mind and physical health over 48 hours .
The results , to be shown on a BBC2 documentary tonight , are intriguing .
But this was not just a reality show stunt .
The researchers involved hoped to shed new light on the validity of statements given by terror suspects who have been held in extreme conditions in camps such as Guantanamo Bay .
" It is important to look at the impact of sensory deprivation because of the number of places around the world where it is used as a weapon or to aid interrogation , " says Professor Steven Robbins , who oversaw the experiments and is one of the Britain 's leading experts on the effects of psychological torture .
" We know that stimulating the brain helps increase connections in the brain that speeds up information processing , but we wanted to find out if the reverse occurs . "
The risks were considerable .
Similar experiments carried out in the Fifties by Canadian psychologist Professor Donald Hebb had to be abandoned after volunteers were unable to endure the conditions for more than 48 hours .
Scroll down for more ...
One subject described the sensory deprivation as being " as bad as anything Hitler had ever done to any of his victims " .
Afterwards ,
Hebb reported that the " very identity " of his subjects had begun to disintegrate within two days .
That is why sensory deprivation is still used as a means of extracting information from prisoners , though human rights campaigners claim it is inhumane and an unreliable technique .
So , who would be brave , or foolish , enough to undergo a similar ordeal voluntarily ?
Step forward comedian Adam Bloom , 37 , one of the six human guinea pigs who agreed to undergo solitary confinement in the bunker , and have the effects on his brain monitored for the TV documentary .
For two days and two nights , he sat in total darkness and silence , while the researchers were able to observe his behaviour using night - vision cameras .
As with real - life prisoners of war , his only comfort was an occasional meal brought to him by his " captors " .
" I'm a very busy person , with a mind that is always racing with thoughts and ideas , " says Bloom .
" My job involves coming up with new jokes all the time and I work by constantly observing my surroundings for anything that I could use on stage .
" I reckoned 48 hours was n't that long and I was sure I could cope . "
So what happened when the door was slammed shut ?
" I spent the first half an hour in the bunker talking , singing and making jokes , but that quickly got boring .
So , I took to sitting on my bed , staring in front of me .
" My mind filled up with thoughts of my life outside , and I started to worry about my fiancÈe and family .
What if something happened to them while I 'm in here ?
Would anyone let me know ?
It did n't take me long to feel more anxious that I usually would . "
Scroll down for more ...
Within a few hours of entering the bunker , Bloom fell asleep .
But when he woke up , he realised that coping with sensory deprivation was going to be far tougher than he'd imagined .
" In the absence of a watch or sunlight , I 'd totally lost track of time , " he says .
" I dozed on and off for what I thought was a few hours , but when I woke up I had no idea whether it was day or night .
It was really unnerving .
" Even eating the meals I was handed did n't help me reset my body clock .
I felt horrendously bored , and completely out of touch with everything . "
Eighteen hours into the experiment , Bloom began to get increasingly paranoid .
" At one point , I started singing and then I burst into tears , " he says .
" I can't remember the last time I cried , and I felt my emotions were beginning to run out of control . "
" Then , I found myself suspecting the whole experiment was a trick .
How did I know who these people really were ?
What if they 'd gone home and I was trapped down there for ever ?
" I knew I was being ridiculous , because setting up the experiment had taken months and involved lengthy meetings and e-mails , but I could n't shake the sense of paranoia . "
By the time he had been in the bunker for 24 hours , Bloom 's mental alertness was slowing down .
" Without light , it was almost impossible to stimulate myself and my brain felt as though it was going to sleep , " he says .
But his real troubles came 30 hours into the experiment .
By then , he had taken to pacing the room endlessly in a bid to keep himself occupied .
" This behaviour is often seen in animals , as well as people , when they are kept in confinement , " says Professor Robbins .

But after 40 hours , events took a more sinister turn .
Bloom began to hallucinate : he saw a pile of 500 oyster shells .
" I could see the pearly sheen on the oyster shells as clear as day , " he says .
Bloom says : " Then I felt as though the room was taking off from underneath me .
For the first time , I realised that the lack of stimulation was driving me close to insanity .
" I felt nothing but numbness , as though I was losing the will to live .
" I considered pulling out , but I told myself that at least I could comfort myself with the thought that my ordeal was soon going to be over .
Some prisoners have had to endure these conditions for months , or even years . "
Bloom was released after 48 hours to undergo psychological tests .
The results were compared with identical tests he had carried out before his incarceration , and showed a clear impairment of his ability to process information , a reduction in memory and an increase in suggestibility .
How people 's brains are affected by a short spell of isolation is not fully understood , but Professor Robbins believes that dendrites - which connect nerve cells and help them to communicate - may lose some of their efficacy if not continually stimulated .
But for Bloom , there was an unexpected outcome .
" When we 'd arrived at the bunker before the experiment , I had thought it was all rather bleak , " he says .
" The exterior was all overgrown and the bunker was an eyesore .
But when I left after 48 hours , I noticed how green the grass was , how blue the sky was and hundreds of yellow buttercups .
" It was staggeringly beautiful .
Even washing my hands under the tap was amazing .
" I made a vow that I would never not notice and appreciate my surroundings again .
" I 'm glad I did it , but no sum of money would convince me to go through 48 hours on my own again .
It was the greatest endurance test of my life . "
Labour rebels are calling for a referendum on the treaty
Starting at least 15 days of debate over the next month , Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the treaty was " good for Britain and good for Europe " .
He came under fire from some Labour backbenchers , and the Tories said the government was " brazenly abrogating " its promise to hold a referendum .
At the end of a rowdy five - hour debate a motion to approve the bill in principle won by 362 votes to 224 .
But the European Union ( Amendment ) Bill will be debated line - by - line over the coming weeks .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown signed the Lisbon Treaty in December but Parliament must ratify it .
It was designed to replace the EU Constitution , which was abandoned in 2005 , but on which Labour had promised a referendum - the government says a referendum is not needed for the new treaty .
But 18 Labour and four nationalist MPs had signed an amendment calling for a referendum on the document , that was not subject to a vote on Monday as the Commons speaker decided against calling it .
Opening the debate earlier , Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the Lisbon Treaty was " fundamentally different " from the failed constitution .
Super state ' myth '
" The government is convinced that Britain 's membership of and full engagement with the EU is good for Britain and good for Europe , " he told MPs .
" We believe this treaty is good for Britain and good for Europe . "
He warned against the Conservative " myth " of a European super state and said the party 's policies would lead to " a second decade of institutional inertia that diverts Europe from the real issues that face it " .
An EU of 27 member states and growing can't operate on the same basis that only just served the needs of an EU of 15 states
Edward Davey
Lib Dems
What are the arguments ?
But shadow foreign secretary William Hague said the treaty " brings about fundamental change " in the EU 's institutional structure , changes which the government " now pretend are matters of little importance about which the people of this country need not be troubled . "
Labour MPs Frank Field , Gwyneth Dunwoody and Gisela Stuart were among those who stood up to question whether the treaty was fundamentally different from the constitution .
' Goebbels ' rant '
But for the Liberal Democrats Edward Davey said : " An EU of 27 member states and growing can't operate on the same basis that only just served the needs of an EU of 15 states .
" Arguments for trimming the bureaucracy and making the institutions less cumbersome ought to be self - evident . "
Mr Brown signed the treaty hours after the official ceremony in December
During the lively debate , Tory MP Andrew Robathan was told to retract comments that the foreign secretary 's speech was " a rant of propaganda that would be worthy of Goebbels " - Mr Miliband said the comments were " not worthy " of him .
The Tories and some Labour MPs are opposing the bill , but the Lib Dems , who support a referendum on the wider issue of Britain 's EU membership , will vote in favour of it .
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " We would vote against a referendum on the treaty and vote in accordance with our long - held position that the real referendum which needs to be had is whether we stay in the European Union or not . "
Ministers argue that no referendum is needed as the treaty merely amends the EU 's existing constitution , rather than overwriting it - as the failed constitution would have done .
Europe Minister Jim Murphy has dismissed claims that up to 100 Labour MPs are unhappy with the refusal to hold a public vote .
On Sunday the Commons foreign affairs committee said parts of the Lisbon Treaty were no different from the abandoned EU Constitution , and accused the government of publicly downplaying the importance of some new EU institutions and roles .
Cryptology ePrint Archive : Report 2007 /419
We examined the binary code of a distribution of Windows 2000 , which is still the second most popular operating system after Windows XP .
( This investigation was done without any help from Microsoft . )
We reconstructed , for the first time , the algorithm used by the pseudo - random number generator ( namely , the function CryptGenRandom ) .
We analyzed the security of the algorithm and found a non-trivial attack : given the internal state of the generator , the previous state can be computed in $ O ( 2 ^ { 23} ) $ work ( this is an attack on the forward - security of the generator , an $ O ( 1 ) $ attack on backward security is trivial ) .
The attack on forward - security demonstrates that the design of the generator is flawed , since it is well known how to prevent such attacks .
We also analyzed the way in which the generator is run by the operating system , and found that it amplifies the effect of the attacks :
The generator is run in user mode rather than in kernel mode , and therefore it is easy to access its state even without administrator privileges .
The initial values of part of the state of the generator are not set explicitly , but rather are defined by whatever values are present on the stack when the generator is called .
Furthermore , each process runs a different copy of the generator , and the state of the generator is refreshed with system generated entropy only after generating 128 KBytes of output for the process running it .
The result of combining this observation with our attack is that learning a single state may reveal 128 Kbytes of the past and future output of the generator .
The implication of these findings is that a buffer overflow attack or a similar attack can be used to learn a single state of the generator , which can then be used to predict all random values , such as SSL keys , used by a process in all its past and future operation .
This attack is more severe and more efficient than known attacks , in which an attacker can only learn SSL keys if it is controlling the attacked machine at the time the keys are used .
That ’s why the F.B.I. ’s profilers have always tried to supplement the basic outlines of the organized / disorganized system with telling details — something that lets the police zero in on a suspect .
In the early eighties , Douglas gave a presentation to a roomful of police officers and F.B.I. agents in Marin County about the Trailside Killer , who was murdering female hikers in the hills north of San Francisco .
In Douglas ’s view , the killer was a classic “ disorganized ” offender — a blitz attacker , white , early to mid-thirties , blue collar , probably with “ a history of bed - wetting , fire - starting , and cruelty to animals . ”
Then he went back to how asocial the killer seemed .
Why did all the killings take place in heavily wooded areas , miles from the road ?
Douglas reasoned that the killer required such seclusion because he had some condition that he was deeply self - conscious about .
Was it something physical , like a missing limb ?
But then how could he hike miles into the woods and physically overpower his victims ?
Finally , it came to him : “ ‘ Another thing , ’ I added after a pregnant pause , ‘ the killer will have a speech impediment . ’ ”
And so he did .
Now , that ’s a useful detail .
Or is it ?
Douglas then tells us that he pegged the offender ’s age as early thirties , and he turned out to be fifty .
Detectives use profiles to narrow down the range of suspects .
It does n’t do any good to get a specific detail right if you get general details wrong .
In the case of Derrick Todd Lee , the Baton Rouge serial killer , the F.B.I. profile described the offender as a white male blue - collar worker , between twenty - five and thirty - five years old , who “ wants to be seen as someone who is attractive and appealing to women . ”
The profile went on , “ However , his level of sophistication in interacting with women , especially women who are above him in the social strata , is low .
Any contact he has had with women he has found attractive would be described by these women as ‘ awkward . ’ ” The F.B.I. was right about the killer being a blue - collar male between twenty - five and thirty - five .
But Lee turned out to be charming and outgoing , the sort to put on a cowboy hat and snakeskin boots and head for the bars .
He was an extrovert with a number of girlfriends and a reputation as a ladies ’ man .
And he was n’t white .
He was black .
A profile is n’t a test , where you pass if you get most of the answers right .
It ’s a portrait , and all the details have to cohere in some way if the image is to be helpful .
In the mid-nineties , the British Home Office analyzed a hundred and eighty - four crimes , to see how many times profiles led to the arrest of a criminal .
The profile worked in five of those cases .
That ’s just 2.7 per cent , which makes sense if you consider the position of the detective on the receiving end of a profiler ’s list of conjectures .
Do you believe the stuttering part ?
Or do you believe the thirty - year - old part ?
Or do you throw up your hands in frustration ?
There is a deeper problem with F.B.I. profiling .
Douglas and Ressler did n’t interview a representative sample of serial killers to come up with their typology .
They talked to whoever happened to be in the neighborhood .
Nor did they interview their subjects according to a standardized protocol .
They just sat down and chatted , which is n’t a particularly firm foundation for a psychological system .
So you might wonder whether serial killers can really be categorized by their level of organization .
Not long ago , a group of psychologists at the University of Liverpool decided to test the F.B.I. ’s assumptions .
First , they made a list of crime - scene characteristics generally considered to show organization : perhaps the victim was alive during the sex acts , or the body was posed in a certain way , or the murder weapon was missing , or the body was concealed , or torture and restraints were involved .
Then they made a list of characteristics showing disorganization : perhaps the victim was beaten , the body was left in an isolated spot , the victim ’s belongings were scattered , or the murder weapon was improvised .
If the F.B.I. was right , they reasoned , the crime - scene details on each of those two lists should “ co-occur ” — that is , if you see one or more organized traits in a crime , there should be a reasonably high probability of seeing other organized traits .
When they looked at a sample of a hundred serial crimes , however , they could n’t find any support for the F.B.I. ’s distinction .
Crimes do n’t fall into one camp or the other .
It turns out that they ’re almost always a mixture of a few key organized traits and a random array of disorganized traits .
Laurence Alison , one of the leaders of the Liverpool group and the author of “ The Forensic Psychologist ’s Casebook , ” told me , “ The whole business is a lot more complicated than the F.B.I. imagines . ”
Alison and another of his colleagues also looked at homology .
If Douglas was right , then a certain kind of crime should correspond to a certain kind of criminal .
So the Liverpool group selected a hundred stranger rapes in the United Kingdom , classifying them according to twenty - eight variables , such as whether a disguise was worn , whether compliments were given , whether there was binding , gagging , or blindfolding , whether there was apologizing or the theft of personal property , and so on .
They then looked at whether the patterns in the crimes corresponded to attributes of the criminals — like age , type of employment , ethnicity , level of education , marital status , number of prior convictions , type of prior convictions , and drug use .
Were rapists who bind , gag , and blindfold more like one another than they were like rapists who , say , compliment and apologize ?
The answer is no — not even slightly .
“ The fact is that different offenders can exhibit the same behaviors for completely different reasons , ” Brent Turvey , a forensic scientist who has been highly critical of the F.B.I. ’s approach , says .
“ You ’ve got a rapist who attacks a woman in the park and pulls her shirt up over her face .
Why ?
What does that mean ?
There are ten different things it could mean .
It could mean he does n’t want to see her .
It could mean he does n’t want her to see him .
It could mean he wants to see her breasts , he wants to imagine someone else , he wants to incapacitate her arms — all of those are possibilities .
You ca n’t just look at one behavior in isolation . ”
A few years ago , Alison went back to the case of the teacher who was murdered on the roof of her building in the Bronx .
He wanted to know why , if the F.B.I. ’s approach to criminal profiling was based on such simplistic psychology , it continues to have such a sterling reputation .
The answer , he suspected , lay in the way the profiles were written , and , sure enough , when he broke down the rooftop - killer analysis , sentence by sentence , he found that it was so full of unverifiable and contradictory and ambiguous language that it could support virtually any interpretation .
Astrologers and psychics have known these tricks for years .
The magician Ian Rowland , in his classic “ The Full Facts Book of Cold Reading , ” itemizes them one by one , in what could easily serve as a manual for the beginner profiler .
First is the Rainbow Ruse — the “ statement which credits the client with both a personality trait and its opposite . ”
( “ I would say that on the whole you can be rather a quiet , self effacing type , but when the circumstances are right , you can be quite the life and soul of the party if the mood strikes you . ” )
The Jacques Statement , named for the character in “ As You Like It ” who gives the Seven Ages of Man speech , tailors the prediction to the age of the subject .
To someone in his late thirties or early forties , for example , the psychic says , “ If you are honest about it , you often get to wondering what happened to all those dreams you had when you were younger . ”
There is the Barnum Statement , the assertion so general that anyone would agree , and the Fuzzy Fact , the seemingly factual statement couched in a way that “ leaves plenty of scope to be developed into something more specific . ”
( “ I can see a connection with Europe , possibly Britain , or it could be the warmer , Mediterranean part ? ” )
And that ’s only the start : there is the Greener Grass technique , the Diverted Question , the Russian Doll , Sugar Lumps , not to mention Forking and the Good Chance Guess — all of which , when put together in skillful combination , can convince even the most skeptical observer that he or she is in the presence of real insight .
Ruling in a case of four Britons who formerly were detainees at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , the D.C. Circuit Court decided Friday that the prisoners have no right to sue top Pentagon officials and military officers for allegedly torturing them and defiling their religious beliefs while they were held at the military prison .
The Court applied several different legal theories in rejecting all of the claims of abuse and arbitrary imprisonment , but the end result was that there was nothing left of the detainees ’ legal challenge .
In a second ruling Friday affecting individuals captured during the “ war on terrorism , ” the Circuit Court decided that the Pentagon has no legal duty to release to the public the opinions or advice that outsiders gave to the government on the creation of “ military commissions ” to try war crimes charges against detainees .
Both of the rulings — Rasul , et al. , v. Myers , et al. ( Circuit docket 06-5209 ) rejecting the torture and abuse claims , and National Institute of Military Justice v. Department of Defense ( 06 - 5242 ) — can be found on the opinions page of the D.C. Circuit under Friday ’s date .
In what appears to be the first federal appeals court decision on the legality of harsh interrogation techniques used by U.S. agents on terrorism suspects , the Circuit Court ruled that torture and abuse that was used while individuals were in detention in a military prison as part of interrogations to gather intelligence or information were “ the type of conduct the defendants were employed to engage in … .
The alleged tortious conduct was incidental to the defendants ’ legitimate employment duties ” — that is , running a military prison and conducting interrogations there .
“ It was foreseeable that conduct that would ordinarily be indisputably ‘ seriously criminal ’ would be implemented by military officials responsible for detaining and interrogating suspected enemy combatants , ” Circuit Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson wrote in the Court ’s main opinion , joined in by Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph and in most parts as well as the result by Circuit Judge Janice Rogers Brown .
Because such conduct was within the range of duties of top officials who authorized interrogation techniques and officers who carried out those instructions , the Circuit Court said , the detainees could not pursue their challenges in court because they did not first pursue them in administrative proceedings at the Pentagon .
In the one part of the decision with which Judge Brown partially disagreed , the Court ruled that the detainees were not covered by a federal law that protects all “ persons ” against government action that intrudes on their religious freedom .
The four Britons held for two years at Guantanamo had argued that actions by guards at Guantanamo — forced shaving of beards , denying copies of the Koran and prayer mats , throwing a copy of the Koran into a toilet bucket , and harassing prisoners while they were practicing their religion — violated their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .
The Circuit Court majority ruled that the Act did not apply to non-resident aliens at Guantanamo .
Judge Henderson wrote that the Act was to be interpreted by analyzing the constitutional meaning of its language , because it was designed to restore constitutional rights to the free exercise of religion .
Since it had ruled last year , in other detainee cases , that those at Guantanamo have no constitutional rights , they are not covered by RFRA because they are not “ persons ” in the constitutional sense , she wrote .
( The ruling that the detainees have no constitutional rights is now under review by the Supreme Court in two pending cases on detainees ’ legal rights , Boumediene v. Bush , 06 - 1195 , and Al Odah v. U.S. , 06-1196 ) .
The four Britons are Shafiq Rasul , Asif Iqbal , Rhuhel Ahmedand Jamal Al - Harith .
They sued former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , top generals , and several Army colonels or lieutenant colonels .
They contended that Secretary Rumsfeld had approved harsh interrogation techniques for Guantanamo prisoners , leading “ systematic and repeated ” torture at the military prison on the island of Cuba throughout their two years in captivity as lower - ranking military personnel carried out Rumsfeld ’s authorization .
They were released from Guantanamo in March 2004 , and returned to Britain .
They then sued in U.S. courts under the Alien Tort Statute , the Geneva Conventions on treatment of military prisoners , the U.S. Constitution , and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .
U.S. District Judge Ricardo M. Urbina threw out all of the claims except that under the religious freedom law , concluding that those allegations could go forward because the Act did apply to the detainees at Guantanamo because of the scope of U.S. control of the military base and prison there , and because the detainees there were “ persons ” under the Act .
In its ruling Friday , the Circuit Court unanimously upheld all parts of Judge Urbina ’s rejection of detainee claims , but divided 2 - 1 on the rationale for overturning his decision allowing the RFRA claim to proceed .
Here in summary are the specific reasons used by the Circuit Court as it dealt with each claim :
Claim of torture and abuse under Alien Torts Statute ( prolonged arbitrary detention , torture , and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment ) —
These claims are barred by the “ Westfall Act ” ( the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 ) , which is the exclusive source of a remedy for torts by federal officials or employees when they act within the scope of their employment .
The actions here were within the scope of employment or incidental to it , th e Circuit Court ruled .
Before one may pursue a Westfall Act claim , he must first try administrative remedies .
The Court found that the detainees had not done so , and thus their claims failed .
Claimed violations of the Geneva Conventions ( seeking damages for arbitrary detention , torture and abuse ) —
The Circuit Court ruled against those , too , under the same Westfall Act rationale used in rejecting the tort law claims .
Claimed iolations of constitutional rights ( cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment , inhuman and degrading conditions at Guantanamo violated their Fifth Amendment due process rights ) —
The Circuit Court ruled that , since it had held the detainees have no constitutional rights , these claims fall .
Aliens held outside sovereign U.S. territory are not covered by the Constitution , it concluded .
Judge Brown , in separate remarks , said that constitutional claims cannot be brought by those who are being detained and interrogated as “ alleged enemy combatants ” because allowing them to sue for damages against U.S. officials “ may allow our enemies to obstruct the foreign policy of our government . ”
Claimed violations of rights to religious freedom ( interfering with religious practices and beliefs and defiling religious objects ) —
The Circuit Court concluded that the detainees were not “ persons ” entitled to protection under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
Judge Brown disagreed on this point , concluding that the plain meaning of the word “ persons ” in the Act covers the detainees .
“ The majority does not point to a single statute defining ‘ person ’ so narrowly as to excluded nonresident aliens from its ambit , and nothing in RFRA ’s history suggests Congress focused on the term ’s scope here , ” she wrote .
She agreed that the RFRA claim had to fail , though , finding that the sued officials had qualified immunity because they would not have known that the Act covered people like the detainees .
Judge Henderson also wrote the Court ’s opinion rejecting the attempt by a military policy think tank and advocacy group , the National Institute of Military Justice , to gain access to letters , faxes and e-mails that outside advisers — academics and former government officials — sent it to help the government set up military commissions under presidential orders .
The Court majority concluded that these were exempt from compelled disclosure under the Freedom of Information
Act because they were “ intra - agency memorandums or letters ” under the Act ’s Exemption 5 . Senior Circuit Judge Stephen F. Williams joined the opinion , while Circuit Judge David S. Tatel dissenting , arguing that the ruling allows government officials to put beyond public reach “ any document the goernment would find it valuable to keep confidential . ”
WASHINGTON , July 11 — The House on Wednesday approved far - reaching changes in student aid programs , voting to cut $ 19 billion in federal subsidies to student lenders over five years , while increasing grants for needy students and halving interest rates on federally backed loans with the savings .
The bill passed 273 to 149 in a sometimes raucous debate , with 47 Republicans joining Democrats , who took control of Congress this year on promises to help the middle class with the escalating costs of higher education .
The bill marks a stark reversal of fortune for the student loan industry , which for over 10 years had largely enjoyed unflagging support under the Republican majority .
Investigations by Congress , the news media and the New York attorney general bruised the standing of lenders , exposing systems of paying colleges commissions to win business , offering college officials free trips and other perks .
While President Bush opposes some elements of the bill , it is widely expected that a broad overhaul of student aid will become law this year .
Mr. Bush himself has proposed cutting government subsidies to lenders by $ 16 billion .
And the Senate is expected to pass legislation later this month that would reduce these subsidies by $ 18.3 billion , while increasing the maximum Pell grant , the nation ’s major assistance program for low - and middle - income students , more swiftly than the House bill does .
THE murky world of doping in sport may be about to get murkier still .
Having spent decades trying to detect the use of performance - enhancing drugs , officials may soon be confronted with the paradoxical problem of detecting their non-use .
The reason for this paradox is the placebo effect : believing a treatment to be effective is sometimes enough to make it so .
It is what lies at the heart of otherwise scientifically unproven fields such as homeopathy — and also , it must be said , at the heart of a lot of mainstream medicine .
An analysis published a few years ago suggested that perhaps a third of medically approved drugs might be acting as placebos .
And that thought led Fabrizio Benedetti and his colleagues at the University of Turin to wonder if the placebo effect might be important in sport , too .
The answer is that it might .
Every year the World Anti-Doping Agency publishes a list of prohibited substances and methods , divided into those prohibited at all times and those outlawed only during competitions .
Dr Benedetti observed that morphine falls into the second category .
Since it is a painkiller , denying it to athletes in training would be unethical .
It is forbidden during competitions because its painkilling properties would give users an unfair advantage , but the effect is short - lived — unlike , say , that of anabolic steroids that build up muscles .
Killing pain , however , is one of the things that the placebo effect is best at .
In 1999 Dr Benedetti himself showed that someone who is injected with morphine for two days in a row experiences a powerful analgesic response not only on those days but also on the next , if the morphine is replaced by a placebo without his knowledge .
That led Dr Benedetti to wonder if the effect of legally administered pre-competition morphine might , perfectly legally , be carried over into a competition by giving a placebo .
In their new experiment , published this week in the Journal of Neuroscience , he and his colleagues simulated a sporting competition by pitting four teams of ten athletic young men against each other in a pain - endurance test .
With a tourniquet strapped around one forearm , these men had to squeeze a hand - spring exerciser repeatedly until pain forced them to stop .
Their scores , measured by the time they managed to keep going , were averaged over the whole team .
One of the teams received a morphine injection just before training sessions held two weeks and one week before the contest , and an injection of saline solution on the big day , along with the suggestion that it was morphine .
Another received the same regime , but the saline was combined with naloxone , an opiate - blocking drug .
The remaining teams received either no treatment at all , or the placebo on competition day alone .
Members of the team that received morphine followed by a placebo were able to endure significantly more pain during the competition than any of their rivals .
In particular , those injected with naloxone did no better than the other two control groups .
This finding supports the theory that placebos reduce pain by encouraging the brain to produce more natural opiates than usual .
Although hand - spring squeezing is not yet an Olympic sport , it is a good enough surrogate to suggest that these effects might be shown in real competitions , too .
So the question is , how useful would Dr Benedetti's observations be , should they be taken up by an unscrupulous but legalistic coach ?
That depends how cynical athletes really are .
The placebo effect depends on what the recipient believes is happening , so he would have to think he was cheating , even though , strictly , he was n't .
Also , if the practice became widespread , it would be hard to maintain the fiction that the injection on competition day contained the drug .
On the other hand , as Dr Benedetti observes , doctors have been getting away with giving placebos for millennia , and their patients still fall for it .
Perhaps if it were sold to athletes as a form of homeopathy , they would not ask too many awkward questions .

“ The Audit ”
I once got talking to a guy whose job it was to go into a company , sit alongside the Systems Administrator for two weeks , and write a professional audit on his processes and practices .
Naturally the sys admin would be on his best behavior , showing off all the clever things he did to keep the company 's computer network ticking over .
At the end of the two weeks , the sys admin would be fired .
There was never any audit : this was just the method the company used to replace their IT people without disruption , making sure the new guy was trained up and the old guy did n't cause any damage before he left .
Mr Erdogan said the issue was the " first duty " of politicians to solve
Mr Erdogan told the UK's Financial Times the ban was depriving some women of the right to higher education .
The PM's Islamist - rooted AK Party began drafting a new constitution after its landslide election victory in July .
The separation of religion and state enshrined in the current constitution is one of the key issues in the debate .
Separately , US Under - Secretary of State Nicholas Burns has arrived in Turkey for talks .
He is expected to discuss tensions over Iran 's nuclear programme and possible operations against Kurdish rebel forces when he meets Mr Erdogan late on Wednesday .
Symbol
Mr Erdogan told the Financial Times that resolving the headscarf issue was a priority .
" The right to higher education can not be restricted because of what a girl wears , " he said .
The wife of President Abdullah Gul wears a headscarf
" There is no such problem in Western societies , but there is a problem in Turkey and I believe it is the first duty of those in politics to solve this problem . "
Mr Erdogan has been supported by President Abdullah Gul , a member of the AK Party until his election as head of state last month .
Mr Gul told the Milliyet newspaper : " It is much better for [ women who are covered ] to go to university than to stay home and be isolated from social life . "
The wives and daughters of both men wear the headscarf .
Turkey 's secularist forces , including military and judicial leaders , oppose any moves they see as eroding the nation 's secular system .
The headscarf has become a symbol of the threat to the continued separation of state governance and religion .
The university ban on headscarves was upheld in 2005 in the European Court of Human Rights , which said it might be needed to safeguard the secular order .
Mr Erdogan has always said his government will respect the separation .
Summer of turmoil
The current constitution evolved from the 1980 military coup and many politicians want to redraw it to bring it more into line with current standards of democracy .
" We want a constitution that is going to provide and protect a state that is a democratic , secular , social state of law , " Mr Erdogan told the Financial Times .
Turkey endured a summer of political turmoil with secularist politicians organising mass demonstrations to try to block Mr Gul 's presidential bid .
The stand - off triggered the snap elections in July .
It ’s been eight years now .
Eight long years .
Sure , initially I was glad when China toppled the Bush regime and executed the “ retarded tyrant ” as I love to call him .
It was n’t that bad at the start , but as time wore on and I realized they were n’t leaving , it started to gnaw at me .
Bush declared martial law in June of 2008 after initiating a nuclear attack on Iran .
Martial law became “ necessary ” in the chaos surrounding the oil shock that followed the Iranian conflict .
People had said he ’d been planning the Iran move for a while , but the media kept pointing out how much of a threat Iran was so I guess we needed to act .
He did n’t have any conventional forces or weaponry available because he ’d over - extended our reach in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Without conventional options , he went nuclear .
The events that followed received sporadic and muddled coverage and what happened is still disputed today .
All I know for sure is that oil become scarce in a real hurry .
China removed the Yuan / dollar peg , called in its massive store of US Treasury bonds and sent the greenback into freefall .
Most Americans did n’t realize that China was trading more with Europe than the US , and while the move stung China , it crippled the US .
They then started paying the Saudis and other Persian Gulf countries in Yuan , the new global currency .
The greenback was shunned like a redheaded stepchild .
The same thing worked on Venezuela and Mexico and their oil output was redirected to China ’s burgeoning economy .
It is rumored that the Chinese then , using covert ops , disabled much of the Canadian oil infrastructure and America was oil dry within weeks .
It turned out that the American government ’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve did n’t hold the 720,000,000 barrels that the government claimed .
Everything ground to a halt .
So Bush declared martial law soon after and China went on the offensive .
Ostensibly , the Chinese invaded to “ remove a tyrant that the rest of the world considers an unnacceptable risk ” .
Of course the US military went nuclear with the Chinese but did n’t realize that the 15 + satellite launches a year the Chinese had been grinding out were all part of an ICBM defense system .
None of the nukes got through .
It was over quickly .
The famed military - industrial complex of the US was an amazing powerhouse .
It ’s just that without oil , the powerhouse did n’t have all that much power .
Unlike previous wars where the might of American production pushed us over the top militarily , production sputtered to a stop and this war was lost without so much as a whimper .
The Chinese instituted some changes .
They said that the only truly free society was one in which everyone worked for the common good .
They imposed their political system on us without asking .
I think they believe they ’re doing us a favor .
One of the biggest issues before the media was nationialized and put under government control was the checkpoints the Chinese introduced .
There are sickeningly frequent reports of US citizens being killed at these checkpoints throughout the country .
Apparently what happens is that a carload of civilians gets shouted at ( in Chinese ) to slow down or stop .
Not understanding , they fail to comply .
Result : bullet riddled civilians with confused and terrified looks on their faces .
Just last week the Chinese killed a busload of 17 civilians .
Most of them were school children on a class trip .
There were three teachers too .
While the Chinese have deployed much of their national army on US soil , they ’ve also used a lot of civilian contractors to enforce curfews and protect foreign diplomats .
These contractors and the company they work for ( Redwater ) are beyond the reach of the US judicial system .
The Chinese have given them immunity for their actions on US soil and the company spirits away any individuals accused of wrongdoing before an investigation can get underway , even if there was a point to conducting one .
The eight years they ’ve been here on US soil have produced some heartbreaking statistics .
Over 4,500,000 “ excess deaths ” .
I like that .
Excess deaths .
Basically , that ’s people either killed violently during uprisings ( ruthlessly crushed by our benevolent occupiers ) or those that have died since the Chinese destroyed many of our factories , roads and infrastructure .
Of those 4,500,000 , about 1,800,000 have been violent or combat related deaths of Americans .
Canada , in a stunning act of humanitarianism has opened its borders to refugees and 12,000,000 Americans have fled our home to reside with our now beloved northern neighbors .
Initially , people seemed to accept the fact that we needed help getting rid of Bush ’s dictatorship .
Lately , I think people have come to understand that the Chinese are really here for our natural resources .
In the fusion driven , post - oil world , apparently American soil contains a lot of the minerals that drive the fusion process .
I do n’t really understand it but apparently the largest supply of “ whatever it is ” ( some sort of helium ? ) was found in Iowa .
The Chinese have set up camp there and apparently have n’t left .
They can talk all they want about giving us our freedom but with 4,500,000 dead , 21,000,000 Americans who ’ve fled and are now living as refugees elsewhere ( 12,000,000 in Canada alone ) and another 1,100,000 fleeing each month , I gotta tell ya , it does n’t feel all that free .
There is hope however , apparently the Chairman of the Chinese Communist party and thus the leader of China is frail .
It ’s said that health - wise he ’s on his last legs .
All we can do is hope that China ’s next leader will curtail China ’s empire .
China has to realize the futility of trying to police the world .
China ’s political , social and moral systems are great … for China , but to impose them elsewhere at the barrel of a gun is wrong .
I just hope the Chinese leadership realizes that .
I ’d say that I hope the Chinese people realize it but we all know that the Chinese do n’t have any say in how their country is run or what wars it wages .
It certainly feels a bit strange to have our future depend on the whims of political leaders far away , but that ’s our new reality .
It ’s hard for me to get too excited about the possibility of Chinese regime change .
Regardless of what happens , the Chinese can’t give me my sons back .
I wo n’t ever hold them again or see their cheeky smiles .
So while other people hope that confusing political changes in foreign lands will help us , I apply slightly more direct methods .
Yes , I know they call me a terrorist and an insurgent .
I like to think of myself as a freedom fighter .
If someone invaded your country and killed your people , I ’d like to think you ’d fight too .
I do n’t expect to win but if I do n’t fight , if we do n’t fight , then all Americans lose .

IMEC
ELECTRONIC circuits that stretch like elastic bands or expand like balloons sound not only fanciful but also rather impractical .
Such circuits are usually made from rigid materials and are certainly not expected to bend and stretch like new - year dieters in a gym during the first week of January .
Yet a little flexibility could be useful , especially in those devices that need to remain in contact with their user 's skin : bandages , body implants and health monitors , for example .
Skin - like electronics would also be valuable for robots .
IMEC , a Belgian research group , has recently made a start on this idea by building tiny electric wires that can stretch to twice their length without breaking .
IMEC produced its stretchy wires by encapsulating tracks of gold that look like meandering rivers within an elastic silicone film .
The arrangement works like a flat spring : when it is stretched the spring opens up without the wires breaking .
And just in case a break does happen , neighbouring tracks are arranged in sets of four that are cross-connected at regular intervals so that the current can switch to an unbroken track .
IMEC 's stretchy circuits can be built with the standard techniques used to make printed - circuit boards .
To demonstrate that this arrangement works , the firm has made a prototype stretchable digital watch .
It is not completely there ; its active ( and rigid ) electronics are contained in islands within the stretchy silicone material .
Nevertheless Jan Vanfleteren , who is leading the project , hopes that future versions will be made fully flexible by using an ultra - thin chip - packaging technology that IMEC is developing .
IMEC 's work is part of a collaborative project , called STELLA ( Stretchable Electronics for Large Area Applications ) , which numbers Philips , a Dutch electronics giant , and Urgo , a French producer of sticking plasters and bandages , among its participants .
But this is not the only group interested in the field .
Nokia , for example , is collaborating with Stéphanie Lacour , of the University of Cambridge 's Nanoscience Centre , to develop a way of depositing gold films onto elastomers ( elastic polymers ) , so that such films become stretchy as well as bendable .
Normally , a gold film will fracture if stretched by as little as 1 - 2 % of its original length .
Dr Lacour 's stretchy metal film , however , contains an array of tiny Y - shaped cracks .
When it is pulled , the cracks open up and the film remains intact .
If silicon chips a few hundred microns across were embedded in the elastomer as well , the film should provide a reliable way of wiring them together to produce a useful electronic device .
Such “ stretchable electronic skin ” , as Nokia dubs it , is intended , initially , to provide a touch - sensitive way of talking to machines .
If it were turned into a screen , stabbing your finger harder on an icon on that screen could make something happen faster .
Tapani Ryhänen , Nokia 's head of strategic research , suggests that stretchable devices , worn on the body , could be used to detect and transmit information about the wearer , such as to measure emotional states .
And what about an entire body suit made from flexible electronics and sensors ?
That would be the ultimate Nintendo Wii game controller .
Nicotine contained in tobacco is highly addictive and tobacco use is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases , over 20 different types or subtypes of cancer , and many other debilitating health conditions .
Every year , more than 8 million people die from tobacco use .
Most tobacco - related deaths occur in low - and middle - income countries , which are often targets of intensive tobacco industry interference and marketing .
Tobacco can also be deadly for non-smokers .
Second - hand smoke exposure has also been implicated in adverse health outcomes , causing 1.2 million deaths annually .
Nearly half of all children breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke and 65 000 children die each year due to illnesses related to second - hand smoke .
Smoking while pregnant can lead to several life - long health conditions for babies .
Heated tobacco products ( HTPs ) contain tobacco and expose users to toxic emissions , many of which cause cancer and are harmful to health .
Electronic nicotine delivery systems ( ENDS ) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems ( ENNDS ) , commonly known as e-cigarettes , do not contain tobacco and may or may not contain nicotine , but are harmful to health and undoubtedly unsafe .
However , it is too early to provide a clear answer on the long - term impact of HTPs and / or e-cigarette use .
UnitedHealth had its own analyst day in New York yesterday -- and the company told investors that it lost 315,000 customers this year because of poor customer service , the AP reports .

As I 've confessed in the past , I 'm a sucker for word puzzles .
My recent post on a Will Shortz puzzle from NPR Morning Edition ended up provoking a surprising amount of comment , much of it in the vein of " Watch me solve it better , faster , and with more style in the superior language XXX . "
I certainly enjoyed watching other people solve the problem , and found their solutions instructive .
As the XP crowd has figured out , we programmers spend too much time working on our own problems and not enough time watching how other people work .
There 's a lot to learn , both good and bad , from getting a peek inside another person 's head .
Out of the Blue
Which brings me to the puzzle at the center of this article .
In what at first seemed to be an incident completely unrelated to word play , I had a pleasant e-mail exchange with Beth Katz , who teaches a Data Structures class at Millersville University .
I happened to look at Beth 's current homework assignment for her class , and you can imagine my reaction when I saw the problem she had posted for her class :
We define word reduction as removing a single letter from a word while leaving the remaining letters in their original order so that the resulting sequence of characters is also a word .
A good word can be reduced step - by - step until all that is left is a or i .
Your program will answer the question : what is the biggest word in the given dictionary that can be reduced ?
Beth gave a short example of a good word -- planets :
planets
plants
pants
pant
ant
an
a
As you can see , you can remove one letter at a time , and each time you are left with a valid word one character shorter .
This makes for an interesting problem indeed .
I 've read that the average English speaker has a vocabulary of perhaps 15,000 to 20,000 words , but many reasonable word lists have upwards of 100,000 English words .
How many of these words qualify as good words ?
As I discussed in the previous word puzzle article , the highly evolved pattern matching facility in the human mind is often pretty good at solving these problems , and I think this is the case ( in a limited way ) for this particular problem .
If I give you a word ( like planets ) above , I think you'd be able to find a possible reduction path quickly , subject to the limitations of your own vocabulary .
But the human mind is not so good at certain variations on the same problems .
Asking you for the biggest word that fits this pattern presents you with an almost impossible task .
Basically , it requires you to be able to iterate through the words you know , ordered by length , and test each one .
Unless you are subject to some pretty incredible flashes of insight , I think you 're going to need a computer for this .
Going Bottom Up
Maybe the feeling is n't universal among programmers , but when I look at a problem , my first instinct is usually to try a top - down approach .
For this problem , a top - down approach would mean identifying the longest words in the dictionary , then attempting to decompose them into successively shorter words .
This approach will work , but a little mental analysis shows that it might be a little resource heavy .
Imagine that you are decomposing a 10 - letter word by taking away one letter at a time .
In the worst case , you might find all 8 shorter words in the dictionary , and then you could find all 720 8 - letter words , and so on .
Although in the general case you might only find one or two matches , particularly at the long lengths , even the potential for factorial growth leaves some room for concern .
So I took a shot at a bottom - up approach instead .
It is n't usually my first choice , but I think you 'll see that in this case it yields a much more satisfactory and efficient solution to the problem .
Lower Manhattan
Mr. Zupan : Placard abuse accounts for much of the on - street parking in parts of the city with concentrations of government offices , such as Lower Manhattan .
Some use by city employees may be legitimate .
But this abuse has been going on for much too long .
VEHICLE RESTRICTIONS
Ban cars and S.U.V.’s that are more than 20 feet long , as well as S.U.V. ’s weighing more than three tons .
This would eliminate Escalades , Yukons , Excursions and other similarly bloated vehicles that tend to block the streets even in normal traffic .
— Tony Wasserman , San Francisco
Mr. Zupan :
How could you implement this ?
Have a tape measure as standard traffic police issue ?
Dr. Falcocchio : Just as trucks are prohibited from using some streets , passenger vehicles longer than 20 feet could be prohibited on streets that were not designed for their use .
Restricting large vehicles from some streets , however , has to do more with the safety of cyclists and pedestrians than with congestion .
Restrict trucks to certain hours .
Allow either only night deliveries , as many European cities do , or no deliveries from 8 to 10 in the morning and 4 to 6 in the afternoon .
— Rita Kramer , Midtown
Dr. Falcocchio : Delivery times could be restricted only with cooperation from businesses receiving deliveries .
The focus should be on allowing deliveries only during certain hours .
Bar passenger cars from entering Manhattan below 96th Street if they carry fewer than four people .
This was tried during the transit strike two years ago , and there was markedly less congestion .
— Steven Scalici ,
Great Kills , Staten Island
Mr. Zupan : Requiring this for a short time during a strike may be acceptable , and carpooling may be a good idea in the suburbs .
But in the long run this would add to the number of cars in the city .
And can you name three people you would be willing to commute with daily ?

On Tuesday , Tucker Carlson talked with Dr. Daniel Amen , a neuropsychiatrist , about the notion that all presidential candidates should undergo brain scans before they can be elected to office .
Amen uses brain scans to treat criminals and people with depression and other mental illnesses , and says they can also detect Alzheimer 's Disease up to ten years in advance of onset .
He also thinks they should be performed on all presidential candidates so the public can see what , if any , predispositions they might have to criminal behavior as well as poor judgment or future illnesses .
On one hand , a brain scan may have prevented the reign of George Bush -- on the other hand , it does have a certain creepy factor to it .
Do we WANT to know this much about our candidates ?
Their physical health is always fair game , why not their mental health as well ?
We have a lot of great readers here at C&L and I 'm curious to know your thoughts on this .
U.S. : Voices on Recording May Not Have Been From Iranian Speedboats
Chilling threat could have come from the shore or another ship , Navy says .
Jan. 10 , 2008  -- Just two days after the U.S. Navy released the eerie video of Iranian speedboats swarming around American warships , which featured a chilling threat in English , the Navy is saying that the voice on the tape could have come from the shore or from another ship .
The near - clash occurred over the weekend in the Strait of Hormuz .
On the U.S. - released recording , a voice can be heard saying to the Americans , " I am coming to you .
You will explode after a few minutes . "
The Navy never said specifically where the voices came from , but many were left with the impression they had come from the speedboats because of the way the Navy footage was edited .
Today , the spokesperson for the U.S. admiral in charge of the Fifth Fleet clarified to ABC News that the threat may have come from the Iranian boats , or it may have come from somewhere else .
We 're saying that we cannot make a direct connection to the boats there , " said the spokesperson .
" It could have come from the shore , from another ship passing by .
However , it happened in the middle of all the very unusual activity , so as we assess the information and situation , we still put it in the total aggregate of what happened Sunday morning .
I guess we 're not saying that it absolutely came from the boats , but we 're not saying it absolutely did n't . "
The Iranians have denied using the threatening language and are saying U.S. - released video is fabricated .
Today , the Iranian government aired its own video of the event on state - run TV there .
On the audio , the voice that the Iranians say is the communication from their vessel can be heard identifying itself to the American ship , " Coalition warship No. 73 this is an Iranian navy patrol boat . "
The incident ended without shots being fired , but senior defense officials told ABC News that the USS Hopper 's gunners were within seconds of firing on the Iranians .

CNN : Obama rumor we disproved still spreading David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday December 5 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Almost a year after it debunked false claims that Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) had attended an Islamic school as a child , CNN reports that the presidential hopeful is still struggling to quash rumors that he is a practicing Muslim .
" Four weeks from the first primary and false rumors are still circulating about Barack Obama , " reports CNN's Chris Lawrence , who says the Muslim myth is alive and well in early primary states critical to the senator 's campaign .
" On Tuesday , minsters rallied support in South Carolina ... and the campaign is emphasizing Obama 's life as a committed Christian . "
The rumors are apparently so pervasive that Obama staffers in the candidate 's Iowa office even keep a letter " attesting to his faith " at the ready , which is signed off on by Christian ministers .
The letter shoots down fabricated rumors including that the senator was sworn into office with a Koran , as opposed to the Bible .
In Oklahoma , the campaign has begun distributing a brochure , entitled " Barack Obama Answering the Call , " which literally spells out Obama 's identification as a Christian .
The inside of the pamphlet is emblazoned with with the phrase " COMMITTED CHRISTIAN " in large block letters .
The root of the Muslim rumor can be traced to a January article in the conservative Insight Magazine , which cited claims from an unnamed source that Obama had attended an Islamic madrassa while living in Indonesia -- and that the information had been uncovered by the campaign of rival presidential contender Sen.
Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) .
The piece was later picked up by Fox News and the New York Post , among other news outlets .
But CNN reporters determined that the senator 's childhood school was public , and did not focus on religion .
A recent front - page piece in the Washington Post , which examined the still - swirling rumors about Obama 's faith , has drawn the ire from many left - leaning bloggers who accuse of the paper not being forceful enough in condemning the rumor as a falsehood .
From the article : Foes Use Obama 's Muslim Ties to Fuel Rumors About Him
In his speeches and often on the Internet , the part of Sen. Barack Obama 's biography that gets the most attention is not his race but his connections to the Muslim world .
Since declaring his candidacy for president in February , Obama , a member of a congregation of the United Church of Christ in Chicago , has had to address assertions that he is a Muslim or that he had received training in Islam in Indonesia , where he lived from ages 6 to 10 .
While his father was an atheist and his mother did not practice religion , Obama 's stepfather did occasionally attend services at a mosque there .
Despite his denials , rumors and e-mails circulating on the Internet continue to allege that Obama ( D - Ill. ) is a Muslim , a " Muslim plant " in a conspiracy against America , and that , if elected president , he would take the oath of office using a Koran , rather than a Bible , as did Rep. Keith Ellison ( D - Minn. ) , the only Muslim in Congress , when he was sworn in earlier this year .
Writing at Talking Points Memo , Greg Sargent crowned the Post article the " Worst Hit Piece of Campaign 2008 , " and accused reporter Perry Bacon of recycling the rumor rather than dispelling it .
" It 's dismal enough that WaPo 's free acknowledgment that these are rumors did n't stop the paper 's editors from running this garbage on its front page , " says Sargent in a post last month .
" What 's even worse is the fact that it does n't get around to explaining the substance of Obama 's denial of these rumors until the 12th paragraph . "
At the liberal blog Hullabaloo , Digby , who slammed the paper for not aggressively denying the rumor , wrote that the Post apparently thought that " ' Republicans say Barack Obama is a Muslim and Obama says he is n't , ' is a legitimate story . "
Salon blogger Glenn Greenwald also weighed in on the controversy , writing that the story had " simply passed on each side 's ' views ' without comment -- the factually true side and the factually false side -- as though they merited equal weight . "
Concluded Greenwald , " It is n't actually that complicated .
When a government official or candidate makes a factually false statement , the role of the reporter is not merely to pass it on , nor is it simply to note that ' some ' dispute the false statement .
The role of the reporter is to state the actual facts ... "

Martian Clouds Pass By on a Winter Afternoon
NASA 's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity captured a view of wispy afternoon clouds , not unlike fair weather clouds on Earth , passing overhead on the rover 's 956th sol , or Martian day ( Oct. 2 , 2006 ) .
With Opportunity facing northeast , the clouds appear to drift gently toward the west in this movie taken with the rover 's navigation camera .
The 10 frames , taken 32 seconds apart , show the formation and evolution of what are likely mid-level , convective water clouds .
Such clouds are common near Mars ' equator at this time of the Martian year .
They have been observed by both of NASA 's Mars Exploration Rovers , by satellites orbiting Mars , and by the Hubble Space Telescope .
In this case , the clouds appear to develop at a fixed location , in the center of the frame about 25 degrees above the horizon .
This style of origin suggests that a thermal plume is rising over a surface feature .
In spite of apparent winds aloft , the thermal plume appears to remain stationary for the 5 - minute duration of the movie .
Though scientists have determined from the images that the wind bearing is east - northeast , approximately 80 degrees , it is not possible on the basis of the movie to unambiguously determine the height and speed of the clouds .
Scientists estimate , based on models of atmospheric wind profiles and the apparent displacement of the clouds , that all of the clouds in the movie are at about the same height somewhere between 5 kilometers and 25 kilometers ( 3 to 20 miles ) above the surface .
The clouds are estimated to be moving at 2.5 meters per second , if they are low , to 12.5 meters per second , if they are high ( 8 feet per second to 41 feet per second ) .
Like clouds on Earth , these Martian clouds are probably composed of ice crystals and possibly supercooled water droplets .
They are similar in appearance to terrestrial cirrocumulus or high altocumulus clouds .
On Earth , such clouds are relatively transient and consist of small , individual cloudlets arranged in rippled patterns .
They usually form 6 kilometers to 12 kilometers ( 4 to 7 miles ) above Earth 's surface by a process known as convection , during which warm air rises and cools , with clouds condensing from the moist air once it has cooled sufficiently .
These Martian clouds appear to be associated with a broader layer of ice - crystal clouds fanning out toward the upper right of the frames at the end of the movie .
This is similar to the occurrence of terrestrial cirrocumulus and altocumulus clouds within layers of cirrus or cirrostratus clouds on Earth .
Also apparent in this movie are prominent waves in the clouds , a result of the effect of gravity waves on cloud thickness , as on Earth .
Though both rovers now have the ability to autonomously detect clouds , these images were taken prior to the first use of the new abilities .
The images shown here were stored on Opportunity and were transmitted to Earth on sol 1056 ( Jan. 12 , 2007 ) during a routine communications pass .

Google 's reported interest in laying a new trans -Pacific underwater fiber optic cable is the most prominent sign that , after a six - year hiatus , companies are starting to build massive conduits for internet data .
After the market collapsed in 2001 , telcos stopped laying new cables .
With a glut of capacity on the market , Google bought " dark fiber " – unused fiber - optic cable connections – at discount rates .
Google wo n't disclose how much fiber capacity it owns , but experts concur that it is a significant amount .
Now , with internet usage surging , telcos and assorted consortia are once again investing in undersea infrastructure .
While Google would not offer specifics on the U.S. - to - Asia connection , known at this point as Unity , it did confirm its interest in undersea cable , saying in a statement that " additional infrastructure for the internet is good for users and there are a number of proposals to add a Pacific submarine cable . "
Indeed , all indications are that we 're on the verge of some very large investments , both in terms of new cables and upgrades , says Eric Schoonover , a senior analyst at TeleGeography .
His research firm notes that trans -Pacific cable is particularly prized at the moment for two reasons :
The dearth of existing undersea cable in the region and the huge swell in bandwidth demand coming out of Asia .
Although the four existing trans -Pacific cables provide an average 3.3 terabits per second of capacity each , cable owners have increasingly been scrambling to meet the upsurge in demand from places like Japan and China , Schoonover says .
Internet traffic along this route alone increased 41 percent between mid-2006 and mid-2007 , according to TeleGeography .
By contrast , eight cables currently cross the Atlantic , and demand there has not outrun capacity yet .
Google representatives say that the move has nothing to do with competing directly with telecommunications companies .
As with Google 's investments in dark fiber , the company plans on using the excess bandwidth simply to connect to datacenters and to peering points , expanding its capacity to transmit its own data , not other people 's traffic .
Schoonover says that explanation makes sense .
" The reason I would tend to believe Google … is [ because ] this is not a great business , " he says .
" There 's not a lot of money in it , to tell you the truth , and the wholesale players in the sub - sea market are selling on razor - thin margins . "
Emphasizing this point , Schoonover says that past precedent has dictated that prices will eventually come down .
" You add markets with new supply , and the price is bound to come down .
There 's even a risk of it collapsing , " he says , as it did in 2000 .
And it is for this reason that Google 's undersea cable plans are probably limited to the trans - Pacific route ... for now .
And then there was Bob Kerrey , the former senator and another Clinton supporter , who slimed up the campaign with the following comments :
“ It ’s probably not something that appeals to him , but I like the fact that his name is Barack Hussein Obama , and that his father was a Muslim and that his paternal grandmother is a Muslim .
There ’s a billion people on the planet that are Muslims , and I think that experience is a big deal . ”
Image Bob Herbert
Pressing the point , Mr. Kerrey told CNN ’s John King : “ I ’ve watched the blogs try to say that you ca n’t trust him because he spent a little bit of time in a secular madrassa .
I feel quite the opposite . ”
Get it ?
Let ’s start with the fact that Mr. Obama never attended a madrassa , and that there is no such thing as a secular madrassa .
A madrassa is a religious school .
Beyond that , the idea is to not - so - slyly feed the current frenzy , on the Internet and elsewhere , that Senator Obama is a Muslim , and thus potentially ( in the eyes of many voters ) an enemy of the United States .
Mr. Obama is not a Muslim .
He ’s a Christian .
And if he were a Muslim , it would not be a legitimate reason for attacking his candidacy .
The Clinton camp knows what it ’s doing , and its slimy maneuvers have been working .
Bob Kerrey apologized and Andrew Young said at the time of his comment that he was just fooling around .
But the damage to Senator Obama has been real , and so have the benefits to Senator Clinton of these and other lowlife tactics .
Consider , for example , the following Web posting ( misspellings and all ) from a mainstream news blog on Jan. 13 :
“ omg people get a grip .
Can you imagine calling our president barak hussien obama ... I cant , I pray no one would be disrespectful enough to put this man in our whitehouse . ”
Mr. Obama ’s campaign was always going to be difficult , and the climb is even steeper now .
There is no reason to feel sorry for him .
He ’s a politician out of Chicago who must have known that campaigns often degenerate into demolition derbies .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation warns us that H.R. 4137 , the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007 , is still steaming ahead with its " Campus - based Digital Theft Prevention " that ties college funding to universities ' intimidates college administrators into a purchase of DRM - based industry - sanctioned download services and deployment of network snoopware that spies on and disconnects college kids if they appear to be violating copyright ( without any hard evidence or a chance for the student to present her side of the story ) .
These congressional requirements will turn out to be expensive dead - ends — the industry - sanctioned online music services are laden with DRM , and network detection / filtering programs present privacy risks and are inevitably rendered obsolete by technological countermeasures .
Advocates of the bill stress that the language stops short of demanding implementation — that it only requires universities to " plan " — but this argument misses the point entirely .
The passage of this bill will unambiguously lead universities down the wrong path .
For the sake of artists , administrators , students , and consumers better approaches exist .
The bill also would hang an unspoken threat over the heads of university administrators .
In response to concerns that potential penalties for universities could include a loss of federal student aid funding , the MPAA 's top lawyer in Washington said that federal funds should be at risk when copyright infringement happens on campus networks .
Moreover , earlier versions of " Campus - based Digital Theft Prevention " proposals nakedly sought to make schools that received numerous copyright infringement notices subject to review by the US Secretary of Education .
In a sign of congressional concern over near record - high gasoline prices and global warming , a Senate committee Tuesday approved legislation calling for the most significant increase in vehicle fuel efficiency in decades .
The measure would boost the fleetwide average fuel economy standards to 35 mpg by 2020 , up from 25 .
It now goes to the Senate , where a similar measure was defeated two years ago after heavy lobbying by automakers .
This time , however , the bill was being backed by a number of lawmakers who previously opposed tougher standards .
And it comes when congressional Democratic leaders have pledged to pass legislation to address climate change .
Cars and light trucks , including sport utility vehicles , pickups and vans , account for about one - fifth of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions .

“ This marks a pretty significant change in the Congress , ” said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) , who has voted against tougher fuel - economy rules but is now sponsoring legislation to raise the standards .
The bill ’s approval by the Senate Commerce Committee marked only the opening round , with lawmakers from vehicle - manufacturing states vowing to fight a measure they believe could hurt the struggling U.S. auto industry .
Environmental groups also assailed the bill , contending that it contained loopholes that could lead to lower increases than promised .
The bill represents the first major revision of the fuel - economy program established during the oil price shocks of the 1970s .
It would require the nationwide fleet of cars and light trucks sold in the country to average 35 mpg by 2020 .
A 4 % annual increase in fuel economy would be required for vehicles made from 2021 to 2030 .
The legislation , however , would give the Transportation Department latitude to permit a lower standard if it determined that the costs of imposing stricter rules outweighed the benefits .

Currently , each automaker ’s car fleet must average 27.5 mpg , a requirement that has not changed for about 18 years , and light trucks must average 22.2 mpg , which will go to 24 by 2011 .
The action came as gas prices moved back to center stage on Capitol Hill , with Democrats and Republicans sparring over each other ’s record in seeking to bring down energy costs .
Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations , announced that his panel would examine the causes behind fluctuations in fuel prices .
During Tuesday ’s Senate Commerce Committee meeting , Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) recalled driving past a filling station in San Francisco last weekend .

“ We could n’t believe our eyes -- $ 4.25 a gallon ! ” she said .
Desperate to do something to respond to the high prices , the committee attached to the fuel - economy bill a measure that would establish new federal penalties for gas price - gouging .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , among the leading advocates for stricter fuel economy rules , cheered the committee vote .
“ Legislation to improve fuel economy has been bottled up for more than two decades , ” she said .
“ Now we have a realistic chance at a strong bill that increases fuel economy by 10 mpg over 10 years -- and 4 % a year beyond that . ”

Environmentalists were less enthusiastic .
“ On the one hand , it ’s a start , ” said Dan Becker , director of the Sierra Club ’s global warming program .
“ On the other hand , it ’s a pretty weak start .
It does n’t actually require the administration to act , so there is no guarantee that fuel economy goes up . ”
Joan Claybrook , a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration who is now president of the watchdog group Public Citizen , called the bill “ a political compromise that now compromises the very purpose of the fuel economy program . ”
They pledged to work to strengthen the measure as it moves through Congress , though that could set up a veto showdown with President Bush .
Bush has called for tougher fuel economy rules , but opposes Congress mandating a standard .

Feinstein , however , said the only way that the full benefits of the bill would not be achieved was “ if the government shows that the costs to the country as a whole would be greater than the benefits . ”
And she added : “ I believe this would be highly unlikely given the spike in gasoline prices , the national security and environmental costs of our oil dependency , and the huge fuel savings that would be achieved as a result of this bill . ”
Auto industry officials called the tougher standards “ unattainable ” and contended that they would deny consumers the SUVs they cherish .
“ If higher standards make vehicles less attractive to consumers , vehicle sales will drop , negatively impacting auto dealers , suppliers , automakers and the U.S. economy , ” the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers , an industry trade group , said in a letter to lawmakers .
The United Auto Workers also opposed the measure .

Sen .
Ted Stevens of Alaska , the committee ’s top Republican , said the bill was “ not perfect , but it is a constructive step toward addressing the nation ’s energy crisis and reducing our dependence on foreign oil . ”

Pro-pollution White House caught doctoring environmental report
October 25 , 2007
The pro-pollution White House has admitted it doctored environmental testimony given to Congress on global warming by the CDC .
Barbara Boxer demanded the White House turn over copies of all versions of the testimony .
WASHINGTON -- The White House acknowledged it edited out half of environmental testimony given Congress on global warming by a U.S. expert .
Tuesday , the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Dr. Julie Gerberding testified to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on climate change and public health .
Her original text was 12 pages long but about six pages were submitted , The Washington Post reported Thursday .
However , White House officials cut it in half , with spokeswoman Dana Perino saying it did n't conform to findings of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
" As I understand it , in the draft there was broad characterizations about climate change science that did n't align with the IPCC , " Perino said .
University of Wisconsin at Madison public health Professor Dr. Jonathan Patz , who served as IPCC lead author for its 2007 , 2001 and 1995 reports , told the newspaper he reviewed Gerberding 's original testimony and dismissed the White House claims .
" That 's nonsense , " Patz told the newspaper .
" Doctor Gerberding 's testimony was scientifically accurate and absolutely in line with the findings of the IPCC . "
U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - Calif. , the committee 's chairwoman , has asked the White House for copies of all versions of the testimony , the Post said .
In response to declining music sales in the UK , the Entertainment Retailers Association ( ERA ) has called for the music industry to put an end to DRM .
The organization — which represents retailers who sell music and DVDs — blames draconian digital copy protection technologies for the slow growth of the digital music market .
Consumers are increasingly dissatisfied with copy protection systems that erode fair use rights and impose limitations on where and how content can be used .
To make matters worse , market fragmentation has led to the emergence of incompatible DRM formats which often confuse consumers and leave them wondering whether or not the content they buy will work on all of their electronics devices .
That makes file - sharing more attractive for some consumers .
Many companies in the recording industry still refuse to adjust their business models to account for consumers ' preferences when it comes to DRM , believing instead that the near - ubiquitous practice of file - sharing can be abolished with more draconian copy protection mechanisms and litigation .
Music retailers appear to be more in touch with consumer expectations and see a very different picture .
Speaking on behalf of UK music retailers , ERA director Kim Bayley told the Financial Times this week that the copy protection mechanisms are " stifling growth and working against the consumer interest . "
Citing a recent study conducted in the UK which indicated that consumers overwhelmingly prefer music without copy protection mechanisms , Bayley says that DRM " puts consumers off . "
According to the Financial Times article , the music industry generates 40 percent of its revenues during the fourth quarter , but retailers are concerned because early sales this season have ramped up slower than usual .
The ERA hopes that the music industry will reevaluate its position on DRM in time for the holiday shopping rush .
Some recording companies , like EMI , have already lopped off the locks and are selling unencumbered music .
EMI has reported strong sales after dumping DRM , which reinforces the fact that giving the consumers what they want is really the only viable strategy for turning around sagging sales .
Paper explains how the “ engineering mentality ” produces terrorists
One of the biggest puzzles of Islamic terrorism is why so many of its participants are engineers .
Perhaps the most famous one is Mohammad Atta , the 9/11 mastermind ( pictured above ) ; but when you read news reports of suicide bombing incidents , you realize he ’s not alone .
It ’s engineer after engineer after engineer .
Why ?
Because in the Middle East , the mindset of engineers mixes with religiosity — and a lack of professional opportunity — to produce a toxic , combustive psychology .
That ’s the conclusion of “ Engineers of Jihad ” , a paper by sociologists Diego Gambetta and Steffen Hertog of the University of Oxford — the link is directly to the full PDF .
Their research is incredibly interesting and thorough .
To start off , they compiled a list of 404 members of violent Islamist groups , and found that engineers were , indeed , wildly overrepresented .
Engineers make up only 3.5 per cent of the Islamic countries they studied , yet they made up 19 per cent of the group of terrorists — which means engineers are six times more likely to be terrorists than they ought to be .
Where things get really interesting is their exploration of engineering psychology — and the dynamics of engineers ’ lives in the Islamic countries .
First off , Gambetta and Hertog note that previous sociological studies have found that engineers are far more likely to be religious and conservative than other academics — four times more than social scientists and three times more so than people in the arts and humanities .
What ’s more , this religiosity affects their careers .
A study by the Carnegie Foundation found that the more religious and conservative an engineer is , the less likely she or he is to be regularly publishing work — and thus less likely to be employed as an engineer .
To make matters worse , as the academics point out , most of the Islamic countries in which these engineers become radicalized have crappy economies :
When the engineers return home from their training in the West , they ca n’t find good jobs .
In Egypt , for example , “ Many graduates preferred joblessness even to relatively well - paying menial jobs , and for numerous young Egyptians marriage became unaffordable .
Making a virtue out of necessity , many graduates tried to restore their dignity by declaring their adherence to antimaterialist Islamic morality . ”
On top of this is what Gambetta and Hertog call the “ engineering mentality ” .
To quote them at some length :
Friedrich von Hayek , in 1952 , made a strong case for the peculiarity of the engineering mentality , which in his view is the result of an education which does not train them to understand individuals and their world as the outcome of a social process in which spontaneous behaviours and interactions play a significant part .
Rather , it fosters on them a script in which a strict ‘ rational ’ control of processes plays the key role : this would make them on the one hand less adept at dealing with the confusing causality of the social and political realms and the compromise and circumspection that these entail , and on the other hand inclined to think that societies should operate orderly akin to well - functioning machines — a feature which is reminiscent of the Islamist engineers …
The upshot ?
The creation of a class of young men who are highly educated , conservative , highly religious , economically thwarted , pissed off at both their own countries and the West , unable or unwilling to examine the complex social and political reasons for their personal troubles , and seeking a straightforward “ answer ” .
“ It appears that engineers … found themselves perfectly and painfully placed at a high - voltage point of intersection in which high ambitions and high frustration collided , ” Gambetta and Hertog conclude .
It ’s a really interesting analysis !
Still , I was surprised to read some of their data and assumptions .
For example , engineers being overall more conservative ?
That shocked me : I hang out with tons of computer and software engineers , and if anything they tend to be either left - wing or libertarian .
( Or , as the Jargon File would have it , just generally suspicious of authority . )
But possibly computer engineers , because they deal with the flow of information — a discipline that necessarily bumps you up intellectually against notions of freedom , secrecy , customization , personal choice , etc. — wind up in different emotional and psychological place than engineers who work more straightforwardly with physics .
And one could easily dispute other parts of Gambetta and Hertog ’s argument ; Hayek ’s analysis of engineering psychology has been disputed .
Still , this is one of the most ambitious attempts to tackle the puzzle of engineer terrorists I ’ve yet seen .

Tigers are a popular attraction at many zoos in China
The girl was posing for photographs with the tiger when it was startled by camera flashes and pulled the girl 's head into its mouth , state media said .
Staff beat the tiger until it released the girl , but she had suffered a crushed skull and died in hospital .
The zoo has stopped allowing visitors to pose with its tigers for a charge of $ 2 ( £ 1 ) , Xinhua news agency said .
The girl was identified as Rui Xin .
Her mother was bitten on the arm while trying to rescue her .
A local newspaper said the zoo had been charging visitors for the opportunity to pose with the tiger since May 2005 .
Prices are climbing back towards $ 96 a barrel
Sweet light crude added $ 2.44 , ending at $ 95.93 a barrel , after hitting $ 96.05 in earlier trade .
London Brent settled $ 2.36 up at $ 92.08 .
Fears of new UN sanctions against Iran are pushing prices up along with strong demand for oil from developing nations .
Many observers believe crude oil will break through $ 100 a barrel this year .
News late on Friday that the UN Security Council is looking into drafting new sanctions against Iran Friday as it continues with its uranium enrichment plans raised fears about potential shortages .
' Unknown territory '
Strong demand from developing nations and a weak US dollar are likely to keep pushing prices up , experts believe .
There are also concerns about geopolitical issues such as a possible clash between the US and Iran , and an escalation of hostilities between Turkey and rebel Kurdish fighters based in the northern areas of Iraq .
We are stepping into an unknown area
Ken Hasegawa , Fimat Japan
What is driving oil prices up ?
The problem facing oil markets and analysts is that all of the factors are combining to create a high level of uncertainty in the market and this , in turn , is driving prices higher .
Oil prices surged on Wednesday after a report showed domestic US crude stocks fell by 3.9 million barrels last week , worrying analysts who had forecast an increase of 100,000 barrels .
The US is the world 's biggest energy consumer and the state of its inventories is a key concern for market watchers .
" We are stepping into an unknown area , " said Ken Hasegawa , a broker at Fimat Japan , of the latest price spike .
" Nobody wants to sell , given the fear of a further rise . "
Traders are bracing themselves for further rises
The weakening US dollar which has made oil , priced in dollars , cheaper to buy outside of the US has also fanned the price rises .
The dollar hit its weakest levels against the pound since 1981 on Wednesday .
Other factors supporting prices are concerns about the stop - start violence in Nigeria 's main oil producing region and worries about the availability of heating supplies for the US winter .
Fixing denied
Oil producers ' body Opec continues to be criticised for not doing enough to restrain prices despite agreeing to lift daily output by 500,000 barrels , an increase which came into effect on Thursday .
A senior Opec official said the organisation was not to blame for the price rises and insisted there was no shortage of capacity in the market .
" We never fix oil prices , " said Abdullah al - Attiyah , Qatar 's energy minister .
" It is market - driven and it is out of control . "
Media pundits ask : Should the US bomb Iran now ?

In the wake of Vice President Cheney 's saber - rattling statements over the weekend warning Iran of " serious consequences " if it attempts to develop nuclear weapons , the cable news networks have focused heavily on the prospect of imminent war against Iran .
Fox News spoke with military analysts Lt. Col. Bill Cowan and Lt. Gen. Tom McInerney .
Both men are members of the Iran Policy Committee , which was founded in 2005 to press for more aggressive action against Iran .
Cowan told
Fox that he believes we are heading for war with Iran , though he suggested it might be more effective to support the " positive , forward - leaning political resistance against the regime " -- an apparent reference to the terrorist MEK group of which the Iran Policy Committee has been a supporter .
McInerney , however , said , " We , in fact , should .
There are enough dots out there that we have more than enough rationale to do it . "
He claimed that Iranian President Ahmadinejad has killed more than 300 Americans in the last 8 months -- a figure which , if correct , would amount to roughly half of all US deaths in Iraq during that period .
" I do n't think we 're going to have a lot of options , " Cowan concluded .
At MSNBC , Chris Matthews invited a debate on the question , " Should the United States Bomb Iran Now ? " between Joshua Muravchik of the American Enterprise Institute and Jim Walsh of MIT 's Security Studies Program .
Muravchik -- who has been a leading exponent of overthrowing the Iranian government since 1993 , when he co-founded the Foundation for Democracy in Iran -- described Iran as " the biggest international sponsor of terrorism . "
He asserted that Iran is " on a mission that starts with hegemony over the Middle East ...
It sees itself , in a sense , at war with us .
...
If it gets a nuclear weapon , it will use that as a kind of umbrella with which to push forth its quest for dominance . "
" The prestige factor of owning that weapon even if they never use it is horrible , " summarized Matthews .
Jim Walsh , however , warned of the immediate negative consequences of bombing Iran , saying , " First and foremost , it would be extremely costly .
... I mean , if you like the war in Iraq , you would love the war in Iran . "
He suggested that an escalation of attacks on US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and a dramatic increase in the price of oil were only two of the likely outcomes .
Walsh also debunked Muravchik 's suggestion that Iran might build a nuclear weapon and then hand it over to terrorists , saying that no government has ever done that .
" They can't trust these crazy guys , " he emphasized .
Matthews then hit Muravchik with a series of questions , including whether the threat of terrorists obtaining loose nukes from the former Soviet republics is not far greater than any hypothetical actions by Iran , how long it might take Iran to build not merely a nuclear weapons but a suitcase - sized device that could be used by terrorists , and whether any of Muravchik 's associates at AEI actually believe Iran is " on the verge of getting a weapon that could be transported by a terrorist group . "
" You 're saying bomb now , " Matthews said , demanding to know what is so urgent that it can't wait while diplomatic and economic efforts are given time to work .
He also asked Muravchik whether his real deadline is to see Iran bombed before Bush leaves office .
" We 've waited , " Muravchik insisted , claiming he never said we should bomb Iran " this minute " and that even " a year from now might be soon enough " but " there 's no alternative way to stop them . "
" If we 're concerned about terrorism , bombing Iran is absolutely the worst thing you could do , " Walsh concluded .
" It is giving al Qaeda this giant gift . "
He also pointed out that even an active Iranian weapons program could be reversed , saying that North Korea is now dismantling its own nuclear program and also that " Almadinejad is not calling the shots " in Iran .

Two years after being cleared for release from Guantánamo by a military review board , Adel Hassan Hamad , a hospital administrator who worked for a Saudi charity , and Salim Muhood Adem , who worked with orphans for a Kuwaiti NGO , have been repatriated to the country of their birth , where , as lawyer Clive Stafford Smith explained , they are both " safe with their families . "
After arriving at Khartoum airport , they were presented with traditional Sudanese clothes by intelligence officers , who took them to a hospital for a short medical examination before returning them to their families and friends .
As a noisy celebration got underway , Hamad spoke by phone to his American lawyers , Steve Wax and William Teesdale of the federal public defender ’s office in Oregon .
" I thank God almighty and express my gratefulness to you , " he said .
" I can finally see the light after the darkness . "
If the administration was hoping to lie low for a while and weather the recent torrent of criticism over its post - 9/11 detention policies  in the Supreme Court , in connection with the destruction of CIA videotapes chronicling the torture of detainees , and through its generally inept attempts to pursue war crimes trials at Guantánamo itself  the release of these men will provide no comfort whatsoever , as their stories highlight some of the most egregious flaws in the whole of Guantánamo ’s sordid history .
Hamad , who is now 49 years old , had been living in Pakistan and working for charity organizations for 17 years .
Captured at his home in July 2002 , after returning from a holiday in Sudan with his wife and four children , he refuted an allegation that he had any kind of connection to al - Qaeda , telling his tribunal in Guantánamo , " I hate them and I pray to God not to let people among the Muslims carry [ out ] their ideas . "
He also pointed out , " If I was a member in al - Qaeda or if I had an association with them I would ’ve not traveled in June 2002 to Sudan with my family on an annual vacation and after the vacation ended I voluntarily returned to Pakistan .
If I was a criminal , with association to those criminals , why would I return to Pakistan knowing that Pakistani intelligence was arresting al - Qaeda members ? "
His description of his arrest seems particularly shocking , but was actually fairly typical of the dozens of arrests in Pakistan at the time , which were mostly based on dubious or nonexistent " intelligence . "
" I was arrested in my house at 1:30 at night when I woke up and found myself in front of policemen from the Pakistani intelligence pointing their weapons in my face like I was in a dream or a disturbing nightmare , " he told his tribunal .
" They were screaming at me , ‘ do n’t move ! ’
So I told them , ‘ What is it , what do you want from me ? ’
And with them was a tall man who did not look Pakistani , which I think he was American .
So they handcuffed me and they told me ‘ Where are your papers ? ’ ( meaning my passport ) .
So I told them , ‘ In my shirt pocket . ’
So the tall man checked my passport and he told me that I came back early from my trip .
I told him yes .
He spoke in poor Arabic .
He saw a legal official Pakistani permit by the date that was in my passport , which had a legal official authorization posted for two years .
So the guard hesitated at the end and asked the tall man , ‘ Do we take him ? ’
And the man said , ‘ Yes , take him . ’
So they took me and detained me in jail in Pakistan for six months and 10 days .
Later I was moved to Bagram and then to Cuba . "
Over the last year or so , Hamad has become one of Guantánamo ’s celebrities , thanks to the efforts of his enterprising lawyers , who traveled to Pakistan to interview his former colleagues and to Sudan to interview his family , producing a film that publicized his plight to a huge audience on YouTube , which , in turn , led to the establishment of a campaigning Web site that drew support from thousands of people , including the actor Martin Sheen .
What makes Hamad ’s story particularly striking , however , beyond his unquestioned innocence , is what happened after his tribunal in Guantánamo three years ago .
The tribunals , known as combatant status review tribunals ( CSRTs ) , were established in the wake of a momentous Supreme Court decision in June 2004 that , contrary to the administration ’s assertions to that date , the detainees had habeas corpus rights .
In other words , that they had the right to challenge the basis of their detention in a court of law .
Rather than delivering them to the U.S. courts , however , the administration established the CSRTs to review the detainees ’ prior designation as " enemy combatants " without rights , who could be held indefinitely without charge or trial .
Emphasizing its disdain for the rule of law , the government prevented the detainees from having legal representation , and , moreover , relied on secret evidence that was withheld from them .
The tribunals , which duly found that all but 38 of the 558 detainees at the time had indeed been correctly designated as " enemy combatants , " came under fire this June from Lt. Col .
Stephen Abraham , a veteran of military intelligence who had taken part in compiling the " evidence " for the tribunals , and who condemned them as a sham , reliant upon vague , unsubstantiated , and generic evidence , and designed merely to approve the detainees ’ prior designation as " enemy combatants . "
While Abraham ’s comments are credited with prompting the Supreme Court to review the detainees ’ rights once more ( in a hearing that took place last week ) , Hamad ’s tribunal had already provided the first vivid demonstration of the injustice of the whole process back in August 2006 , when Farah Stockman of the Boston Globe reported that Hamad had been judged in his CSRT to be an " enemy combatant " because of exactly the kind of generic allegations that were later condemned by Abraham .
Hamad maintained that the Saudi charity he worked for , the World Assembly of Muslim Youth ( WAMY ) , was " a charity organization that works to help the Afghan refugees , providing them with food , medicine , clothes , and education , building charter schools which is made of an orphanage , educational training , and also works in the health department by establishing hospitals , small clinics , and also digging water wells , [ and ] building water wells . "
The U.S. authorities , however , described it as an organization that " supports terrorist ideals and causes , " even though it has never appeared on a terrorism watchlist ( despite being investigated by the U.S. Senate ) and was one of the favored projects of the late Saudi King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz .
Another organization that Hamad had worked for previously , the Kuwait - based Lajanat Dawa Islamiya ( LDI ) , which is also not on any U.S. terrorism watchlist , was described as " one of the most active " Islamic NGOs " providing logistical and financial support " to mujahedeen operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan , which " may be " associated with Osama bin Laden .
In his tribunal , a clearly exasperated Hamad refuted all the allegations , at one point exclaiming , " arresting employees like myself [ who ] is not capable of supporting terrorists financially , is this justice ?
I am an employee who works for a living and I have no connection to the [ organization ’s ] political views or its financial resources , so why do you punish me for a crime I did not commit .
Why do n’t you arrest the charities ’ presidents or the people who support [ them ] financially instead of arresting a simple employee with no informational value ? "
Predictably , his tribunal judged that he had been correctly designated an " enemy combatant , " but although his pleas appeared to have been ignored , Stockman , who was allowed to examine the CSRT documentation , noted that one of the tribunal members  an unidentified army major  had issued a dissenting opinion .
Taking into account the fact that neither WAMY nor LDI appears on the State Department ’s list of terrorist organizations , the major argued that , " even assuming all the allegations are accurate , the detainee does not meet the definition of enemy combatant . "
He added , " These NGOs presumably have numerous employees and volunteer workers who have been working in legitimate humanitarian roles .
The mere fact that some elements of these NGOs provide support to ‘ terrorist ideals and causes ’ is insufficient to declare one of the employees an enemy combatant . "
Stockman noted , however , that the major was overruled by his colleagues , one of whom  in a single line that discredits the whole tribunal process as effectively as Lt. Col .
Abraham ’s later declaration  wrote that the case " passed the ‘ low evidentiary hurdle ’ set up by the rules of the hearings . "
Two months ago , the major , who took part in 49 of the 558 CSRT hearings , publicly added his complaints to those recorded by Abraham , telling William Teesdale , " Much of the material presented was supplied by intelligence agencies and were summaries that were not necessarily justified by the underlying evidence . "
The major specifically mentioned his dissent in Hamad ’s CSRT , and also spoke about the deliberate exclusion of exculpatory evidence , the reconvening of CSRTs when an unfavorable result was produced , and the pressure exerted on the tribunals from higher up the command structure .
The case of Salim Muhood Adem , who is also 49 years old , is , in its own way , just as damning as that of Hamad .
A Pakistani resident who had first traveled to Pakistan in 1991 when he " performed official lawful work for schools , " he told his tribunal that he had been employed by the Revival of Islamic Heritage Society ( RIHS ) , a Kuwaiti NGO , since 1994 , and pointed out that he had mentioned to the interrogators what type of work he did  traveling from one school to another to check on education before being transferred to " the Orphanage Office of Administration "  and that it " was n’t a crime . "
Responding to an allegation that the organization was " suspected of supporting extremist activity , and some employees are suspected of supporting terrorism , " he said , " I have only known the Islamic organization to be associated with humanitarian efforts , never terrorism . "
He acknowledged traveling to Afghanistan in 1998 , explaining that he went " to supervise the administration of Orphanage Schools , " and was perplexed by an allegation that his residence was " identified as a suspected al - Qaeda residence and raided . "
He said that he rented the house from a Pakistani woman , and added , " everything I did regarding the house was legal . "
Crucially , he explained that when he was arrested , at home with his wife and two small children , " the officer that arrested us said he was giving us to the American forces to avoid problems and keep our country safe . "
Unlike WAMY and LDI , the RIHS was actually blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury in January 2002 , apparently because some of its personnel , including the director of its Pakistani office , Abdul Muhsin al - Libi , " defrauded well - meaning contributors by diverting money donated for widows and orphans to al - Qaeda terrorists , " and " padded the number of orphans it claimed to care for by providing names of orphans that did not exist or who had died .
Funds then sent for the purpose of caring for the nonexistent or dead orphans were instead diverted to al - Qaeda terrorists . "
However , neither Libi nor another named suspect , Abu Bakr al - Jaziri , both of whom also apparently held senior positions in the Afghan Support Committee , which was identified as having been established by Osama bin Laden in the 1980s , were captured by the Americans .
Instead , Adem and four of the charity ’s other workers were seized , even though there was no evidence that any of the men knew anything about the terrorist funding .
What ’s particularly shocking about Adem ’s situation is that , although the other four men  one Jordanian and another three Sudanese , including the charity ’s accountant in 2001  were released between November 2003 and July 2005 , Adem had to wait another 29 months to be granted his freedom .
Explaining the delay in the release of both men , Hamad ’s lawyers recently filed a declaration in the D.C. Circuit Court , outlining the progress  or lack of progress  in negotiations between the Sudanese and American governments , which revealed the extent to which political maneuvering , rather than issues of justice , has driven much of the Bush administration ’s policy toward the detainees .
In the declaration , William Teesdale explained that the Sudanese government had been notified that Hamad and Adem had been " approved for transfer " on Nov. 14 , 2005 , and that the State Department had sought assurances that they would be investigated on their return to Sudan , and that their human rights would be respected .
The department also sought permission to have " access to the detainees if needed " and assurances that the Sudanese government would " take responsibility for the detainees and prevent them from being a further threat to the United States . "
The Sudanese deputy ambassador , Salah Elguneid , explained to Teesdale that the Sudanese embassy gave an " official reply " to these demands in June 2006 , agreeing to all of them and even pointing out that U.S. officials had " met with some of the [ previously ] released detainees in Sudan since their release . "
The State Department then indicated that it would be good " to try to resolve the issue of all the Sudanese Guantánamo detainees " ( another six , including al - Jazeera cameraman Sami al - Haj , are still being held ) and that the way forward would be to " draw up a memorandum of understanding between the two countries . "
Elguneid noted , however , that Samuel Whitton , the U.S. ambassador who had been proceeding with these negotiations , then left his job , and that " negotiations with the new ambassador at large for war crimes , Clint Williamson , were more difficult . "
This was something of an understatement .
Elguneid admitted that , despite filing 10 requests for a meeting to discuss the release of Hamad and Adem , he had been unable to secure an appointment with Williamson and had not met any State Department officials since that last meeting in June 2006 .
With the release of Adel Hamad and Samir Adem , the deadlock has obviously been broken , but the clear politicization of the detainee - release process casts further shadows on the legitimacy of Guantánamo .
And the stonewalling on the part of State Department officials serves only to undermine Condoleezza Rice ’s claims that the Department is committed to Defense Secretary Robert Gates ’ stated aim of finding ways to close the prison sooner rather than later .

FORT COLLINS , Colorado ( CNN ) --
The College Republicans , a student organization at Colorado State University , were n't planning anything special for the last week of September .
Colorado State student Yael Yund , 21 , signs a petition calling for David McSwane 's resignation .
Then on September 21 , David McSwane , the editor - in - chief of The Rocky Mountain Collegian , the daily student newspaper , printed the four - word column that sparked a national free speech debate and sent the College Republicans into action , writing a petition to force him to resign .
" Taser this : F**k Bush " was printed on the opinion page of the newspaper , causing CSU president Larry Penley to issue a formal statement and the Board of Student Communications to plan a meeting for Wednesday night .
During the meeting they will decide on the fate of McSwane and his future involvement with the publication .
" We 'll present our petition to the board at the meeting , " said student Chelsey Penoyer , the chairman of the College Republicans .
" We 're petitioning that he should resign on his own .
The petition also urges students to think twice before going to businesses who continue advertising with The Collegian . "
In a confidential memo mistakenly released to the local newspaper , The Coloradoan , Fort Collins businesses have already pulled out $ 30,000 in advertising with The Collegian , which relies completely on external revenue to operate , not student fees .
According to the memo , to make up for the loss , student employee wages were cut by 10 percent , the newspaper reported .
McSwane confirmed the memo after its release .
McSwane has defended his actions , referring to the incident involving a college student who was Tasered at a recent John Kerry speech in Florida .
He said that his decision was exercising his right to free speech .
He refused to comment for this story .
Students around the CSU campus expressed a majority feeling that while they felt McSwane 's right to free speech should be protected , many of them felt as though he misused it .
" At first I totally supported him and the paper , " said senior Evan Isoline , who read the initial column when it came out .
" I thought he was making a political statement and then throwing away his college career at the paper .
I thought he would resign right away .
" Now you look at it and it 's like , ' Taser this .
Taser what ?'
The issue is n't even about President Bush .
If you 're going to stand up for something like that you have to have something to back it up .
You have to believe in something . "
Some students however have stopped in to the newsroom in support of the paper 's actions .
" I completely support him and the paper for their decision , " said Alesia Gifford , vice president of the Young Democrats , another political student organization .
" In this society we are taking a step backwards , especially with the free speech debate .
President Bush has lost our respect as a country .
" At some point we have to stand up for our rights .
[ McSwane ] was just showing that speech , even when explicit , should always be protected by the First Amendment . "
Many more students however were shocked at the paper 's decision and failed to see the political stance they took .
In addition to writing a column they felt lacked substance , students also were concerned of what it would do to the university 's image .
" It makes the students at Colorado State look like a bunch of uneducated children who do n't have anything intelligent to say , " Penoyer said .

When U.S. government officials and foreign policy pundits discuss terrorism , they usually focus on the characteristics , personnel , history , tactics , targets , objectives and effects of terrorist organizations .
They rarely talk about motives .
To fully understand Islamic terrorism , one needs to understand what triggers this extraordinary rage .
And throughout history one factor stands out above all else : … Continue reading “ US Role in Islamist Terrorism ”
JACKSON , Miss .
( AP )  Donnie Register has a new reason to be thankful he 's married — police say his wedding band deflected a bullet and probably saved his life .
Two men walked into Register 's shop at The Antique Market on Saturday and asked to see a coin collection , police Sgt. Jeffery Scott said .
When Register retrieved the collection , one of the men pulled a gun and demanded money .
A shot was fired as Register threw up his left hand , and his wedding ring deflected the bullet , police said .
" The bullet managed to go through two of his fingers without severing the bone , " said his wife , Darlene Register .
" A part of the bullet broke off and is in his middle finger .
The other part is in his neck , lodged in the muscle tissue .
But it 's not life - threatening . "
She said she gives God all the credit .
Police were searching for the robbers , who Scott said " stole a substantial amount of cash . "

Poured into a gold swimsuit , Make Me A Supermodel winner Jen Hunter looks as if this outfit was custom - made for her .
But the one - piece triggered a furious row about stick - thin models when her rival finalist Marianne Berglund appeared painfully underweight in the same attire .

Posh bans size zero girls from modelling her jeans
• ' How can images of stick - thin idols NOT be a bad example to girls ?'
Appearing here for the first time in the outfit which sparked the debate about size zero models , Miss Hunter - who was criticised on the show for being too fat - said : " This is what a real woman should look like .
" I am all curves and flesh , not skin and bone .
Boys , who would you rather snuggle up to ? "
Looking as different as chalk and cheese , the swimwear clings to Miss Hunter 's voluptuous curves and reveals acres of cleavage while on clinically underweight Miss Berglund , it shows her protruding hips and ribs and appears to hang off her .
Barmaid Miss Hunter , 24 - who weighs 11 stone and is a healthy size 12 - was reduced to tears when she was castigated on the reality TV show for not taking a food and exercise regime seriously .
Judge Tandy Anderson , managing director of Select Model Management , criticised her for having " stocky " legs while supermodel Rachel Hunter , a fellow panellist , reprimanded her for saying she wanted to prove larger women could be successful models .
Swedish blonde Miss Berglund , 18 , who made it to the final with her , was meanwhile praised for having a " sensational " body for modelling despite having a body mass index of 16.1 .
It fell well below the minimum BMI of 18 for models taking part in Madrid Fashion Week in September , set after catwalk model Luisel Ramos dropped dead from self - starvation .
But mother - of - one Miss Hunter triumphed when viewers voted her to the top female slot in the contest - and claimed she owed her success to her favourite dish of hotpot and chips .
In a refreshing admission which will have millions of women breathing a sigh of relief - and letting out their stomachs - she said : " It 's fantastic to know the public prefer a woman with a few wobbly bits over a stick insect .
" I am a northern lass - I like my hotpot and my shepherd 's pie and I have a very sweet tooth .
" My wardrobe is stuffed with clothes that do n't fit but I scrub up pretty well .
I like to think men see me as a yummy mummy . "
Her confession comes after a chorus of calls for the fashion industry to stop using stick - thin and underweight models .
Designer Giorgio Armani recently took a stand by banning size zero models from his shows .
Wigan - born Miss Hunter , who beat five female hopefuls to the top slot after refusing to bow to pressure , claimed her win proved women could not relate to skinny models .
The divorcee triumphed over eight - stone Miss Berglund - who was dubbed " the walking skeleton " - but was beaten to the overall prize of a modelling contract by a male competitor .
In a blog diary she kept throughout the show , in which she cheekily gave herself the nickname " fat bird , " she announced : " I am doing this for every hardworking single mum and every woman who is n't a size eight or below .
" You do n't have to be a size eight to be beautiful .
I am trying to change an industry that is so set in its ways and its definition of what is beautiful .
It is so hard and harsh at times .
" You analyse every step you make , every mouth full of food you take .
As long as I am being me , I am not going to regret anything I do . "
People ’s freedom to innovate technologically is highly valuable , even critical , to humanity .
This implies several imperatives when restrictive measures are proposed : Assess risks and opportunities according to available science , not popular perception .
Account for both the costs of the restrictions themselves , and those of opportunities foregone .
Favor measures that are proportionate to the probability and magnitude of impacts , and that have a high expectation value .
Protect people ’s freedom to experiment , innovate , and progress .
_________________________________________________________________________
Unpacking the Proactionary Principle
Looking deeper into the Principle , we arrive at these factors to take into account :
People ’s freedom to innovate technologically is valuable to humanity .
The burden of proof therefore belongs to those who propose restrictive measures .
All proposed measures should be closely scrutinized .
Evaluate risk according to available science , not popular perception , and allow for common reasoning biases .
Give precedence to ameliorating known and proven threats to human health and environmental quality over acting against hypothetical risks .
Treat technological risks on the same basis as natural risks ; avoid underweighting natural risks and overweighting human - technological risks .
Fully account for the benefits of technological advances .
Estimate the lost opportunities of abandoning a technology , and take into account the costs and risks of substituting other credible options , carefully considering widely distributed effects and follow - on effects .
Consider restrictive measures only if the potential impact of an activity has both significant probability and severity .
In such cases , if the activity also generates benefits , discount the impacts according to the feasibility of adapting to the adverse effects .
If measures to limit technological advance do appear justified , ensure that the extent of those measures is proportionate to the extent of the probable effects .
When choosing among measures to restrict technological innovation , prioritize decision criteria as follows :
Give priority to risks to human and other intelligent life over risks to other species ; give non-lethal threats to human health priority over threats limited to the environment ( within reasonable limits ) ; give priority to immediate threats over distant threats ; prefer the measure with the highest expectation value by giving priority to more certain over less certain threats , and to irreversible or persistent impacts over transient impacts .
A Proactionary Alternative to the Precautionary Principle
The Proactionary Principle emerged out of a critical discussion of the widely used “ precautionary principle ” during Extropy Institute ’s Vital Progress Summit I in 2004 .
The precautionary principle has been used as a means of deciding whether to allow an activity ( typically involving corporate activity and technological innovation ) that might have undesirable side - effects on human health or the environment .
In practice , that principle is strongly biased against the technological progress so vital to the continued survival and well - being of humanity .
Understanding that we need to develop and deploy new technologies to feed billions more people over the coming decades , to counter natural threats from pathogens to environmental changes , and to alleviate human suffering from disease , damage , and the ravages of aging , those involved in the VP Summit recognized two things :
The importance of critically analyzing the precautionary principle , and the formation of an alternative , more sophisticated principle that incorporates more extensive and accurate assessment of options while protecting our fundamental responsibility and liberty to experiment and innovate .
The precautionary principle , while well - intended by many of its proponents , inherently biases decision making institutions toward the status quo , and reflects a reactive , excessively pessimistic view of technological progress .
By contrast , the Proactionary Principle urges all parties to actively take into account all the consequences of an activity — good as well as bad — while apportioning precautionary measures to the real threats we face , in the context of an appreciation of the crucial role played by technological innovation and humanity ’s evolving ability to adapt to and remedy any undesirable side - effects .
While precaution itself implies using foresight to anticipate and prepare for possible threats , the principle that has formed around it threatens human well - being .
The precautionary principle has become enshrined in many international environmental treaties and regulations , making it urgent to offer an alternative principle and set of criteria .
The need for the Proactionary Principle will become clear if we understand the flaws of the precautionary principle .
Principle Against Progress
The precautionary principle appears to have originated with the German principle of Vorsorgeprinzip .
No single formulation of the principle has been universally adopted .
Variations exist between influential formulations , such as those involved in the North - Sea conferences from 1984 to 1995 , as well as those expressed in the Rio Declaration of 1992 and the UN Framework Climate Convention of 1992 .
All versions do have in common three elements :
The possibility of harm to humans or the environment , resulting from a technology or activity ; scientific uncertainty regarding cause - effect relationships ; and the justifiability of taking precautionary measures .
According to the popular and relatively clear version found in The Wingspread Declaration ( 1999 ) , the precautionary principle states that :
“ When an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment , precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not established scientifically .
In this context , the proponent of the activity , rather than the public , should bear the burden of proof . ”
Al alternative formulation :
We should permit no new technology to be developed and no new productive activity to take place unless we can scientifically prove that no harm to health or environment will result .
Statements of the precautionary principle vary in several ways .
It ’s worth making a basic distinction between a weaker and a stronger formulation .
The weaker form refers to threats of serious or irreversible harm or damage .
The stronger version ( such as both of the above statements ) omits this condition and so claims more than the weaker : it calls for precautionary measures even when the possible harm is not a serious or irreversible one .
Variants of the precautionary principle differ in a second important way , depending on whether they include a cost - effectiveness clause .
The Rio Declaration of 1992 incorporated such a clause :
“ Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage , lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost - effective measures . ”
We should also pay attention to a third way in which formulations of the precautionary principle vary .
The particular phrasing of the clause concerning our knowledge of the causal relationship between the alleged threat and health or the environment , shift the burden of proof to different degrees .
If the claim is that that restrictive precautionary measures are justified and required “ if any possibility ” of harm exists , then restrictions of any kind will be much easier to justify .
A less drastic claim says that precautionary measures are justified even if the cause - effect relationship has not been fully established .
All versions of the precautionary principle are inadequate for their purpose , and are systematically skewed against economic and technological progress and development .
It can easily be wielded to prevent the introduction of all kinds of new technologies .
A wide range of international environmental treaties and regulations already incorporate the principle and use it to restrict numerous activities .
Alar , a chemical for regulating growth in apples , was withdrawn from distribution in 1989 following misinformed public clamor regarding its alleged carcinogenicity .
Dr. Elizabeth Whelan has noted how the principle has been used to ban “ a health - enhancing chemical like chlorine ” because of doubtful “ adverse effects on wildlife — or its effect in high dose laboratory animal experiments . ”
The precautionary principle is a favorite tool of those who oppose medical applications of biotechnology as well as any form of agricultural biotechnology , especially genetically modified crops and livestock .
GM foods and medical biotech have enormous potential for meeting global needs for improved health and adequate nutrition .
The effects of a widely applied precautionary principle would be disastrous for countries that need to use pesticides or genetically modified crops to feed their populations .
What ’s wrong with the Precautionary Principle ?
The precautionary principle has at least six major weak spots .
It serves us badly by :
assuming worst - case scenarios distracting attention from established threats to health , especially natural risks assuming that the effects of regulation and restriction are all positive or neutral , never negative ignoring potential benefits of technology and inherently favoring nature over humanity illegitimately shifting the burden of proof and unfavorably positioning the proponent of the activity conflicting with more balanced , common - law approaches to risk and harm .
First , the precautionary principle always assumes worst - case scenarios .
Any release of chemicals into the environment might initiate a chain of events leading to a disaster .
Genetically modified organisms might cause unanticipated , serious , and irreversible problems .
By imagining the proposed technology or project primarily in a worst - case scenario — while assuming that refraining from action will have no disastrous consequences — the adherents of the principle immediately tilt the playing field in their favor .
Second , the precautionary principle ignores background risk , distracting our attention from established dangers to health .
Nature itself brings with it a risk of harms such as infection , hunger , famine , and environmental disruption .
We should apply our limited resources first to major risks that we know are real , not merely hypothetical .
The more we attend to merely hypothetical threats to health and environment , the less money , time , and effort will remain to deal with substantial health problems that are highly probable or thoroughly established .
The principle errs in focusing on future technological harms that might occur , while ignoring natural risks that are actually occurring .
Third , adherents of the precautionary principle assume that proposed regulations and restrictions will cause no harm to health .
Yet the very application of the principle itself can endanger our health .
Consider , for instance , the consistent correlation between the health of a nation ’s citizens and their standard of living .
Widespread application of the precautionary principle , by hampering economic activity , will tend to reduce living standards and thereby worsen health .
In addition , major efforts to eliminate small , speculative risks can unleash far greater and more likely harms .
Fourth , the precautionary principle fails to treat natural and human threats on the same basis .
Users of the principle routinely ignore the potential benefits of technology , in effect favoring nature over humanity .
The principle does not account for the fact that the risks created by technological stagnation are at least as real as those of technological advancement .
As biochemist Bruce Ames of UCLA has demonstrated , almost all of our exposure to dangerous chemicals comes in the form of natural chemicals .
Yet fear and attention are primarily directed toward synthetic chemicals .
A particular chemical has the same effects regardless of whether its source is natural or synthetic .
Despite this , scientifically unsound activists treat human - derived chemicals as guilty until proven innocent , and naturally occurring chemicals as innocent or insignificant .
Fifth , the precautionary principle illegitimately shifts the burden of proof by positioning advocates of proposed activities or new technologies as reckless , in contrast with the “ responsible ” advocates of “ precaution ” .
The content — even the very name — of the precautionary principle positions environmental activists and Luddites as friends and protectors of the common person .
The innovators are made to prove safety , having already been portrayed as indifferent to the common good and interested only in profiting .
Having illegitimately shifted the burden of proof , activists can impose their values without troubling themselves with evidence and without taking responsibility for the results of overly - precautious policies .
For example , the Environmental Working Group opposed the use of pesticides , speculating about possible carcinogenic effects of trace amounts of their residues .
They do not seem to have taken into account the probability that restricting pesticides would increase cancer rates .
Activists get away with the burden of proof trick by managing perceptions of risk instead of examining the real risks .
This move is particularly dangerous because we have limited resources to address a multitude of risks .
We cannot afford to make decisions driven by manipulated perceptions .
It ’s crucial that we rely on a comprehensive , scientifically grounded perspective when choosing which risks have the strongest claim on our attention .
Sixth , and finally , the precautionary principle conflicts with the more balanced approach to risk and harm derived from common law .
Common law holds us liable for injuries we cause , our liability being proportionate with the degree of foreseeable risk .
By contrast , the precautionary principle dismisses liability and acts like a preliminary injunction — but without the involvement of a court , without the burden of proof , and without taking responsibility for harm caused by the injunction . [ 1 ]
The Essence of the Proactionary Principle
If the precautionary principle had been widely applied in the past , technological and cultural progress would have ground to a halt .
Human suffering would have persisted without relief , and life would have remained poor , nasty , brutish , and short :
No chlorination and no pathogen - free water ; no electricity generation or transmission ; no X - rays ; no travel beyond the range of walking .
Most activities involving technology will have undesired effects as well as desirable ones .
Whereas the precautionary principle is often used to take an absolutist stand against an activity , the Proactionary Principle allows for handling mixed effects through compensation and remediation instead of prohibition .
The Proactionary Principle recognizes that nature is not always kind , that improving our world is both natural and essential for humanity , and that stagnation is not a realistic or worthy option .
The Proactionary Principle stands for the proactive pursuit of progress .
Being proactive involves not only anticipating before acting , but learning by acting .
When technological progress is halted , people lose an essential freedom and the accompanying opportunities to learn through diverse experiments .
We already suffer from an undeveloped capacity for rational decision making .
Prohibiting technological change will only stunt that capacity further .
Continuing needs to alleviate global human suffering and desires to achieve human flourishing should make obvious the folly of stifling our freedom to learn
XMM -Newton Detects Pulsed Heartbeat Of A Weird New Type Of Star
by Staff Writers
Paris , France ( SPX ) Dec 24 , 2007
XMM -Newton has detected periodic X - ray emission , or the pulsed heartbeat of a weird new type of star .
Collecting the X - rays from the so - called rotating radio transient has confirmed the nature of the underlying celestial object and given astronomers a new insight into these exotic objects .
The observations were made using XMM - Newton 's European Photon Imaging Camera ( EPIC ) , which targeted the celestial object RRAT J1819 - 1458 .
Astronomers observed the object for around 12 hours and detected pulsations in the X - ray data that show the source to be rotating once every 4.26 seconds .
Previously , astronomers had only seen radio outbursts from this object .
It erupts every three minutes or so with a brief burst of radio emission lasting just 3 milliseconds .
Such behaviour defines the object as a rotating radio transient ( RRAT ) .
The RRATs were announced in February 2006 .
Eleven objects were found using the Parkes radio telescope .
Astronomers suspected that RRATs were neutron stars , the compact remnants of dead stars made of neutrons and measuring just 10 - 12 km across yet containing more matter than the Sun .
They are therefore extremely dense .
Most observed neutron stars are radio pulsars ; rotating quickly and sweeping lighthouse beams of radiation across space that make them appear to pulsate .
The RRATs , however , were only detected through their radio bursts .
The new XMM - Newton observations show that periodic emission , linked to the object 's rotation , can be detected in X - rays .
" It is now definite that RRATs are rotating neutron stars as we can see the 4.26 - second rotation period of the RRAT in the X - ray data , " says Maura McLaughlin , West Virginia University , USA , who took the lead in the research .
In addition to the identification of the underlying celestial object from the discovery of the X - ray pulsations , XMM - Newton also revealed another facet of the RRAT 's behaviour .
Something appears to be absorbing certain frequencies of the X - rays after they are emitted from the surface of the neutron star .
The absorption could either be happening in an atmosphere of gases surrounding the neutron star or by particles trapped in the neutron star 's magnetic field .
If the second reason is the cause of the absorption , it would indicate that the magnetic field of this RRAT is strong .
" We can't say for sure where the absorption is coming from with these observations , " says Nanda Rea , University of Amsterdam , Netherlands .
She estimates that an observation twice as long would collect enough data to determine where the absorption is taking place .
She also hopes to follow - up this observation by targeting other RRATs .
Before that can happen , however , the team must refine the positions they have for these objects .
To do this , they continue to observe the RRATs with radio telescopes across the world , timing the outbursts .
From careful measurements of the arrival times of the bursts over the course of the year , their positions in the sky can be determined more accurately .
Once these locations are known , X - ray telescopes can be pointed in their direction .
Since the original discovery of 11 RRATs , McLaughlin 's team has found an additional 10 .
This indicates that they may form a substantial population in the Milky Way , with over 100 000 of them dotted around our galaxy .
Discovery of pulsations and a possible spectral feature in the X - Ray emission from rotating radio transient J1819 - 1458 by M. McLaughlin , N. Rea , B. Gaensler , S. Chatterjee , F. Camilo , M. Kramer , D. Lorimer , A. Lyne , G. Israel , and A. Possenti is published in The Astrophysical Journal .
Shadow Government
The New Order of the Barbarians
Part ONE Editorial Note :
This is a transcript of the first of three tapes on the " New Order of Barbarians " , referred to on the tapes simply as the " new world system . "
Tapes one and two , done in 1988 , are the reminiscences By Dr. Lawrence Dunegan , of a speech given March 20 , 1969 by Dr. Richard Day , an insider of the " Order " , whose credentials are given in an interview with Dr. Dunegan on tape three .
The moderator in the final taped interview with Dr. Dunegan is Randy Engel , National Director , US Coalition for Life .
It 's interesting to note that Dr. Dunegan " spilled the beans " in 1988 .
According to the bio information , Dr. Day died shortly thereafter , in 1989 .
It could be a coincidence since Dr. Day was elderly when he died , and then again ....
Most of you reading this are very well aware , already , of many of the details involved in the diabolical plan to bring about a New World Order .
As much as we all know , hearing about the " HOW " from the words of an insider is spine chilling .
I believe these tapes COULD change many lives and awaken many more people to the REALITY of what lies ahead if we do n't stop the process .
There are many more millions of US than there are the planners .
The useful idiots  their words , not ours  who are helping the process along know NOT what they do .
If they DID know , they would stop , because they would KNOW that they , too , will be either terminated or become part of a GLOBAL SLAVE CAMP .
Dr. Dunegan reveals not just " WHAT " is intended for America and all people in the world , but " HOW " the controllers intend to carry out their plan .
He covers topics such as :
IS there a power , A force or a group of men organizing and redirecting change ?
" Everything is in place and nobody can stop us now . . . "
People will have to get used to change  everything will change , constantly
The REAL and the " STATED " goals
Population Control
Permission to have babies
Redirecting the purpose of sex - sex without reproduction and reproduction without sex
Sex education as a tool of World Government
Encouraging homosexuality ...
Sex , anything goes
Uthanasia and the " Demise Pill "
Limiting access to affordable medical care makes eliminating the elderly easier
Planning the control over medicine
Elimination of private doctors

Dr. Lawrence Dunegan THE NEW ORDER OF BARBARIANS IS THERE A POWER , A FORCE OR A GROUP OF MEN ORGANIZING AND REDIRECTING CHANGE ?
There has been much written , and much said , by some people who have looked at all the changes that have occurred in American society in the past 20 years or so , and who have looked retrospectively to earlier history of the United States , and indeed , of the world , and come to the conclusion that there is a conspiracy of sorts which influences , indeed controls , major historical events , not only in the United States , but around the world .
This conspiratorial interpretation of history is based on people making observations from the outside , gathering evidence and coming to the conclusion that from the outside they see a conspiracy .
Their evidence and conclusions are based on evidence gathered in retrospect .
Period .
I want to now describe what I heard from a speaker in 1969 which in several weeks will be 20 years ago .
The speaker did not speak in terms of retrospect , but rather predicting changes that would be brought about in the future .
The speaker was not looking from the outside in , thinking that he saw conspiracy , rather , he was on the inside , admitting that , indeed , there was an organized power , force , group of men , who wielded enough influence to determine major events involving countries around the world .
And he predicted , or rather expounded on , changes that were planned for the remainder of this century .
As you listen , if you can recall the situation , at least in the United States in 1969 and the few years thereafter , and then recall the kinds of changes which have occurred between then and now , almost 20 years later , I believe you will be impressed with the degree to which the things that were planned to be brought about have already been accomplished .
Some of the things that were discussed were not intended to be accomplished yet by 1988 .
[ Ed. Note : the year Dr. Dunegan made this tape ] but are intended to be accomplished before the end of this century .
There is a timetable ; and it was during this session that some of the elements of the timetable were brought out .
Anyone who recalls early in the days of the Kennedy Presidency . . the Kennedy campaign . . when he spoke of " progress in the decade of the 60s " ; that was kind of a cliche in those days - " the decade of the 60s . "
Well , by 1969 our speaker was talking about the decade of the 70s , the decade of the 80s , and the decade of the 90s .
So that ...
I think that terminology that we are looking at .
. . looking at things and expressing things , probably all comes from the same source .
Prior to that time I do n't remember anybody saying " the decade of the 40s and the decade of the 50s .
So I think this overall plan and timetable had taken important shape with more predictability to those who control it , sometime in the late 50s .
That 's speculation on my part .
In any event , the speaker said that his purpose was to tell us about changes which would be brought about in the next 30 years or so . . . so that an entirely new world - wide system would be in operation before the turn of the century .
As he put it , " We plan to enter the 21st Century with a running start .
Everything is in place and nobody can stop us now . . . "
He said  as we listened to what he was about to present  he said , " Some of you will think I 'm talking about Communism .
Well , what I 'm talking about is much bigger than Communism ! "
At that time he indicated that there is much more cooperation between East and West than most people realize .
In his introductory remarks he commented that he was free to speak at this time because now , and I 'm quoting here , " everything is in place and nobody can stop us now . "
That 's the end of that quotation .
He went on to say that most people do n't understand how governments operate and even people in high positions in governments , including our own , do n't really understand how and where decisions are made .
He went on to say that ... he went on to say that people who really influence decisions are names that , for the most part , would be familiar to most of us , but he would not use individuals ' names or names of any specific organization .
But , that if he did , most of the people would be names that were recognized by most of his audience .
He went on to say that they were not primarily people in public office , but people of prominence who were primarily known in their private occupations or private positions .
The speaker was a doctor of medicine , a former professor at a large Eastern university , and he was addressing a group of doctors of medicine , about 80 in number .
His name would not be widely recognized by anybody likely to hear this , and so there is no point in giving his name .
The only purpose in recording this is that it may give a perspective to those who hear it regarding the changes which have already been accomplished in the past 20 years or so , and a bit of a preview to what at least some people are planning for the remainder of this century so that we  or they  would enter the 21st Century with a flying start .
Some of us may not enter that Century .
His purpose in telling our group about these changes that were to be brought about was to make it easier for us to adapt to these changes .
Indeed , as he quite accurately said , they would be and he hopes that we , as sort of his friends , would make the adaptation more easily if we knew somewhat beforehand what to expect .
" PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO GET USED TO CHANGE . . . "
Somewhere in the introductory remarks he insisted that nobody have a tape recorder and that nobody take notes , which for a professor was a very remarkable kind of thing to expect from an audience .
Something in his remarks suggested that there could be negative repercussions against him if his ... if it became widely known what he was about to say to ... our group ... if it became widely known that he spilled the beans , so to speak .
When I heard that , first I thought maybe that was sort of an ego trip , somebody enhancing his own importance .
But as the revelations unfolded , I began to understand why he might have had some concern about not having it widely known what was said , although this ... although this was a fairly public forum where he was speaking , [ where the ] remarks were delivered .
But , nonetheless , he asked that no notes be taken ... no tape recording be used  suggesting there might be some personal danger to himself if these revelations were widely publicized .
Again , as the remarks began to unfold , and I saw the rather outrageous things that were said  at that time they certainly seemed outrageous -- I made it a point to try to remember as much of what he said as I could , and during the subsequent weeks and months and years , to connect my recollections to simple events around me , both to aid my memory for the future in case I wanted to do what I 'm doing now - record this .
And also , to try to maintain a perspective on what would be developing , if indeed , it followed the predicted pattern - which it has !
At this point , so that I do n't forget to include it later , I 'll just include some statements that were made from time to time throughout the presentation ... just having a general bearing on the whole presentation .
One of the statements was having to do with change .
People get used . . the statement was , " People will have to get used to the idea of change , so used to change , that they 'll be expecting change .
Nothing will be permanent . "
This often came out in the context of a society of ... where people seemed to have no roots or moorings , but would be passively willing to accept change simply because it was all they had ever known .
This was sort of in contrast to generations of people up until this time where certain things you expected to be , and remain in place as reference points for your life .
So change was to be brought about , change was to be anticipated and expected , and accepted , no questions asked .
Another comment that was made . . from time to time during the presentation was , " People are too trusting .
People do n't ask the right questions . "
Sometimes , being too trusting was equated with being too dumb .
But sometimes when ... when he would say that and say , " People do n't ask the right questions , " it was almost with a sense of regret , as if he were uneasy with what he was part of , and wished that people would challenge it and maybe not be so trusting .
THE REAL AND THE " STATED " GOALS
Another comment that was repeated from time to time ... this particularly in relation to changing laws and customs ... and specific changes ... he said , " Everything has two purposes .
One is the ostensible purpose which will make it acceptable to people ; and second , is the real purpose which would further the goals of establishing the new system and having it . "
Frequently he would say , " There is just no other way .
There 's just no other way ! "
This seemed to come as a sort of an apology , particularly when ... at the conclusion of describing some particularly offensive changes .
For example , the promotion of drug addiction which we 'll get into shortly .
POPULATION CONTROL
He was very active with population control groups , the population control movement , and population control was really the entry point into specifics following the introduction .
He said the population is growing too fast .
Numbers of people living at any one time on the planet must be limited or we will run out of space to live .
We will outgrow our food supply and we will over - pollute the world with our waste .
PERMISSION TO HAVE BABIES
People wo n't be allowed to have babies just because they want to or because they are careless .
Most families would be limited to two .
Some people would be allowed only one , and the outstanding person or persons might be selected and allowed to have three .
But most people would [ be ] allowed to have only two babies .
That 's because the zero population growth [ rate ] is 2.1 children per completed family .
So something like every 10th family might be allowed the privilege of the third baby .
To me , up to this point , the word " population control " primarily connoted limiting the number of babies to be born .
But this remark , about what people would be " allowed " and then what followed , made it quite clear that when you hear " population control " that means more than just controlling births .
It means control of every endeavor of an entire ... of the entire world population ; a much broader meaning to that term than I had ever attached to it before hearing this .
As you listen and reflect back on some of the things you hear , you will begin to recognize how one aspect dovetails with other aspects in terms of controlling human endeavors .
REDIRECTING THE PURPOSE OF SEX - SEX WITHOUT REPRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION WITHOUT SEX
Well , from population control , the natural next step then was sex .
He said sex must be separated from reproduction .
Sex is too pleasurable , and the urges are too strong , to expect people to give it up .
Chemicals in food and in the water supply to reduce the sex drive is not practical .
The strategy then would be not to diminish sex activity , but to increase sex activity , but in such a way that people wo n't be having babies .
CONTRACEPTION UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE TO ALL
And the first consideration then here was contraception .
Contraception would be very strongly encouraged , and it would be connected so closely in people 's minds with sex , that they would automatically think contraception when they were thinking or preparing for sex .
And contraception would be made universally available .
Nobody wanting contraception would be ... find that they were unavailable .
Contraceptives would be displayed much more prominently in drug stores , right up with the cigarettes and chewing gum .
Out in the open , rather than hidden under the counter where people would have to ask for them and maybe be embarrassed .
This kind of openness was a way of suggesting that contraceptions . . that contraceptives are just as much a part of life as any other items sold in the store .
And , contraceptives would be advertised .
And , contraceptives would be dispensed in the schools in association with sex education !
SEX EDUCATION AS A TOOL OF WORLD GOVERNMENT
The sex education was to get kids interested early , making the connection between sex and the need for contraception early in their lives , even before they became very active .
At this point I was recalling some of my teachers , particularly in high school and found it totally unbelievable to think of them agreeing , much less participating in , distributing of contraceptives to students .
But , that only reflected my lack of understanding of how these people operate .
That was before the school - based clinic programs got started .
Many , many cities in the United States by this time have already set up school - based clinics which are primarily contraception , birth control , population control clinics .
The idea then is that the connection between sex and contraception introduced and reinforced in school would carry over into marriage .
Indeed , if young people  when they matured  decided to get married , marriage itself would be diminished in importance .
He indicated some recognition that most people probably would want to be married ... but that this certainly would not be any longer considered to be necessary for sexual activity .
TAX FUNDED ABORTION AS POPULATION CONTROL
No surprise then , that the next item was abortion .
And this , now back in 1969 , four years before Roe vs. Wade .
He said , " Abortion will no longer be a crime .
Abortion will be accepted as normal " , and would be paid for by taxes for people who could not pay for their own abortions .
Contraceptives would be made available by tax money so that nobody would have to do without contraceptives .
If school sex programs would lead to more pregnancies in children , that was really seen as no problem .
Parents who think they are opposed to abortion on moral or religious grounds will change their minds when it is their own child who is pregnant .
So this will help overcome opposition to abortion .
Before long , only a few die - hards will still refuse to see abortion as acceptable , and they wo n't matter anymore .
ENCOURAGING HOMOSEXUALITY .
SEX , ANYTHING GOES
Homosexuality also was to be encouraged .
" People will be given permission to be homosexual . "
That 's the way it was stated .
They wo n't have to hide it .
And elderly people will be encouraged to continue to have active sex lives into the very old ages , just as long as they can .
Everyone will be given permission to have sex , to enjoy however they want .
Anything goes .
This is the way it was put .
And , I remember thinking , " how arrogant for this individual , or whoever he represents , to feel that they can give or withhold permission for people to do things ! "
But that was the terminology that was used .
In this regard , clothing was mentioned .
Clothing styles would be made more stimulating and provocative .
Recall back in 1969 was the time of the mini skirt , when those mini- skirts were very , very high and revealing .
He said , " It is not just the amount of skin that is exposed that makes clothing sexually seductive , but other , more subtle things are often suggestive , "
. . things like movement , and the cut of clothing , and the kind of fabric , the positioning of accessories on the clothing .
" If a woman has an attractive body , why should she not show it ? " was one of the statements .
There was not detail on what was meant by " provocative clothing , " but since that time if you watched the change in clothing styles , blue jeans are cut in a way that they 're more tight - fitting in the crotch .
They form wrinkles .
Wrinkles are essentially arrows .
Lines which direct one 's vision to certain anatomic areas .
And , this was around the time of the " burn your bra " activity .
He indicated that a lot of women should not go without a bra .
They need a bra to be attractive , so instead of banning bras and burning them , bras would come back .
But they would be thinner and softer allowing more natural movement .
It was not specifically stated , but certainly a very thin bra is much more revealing of the nipple and what else is underneath , than the heavier bras that were in style up to that time .
Technology .
Earlier he said . . sex and reproduction would be separated .
You would have sex without reproduction and then technology was reproduction without sex .
This would be done in the laboratory .
He indicated that already , much , much research was underway about making babies in the laboratory .
There was some elaboration on that , but I do n't remember the details , how much of that technology has come to my attention since that time .
I do n't remember . .
I do n't remember in a way that I can distinguish what was said from what I subsequently have learned as general medical information .
FAMILIES TO DIMINISH IN IMPORTANCE
Families would be limited in size .
We already alluded to not being allowed more than two children .
Divorce would be made easier and more prevalent .
Most people who marry will marry more than once .
More people will not marry .
Unmarried people would stay in hotels and even live together .
That would be very common - nobody would even ask questions about it .
It would be widely accepted as no different from married people being together .
More women will work outside the home .
More men will be transferred to other cities , and in their jobs , more men would travel .
Therefore , it would be harder for families to stay together .
This would tend to make the marriage relationship less stable and , therefore , tend to make people less willing to have babies .
And , the extended families would be smaller , and more remote .
Travel would be easier , less expensive , for a while , so that people who did have to travel would feel they could get back to their families ... not that they were abruptly being made remote from their families .
But one of the net effects of easier divorce laws combined with the promotion of travel , and transferring families from one city to another , was to create instability in the families .
If both husband and wife are working and one partner gets transferred the other one may not be easily transferred .
So one either keeps his or her job and stays behind while the other leaves , or else gives up the job and risks not finding employment in the new location .
Rather a diabolical approach to this whole thing !
EUTHANASIA AND THE " DEMISE PILL "
Everybody has a right to live only so long .
The old are no longer useful .
They become a burden .
You should be ready to accept death .
Most people are .
An arbitrary age limit could be established .
After all , you have a right to only so many steak dinners , so many orgasms , and so many good pleasures in life .
And after you have had enough of them and you 're no longer productive , working , and contributing , then you should be ready to step aside for the next generation .
Some things that would help people realize that they had lived long enough , he mentioned several of these ...
I do n't remember them all ... here are a few :
Use of very pale printing ink on forms that people ... are necessary ... to fill out , so that older people would n't be able to read the pale ink as easily and would need to go to younger people for help .
Automobile traffic patterns - there would be more high - speed traffic lanes . . traffic patterns that would . . that older people with their slower reflexes would have trouble dealing with and thus , lose some of their independence .
LIMITING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE MEDICAL CARE MAKES ELIMINATING THE ELDERLY EASIER
A big item  [ that ] was elaborated at some length  was the cost of medical care would be burdensomely high .
Medical care would be connected very closely with one 's work , but also would be made very , very high in cost so that it would simply be unavailable to people beyond a certain time .
And unless they had a remarkably rich , supporting family , they would just have to do without care .
And the idea was that if everybody says , " Enough !
What a burden it is on the young to try to maintain the old people , " then the young would become agreeable to helping Mom and Dad along the way , provided this was done humanely and with dignity .
And then the real example was - there could be like a nice , farewell party , a real celebration .
Mom and Dad had done a good job .
And then after the party 's over they take the " demise pill . "
PLANNING THE CONTROL OVER MEDICINE
The next topic is Medicine .
There would be profound changes in the practice of medicine .
Overall , medicine would be much more tightly controlled .
The observation was made , " Congress is not going to go along with national health insurance .
That ( in 1969 ) , he said , " is now , abundantly evident .
But it 's not necessary .
We have other ways to control health care . "
These would come about more gradually , but all health care delivery would come under tight control .
Medical care would be closely connected to work .
If you do n't work or can't work , you wo n't have access to medical care .
The days of hospitals giving away free care would gradually wind down , to where it was virtually non-existent .
Costs would be forced up so that people wo n't be able to afford to go without insurance .
People pay ... you pay for it , you 're entitled to it .
It was only subsequently that I began to realize the extent to which you would not be paying for it .
Your medical care would be paid for by others .
And therefore you would gratefully accept , on bended knee , what was offered to you as a privilege .
Your role being responsible for your own care would be diminished .
As an aside here  this is not something that was developed at this time ...
I did n't understand it at the time  as an aside , the way this works , everybody 's made dependent on insurance .
And if you do n't have insurance then you pay directly ; the cost of your care is enormous .
The insurance company , however , paying for your care , does not pay that same amount .
If you are charged , say , $ 600 on your part , they pay $ 300 or $ 400 .
And that differential in billing has the desired effect :
It enables the insurance company to pay for that which you could never pay for .
They get a discount that 's unavailable to you .
When you see your bill you 're grateful that the insurance company could do that .
And in this way you are dependent , and virtually required to have insurance .
The whole billing is fraudulent .
Anyhow , continuing on now ... access to hospitals would be tightly controlled .
Identification would be needed to get into the building .
The security in and around hospitals would be established and gradually increased so that nobody without identification could get in or move around inside the building .
Theft of hospital equipment , things like typewriters and microscopes and so forth would be " allowed " and exaggerated ; reports of it would be exaggerated so that this would be the excuse needed to establish the need for strict security , until people got used to it .
And anybody moving about in a hospital would be required to wear an identification badge with photograph and . . telling why he was there . . employee or lab technician or visitor or whatever .
This is to be brought in gradually  getting everybody used to the idea of identifying themselves  until it was just accepted .
This need for ID to move about would start in small ways : hospitals , some businesses , but gradually expand to include everybody in all places !
It was observed that hospitals can be used to confine people ... for the treatment of criminals .
This did not mean , necessarily , medical treatment .
At that ... at that time , I did not know the word " Psycho - Prison " as in the Soviet Union , but without trying to recall all the details , basically , he was describing the use of hospitals both for treating the sick and for confinement of criminals for reasons other than the medical well - being of the criminal .
The definition of criminal was not given .
ELIMINATION OF PRIVATE DOCTORS
The image of the doctor would change .
No longer would he be seen as an individual professional in service to individual patients .
But the doctor would be gradually recognized as a highly skilled technician ... and his job would change .
The job is to include things like executions by lethal injection .
The image of the doctor being a powerful , independent person would have to be changed .
And he went on to say , " Doctors are making entirely too much money .
They should advertise like any other product . "
Lawyers would be advertising too .
Keep in mind , this was an audience of doctors being addressed by a doctor .
And it was interesting that he would make some rather insulting statements to his audience without fear of antagonizing us .
The solo practitioner would become a thing of the past .
A few die - hards might try to hold out , but most doctors would be employed by an institution of one kind or another .
Group practice would be encouraged , corporations would be encouraged , and then once the corporate image of medical care ... as this gradually became more and more acceptable , doctors would more and more become employees rather than independent contractors .
And along with that , of course , unstated but necessary , is the employee serves his employer , not his patient .
So that 's ... we 've already seen quite a lot of that in the last 20 years .
And apparently more on the horizon .
The term HMO was not used at that time , but as you look at HMOs you see this is the way that medical care is being taken over since the National Health Insurance approach did not get through the Congress .
A few die - hard doctors may try to make a go of it ; remaining in solo practice , remaining independent , which , parenthetically , is me .
But they would suffer a great loss of income .
They'd be able to scrape by , maybe , but never really live comfortably as would those who were willing to become employees of the system .
Ultimately , there would be no room at all for the solo practitioner , after the system is entrenched .
NEW DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE AND UNTREATABLE DISEASES
Next heading to talk about is HEALTH & DISEASE .
He said there would be new diseases to appear which had not ever been seen before .
Would be very difficult to diagnose and be untreatable  at least for a long time .
No elaboration was made on this , but I remember , not long after hearing this presentation , when I had a puzzling diagnosis to make , I would be wondering , " Is this ... was what he was talking about ?
Is this a case of what he was talking about ? " .
Some years later , as AIDS ultimately developed , I think AIDS was at least one example of what he was talking about .
I now think that AIDS probably was a manufactured disease .
SUPPRESSING CANCER CURES AS A MEANS OF POPULATION CONTROL ... CANCER .
He said , " We can cure almost every cancer right now .
Information is on file in the Rockefeller Institute , if it 's ever decided that it should be released .
But consider - if people stop dying of cancer , how rapidly we would become overpopulated .
You may as well die of cancer as something else . "
Efforts at cancer treatment would be geared more toward comfort than toward cure .
There was some statement ultimately the cancer cures which were being hidden in the Rockefeller Institute would come to light because independent researchers might bring them out , despite these efforts to suppress them .
But at least for the time being , letting people die of cancer was a good thing to do because it would slow down the problem of overpopulation .
INDUCING HEART ATTACKS AS A FORM OF ASSASSINATION
Another very interesting thing was heart attacks .
He said , " There is now a way to simulate a real heart attack .
It can be used as a means of assassinates . "
Only a very skilled pathologist who knew exactly what to look for at an autopsy , could distinguish this from the real thing .
I thought that was a very surprising and shocking thing to hear from this particular man at that particular time .
This , and the business of the cancer cure , really still stand out sharply in my memory , because they were so shocking and , a that time , seemed to me out of character .
He then went on to talk about nutrition and exercise , sort of in the same framework .
People would not have to ... people would have to eat right and exercise right to live as long as before .
Most wo n't .
This , in the connection of nutrition , there was no specific statement that I can recall as to particular nutrients that would be either inadequate or in excess .
In retrospect , I tend to think he meant high salt diets and high fat diets would predispose toward high blood pressure and premature arteriosclerotic heart disease .
And that if people who were too dumb or too lazy to exercise as they should then their dietary ... their circulating fats go up and predispose to disease .
And he said something about diet information  about proper diet  would be widely available , but most people  particularly stupid people , who had no right to continue living anyway  they would ignore the advice and just go on and eat what was convenient and tasted good .
There were some other unpleasant things said about food .
I just can't recall what they were .
But I do remember of ... having reflections about wanting to plant a garden in the backyard to get around whatever these contaminated foods would be .
I regret I do n't remember the details ... the rest of this ... about nutrition and hazardous nutrition .
With regard to Exercise .
He went on to say that more people would be exercising more , especially running , because everybody can run .
You do n't need any special equipment or place .
You can run wherever you are .
As he put it , " people will be running all over the place . "
And in this vein , he pointed out how supply produces demand .
And this was in reference to athletic clothing and equipment .
As this would be made more widely available and glamorized , particularly as regards running shoes , this would stimulate people to develop an interest in running and  as part of a whole sort of public propaganda campaign  people would be encouraged then to buy the attractive sports equipment and to get into exercise .
Again ... well in connection with nutrition he also mentioned that public eating places would rapidly increase .
That ... this had a connection with the family too .
As more and more people eat out , eating at home would become less important .
People would be less dependent on their kitchens at home .
And then this also connected to convenience foods being made widely available  things like you could pop into the microwave .
Whole meals would be available pre-fixed .
And of course , we 've now seen this ... and some pretty good ones .
But this whole different approach to eating out and to previously prepared meals being eaten in the home was predicted at that time to be brought about  convenience foods .
The convenience foods would be part of the hazards .
Anybody who was lazy enough to want the convenience foods rather than fixing his own also had better be energetic enough to exercise .
Because if he was too lazy to exercise and too lazy to fix his own food , then he did n't deserve to live very long .
This was all presented as sort of a moral judgment about people and what they should do with their energies .
People who are smart , who would learn about nutrition , and who are disciplined enough to eat right and exercise right are better people  and the kind you want to live longer .
EDUCATION AS A TOOL FOR ACCELERATING THE ONSET OF PUBERTY AND EVOLUTION
Somewhere along in here there was also something about accelerating the onset of puberty .
And this was said in connection with health , and later in connection with education , and connecting to accelerating the process of evolutionary change .
There was a statement that " we think that we can push evolution faster and in the direction we want it to go . "
I remember this only as a general statement .
I do n't recall if any details were given beyond that .
BLENDING ALL RELIGIONS  THE OLD RELIGIONS WILL HAVE TO GO
Another area of discussion was RELIGION .
This is an avowed atheist speaking .
And he said , " Religion is not necessarily bad .
A lot of people seem to need religion , with it 's mysteries and rituals  so they will have religion . "
But the major religions of today have to be changed because they are not compatible with the changes to come .
The old religions will have to go .
Especially Christianity .
Once the Roman Catholic Church is brought down , the rest of Christianity will follow easily .
Then a new religion can be accepted for use all over the world .
It will incorporate something from all of the old ones to make it more easy for people to accept it , and feel at home in it .
Most people wo n't be too concerned with religion .
They will realize that they do n't need it .
CHANGING THE BIBLE THROUGH REVISIONS OF KEY WORDS
In order to do this , the Bible will be changed .
It will be rewritten to fit the new religion .
Gradually , key words will be replaced with new words having various shades of meaning .
Then , the meaning attached to the new word can be close to the old word .
And as time goes on , other shades of meaning of that word can be emphasized , and then gradually that word replaced with another word .
I do n't know if I 'm making that clear .
But the idea is that everything in Scripture need not be rewritten , just key words replaced by other words .
And the variability in meaning attached to any word can be used as a tool to change the entire meaning of Scripture , and therefore make it acceptable to this new religion .
Most people wo n't know the difference ; and this was another one of the times where he said , " the few who do notice the difference wo n't be enough to matter . "
THE CHURCHES WILL HELP
Then followed one of the most surprising statements of the whole presentation :
He said , " some of you probably think the churches wo n't stand for this , " and he went on to say , " The churches will help us ! "
There was no elaboration on this ; it was unclear just what he had in mind when he said , " the churches will help us ! "
In retrospect , I think some of us now can understand what he might have meant at that time .
I recall then only of thinking , " no they wo n't ! " and remembering our Lord 's words where he said to Peter , " Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my Church , and gates of Hell will not prevail against it . "
So ... yes , some people in the churches might help .
And in the subsequent 20 years we 've seen how some people in churches have helped .
But we also know that our Lord 's Words will stand , and the gates of Hell will NOT prevail .
RESTRUCTURING EDUCATION AS A TOOL OF INDOCTRINATION
Another area of discussion was Education .
And one of the things in connection with education that I remember connecting with what he said about religion , was  in addition to changing the Bible  he said that the classics in Literature would be changed .
I seem to recall Mark Twain 's writings was given as one example .
But he said , the casual reader reading a revised version of a classic would never even suspect that there was any change .
And , somebody would have to go through word by word to even recognize that any change was made in these classics ; the changes would be so subtle .
But the changes would be such as to promote the acceptability of the new system .
MORE TIME IN SCHOOLS , BUT THEY " WOULDN'T LEARN ANYTHING . "
As regards education , he indicated that kids would spend more time in schools , but in many schools they would n't learn anything .
They 'll learn some things , but not as much as formerly .
Better schools in better areas with better people  their kids will learn more .
In the better schools , learning would be accelerated .
And this is another time where he said , " We think we can push evolution . "
By pushing kids to learn more , he seemed to be suggesting that their brains would evolve , that their offspring would evolve  sort of pushing evolution  where kids would learn and be more intelligent at a younger age .
As if this pushing would alter their physiology .
Overall , schooling would be prolonged .
This meant prolonged through the school year .
I 'm not sure what he said about a long school day , I do remember he said that school was planned to go all summer , that the summer school vacation would become a thing of the past .
Not only for schools , but for other reasons .
People would begin to think of vacation times year round , not just in the summer .
For most people , it would take longer to complete their education .
To get what originally had been in a bachelor 's program would now require advanced degrees and more schooling .
So that a lot of school time would be just wasted time .
Good schools would become more competitive .
I inferred when he said that , that he was including all schools  elementary up through college  but I do n't recall whether he said that .
Students would have to decide at a younger age what they would want to study and get onto their track early , if they would qualify .
It would be harder to change to another field of study once you get started .
Studies would be concentrated in much greater depth , but narrowed .
You would n't have access to material in other fields , outside your own area of study , without approval .
This seem to be more ... where he talked about limited access to other fields ...
I seem to recall that as being more at the college level , high school and college level , perhaps .
People would be very specialized in their own area of expertise .
But they wo n't be able to get a broad education and wo n't be able to understand what is going on overall .
CONTROLLING WHO HAS ACCESS TO INFORMATION
He was already talking about computers in education , and at that time he said anybody who wanted computer access , or access to books that were not directly related to their field of study would have to have a very good reason for so doing .
Otherwise , access would be denied .
SCHOOLS AS THE HUB OF THE COMMUNITY
Another angle was that the schools would become more important in people 's overall life .
Kids in addition to their academics , would have to get into school activities unless they wanted to feel completely out of it .
But spontaneous activities among kids  the thing that came to my mind when I heard this was sandlot football and sandlot baseball teams that we worked up as kids growing up .
I said the kids wanting any activities outside of school would be almost forced to get them through the school .
There would be few opportunities outside .
Now the pressures of the accelerated academic program , the accelerated demands , where kids would feel they had to be part of something  one or another athletic club or some school activity  these pressures he recognized would cause some students to burn out .
He said , " the smartest ones will learn how to cope with pressures and to survive .
There will be some help available to students in handling stress , but the unfit wo n't be able to make it .
They will then move on to other things . "
In this connection , and later on in the connection with drug abuse and alcohol abuse , he indicated that psychiatric services to help would be increased dramatically .
In all the pushing for achievement , it was recognized that many people would need help , and the people worth keeping around would be able to accept and benefit from that help , and still be super - achievers .
Those who could not would fall by the wayside and therefore were sort of dispensable  " expendable " 
I guess is the word I want .
Education would be lifelong .
Adults would be going to school .
There 'll always be new information that adults must have to keep up .
When you can't keep up anymore , you 're too old .
This was another way of letting older people know that the time had come for them to move on and take the demise pill .
If you get too tired to keep up with your education , or you got too old to learn new information , then this was a signal  you begin to prepare to get ready to step aside .
SOME BOOKS WOULD JUST DISAPPEAR FROM THE LIBRARIES
In addition to revising the classics , which I alluded to awhile ago - with revising the Bible , he said , " some books would just disappear from the libraries . "
This was in the vein that some books contain information or contain ideas that should not be kept around .
And therefore , those books would disappear .
I do n't remember exactly if he said how this was to be accomplished .
But I seem to recall carrying away this idea that this would include thefts .
That certain people would be designated to go to certain libraries and pick up certain books and just get rid of them .
Not necessarily as a matter of policy  just simply steal it .
Further down the line , not everybody will be allowed to own books .
And some books NOBODY will be allowed to own .
CHANGING LAWS
Another area of discussion was laws that would be changed .
At that time a lot of States had blue laws about Sunday sales , certain Sunday activities .
He said the blue laws would all be repealed .
Gambling laws would be repealed or relaxed , so that gambling would be increased .
He indicated then that governments would get into gambling .
We 've had a lot of state lotteries pop up around the country since then .
And , at the time , we were already being told that would be the case .
" Why should all that gambling money be kept in private hands when the State would benefit from it ? " was the rational behind it .
But people should be able to gamble if they want to .
So it would become a civil activity , rather than a private , or illegal activity .
Bankruptcy laws would be changed .
I do n't remember the details , but just that they would be changed .
And I know subsequent to that time they have been .
Antitrust laws would be changed , or be interpreted differently , or both .
In connection with the changing anti-trust laws , there was some statement that in a sense , competition would be increased .
But this would be increased competition within otherwise controlled circumstances .
So it 's not a free competition .
I recall of having the impression that it was like competition but within members of a club .
There would be nobody outside the club would be able to compete .
Sort of like teams competing within a professional league ... if you 're the NFL or the American or National Baseball Leagues , you compete within the league but the league is all in agreement on what the rules of competition are  not a really free competition .
ENCOURAGEMENT OF DRUG ABUSE TO CREATE A JUNGLE ATMOSPHERE
Drug use would be increased .
Alcohol use would be increased .
Law enforcement efforts against drugs would be increased .
On first hearing that , it sounded like a contradiction .
Why increase drug abuse and simultaneously increase law enforcement against drug abuse ?
But the idea is that , in part , the increased availability of drugs would provide a sort of law of the jungle whereby the weak and the unfit would be selected out .
There was a statement made at the time : " Before the earth was overpopulated , there was a law of the jungle where only the fittest survived . "
You had to be able to protect yourself against the elements and wild animals and disease .
And if you were fit , you survived .
But now we 've become so civilized  we 're over civilized  and the unfit are enabled to survive , only at the expense of those who are more fit .
And the abusive drugs then , would restore , in a certain sense , the law of the jungle , and selection of the fittest for survival .
News about drug abuse and law enforcement efforts would tend to keep drugs in the public consciousness .
And would also tend to reduce this unwarranted American complacency that the world is a safe place , and a nice place .
ALCOHOL ABUSE
The same thing would happen with alcohol .
Alcohol abuse would be both promoted and demoted at the same time .
The vulnerable and the weak would respond to the promotions and , therefore , use and abuse more alcohol .
Drunk driving would become more of a problem ; and stricter rules about driving under the influence would be established so that more and more people would lose their privilege to drive .
RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL
This also had connection with something we 'll get to later about overall restrictions on travel .
Not everybody should be free to travel the way they do now in the United States .
People do n't have a need to travel that way .
It 's a privilege !
It was a kind of a high - handed way it was put .
Again , much more in the way of psychological services would be made available to help those who got hooked on drugs and alcohol .
The idea being , that in order to promote this  drug and alcohol abuse to screen out some of the unfit people who are otherwise pretty good  would also be subject to getting hooked .
And if they were really worth their salt they would have enough sense to seek psychological counseling and to benefit from it .
So this was presented as sort of a redeeming value on the part of the planners .
It was as if he were saying , " you think we 're bad in promoting these evil things  but look how nice we are  we 're also providing a way out ! "
THE NEED FOR MORE JAILS , AND USING HOSPITALS AS JAILS
More jails would be needed .
Hospitals could serve as jails .
Some new hospital construction would be designed so as to make them adaptable to jail - like use .
What is it about artificial sweeteners ?
As never before , they pervade the American diet -- in pink , yellow and blue packets on diner counters , in sugar - free cookies and diet juices , in sodas and smoothies and low - calorie yogurt and boxes of powder for baking .
And , as ever , many Americans view them with suspicion .
Every few years , a study links one to cancer .
People get scared .
Follow - up research finds nothing to worry about .
Decades may pass , but sooner or later another scary study comes along .
And still , we keep eating these faux sugars .

Today , nearly 200 million Americans consume sugar - free or low - calorie products , according to the Calorie Control Council , a group that represents the diet food industry .
About half of those people consume an average of four of these products every day .
Diet sodas make up 29 % of the nation ’s $ 200 - million annual soft drink sales , and the percentage is rising , says John Sicher , editor and publisher of the trade journal Beverage Digest .
That we ’re consuming artificial sweeteners is clear .
Whether we ’ll ever do so with total ease is not .
Suspicions about the safety of man-made sweeteners started soon after saccharin was invented more than a century ago .
Studies , later disputed , led to warning labels on one sweetening product , the banning of another , intermittent mistrust of others .
The most recent volley in the sweetener wars came from researchers in Italy who say aspartame causes cancer in rats .
Similar fears have been levied about newer sweeteners , including sucralose , commonly known as Splenda .

Supporters and critics of the substances each criticize the methods and motives of the other side .
Many food chemists say it is impossible for people to eat or drink enough of any man-made sweetener to cause health problems .
Sweetener skeptics , on the other hand , say that safety studies are often funded with industry dollars and there are n’t enough data to be sure about the safety of most artificial sweeteners .
Behind the seemingly endless cycles of debate , there may be something cultural at work in the way we think about what we eat , says USC sociologist Barry Glassner , author of “ The Gospel of Food , ” which urges people to abandon food fads in favor of calmer attitudes toward eating .
A few generations ago , Glassner says , people looked to science and technology as salvation -- it was the time of Kool - Aid , Tupperware and pasteurized processed cheese .

Today , he says , there ’s an increasing emphasis on “ natural , ” a view that demonizes anything in our food that comes out of labs .
Instead of electric colors and chemical flavors , increasingly our culture worships whole grains , organic greens and local produce .
“ There is tremendous nostalgia , right now , for an imagined past in which everything we ate was pure and came straight out of some magically clean Earth , ” Glassner says .
“ That never existed -- except in our imagination . ”
In line with this cultural shift , some people are turning to a new crop of sweeteners based on “ natural ” ingredients , such as stevia , a calorie - free herb from South and Central America .
Already popular in Asia , stevia is now available in the U.S. in natural food stores ( U.S. food companies ca n’t yet include it in their products ) , and sales of it rose 19 % in the last year , according to SPINS , a natural - products market research firm .
Cargill Inc. is working with Coca - Cola Co. to test the safety of what they say is an aftertaste - free stevia - derived sweetener , rebiana , which they hope to introduce to American taste buds .

The Food and Drug Administration has approved five artificial sweeteners for use in the United States : saccharin ( found in Sweet ’N Low and Tab ) , aspartame ( in NutraSweet , Equal , Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi ) , sucralose ( Splenda , and in Diet Hanson ’s sodas ) , neotame ( in newer formulations of Tang and some sparkling waters ) and acesulfame potassium ( Sweet One , Sunnett and , with Splenda , in Diet Snapple and Diet Rite ) .
Others are under review .
Another sweetener , cyclamate , which used to be in the U.S. versions of Tab and Fresca , has been banned in the United States for decades , after studies -- later disputed -- conducted in the 1960s and 1970s showed a cancer link in rodents .
( Cyclamate is legal in Canada and in dozens of other countries and is found in Canadian Sweet ’N Low instead of saccharin .
That ’s because saccharin -- legal in the U.S. -- is banned in Canada . )
Each sweetening product uses a different type of molecule ( or blend of them ) to trick the tongue into thinking it ’s tasting something sweet .
Thanks to the substances ’ chemistry , it takes only a tiny amount of each to trigger the same taste receptors that recognize sugar molecules .
That makes them hundreds and in some cases tens of thousands of times sweeter than the real stuff .
( A can of Coke , for example , contains about 10 teaspoons of sugar , while a can of diet Coke contains less than a tenth of a teaspoon of aspartame . )
Because artificial sweeteners work in such small quantities , they add virtually no calories to a drink or food .
Some , in fact , are n’t even digested by the body .
And , unlike sugar , none raise insulin or glucose levels , making them popular with diabetics .

Saccharin and aspartame , which have been around the longest , have received the most heat from studies investigating their safety .
--
Saccharin
Saccharin first hit human taste buds in 1879 , when a Johns Hopkins University chemist accidentally spilled a substance he was working with on his hand and later noticed a sweet taste while eating dinner .
Its popularity grew during the sugar shortages of World War I ; Sweet ’N Low hit the U.S. market in 1957 .

In 1975 , a Canadian study found that male rats experienced increased rates of bladder cancer after consuming high doses of saccharin .
Media reports at the time stated that the amount rats were eating was the equivalent of a person drinking 800 diet sodas a day .
Other studies had similiar findings , and as a result , from 1981 until 2000 , products containing saccharin required warning labels in the U.S .
The requirement was reversed after the U.S. National Toxicology Program at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences found fault with the data and removed saccharin from the list of suspected human carcinogens .
( The FDA banned cyclamate in 1970 based on similar evidence of bladder cancer in rats .
But later studies failed to verify the link , and the FDA is reconsidering . )
Some scientists disagree with the decision to de-list saccharin in the U.S. and wish that more studies were being done .
Toxicologist James Huff , associate director for chemical carcinogenesis at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , says the decision was more political than scientific .
“ In my experience . . . when you find something that is carcinogenic in animals , we have to believe that it will cause cancer in humans under certain exposure circumstances , " Huff says .

Aspartame
Aspartame was first linked to cancer in the 1970s , when hundreds of rats exposed to the chemical developed higher rates of brain tumors .
Then , in 1996 , scientists attempted to link an observed four - to fivefold rise in human brain cancer between the late 1970s and mid-1980s to increased use of aspartame .
But further analysis found inconsistencies in both sets of data .
Long - term rodent studies over the decades have found no signs of harm .
And a 2006 analysis of 10 years ’ worth of data from more than 450,000 adults collected by the National Cancer Institute showed no link between aspartame use and cancer rates .
Advertisement
But the aspartame discussion is n’t over .
In two studies published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives in 2006 and 2007 , a group at the European Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences in Bologna , Italy , presented what they say is the first real evidence that aspartame causes multiple types of cancer in animals .
In their first study , the Ramazzini group exposed hundreds of 8 - week - old rats to varying doses of aspartame .
In the second , they began exposing rats to aspartame as fetuses .
The Italian researchers reported that their rats started to develop nearly twice as many cases of lymphoma , leukemia and other cancers when consuming the equivalent of 20 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight .
By comparison , the average American consumes about 5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight daily .
And the FDA recommends people eat no more than 50 milligrams / kilogram of body weight each day -- the equivalent of 97 packets of Equal , or 20 cans of diet soda , for a 150 - pound person .
Advertisement
Based on its findings , the Italian group has urged governments to review regulations about aspartame in foods and beverages , especially ones consumed by children .
The researchers ca n’t yet explain how aspartame might cause cancer , but one theory involves the sweetener ’s chemical structure .
Aspartame contains two harmless amino acids found in proteins but also a compound called methanol , which is broken down by the body into formaldehyde and other byproducts .
In large doses , methanol can cause blindness ; formaldehyde can cause cancers such as leukemia .
In response to the Italian research , the European Food Safety Authority , Europe ’s FDA equivalent , reviewed the evidence on aspartame and issued a 40 - page report reaffirming the sweetener ’s safety .
Other regulatory agencies followed suit .
And in September , a panel of 10 American researchers conducted a review of more than 500 aspartame studies and concluded that the chemical is safe .
Its report , published in Critical Reviews in Toxicology , expressed a long list of concerns about the Ramazzini studies .
Advertisement
For example , the rats used by the Italian group had long had major problems with chronic respiratory disease , which often leads to lymphomas and leukemia .
“ These are really sick animals , ” says University of Maryland toxicologist Bernadene Magnuson , a panel member .
In addition , Magnuson says , the animals were caged in groups and “ we have no way of knowing how much each rat was eating . ”
Small rats could eat as much aspartame as large ones , even though the same amount of the chemical has a bigger effect on smaller creatures .
The Italian studies ’ findings also contrast starkly with others conducted on aspartame , Magnuson adds .
The panel analyzed a dozen , more carefully regulated studies and found that rodents in those had tolerated daily exposures of up to 10,000 milligrams / kilogram of aspartame -- the equivalent of 19,400 daily packets of Equal for an average adult human -- with no ill effects .
“ I have no question in my mind that it is safe to consume aspartame , and I ’d rather consume that than empty calories with a full - sugar soda , ” Magnuson says .
“ My kids too . ”
Advertisement
Eric Walters , a biochemist at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in North Chicago , Ill. , says he finds the toxic - methanol argument hard to stomach .
“ You could n’t possibly consume enough diet soft drink to get a toxic dose of methanol , ” says Walters , who worked for the NutraSweet Co. from 1982 to 1991 .
“ You would need 100 cans at a sitting . ”
A cup of fruit juice , he adds , contains as much methanol as a cup of diet soft drink .
But the Italian group is sticking to its guns , as are some scientists in the U.S.
Some claim that industry affiliations among panel members make it hard to trust the U.S. report ’s conclusions and note that the review was funded by Ajinomoto Food Ingredients , a major producer of aspartame .
( The panel was not told who had commissioned the report until it was completed , Magnuson says . )
In an open letter in June to the FDA , 11 doctors and PhDs argued that letting the animals live into old age , one of the most controversial aspects of the Italian studies , more accurately mimics how aspartame might affect people throughout their lifetimes .
More studies , they say , should be done the same way .

“ To me , the Ramazzini studies are the future , ” says Huff , one of the signatories .

Sucralose
Sucralose , one of the newer sweeteners , has also gotten its share of attention -- positive and negative .
Commonly known as Splenda , sucralose was approved for U.S. use in 1998 .
Since then , it has become popular as a sugar substitute in baked goods because , unlike aspartame and other alternatives , it keeps its chemical structure when heated , and its shelf life is relatively long .
Advertisement
Splenda riled the Sugar Assn. and inspired a flurry of lawsuits -- finally settled this spring -- with its marketing slogan , “ Made from sugar , so it tastes like sugar . ”
The makers of Equal sued Splenda ’s marketers on the grounds that the ad campaign was false and misleading .
A Sugar Assn.- funded website , www.truthaboutsplenda .com , also criticizes Splenda ’s attempts to seem as natural as sugar and says that a lack of long - term studies makes Splenda ’s safety uncertain .
Sucralose does begin life as the sugar molecule sucrose , but a number of chemical alterations follow , including the addition of a chlorine atom .
Studies so far have failed to show that Splenda is unsafe , however , and most scientists dismiss the idea .
“ There is no direct evidence ” that Splenda causes cancer , says Dr. David L. Katz , director of the Yale Griffin Prevention Research Center in New Haven , Conn .
“ It ’s just a theoretical concern . ”

Acesulfame potassium
A less - known target of anxiety is a sweetener called acesulfame potassium , also known as acesulfame K or Ace K , and marketed as Sweet One or Sunnett .
The FDA approved the chemical for use in soft drinks in 1998 , but Myra Karstadt , a consulting toxicologist and adjunct faculty of the department of environmental and occupational health at the Drexel University School of Public Health in Philadelphia , says the approval was based on poorly designed studies , flawed data and doubtful interpretation of statistics .
Advertisement
In 1996 , Karstadt and Michael Jacobson , executive director of the Washington - based consumer group Center for Science in the Public Interest , began urging the FDA and the National Toxicology Program to conduct long - term studies on the chemical .
What data there are , Karstadt and Jacobson say , suggest that Ace K causes cancer in rodents .
In the last few years , Ace K has steadily gained shelf space as an add - on to products containing sucralose .
The Splenda - Ace K blend has become a popular ingredient in baked goods because of the combination ’s taste and because it retains its sweetness when heated to high temperatures .
Ace K also appears in products such as puddings , frozen meals and fruity drinks .
But most consumers do n’t know it ’s there because , unlike other sweeteners , Ace K is never advertised on the fronts of food packaging .
Repeatedly , Huff adds , the FDA has turned down proposals to further test aspartame , Ace K and other sweeteners .
“ There should be more studies , ” Jacobson says , but he ’s not holding his breath .
“ The only ones with the incentive to study them are the companies marketing them .
If they say it causes cancer , they ’re out of business . ”

No matter which type of cookies and soda people choose , one thing is clear :
We are a nation pulled in opposite directions by two conflicting desires .
We crave sweets , yet we are obsessed with our weight and anything that claims to be a magic elixir for weight loss .
Artificial sweeteners , Katz says , have been around for a long time .
If we were going to see an epidemic of cancer , he says , we would already have done so .
He opposes artificial sweeteners for a different reason -- there is no convincing evidence , he says , that products containing them help people lose weight .
They may do the opposite .
For every study that suggests eating low - calorie foods leads to a short - term reduction in calorie consumption , another finds that people who consume diet foods and beverages add just as many calories -- if not more -- to other parts of their diet , he says .
Advertisement
Katz adds that eating large amounts of sweets -- regular or diet -- increases our tolerance for , and addiction to , sweetness .
Bathe your taste buds in Diet Coke all day long and you may be more likely than someone consuming fewer sweets to need a sickeningly sweet dessert or sugar - enhanced pasta sauce or salad dressing to feel satisfied .
“ The word ‘ diet ’ [ in diet food products ] is a misnomer , ” Katz says .
“ At this point , I am thoroughly convinced that they undermine that goal . ”
Does College Football Cause Higher Crime ?
A Guest Post
A few days ago , Levitt blogged about an interesting study finding that violent movies reduce crime ( at least in the short run ) .
The reason , according to the study ’s authors , Gordon Dahl and Stefano DellaVigna , is simply that more violent movies means fewer drunken louts on the streets .
It is simply an incapacitation effect .
One way of testing this hypothesis would be to look for the opposite type of experiment :
What puts more drunken louts on the streets ?
Two words : college football .
Or , at least , that is the focus of a new study by Daniel Rees and Kevin Schnepel linking crime and sporting events .
They analyze daily crime data , but instead of analyzing the changes around the release of new movies , they look to see what happens on game day .
Their findings are quite striking , and they report large rises in assaults , vandalism , and disorderly conduct on game days .
As might be expected , this effect is large in the city of the home team , but basically non-existent in the city of the visitors .
You might be worried that this rise in arrests reflects more police on the street on game day ( and hence more arrests per crime ) , rather than simply more crime .
But the authors provide a clever response , noting that upset losses by the home team have a particularly large effect on violent assaults , while expected losses have little effect .
Unless police chiefs are also successfully forecasting football outcomes , it seems that this alternative explanation does n’t hold water .
The effects here are pretty large , and the study is quite convincing .
It is worth noting that these results occur despite the fact that the football programs they analyze ban the sale of alcohol in the stadium .
There ’s a nice back story here , too .
Schnepel is an undergraduate student , who got to thinking about this question while sitting in Rees ’ class on the economics of crime .
Soon enough , an idea became some explanatory regressions , and then a co-authorship , and now , an interesting paper .
And all this happened in time for Schnepel to boast about it on his grad school application ( which I look forward to reading ! ) .
[ Correction : Schnepel is in fact a current graduate student in economics at the University of Colorado , Denver .
Though we ’d still love to get a look at his application . ]
Putting the Rees - Schnepel and the Dahl - DellaVigna studies together , the policy implications seem pretty obvious : we want to engage aggressive young men in activities that amuse them ( like movies ) , but do n’t provide an outlet for violence ( like a football game ) .
This seems pretty obvious , but then it got me wondering : why do violent movies lead us to sit quietly and stare at the screen , while football leads us to get out of our seats and begin the biffo ?
A general theory here may well suggest broader policy implications from these sorts of studies .
We Own The World
Noam Chomsky
ZNet , January 1 , 2008
You all know , of course , there was an election — what is called “ an election ” in the United States — last November .
There was really one issue in the election , what to do about U.S. forces in Iraq and there was , by U.S. standards , an overwhelming vote calling for a withdrawal of U.S. forces on a firm timetable .
As few people know , a couple of months earlier there were extensive polls in Iraq , U.S. - run polls , with interesting results .
They were not secret here .
If you really looked you could find references to them , so it ’s not that they were concealed .
This poll found that two - thirds of the people in Baghdad wanted the U.S. troops out immediately ; the rest of the country — a large majority — wanted a firm timetable for withdrawal , most of them within a year or less .
The figures are higher for Arab Iraq in the areas where troops were actually deployed .
A very large majority felt that the presence of U.S. forces increased the level of violence and a remarkable 60 percent for all of Iraq , meaning higher in the areas where the troops are deployed , felt that U.S. forces were legitimate targets of attack .
So there was a considerable consensus between Iraqis and Americans on what should be done in Iraq , namely troops should be withdrawn either immediately or with a firm timetable .
Well , the reaction in the post-election U.S. government to that consensus was to violate public opinion and increase the troop presence by maybe 30,000 to 50,000 .
Predictably , there was a pretext announced .
It was pretty obvious what it was going to be .
“ There is outside interference in Iraq , which we have to defend the Iraqis against .
The Iranians are interfering in Iraq . ”
Then came the alleged evidence about finding IEDs , roadside bombs with Iranian markings , as well as Iranian forces in Iraq .
“ What can we do ?
We have to escalate to defend Iraq from the outside intervention . ”
Then came the “ debate . ”
We are a free and open society , after all , so we have “ lively ” debates .
On the one side were the hawks who said , “ The Iranians are interfering , we have to bomb them . ”
On the other side were the doves who said , “ We can not be sure the evidence is correct , maybe you misread the serial numbers or maybe it is just the revolutionary guards and not the government . ”
So we had the usual kind of debate going on , which illustrates a very important and pervasive distinction between several types of propaganda systems .
To take the ideal types , exaggerating a little : totalitarian states ’ propaganda is that you better accept it , or else .
And “ or else ” can be of various consequences , depending on the nature of the state .
People can actually believe whatever they want as long as they obey .
Democratic societies use a different method : they do n’t articulate the party line .
That ’s a mistake .
What they do is presuppose it , then encourage vigorous debate within the framework of the party line .
This serves two purposes .
For one thing it gives the impression of a free and open society because , after all , we have lively debate .
It also instills a propaganda line that becomes something you presuppose , like the air you breathe .
That was the case here .
This is a classic illustration .
The whole debate about the Iranian “ interference ” in Iraq makes sense only on one assumption , namely , that “ we own the world . ”
If we own the world , then the only question that can arise is that someone else is interfering in a country we have invaded and occupied .
So if you look over the debate that took place and is still taking place about Iranian interference , no one points out this is insane .
How can Iran be interfering in a country that we invaded and occupied ?
It ’s only appropriate on the presupposition that we own the world .
Once you have that established in your head , the discussion is perfectly sensible .
You read a lot of comparisons now about Vietnam and Iraq .
For the most part they are totally incomparable ; the nature and purpose of the war , almost everything is totally different except in one respect : how they are perceived in the United States .
In both cases there is what is now sometimes called the “ Q ” word , quagmire .
Is it a quagmire ?
In Vietnam it is now recognized that it was a quagmire .
There is a debate of whether Iraq , too , is a quagmire .
In other words , is it costing us too much ?
That is the question you can debate .
So in the case of Vietnam , there was a debate .
Not at the beginning — in fact , there was so little discussion in the beginning that nobody even remembers when the war began — 1962 , if you ’re interested .
That ’s when the U.S. attacked Vietnam .
But there was no discussion , no debate , nothing .
By the mid-1960s , mainstream debate began .
And it was the usual range of opinions between the hawks and the doves .
The hawks said if we send more troops , we can win .
The doves , well , Arthur Schlesinger , famous historian , Kennedy ’s advisor , in his book in 1966 said that we all pray that the hawks will be right and that the current escalation of troops , which by then was approaching half a million , will work and bring us victory .
If it does , we will all be praising the wisdom and statesmanship of the American government for winning victory — in a land that we ’re reducing to ruin and wreck .
You can translate that word by word to the doves today .
We all pray that the surge will work .
If it does , contrary to our expectations , we will be praising the wisdom and statesmanship of the Bush administration in a country , which , if we ’re honest , is a total ruin , one of the worst disasters in military history for the population .
If you get way to the left end of mainstream discussion , you get somebody like Anthony Lewis who , at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 , wrote in retrospect that the war began with benign intensions to do good ; that is true by definition , because it ’s us , after all .
So it began with benign intentions , but by 1969 , he said , it was clear that the war was a mistake .
For us to win a victory would be too costly — for us — so it was a mistake and we should withdraw .
That was the most extreme criticism .
Very much like today .
We could withdraw from Vietnam because the U.S. had already essentially obtained its objective by then .
Iraq we ca n’t because we have n’t obtained our objectives .
And for those of you who are old enough to remember — or have read about it — you will note that the peace movement pretty much bought that line .
Just like the mainstream discussion , the opposition of the war , including the peace movement , was mostly focused on the bombing of the North .
When the U.S. started bombing the North regularly in February 1965 , it also escalated the bombing of the South to triple the scale — and the South had already been attacked for three years by then .
A couple of hundred thousand South Vietnamese were killed and thousands , if not tens of the thousands , had been driven into concentration camps .
The U.S. had been carrying out chemical warfare to destroy food crops and ground cover .
By 1965 South Vietnam was already a total wreck .
Bombing the South was costless for the United States because the South had no defense .
Bombing the North was costly — you bomb the North , you bomb the harbor , you might hit Russian ships , which begins to become dangerous .
You ’re bombing an internal Chinese railroad — the Chinese railroads from southeast to southwest China happen to go through North Vietnam — who knows what they might do .
In fact , the Chinese were accused , correctly , of sending Chinese forces into Vietnam , namely to rebuild the railroad that we were bombing .
So that was “ interference ” with our divine right to bomb North Vietnam .
So most of the focus was on the bombing of the North .
The peace movement slogan , “ Stop the bombing ” meant the bombing of the North .
In 1967 the leading specialist on Vietnam , Bernard Fall , a military historian and the only specialist on Vietnam respected by the U.S. government — who was a hawk , incidentally , but who cared about the Vietnamese — wrote that it ’s a question of whether Vietnam will survive as a cultural and historical entity under the most severe bombing that has ever been applied to a country this size .
He was talking about the South .
He kept emphasizing it was the South that was being attacked .
But that did n’t matter because it was costless , therefore it ’s fine to continue .
That is the range of debate , which only makes sense on the assumption that we own the world .
If you read , say , the Pentagon Papers , it turns out there was extensive planning about the bombing of the North — very detailed , meticulous planning on just how far it can go , what happens if we go a little too far , and so on .
There is no discussion at all about the bombing of the South , virtually none .
Just an occasional announcement , okay , we will triple the bombing , or something like that .
If you read Robert McNamara ’s memoirs of the war — by that time he was considered a leading dove — he reviews the meticulous planning about the bombing of the North , but does not even mention his decision to sharply escalate the bombing of the South at the same time that the bombing of the North was begun .
I should say , incidentally , that with regard to Vietnam what I have been discussing is articulate opinion , including the leading part of the peace movement .
There is also public opinion , which it turns out is radically different , and that is of some significance .
By 1969 around 70 percent of the public felt that the war was not a mistake , but that it was fundamentally wrong and immoral .
That was the wording of the polls and that figure remains fairly constant up until the most recent polls just a few years ago .
The figures are pretty remarkable because people who say that in a poll almost certainly think , I must be the only person in the world that thinks this .
They certainly did not read it anywhere , they did not hear it anywhere .
But that was popular opinion .
The same is true with regard to many other issues .
But for articulate opinion it ’s pretty much the way I ’ve described — largely vigorous debate between the hawks and the doves , all on the unexpressed assumption that we own the world .
So the only thing that matters is how much is it costing us , or maybe for some more humane types , are we harming too many of them ?
Getting back to the election , there was a lot of disappointment among anti-war people — the majority of the population — that Congress did not pass any withdrawal legislation .
There was a Democratic resolution that was vetoed , but if you look at the resolution closely it was not a withdrawal resolution .
There was a good analysis of it by General Kevin Ryan , who was a fellow at the Kennedy School at Harvard .
He went through it and he said it really should be called a re-missioning proposal .
It leaves about the same number of American troops , but they have a slightly different mission .
He said , first of all it allows for a national security exception .
If the president says there is a national security issue , he can do whatever he wants — end of resolution .
The second gap is it allows for anti-terrorist activities .
Okay , that is whatever you like .
Third , it allows for training Iraqi forces .
Again , anything you like .
Next it says troops have to remain for protection of U.S. forces and facilities .
What are U.S. forces ?
Well , U.S. forces are those embedded in Iraqi armed units where 60 percent of their fellow soldiers think that they — U.S. troops , that is — are legitimate targets of attack .
Incidentally , those figures keep going up , so they are probably higher by now .
Well , okay , that is plenty of force protection .
What facilities need protection was not explained in the Democratic resolution , but facilities include what is called “ the embassy . ”
The U.S. embassy in Iraq is nothing like any embassy that has ever existed in history .
It ’s a city inside the green zone , the protected region of Iraq , that the U.S. runs .
It ’s got everything from missiles to McDonalds , anything you want .
They did n’t build that huge facility because they intend to leave .
That is one facility , but there are others .
There are “ semi - permanent military bases , ” which are being built around the country .
“ Semi- permanent ” means permanent , as long as we want .
General Ryan omitted a lot of things .
He omitted the fact that the U.S. is maintaining control of logistics and logistics is the core of a modern Army .
Right now about 80 percent of the supply is coming in though the south , from Kuwait , and it ’s going through guerilla territory , easily subject to attack , which means you have to have plenty of troops to maintain that supply line .
Plus , of course , it keeps control over the Iraqi Army .
The Democratic resolution excludes the Air Force .
The Air Force does whatever it wants .
It is bombing pretty regularly and it can bomb more intensively .
The resolution also excludes mercenaries , which is no small number — sources such as the Wall Street Journal estimate the number of mercenaries at about 130,000 , approximately the same as the number of troops , which makes some sense .
The traditional way to fight a colonial war is with mercenaries , not with your own soldiers — that is the French Foreign Legion , the British Ghurkas , or the Hessians in the Revolutionary War .
That is part of the main reason the draft was dropped — so you get professional soldiers , not people you pick off the streets .
So , yes , it is re-missioning , but the resolution was vetoed because it was too strong , so we do n’t even have that .
And , yes , that did disappoint a lot of people .
However , it would be too strong to say that no high official in Washington called for immediate withdrawal .
There were some .
The strongest one I know of — when asked what is the solution to the problem in Iraq — said it ’s quite obvious , “ Withdraw all foreign forces and withdraw all foreign arms . ”
That official was Condoleeza Rice and she was not referring to U.S. forces , she was referring to Iranian forces and Iranian arms .
And that makes sense , too , on the assumption that we own the world because , since we own the world U.S. forces cannot be foreign forces anywhere .
So if we invade Iraq or Canada , say , we are the indigenous forces .
It ’s the Iranians that are foreign forces .
I waited for a while to see if anyone , at least in the press or journals , would point out that there was something funny about this .
I could not find a word .
I think everyone regarded that as a perfectly sensible comment .
But I could not see a word from anyone who said , wait a second , there are foreign forces there , 150,000 American troops , plenty of American arms .
So it is reasonable that when British sailors were captured in the Gulf by Iranian forces , there was debate , “ Were they in Iranian borders or in Iraqi borders ?
Actually there is no answer to this because there is no territorial boundary , and that was pointed out .
It was taken for granted that if the British sailors were in Iraqi waters , then Iran was guilty of a crime by intervening in foreign territory .
But Britain is not guilty of a crime by being in Iraqi territory , because Britain is a U.S. client state , and we own the world , so they are there by right .
What about the possible next war , Iran ?
There have been very credible threats by the U.S. and Israel — essentially a U.S. client — to attack Iran .
There happens to be something called the UN Charter which says that — in Article 2 — the threat or use of force in international affairs is a crime .
“ Threat or use of force . ”
Does anybody care ?
No , because we ’re an outlaw state by definition , or to be more precise , our threats and use of force are not foreign , they ’re indigenous because we own the world .
Therefore , it ’s fine .
So there are threats to bomb Iran — maybe we will and maybe we wo n’t .
That is the debate that goes on .
Is it legitimate if we decide to do it ?
People might argue it ’s a mistake .
But does anyone say it would be illegitimate ?
For example , the Democrats in Congress refuse to put in an amendment that would require the Executive to inform Congress if it intends to bomb Iran — to consult , inform .
Even that was not accepted .
The whole world is aghast at this possibility .
It would be monstrous .
A leading British military historian , Correlli Barnett , wrote recently that if the U.S. does attack , or Israel does attack , it would be World War III .
The attack on Iraq has been horrendous enough .
Apart from devastating Iraq , the UN High Commission on Refugees reviewed the number of displaced people — they estimate 4.2 million , over 2 million fled the country , another 2 million fleeing within the country .
That is in addition to the numbers killed , which if you extrapolate from the last studies , are probably approaching a million .
It was anticipated by U.S. intelligence and other intelligence agencies and independent experts that an attack on Iraq would probably increase the threat of terror and nuclear proliferation .
But that went way beyond what anyone expected .
Well known terrorism specialists Peter Bergen and Paul Cruickshank estimated — using mostly government statistics — that what they call “ the Iraq effect ” increased terror by a factor of seven , and that is pretty serious .
And that gives you an indication of the ranking of protection of the population in the priority list of leaders .
It ’s very low .
So what would the Iran effect be ?
Well , that is incalculable .
It could be World War III .
Very likely a massive increase in terror , who knows what else .
Even in the states right around Iraq , which do n’t like Iran — Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , and Turkey — even there the large majority would prefer to see a nuclear armed Iran to any U.S. military action , and they are right , military action could be devastating .
It does n’t mean we wo n’t do it .
There is very little discussion here of the illegitimacy of doing it , again on the assumption that anything we do is legitimate , it just might cost too much .
Is there a possible solution to the U.S. / Iran crisis ?
Well , there are some plausible solutions .
One possibility would be an agreement that allows Iran to have nuclear energy , like every signer of the non-proliferation treaty , but not to have nuclear weapons .
In addition , it would call for a nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East .
That would include Iran , Israel , which has hundreds of nuclear weapons , and any U.S. or British forces deployed in the region .
A third element of a solution would be for the United States and other nuclear states to obey their legal obligation , by unanimous agreement of the World Court , to make good - faith moves to eliminate nuclear weapons entirely .
Is this feasible ?
Well , it ’s feasible on one assumption , that the United States and Iran become functioning democratic societies , because what I have just quoted happens to be the opinion of the overwhelming majority of the populations in Iran and the United States .
On everything that I mentioned there is an overwhelming majority .
So , yes , there would be a very feasible solution if these two countries were functioning democratic societies , meaning societies in which public opinion has some kind of effect on policy .
The problem in the United States is the inability of organizers to do something in a population that overwhelmingly agrees with them and to make that current policy .
Of course , it can be done .
Peasants in Bolivia can do it , we can obviously do it here .
Can we do anything to make Iran a more democratic society ?
Not directly , but indirectly we can .
We can pay attention to the dissidents and the reformists in Iran who are struggling courageously to turn Iran into a more democratic society .
And we know exactly what they are saying , they are very outspoken about it .
They are pleading with the United States to withdraw the threats against Iran .
The more we threaten Iran , the more we give a gift to the reactionary , religious fanatics in the government .
You make threats , you strengthen them .
That is exactly what is happening .
The threats have lead to repression , predictably .
Now the Americans claim they are outraged by the repression , which we should protest , but we should recognize that the repression is the direct and predictable consequence of the actions that the U.S. government is taking .
So if you take actions , and then they have predictable consequences , condemning the consequences is total hypocrisy .
Incidentally , in the case of Cuba about two - thirds of Americans think we ought to end the embargo and all threats and enter into diplomatic relations .
And that has been true ever since polls have been taken — for about 30 years .
The figure varies , but it ’s roughly there .
Zero effect on policy , in Iran , Cuba , and elsewhere .
So there is a problem and that problem is that the United States is just not a functioning democracy .
Public opinion does not matter and among articulate and elite opinion that is a principle — it should n’t matter .
The only principle that matters is we own the world and the rest of you shut up , you know , whether you ’re abroad or at home .
So , yes , there is a potential solution to the very dangerous problem , it ’s essentially the same solution : do something to turn our own country into a functioning democracy .
But that is in radical opposition to the fundamental presupposition of all elite discussions , mainly that we own the world and that these questions do n’t arise and the public should have no opinion on foreign policy , or any policy .
Once , when I was driving to work , I was listening to NPR .
NPR is supposed to be the kind of extreme radical end of the spectrum .
I read a statement somewhere , I do n’t know if it ’s true , but it was a quote from Obama , who is the hope of the liberal doves , in which he allegedly said that the spectrum of discussion in the United States extends between two crazy extremes , Rush Limbaugh and NPR .
The truth , he said , is in the middle and that is where he is going to be , in the middle , between the crazies .
NPR then had a discussion — it was like being at the Harvard faculty club — serious people , educated , no grammatical errors , who know what they ’re talking about , usually polite .
The discussion was about the so - called missile defense system that the U.S. is trying to place in Czechoslovakia and Poland — and the Russian reaction .
The main issue was , “ What is going on with the Russians ?
Why are they acting so hostile and irrational ?
Are they trying to start a new Cold War ?
There is something wrong with those guys .
Can we calm them down and make them less paranoid ? ”
The main specialist they called in , I think from the Pentagon or somewhere , pointed out , accurately , that a missile defense system is essentially a first - strike weapon .
That is well known by strategic analysts on all sides .
If you think about it for a minute , it ’s obvious why .
A missile defense system is never going to stop a first strike , but it could , in principle , if it ever worked , stop a retaliatory strike .
If you attack some country with a first strike , and practically wipe it out , if you have a missile defense system , and prevent them from retaliating , then you would be protected , or partially protected .
If a country has a functioning missile defense system it will have more options for carrying out a first strike .
Okay , obvious , and not a secret .
It ’s known to every strategic analyst .
I can explain it to my grandchildren in two minutes and they understand it .
So on NPR it is agreed that a missile defense system is a first - strike weapon .
But then comes the second part of the discussion .
Well , say the pundits , the Russians should not be worried about this .
For one thing because it ’s not enough of a system to stop their retaliation , so therefore it ’s not yet a first - strike weapon against them .
Then they said it is kind of irrelevant anyway because it is directed against Iran , not against Russia .
Okay , that was the end of the discussion .
So , point one , missile defense is a first - strike weapon ; second , it ’s directed against Iran .
Now , you can carry out a small exercise in logic .
Does anything follow from those two assumptions ?
Yes , what follows is it ’s a first - strike weapon against Iran .
Since the U.S. owns the world what could be wrong with having a first - strike weapon against Iran .
So the conclusion is not mentioned .
It is not necessary .
It follows from the fact that we own the world .
Maybe a year ago or so , Germany sold advanced submarines to Israel , which were equipped to carry missiles with nuclear weapons .
Why does Israel need submarines with nuclear armed missiles ?
Well , there is only one imaginable reason and everyone in Germany with a brain must have understood that — certainly their military system does — it ’s a first - strike weapon against Iran .
Israel can use German subs to illustrate to Iranians that if they respond to an Israeli attack they will be vaporized .
The fundamental premises of Western imperialism are extremely deep .
The West owns the world and now the U.S. runs the West , so , of course , they go along .
The fact that they are providing a first - strike weapon for attacking Iran probably , I ’m guessing now , raised no comment because why should it ?
You can forget about history , it does not matter , it ’s kind of “ old fashioned , ” boring stuff we do n’t need to know about .
But most countries pay attention to history .
So , for example , for the United States there is no discussion of the history of U.S. / Iranian relations .
Well , for the U.S. there is only one event in Iranian history — in 1979 Iranians overthrew the tyrant that the U.S. was backing and took some hostages for over a year .
That happened and they had to be punished for that .
But for Iranians their history is that for over 50 years , literally without a break , the U.S. has been torturing Iranians .
In 1953 the U.S. overthrew the parliamentary government and installed a brutal tyrant , the Shah , and kept supporting him while he compiled one of the worst human rights records in the world — torture , assassination , anything you like .
In fact , President Carter , when he visited Iran in December 1978 , praised the Shah because of the love shown to him by his people , and so on and so forth , which probably accelerated the overthrow .
Of course , Iranians have this odd way of remembering what happened to them and who was behind it .
When the Shah was overthrown , the Carter administration immediately tried to instigate a military coup by sending arms to Iran through Israel to try to support military force to overthrow the government .
We immediately turned to supporting Iraq , that is Saddam Hussein , and his invasion of Iran .
Saddam was executed for crimes he committed in 1982 , by his standards not very serious crimes — complicity in killing 150 people .
Well , there was something missing in that account — 1982 is a very important year in U.S. / Iraqi relations .
That is the year in which Ronald Reagan removed Iraq from the list of states supporting terrorism so that the U.S. could start supplying Iraq with weapons for its invasion of Iran , including the means to develop weapons of mass destruction , chemical and nuclear weapons .
That is 1982 .
A year later Donald Rumsfeld was sent to firm up the deal .
Well , Iranians may very well remember that this led to a war in which hundreds of thousands of them were slaughtered with U.S. aid going to Iraq .
They may well remember that the year after the war was over , in 1989 , the U.S. government invited Iraqi nuclear engineers to come to the United States for advanced training in developing nuclear weapons .
What about the Russians ?
They have a history too .
One part of the history is that in the last century Russia was invaded and practically destroyed three times through Eastern Europe .
You can look back and ask , when was the last time that the U.S. was invaded and practically destroyed through Canada or Mexico ?
That does n’t happen .
We crush others and we are always safe .
But the Russians do n’t have that luxury .
Now , in 1990 a remarkable event took place .
I was kind of shocked , frankly .
Gorbachev agreed to let Germany be unified , meaning join the West and be militarized within a hostile military alliance .
This is Germany , which twice in that century practically destroyed Russia .
That ’s a pretty remarkable agreement .
There was a quid pro quo .
Then - president George Bush I agreed that NATO would not expand to the East .
The Russians also demanded , but did not receive , an agreement for a nuclear - free zone from the Artic to the Baltic , which would give them a little protection from nuclear attack .
That was the agreement in 1990 .
Then Bill Clinton came into office , the so - called liberal .
One of the first things he did was to rescind the agreement , unilaterally , and expand NATO to the East .
For the Russians that ’s pretty serious , if you remember the history .
They lost 25 million people in the last World War and over 3 million in World War I .
But since the U.S. owns the world , if we want to threaten Russia , that is fine .
It is all for freedom and justice , after all , and if they make unpleasant noises about it we wonder why they are so paranoid .
Why is Putin screaming as if we ’re somehow threatening them , since we ca n’t be threatening anyone , owning the world .
One of the other big issues on the front pages now is Chinese “ aggressiveness . ”
There is a lot of concern about the fact that the Chinese are building up their missile forces .
Is China planning to conquer the world ?
Big debates about it .
Well , what is really going on ?
For years China has been in the lead in trying to prevent the militarization of space .
If you look at the debates and the Disarmament Commission of the UN General Assembly , the votes are 160 to 1 or 2 .
The U.S. insists on the militarization of space .
It will not permit the outer space treaty to explicitly bar military relations in space .
Clinton ’s position was that the U.S. should control space for military purposes .
The Bush administration is more extreme .
Their position is the U.S. should own space , their words ,
We have to own space for military purposes .
So that is the spectrum of discussion here .
The Chinese have been trying to block it and that is well understood .
You read the most respectable journal in the world , I suppose , the Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , and you find leading strategic analysts , John Steinbrunner and Nancy Gallagher , a couple of years ago , warning that the Bush administration ’s aggressive militarization is leading to what they call “ ultimate doom . ”
Of course , there is going to be a reaction to it .
You threaten people with destruction , they are going to react .
These analysts call on peace - loving nations to counter Bush ’s aggressive militarism .
They hope that China will lead peace - loving nations to counter U.S. aggressiveness .
It ’s a pretty remarkable comment on the impossibility of achieving democracy in the United States .
Again , the logic is pretty elementary .
Steinbrunner and Gallagher are assuming that the United States cannot be a democratic society ; it ’s not one of the options , so therefore we hope that maybe China will do something .
Well , China finally did something .
It signaled to the United States that they noticed that we were trying to use space for military purposes , so China shot down one of their satellites .
Everyone understands why — the mili- tarization and weaponization of space depends on satellites .
While missiles are very difficult or maybe impossible to stop , satellites are very easy to shoot down .
You know where they are .
So China is saying , “ Okay , we understand you are militarizing space .
We ’re going to counter it not by militarizing space , we ca n’t compete with you that way , but by shooting down your satellites . ”
That is what was behind the satellite shooting .
Every military analyst certainly understood it and every lay person can understand it .
But take a look at the debate .
The discussion was about , “ Is China trying it conquer the world by shooting down one of its own satellites ? ”
About a year ago there was a new rash of articles and headlines on the front page about the “ Chinese military build - up . ”
The Pentagon claimed that China had increased its offensive military capacity — with 400 missiles , which could be nuclear armed .
Then we had a debate about whether that proves China is trying to conquer the world or the numbers are wrong , or something .
Just a little footnote .
How many offensive nuclear armed missiles does the United States have ?
Well , it turns out to be 10,000 .
China may now have maybe 400 , if you believe the hawks .
That proves that they are trying to conquer the world .
It turns out , if you read the international press closely , that the reason China is building up its military capacity is not only because of U.S. aggressiveness all over the place , but the fact that the United States has improved its targeting capacities so it can now destroy missile sites in a much more sophisticated fashion wherever they are , even if they are mobile .
So who is trying to conquer the world ?
Well , obviously the Chinese because since we own it , they are trying to conquer it .
It ’s all too easy to continue with this indefinitely .
Just pick your topic .
It ’s a good exercise to try .
This simple principle , “ we own the world , ” is sufficient to explain a lot of the discussion about foreign affairs .
I will just finish with a word from George Orwell .
In the introduction to Animal Farm he said , England is a free society , but it ’s not very different from the totalitarian monster I have been describing .
He says in England unpopular ideas can be suppressed without the use of force .
Then he goes on to give some dubious examples .
At the end he turns to a very brief explanation , actually two sentences , but they are to the point .
He says , one reason is the press is owned by wealthy men who have every reason not to want certain ideas to be expressed .
And the second reason — and I think a more important one — is a good education .
If you have gone to the best schools and graduated from Oxford and Cambridge , and so on , you have instilled in you the understanding that there are certain things it would not do to say ; actually , it would not do to think .
That is the primary way to prevent unpopular ideas from being expressed .
The ideas of the overwhelming majority of the population , who do n’t attend Harvard , Princeton , Oxford and Cambridge , enable them to react like human beings , as they often do .
There is a lesson there for activists .

When the feminists of the Sixties and Seventies started protesting loudly about disparities in the treatment of men and women in areas such as equality at work and educational opportunities , they also quite rightly urged women to reclaim their bodies for themselves .
For too long , they said , women had been discouraged from understanding their own desires while pandering to men's sexual needs .
Their battle cry was : " It 's your body - you should do what you want with it ! "
For the first time , women were speaking about taking charge of their sexuality and sexual relationships .
Women also suddenly had access to better methods of birth control because the Pill freed them from the fear of unwanted children , and allowed them to postpone motherhood until it suited them .
Previous generations of women had quite literally laid down their bodies because it was widely felt that a man should be able to have sex with his wife whenever he wanted .
You were about as likely to find a magazine article on how women could enhance their sexual pleasure as you were to see a female in 10 Downing Street .
It certainly was n't regarded as being a woman 's prerogative in the first six decades of the 20th century to insist on sexual satisfaction from her husband .
In fact , such a woman might well have been chastised for even thinking about such fulfilment .
Scroll down for more ...
But feminism was the catalyst for sweeping changes in the sexual landscape as other social factors came to influence the way women thought about their sexual selves .
Music idols such as Debbie Harry of Blondie and Madonna paraded their sexuality on the stage .
Films such as Dirty Dancing , Nine - To - Five and When Harry Met Sally showed women discovering their strengths and becoming empowered .
Scores of women 's magazines such as Cosmopolitan contained a wealth of articles ranging from advice about salaries to how to demand sexual satisfaction .
So what is the result of this sexual revolution , which seems to have convinced millions of women that " good enough " in the bedroom is no longer , well , good enough ?
In my work as a life coach , agony aunt and psychologist , I regularly encounter women in their late 20s , 30s and 40s - the inheritors of the feminist revolution - with bitter regrets over relationships that have failed on one pivotal issue : the issue of sexual compromise .
And professionals such as myself are being forced to realise that feminism , with all the wonderful things it did for women , went too far with the " I will only do as I please " attitude to sex it engendered .
It has produced a generation of women who simply refuse to compromise over sexual matters with their partners .
As a result , they have ruined their relationships .
Jennifer , 38 , the director of a marketing company in fashion , is an excellent case in point .
She arrived at a life - coaching session I was giving , seeking to improve communication skills with her increasing number of staff .
She 's a woman who appears to have it all .
No man bosses her around because she 's her own boss .
She earns a six - figure salary , has the luxury - holidays lifestyle along with a supportive and close - knit group of equally successful female friends .
But did she also have a happy marriage ?
I thought my meeting with her would be a straightforward session about management and communication , but my instincts quickly told me - when she " inadvertently " admitted that her husband had had an affair - that more important things were on Jennifer 's mind .
She confessed that during the three years before he had strayed , they 'd had virtually no sex - on average once every six months .
Because she had thrown herself into establishing her company , Jennifer had been working terribly hard and had shown little interest in sex .
This led to arguments , she told me , during which her husband , a property developer , protested strongly that it left him feeling cold - shouldered .
It never occurred to Jennifer - or the countless other women I have dealt with on this exact same issue - that eventually he'd look elsewhere .
Do n't misunderstand me .
I never encourage or excuse infidelity .
But when you hear story after story of men feeling sexually neglected by women who find it perfectly natural to put their own interests before their husband 's - and not for a good reason such as a medical issue or a traumatic event like a bereavement - I can't help but feel that some men have little choice , bar ending the relationship .
After all , the human sex drive is a powerful thing , and requires careful care and consideration between two people .
Jennifer and her husband failed to repair the damage to their relationship , and many months down the line she was suffering bitter regret over their impending divorce .
Sarah , 39 , a solicitor from Surrey , fared a little better .
She did n't avoid the emotional pain Jennifer had suffered , but she did avoid divorce when her husband asked her for a trial separation .
After he dropped that bombshell , Sarah was forced to re-evaluate the way she 'd been treating the sexual side of their relationship .
Having had two children , she 'd switched off having sex as though she was turning off a tap .
Her view of what made a contented home life was enjoying her children after a moderately long working day .
At that point , sex simply was n't on the radar for her .
Sarah had been shrugging off her husband 's advances with no thought towards his feelings .
As her husband , an accountant , was n't the type to make a fuss as Jennifer 's did , Sarah had made the dangerous assumption that all was well in their world , and that their marriage was ticking over the way she liked it .
What she had n't bargained for was the fact that their virtually sexless marriage had made her husband feel emasculated and unloved .
He 'd often made advances prefaced by candlelit dinners .
Sarah enjoyed the meals , but preferred to do some of her casework afterwards .
In measured tones , he'd often asked if there was anything that he could do differently to reignite her sexual interest ?
But she 'd pooh - poohed the very thought , as the cut and thrust of her legal work was more exciting .
In the end , he did n't seek out an affair , but he was seeking a separation ; quietly sick of being refused the warmth and intimacy they 'd once enjoyed .
Once she was over the shock of his suggestion , Sarah came to realise that what she 'd seen as a cosy little world had excluded him as an equal partner .
With a good deal of effort on her part , and goodwill on his , they managed to work through their difficulties and re-establish a sex life that both were happy with .
But it could have been very different .
Over the past two decades , I 've noticed how much the issues women raise with me in terms of their sex lives have changed .
When I was in my teens , what was on everyone 's mind was simply experimenting with sex .
Women began to feel a real sense of freedom about harnessing the pleasures their bodies could provide them with .
The message of feminism at that time was that women no longer had to be frightened of having sex on their terms .
And as sexual matters have become much more open for discussion , there has been a sea- change when it comes to women asking their partner to satisfy them .
Women are far more likely to seize the sexual moment and have one - night stands , shortlived flings , and sexually experiment the way a woman of 40 or 50 years ago never would .
Over the past couple of decades , women are also more likely to have had far more sexual partners , whereas their mothers and certainly their grandmothers may have had only one partner and presumed that what they shared was all there was to sex .
Unfortunately , alongside this growing knowledge of what was satisfying for an individual woman - and what was n't - was a feminist - inspired selfishness in relationships when it came to sex .
In researching my new book I 've come to this conclusion : what 's been forgotten is that such selfishness and other feelings of empowerment , which have served women well in the boardroom , do n't necessarily translate to the bedroom .
One divorcee I encountered , Elizabeth , 44 , a high - flying advertising executive , had carved out a successful career from saying " No " at work to bad ideas and pushy colleagues , and setting firm limits on what others could and should do .
The problem was that she instinctively translated that hardheaded - attitude and applied it to her own sexual relationship .
She loved her long - term boyfriend , but said his lack of foreplay skills was killing off her sexual interest .
As far as Elizabeth was concerned , she 'd every right to say " No " to sex .
He was hurt and angry every time he was rebuffed .
An invisible wall grew between them until he suggested breaking up .
Only after much soul - searching did Elizabeth acknowledge that her blanket ban on sex was destroying their relationship .
Brought to the brink , she realised that actually encouraging sensual skills in him was a better solution .
Of course , I meet people with all sorts of relationship problems , but when sex is at the heart of it I 've met literally hundreds of " Sarahs " , " Jennifers " and " Elizabeths " .
They 've lacked interest in sex for a variety of reasons , and expected to set the ground rules with no negotiation .
The consequences ?
Troubled or broken relationships .
Some have decided it 's worth learning to compromise over sex , while others have steadfastly refused to budge .
All have experienced some unhappiness , be it dealing with arguments or discovering affairs , or facing a break - up they did n't want .
But the consequences have definitely been worse for those who fail to compromise .
Just as you may hate being the person responsible for remembering every one of his relations ' birthdays as well as your own , he may hate being the one who has to take garden waste to the tip .
But such things are all part and parcel of ensuring a relationship works .
You may think it 's a terrible comparison to make between chores and sex .
But I believe that sex should be seen as a duty because it is one of the most fundamental ways in which you can make your partner feel better .
What it all boils down to is that just as you 'd expect to have discussions over how to spend any spare cash , where to holiday , and whose parents to spend Christmas with , so , too , do you need to discuss your sexual desires and needs .
That 's what 's empowering .
It 's actually not empowering when a woman simply says : " No , my body is mine and I 'll never meet you halfway . "
Because ultimately it may destroy her relationship .
No doubt women of all ages will have strong reactions to what I 'm saying , but it 's interesting for me to speak to people from older generations about this issue .
Without compromising all the wonderful freedoms women now enjoy , not least equality in the workplace , we can still learn something from our grandparents .
Rather than taking a " me , me , me " attitude to life as soon as you step into a relationship , it should be a " we , we , we " attitude , which gives equal weight to both partners ' needs .
Sometimes that means making love to your partner even when you 're not in the mood .
But you do so because you know it 'll make the person you love happy .
Obviously I 'm against any excessive pressure from a man for you to have sex when it 's not desired .
But rejecting him time and again simply because you can is almost guaranteed to lead to disaster .
Did those feminists who made so many marvellous strides for womanhood realise what road they were urging women to travel down when they urged the sisterhood to take control of their sex lives ?
It 's a credo I believe has left many women with failed relationships , many with regrets and bitterness .
You may not want to have sex , just as you may not want to visit his parents , but you must tend to every aspect of your relationship if you wish it to survive .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Prices of existing U.S. single - family homes recorded their biggest annual drop in October , suggesting the housing slump is far from over , a national home price gauge released on Wednesday showed .
The Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller year - over - year index of 10 metropolitan areas fell to 209.68 in October , down 6.7 percent from a year earlier .
The decline surpassed the 6.3 percent drop in April 1991 .
“ No matter how you look at these data , it is obvious that the current state of the single - family housing market remains grim , ” said Robert Shiller , chief economist at MacroMarkets LLC , in a statement .
The firms ’ newer , composite home price index on 20 metropolitan areas declined to 192.89 in October , down 6.1 percent from a year ago .
On a month - over - month basis , both indexes lost 1.4 percent in October compared with September .
The bleak housing data spurred more selling in stocks , which were already under downward pressure on worries over weak Christmas tallies among retailers .
Bond prices were also stuck in the red , as the data failed to stoke hopes of more interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve .
Eleven of the 20 metropolitan areas recorded their largest monthly decline on record in October , led by San Diego , where home prices fell 2.6 percent , according to S&P / Case - Shiller .

On an annual basis , single - family home prices in Miami recorded the biggest decline , down 12.4 percent in October , followed by Tampa with an 11.8 percent fall .
Charlotte , Portland and Seattle were the only cities still experiencing annual home appreciation in October , as tracked by the S&P / Case - Shiller indexes .
At least one economist predicted that home depreciation will continue well into 2008 in order to attract enough buyers to clear the huge backlog in inventories .
“ It ’s painful medication but it ’s the one that works , ” said Gregory Miller , chief economist at SunTrust Banks Inc. in Atlanta .
“ More likely , we ’ll be well into 2009 before we start describing this housing cycle as ‘ in recovery , ’ ” Miller added .

Had the long wait been worth it ?
Honestly , we do n't think so .
ATI kept their fans waiting for the Radeon HD 2000 cards , promising better performance than NVIDIA 's GeForce 8800 series of graphics cards .
However , for all that delay , their flagship Radeon HD 2900 XT cannot even beat the GeForce 8800 GTX ( released over six months earlier ) in performance , much less the GeForce 8800 Ultra .
For a graphics card that spent so much time in development , we expected a really refined card .
Well , it is and it is n't .
It is the first graphics card we know to use expensive digital power regulation for greater efficiency and a cleaner board design .
It also conveniently includes an onboard audio processor which allows you to stream video and audio together to your HDTV via a HDMI cable .
This is a feature not yet found on any other graphics card .
However , power consumption is still prodigious , so much so that ATI had to use a new 8 - pin power connector to supplement the first 6 - pin power connector .
This new connector had many users groaning in frustration as most power supplies only ship with two standard 6 - pin power cables .
The card will still run at full speed if you just use two 6 - pin power cables , but it 's advisable for you to switch one of them to a 8 - pin power cable to reduce the load on your power cables .
The increased power consumption also meant increased thermal output .
We are glad to report that ATI has done a pretty good job of it here .
The cooler is large , as expected , but the fan is fortuitously quiet in comparison to the fans ATI used in the past .
We did not experience any stability issues even in these hot and humid conditions , but overclocking may not be easy due to the amount of heat produced .
We recently retested the ATI Radeon HD 2900 XT with a slew of new DirectX 9 and DirectX 10 games and of course , new drivers !
We also threw the new NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT into the mix .
Unfortunately for ATI , the new NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT totally blew away the Radeon HD 2900 XT .
The NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT may not offer an incredible boost in speed over the Radeon HD 2900 XT but it is much cheaper .
With the advent of the far more cost - effective NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT , there is no longer a valid reason for gamers to buy the ATI Radeon HD 2900 XT , unless of course they are rabid ATI fans .
Even throwing in a free Valve game bundle ( Half - Life 2 : Episode 2 , Team Fortress 2 and Portal ) to sweeten the deal is n't going to work .
If ATI wants to move their Radeon HD 2900 XT inventory , they will need to start cutting its price at least by half , and that 's what we think they will do very , very soon .
So , if you are looking to buy the ATI Radeon HD 2900 XT , wait a while .
ATI will drastically slash its price soon to stay competitive .

オブジェクトとクラスの関係について、次のような説明を見かけました（文言の引用ではなくて、檜山による要約）。
オブジェクトとクラスは全体としてツリー構造をしていて、ツリーの末端をオブジェクト、末端以外のノードをクラスという。末端であるオブジェクトは、その親ノードであるクラスのインスタンスと呼び、クラスどおしの親子関係を継承関係と呼ぶ。
うーむ、この説明、ある意味「簡潔でわかりやすい」とも言えるのだけど、ちょっと単純化し過ぎでしょ。
オブジェクトやクラスの概念て、そんなに美しくもなきゃ、整合的でもありません。実用性やら実装上の都合やらでゴチャゴチャですがね。しかし、そのゴチャゴチャが悪いともいえません。ゴチャゴチャを無理に単純化することなく、必然性を持った（幾分は偶発的だけど(苦笑)）複雑さとして理解すべきかと思います。
というわけで、メタクラスやレイフィケーション（reification）なんて少し珍しい概念も含めて、オブジェクトとクラスの関係を整理してみましょう。今回の目標は、「Classクラスオブジェクト」（書き間違ってないぞ！）という概念を、実感を伴って明確に理解することです。
内容：
[ 追記 ]
ちなみに、犬、猫、ポチとタマとかは出てきませんよ。ましてや牛は出てきません。[追記]
まずは、クラスの継承関係を絵に描く
クラスを四角で描いて、継承関係は二重の矢印（⇒）で示しましょう。二重矢印を使うのは、後で色々な矢印が出てくるので、それらと区別するためです。矢印の方向は、「派生クラス⇒基底クラス」の向きとします。この向きに必然性があるわけじゃないけど、UMLなどの習慣に従いました。例えばこんな：
毎回絵で示すのも面倒なんで、B ⇒ A のとき B is - derived - from A とも書きます 。Javaなら B extends A 、 Rubyなら B < A 、 C ++なら
B : public
A てな書き方をしますね* 1。is - derived - fromを使って上の図を書き下せば：
String is - derived - from Object
Person is - derived - from Object
Employee is - derived - from Person
B is - derived - from A は、BがAから直接的に派生したことを示します。あっ、「派生した」なんて言葉を使いましたが、「継承により定義された」と同じことです。
is - derived - from をもとに、サブクラス／スーパークラスの関係 B is - subclass - of A を定義するなら 、
[ ルールsub - 1 ]
B is - derived - from A ならば 、B is - subclass - of A
[ ルールsub - 2 ] とあ るXに対して 、B is - subclass - of X かつ X is - subclass - of A ならば 、B is - subclass - of A
絵で考えると、何本かの二重線矢印'⇒'をたどっ てBか らAに行けるなら B is - subclass - of A ってこと。先の図では 、 「 Employee ⇒ Person 」 「 Person ⇒Object 」だったので 、Employee is - subclass - of Object ですね 。
ところで 、A is - subclass - of A （つまり、自分自身はサブクラス）と考えるのかな？ is - subclass - of を数学的な順序関係として定式化したいなら、自分もサブクラスとしたほうが都合がいいんですけど、自分もサブクラスとする習慣はあんまりない気がするな。
あ、そうそう、 「 単一継承か多重継承か」なんて話はいまの文脈ではまったくどうでもいい事なので、単に絵を描く手間を省くために単一継承を例とします。
オブジェクトの生成とインスタンス概念
さて次に、 「 オブジェクトaが、クラ スAから生成された 」という主張（あるいは記述）を a is - created - by A と書くことにします。これはつまり、 a = new A ( ) ; のようなコードが実行された、ってことです。「aが、クラスAのnewで作られた」なんてことは、実行時のある時点を特定しないと意味を持たない言明であることに注意してください。
a is - created - by A であることを絵で描くときは、クラ スAからオブジェクトaに向かって波線矢印を引きます。クラスは四角、オブジェクトは丸で描くことにします。
それで、a is - instance - of X ということを、とりあえず次のように定義します（この定義は後で修正します）。
[ ルールinst - 1 ] a is - created - by X ならば 、a is - instance - of X である。 （Xは生みの親 ）
[ ルールinst - 2 ] a is - instance - of A かつ A is - subclass - of X ならば、a is - instance - of X である。 （Xは生みの親のスーパークラス ）
この定義は別に珍しいものじゃないですね。例えば次の状況を考えましょう。
class A extends X { } A a = new A ( ) ;
( 1 ) の部分か ら A is - derived - from X です 。 ( 2 ) の部分からは a is - created - by A がわかります。このことから 、a is - instance - of X は次のように導き出せます。（下図の、'-'を並べた横棒は、ルールによ る “ 推論 ” を表します。 ）
a is - created - by A A is - derived - from X -----------------[ルールinst-1 ]
-------------------[ルールsub-1 ] a is - instace - of A A is - subclass - of X --------------------------------------------------[ルールinst-2 ] a is - instace - of X （結論 ）
まー、普通はいちいちこんなことを考えなくても、「aはXのインスタンス」と直感的に判断できるでしょう。
a is - instance - of A であることを絵に描くときは、aか らAに向かって実線の矢印を引くことにします。上に挙げたis - instance - ofの定義を図示すれば次のようになります。
オブジェクト・プレーンとクラス・プレーン
Object , String , Personという3つのクラス、それ とStringのインスタンスs1 , s2 , Personのインスタンスpを絵に描いてみましょう（is-instace-ofは、直接の所属関係だけを描いた）。
結局のところ、冒頭で述べた「クラスとオブジェクトは全体としてツリー構造をしていて、ツリーの末端がオブジェクト、末端以外のノードがクラス」になっちゃったね。いや、違うんですよ。ちゃんと絵を描くと、実は次のようです。
立体的なんです！ 下の面には丸で描かれるオブジェクトだけを配置します。この面をオブジェクト・プレーンと呼びましょう。二階にあたる上の面には四角で描かれるクラスだけを配置します。二階のフロアはクラス・プレーンです。
クラス間の継承関係（is- derived - from）やサブクラス／スーパークラスの関係（is-subclass-of）は、クラス・プレーン上に描かれる矢印で示されます。一方、生成関係（is-created-by）、所属関係（is-instance-of）は、一階のオブジェクト・プレーンと二階のクラス・プレーンをつなぐ矢印になっています。
一階と二階を区別して、水平方向（プレーン内）の関係と垂直方向（プレーンをまたぐ）関係の違いも意識すべきなんです。これ、大事。
クラスオブジェクトとレイフィケーション
プログラムの実行中にはオブジェクトが生成されたり捨てられたりしますが、先の図に即して言えば、それらはオブジェクト・プレーンで生じる変化です。クラス・プレーンは、プログラムの実行中も何ら変化しません。
実行時には、そもそもクラスなんて存在してないプログラミング言語もあります。例えば、実行時型情報（RTTI）が導入される以前のC++では、クラスはプログラマの頭の中とソースコード上にあるだけで、実行時のメモリ内を探してもクラスのかけらも見つかりません。
一方Javaなどでは、実行時のメモリ内にクラスが存在し、プログラムからクラスへアクセスすることもできます。このような“実行時に存在するクラス”をどう解釈すべきでしょうか？
以下、オブジェクト・プレーンとクラス・プレーンの絵で考えてみます。
オブジェクト・プレーン内に描かれたオブジェクトは、実行時のメモリ内存在物に対応するとしましょう。しかし、クラス・プレーンに描かれたクラスは、概念、あるいはソースコードに記述されたものとしてのクラスです（そう約束します）。となると、“実行時のクラス”はオブジェクト・プレーン（一階）に配置されるべきものです。
しかし、クラスは本来クラス・プレーン（二階）にいるものなのに、オブジェクト・プレーンに配置されたクラスってなんなのそれ？
この点を説明するために、クラスオブジェクトという言葉を使うことにします。クラスオブジェクトは、クラスではなくてオブジェクトです。ただし、クラスを表現するためのオブジェクトです。
図でいえば、二階のクラス・プレーンに載っているほんとのクラスに対して、その“真下”に、そのクラスに対応するオブジェクトがあると思ってください。二階にいるほんとのクラスに対して、代理となるオブジェクト（それがクラスオブジェクト）を作り出すことをレイフィケーションといいます。
レイフィケーションのレイファイ（reify）とは、「抽象物を具現化する」といった意味です。もともとは概念的な存在であるクラスを、メモリ内実体であるオブジェクトに具現化したものがクラスオブジェクトです。図に描くときは、レイフィケーションを、クラス・プレーン（二階）からオブジェクト・プレーン（一階）に落ちる点線矢印で示すことにします。
クラスオブジェクトが所属するクラス
今扱っている例では、二階のクラス・プレーンに
Object , String , Personという3つのクラスが載っています。レイフィケーションにより、二階から一階への写像が行われると、一階のオブジェクト・プレーンに対応する3つのクラスオブジェクトが出来ます。これらのクラスオブジェクトを、Javaの記法を借りて、Object.class , String.class , Person.classと書きましょう。お尻に'.class'が付いてますが、クラスそのものではなくてオブジェクトですからね！
構文（書き方）としては、Javaクラスファイル名と同じだけど、もちろんファイルではなくて、実行時のメモリ内にあるものです。
さて、オブジェクト・プレーンに存在するオブジェクトは、何らかのクラスのインスタンスになるべきです*2。ですから、例えば
Object.class is - instance - of X となるクラス（ほんとのクラス）Xが必要です。そこで、クラス・プレーンに
Class というクラスを設けましょう 。
目論見としては 、Object.class , String.class , Person.class（これらはオブジェクトです！）を、クラスClassのインスタンスと考えたいのです。しかし、is-instance-ofの定義には、「生みの親」が条件に入っていました。クラスオブジェクトが、実行時に「Classからnewで生成された」わけではありません。Object.class , String.class , Person.classは、実行時ではなくてコンパイル時に作り込んでおく必要があります（レイフィケーションはコンパイラの仕事です）。
is -created - byの解釈をゆるくする （createの意味を拡大解釈する）手もありますが、ここでは、混乱を避けるためにis-prepared-asという関係を導入しましょう。Object.class is - prepared - as Class などが成立している、とします。そして、is - instance - ofの定義を少し修正します。
[ ルールinst - 1 ' ] a is - created - by X または a is - prepared - as X ならば 、a is - instance - of X である 。
すべてを一階に押し込めてみる
立体的な図を描くのは面倒なので、プレーンを直線、クラスやオブジェクトを点で描くことにします。その描き方で図示すると：
ん？ クラス・プレーンに新設されたク ラ スClassに対するレイフィケーション・イメージ（レイファイの結果）が欠けていますね。そう、Class.classというクラスオブジェクトも追加しないとね。これで、一階のオブジェクト・プレーンも随分にぎやかになりました。
普通のインスタンスオブジェクト：s1 , s2 , p
クラスオブジェクト ：Object.class , String.class , Person.class , Class.class
二階のクラス・プレーンの代理が一階に揃っているので、本来はクラス・プレーン内の関係である継承関係（is-derived-from）や、オブジェクト・プレーンとクラス・プレーンを結ぶ関係である所属関係（is-instace-of）も、オブジェクト・プレーン内に描くことができるようになります（下図； is-instace-ofは、直接の所属関係だけを描いた）。
図の矢印に、1から10の番号を付けておきました。次のJavaプログラムは、各番号に対応するアサーションを書き並べたものです。実行すると単にOKと表示されるので、アサーションの等式はすべて正しいことが確認できます。
class Person extends Object { public final String name ; public Person ( String name ) { this .name = name ; } } public class ObjectsAndClasses { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { String s1 = new String ( " Hello " ) ; String s2 = new String ( " Bye - bye " ) ; Person p = new Person ( " tonkichi " ) ; assert ( String . class ) .getSuperclass ( ) == Object .
class ; assert ( Person . class ) .getSuperclass ( ) == Object .
class ; assert ( Class . class ) .getSuperclass ( ) == Object .
class ; assert s 1.getClass ( ) == String .
class ; assert s2.getClass ( ) == String .
class ; assert p.getClass ( ) == Person .
class ; assert ( String . class ) .getClass ( ) == Class .
class ; assert ( Person . class ) .getClass ( ) == Class .
class ; assert ( Object .
class ) .getClass ( ) == Class .
class ; assert ( Class . class ) .getClass ( ) == Class .
class ; System.out.println ( " OK " ) ; } }
もっと上の階の住人 達
どうでしょう、納得できましたか？ 僕は納得できないですね（オイオイ）。Class.classというクラスオブジェクトの扱いが不徹底で気持ち悪いんです。
クラスオブジェク トClass.classは、クラス・プレーンにあるクラスClassのレイフィケーション・イメージでした。が、Classというクラスがクラス・プレーンに在るのはおかしいのですよ。
僕たちは 、「 Ojbect , String , Person は “ クラス ” です」という言い方をしますよね。引用符でかこまれた“クラス”
をCLASSと書くことにすると、この言明の意味は次のようなことでしょう。
Object is - instance - of CLASS （ Object は “ クラ ス ” です） String is - instance - of CLASS （ String は “ クラ ス ” です） Person is - instance - of CLASS （ Person は “ クラス ” です ）
既に指摘したように、is-instance-ofは、2枚のプレーンにまたがる“垂直な”
関係です。そしてクラス達は、二階のクラス・プレーン上に住んでいます。となると、CLASSは三階のプレーン上の住人でなくてはなりません。
三階のプレーンはメタクラス・プレーンと呼びます。Ojbect , String , Personなどクラスが所属する分類カテゴリであるCLASSは、メタクラスと呼ばれるものなのです。
この図では、メタクラス・プレーンにはCLASSしかいませんが、クラスをBUILTIN_CLASS（組み込みクラス）とUSER_DEFINED_CLASS（ユーザー定義クラス）に分ければ、メタクラス・プレーン内に次のような関係が生じます。
そして、四階であるメタメタクラス・プレーンを設けて、そこにMETACLASSというメタ分類カテゴリーを置いてもいいかもしれません。
CLASS is - instance - of METACLASS BUILTIN_CLASS is -instance - of METACLASS USER_DEFINED_CLASS
is -instance - of METACLASS
メタタワーと繰り返しレイフィケーション
通常は、オブジェクト・プレーンとクラス・プレーンの二階建てで十分でしょう。しかし、プログラミング言語や応用によっては三階建て、四階建ての建物が必要になります。原理的には、「メタ、メタメタ、メタメタメタ、…」とより高いレベルの概念を作り出せるので、メタレベルを昇るタワーは高層建築になり得ます。
レイフィケーションも、二階から一階だけでなく、三階から二階、四階から三階へのレイフィケーションも考えられます。もちろん、レイフィケーションを繰り返してメタレベルを落としていくことができます。三階にいるメタクラスであるCLASSは、まず二階のClassへとレイファイされ、さらに一階のClass.classにレイファイされたのです。
Class.class is - instance - of Class という関係は、もともと は
Class is - instance - of CLASS という二階と三階の関係をレイファイして、一階と二階の関係しにしたものです。その関係をさらに一階に（ちょっと無理やり）押し込めたので、( Class.class).getClass( ) == Class.class というループが生じたのです。
概念的なメタタワーの何階までがオブジェクト・プレーンにレイファイされているかにより、プログラムの実行時に自分自身の言語環境／実行環境をどこまで見られるか／触れるかが決まります。極端な話ですけど、メタタワーへの操作が十分に許されていれば、実行中にプログラミング言語の言語仕様や実行方式を変更しながら走るプログラムなんてのも実現可能です。
とととと、話がそれてきたのでこのへんにしましょう。オブジェクトとクラスの関係はそれほど単純ではないことを感じていただけたでしょうか。最後に
Class.classですが、これは、Classというクラスの代理であるクラスオブジェクトですから、Classクラスオブジェクトと呼べますよね、さらに正確には、CLASSというメタクラスの代理であるメタクラスクラスClassのクラスオブジェクトですから、メタクラスクラスClassクラスオブジェクトです :-)
Washington , D.C. – Speaker Nancy Pelosi released this statement on the New York Times report on President Trump ’s tax information :
Would it surprise you to learn that the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) is refusing to allow medical marijuana research to move forward — despite a clear recommendation from its own administrative law judge to let such research happen ?
If you ’re like me , this will be just the latest outrage from the same agency that insists on terrorizing and arresting medical marijuana patients and providers who are complying with state law and their doctors ’ advice .
Would you please take one minute to ask your U.S.
House member to direct the DEA to permit medical marijuana research to move forward ?
MPP ’s online action center has done all the work for you ; just click a few buttons and your letter will be sent .
( Congress provides the DEA with 100 % of its funding — all of it taxpayer money — so the DEA is more likely to listen to members of Congress than just about anyone else . )
In February of this year , DEA Administrative Law Judge Mary Bittner recommended that Professor Lyle Craker and the University of Massachusetts be granted a license to grow research - grade marijuana that would be used in FDA - and DEA - approved clinical studies into marijuana ’s therapeutic uses , noting that it would be “ in the public interest ” to do so .
But the DEA has ignored her recommendation and continued to block the research .
And earlier this month , during a hearing before the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime , Terrorism , and Homeland Security , DEA official Joseph Rannazzisi refused to commit to a timeline for ruling on the University of Massachusetts ’ application ... even implying that the DEA might just wait until after a new presidential administration takes power in January 2009 !
This is the height of hypocrisy .
The DEA continually cites insufficient research as a reason for keeping medical marijuana illegal — while simultaneously blocking the very research that ’s needed to persuade the FDA to approve marijuana as a prescription medicine .
How can the DEA hide behind the FDA in arguing against medical marijuana access , and then block any attempt to move marijuana through the FDA approval process ?
Would you please take one minute to ask your U.S.
House member to stop letting politics interfere with research into the medicinal value of marijuana ?
Thank you ,

Cocaine Jet Crash in Mexico Linked to Narco - Trafficker
Who Worked for U.S. Government Before His September Arrest , José Nelson Urrego May Have Been Operating as a Trafficker and Money Launderer for Years in Panama , Under U.S. Protection
By Bill Conroy
Special to The Narco News Bulletin Panamanian police descended on a small , private island off the Pacific coast of the Central American nation in late September of last year .
They arrested the island ’s owner , a middle - aged Colombia named Jose Nelson Urrego Cardenas , as well as his 20 - year - old girlfriend , who testified before Panamanian prosecutors just this week .

The police also found a sophisticated communications center on the island that is a clue to Urrego ’s occupation and to his connection to the Gulfstream II jet that fell from the sky over Mexico ’s Yucatan peninsula about a week after his arrest — with close to four tons of cocaine onboard .
The police also found a sophisticated communications center on the island that is a clue to Urrego ’s occupation and to his connection to the Gulfstream II jet that fell from the sky over Mexico ’s Yucatan peninsula about a week after his arrest — with close to four tons of cocaine onboard .
Baruch Vega , a Colombian citizen who has a long history as a CIA asset operating in Central and South America , has told Narco News that the Gulfstream II was part of an undercover government operation led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) – a law enforcement agency that is part of the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) .
Previously , DEA officers had told Narco News the same thing , indicating the Gulfstream II was linked to an ICE operation called the Mayan Express .
Documents obtained previously by Narco News also indicate that the jet was used in prior CIA operations and was last owned , in part by a pilot named Greg Smith — who was involved in prior DEA , FBI and CIA operations in Latin America some eight years ago .
Vega , however , offers a key revelation about the Gulfstream II incident that connects the cocaine onboard directly to the U.S. government via an informant and convicted narco - trafficker : Urrego .
In addition , press reports in Latin America add credence to Vega ’s revelations , which help to piece together the fabric of long - running DEA , ICE and CIA operations in Panama , Colombia and Mexico .
The Urrego Connection Urrego is a notorious narco - trafficker , according to the DEA , who has done work for the major Colombian drug organizations over the years — the Medellin , Cali and North Valley “ cartels ” — serving as a money launderer and communications expert .
His name will be familiar to anyone who has been reading Narco News ’ ongoing series on alleged corruption in the DEA ’s Bogotá office .
He was arrested in Colombia in 1998 on narco - trafficking charges and landed in Bogotá ’s La Picota prison .
Here ’s how a U.S. State Department report described Urrego in the wake of his arrest in the late 1990s :
He is a Colombian multi- ton cocaine trafficker and money launderer who is mentioned in over 80 DEA case files dating back to 1982 .
Urrego ’s role as a communications chief for Colombian narco - traffickers is detailed in the following report in Business 2.0 magazine : [ Urrego ’s ] network ’s command center was hidden in a Bogotá warehouse outfitted with a retractable German - made Rhode & Schwarz transmission antenna about 40 feet high , and 15 to 20 computers networked with servers and a small mainframe .
The same kind of state - of - the - art setup existed in communications centers at Urrego ’s ranch in Medellín , at an island resort he owned , and at a hideout in Cali .
Seized invoices and letters show that Urrego or his associates had recently bought roughly $ 100,000 worth of Motorola ( MOT ) gear : 12 base stations , 16 mobile stations installed in trucks and cars , 50 radio phones , and eight repeaters , which boost radio signals over long distances .
The range of Urrego ’s network extended across the Caribbean and the upper half of South America .
He and his operatives used it to send text messages to laptops in dozens of planes and boats to inform their pilots when it was safe to go , and to receive confirmations of when loads were dropped and retrieved .
According to one intelligence official who analyzed Urrego ’s network , it was transmitting 1,000 messages a day — and not one of them was intercepted , even by U.S. spy planes .
So , Urrego is not small potatoes in the world of narco - trafficking .
In fact , he is one of the big fish .
So why did Colombian authorities release him from jail in September 2001 — after he had served only three years for his role as one of that country ’s major narco - trafficking masterminds ?
According to Vega , it ’s because the U.S. government recruited Urrego as an informant in exchange for the promise of a better deal related to the narco - trafficking charges he was facing at the time .
And Vega is certainly in a position to know ; for years , he was in charge of negotiating such deals with dozens of Colombian traffickers who ultimately surrendered to U.S. authorities .
In fact , Vega contends Urrego also has been indicted in the United States and was staring down an extremely long prison sentence absent some kind of deal .
DEA officers also confirmed to Narco News that Urrego is under indictment in the United States – but do n’t go looking for the paperwork on that , because you likely wo n’t find it .
It is a common practice for court records on U.S. cooperating sources to be “ super sealed ” to protect the informants ’ identity .
Vega says he initially approached Urrego in the late 1990s on behalf of the U.S. government to broker a deal with him while he was in prison in Bogota .
After several setbacks due to the interference of allegedly corrupt federal agents in Bogota , a DEA agent in Florida named Ed Fields finally managed , sometime around 2001 , to set up an operation involving Urrego .
One of Urrego ’s initial missions involved targeting Colombia ’s guerrilla rebels , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC in its Spanish initials ) , with a communications sting that played a role , according to the Miami Herald , in the indictments issued against some 50 FARC members in 2006 for alleged narco - trafficking activities .
Fields , with the help of the National Security Agency , according to documents obtained by Narco News , worked with Urrego in carrying out the sting , which involved clandestinely planting government - monitored satellite phones with the FARC ’s leadership .
The CIA also would have been involved in monitoring the operation , particularly any recordings , in the event information surfaced that was of value on the intelligence front , law enforcement and intelligence officials say .
Vega says that Urrego continued to work as a CIA asset from that point onward , while also doing work for the DEA and more recently ICE .
In fact , according to Vega , Urrego is the man behind the cocaine onboard the Gulfstream II that crashed in Mexico in late September of last year .
In fact , since his arrest in September , Urrego himself has repeatedly said he was working for the CIA and other U.S. government agencies his entire time in Panamá .
If the Panamanian government ’s charges against Urrego are true , they suggest that he was making huge sums of money through drug trafficking and money laundering while under the protection of U.S. security agencies .
Busted in Panama On Sept. 15 , 2007 , a little more than a week before the Gulfstream II jet crashed on Sept. 24 in the town of Tixkokob after being waived off of two airports in the Yucatan , Panamanian authorities raided Urrego ’s home on Chapera Island off the Pacific Coast of Panama .
He was arrested on money laundering charges related to alleged narco - trafficking activities .
Reports in the Panamanian press ( including this one in the newspaper El Siglo ) claimed Urrego had established an impressive communications center on the island that he bought for some $ 12 million , and that he had numerous bank accounts , properties and shell companies that served as fronts for his money laundering activities .
Reuters reported the following on Sept. 21 , 2007 : PANAMA CITY ( Reuters ) – Panama said on Friday that it would investigate how a known Colombian drug trafficker managed to obtain Panamanian residence , ID cards , bank accounts and even a $ 12 million private island without being noticed .
President Martin Torrijos said a probe would be opened into how Jose Urrego , who was detained by Colombia in the 1990s for drug smuggling , carried on illicit activities unnoticed in Panama for at least three years until his arrest last week .
Urrego , 53 , was arrested on Chapera Island , off the Pacific coast .
Police said he was working as communications chief for Colombia ’s Norte del Valle cartel .
Urrego claims he was not engaged in any illegal activities and denied ever serving as a communications chief for Colombian narco - trafficking organizations .
After his arrest , Urrego told prosecutors he had connections to the CIA , which had provided him training in the use of specialized communications equipment , and that since 2005 he has had a driver ’s license , work permit and a multiple - entry visa for the United States — provided through ICE .
According the Panamanian daily La Prensa , Urrego had been in the United States numerous times over the course of 2007 , as recently as July of last year .
( Given ICE ’s well - publicized efforts to round up and deport working immigrant families who lack proper U.S. paperwork , the fact that a known narco - trafficker was allowed to enter and leave the country freely speaks volumes about the double standards inherent in U.S. immigration policy and also hints at the high value placed on Urrego as a cooperating source for U.S. government operations in Latin America . )

“ Usually , you relocated a source to the states for safety , but if Urrego was going back and forth to Panama , he was not worried about safety . ”

“ Usually , you relocated a source to the states for safety , but if Urrego was going back and forth to Panama , he was not worried about safety . ”
Vega contends that Urrego ’s arrest by Panamanian authorities compromised ICE ’s operation , leading to the crash of the Gulfstream II jet .
He , along with several law enforcement professionals who spoke to Narco News , say it is even possible that Urrego ’s arrest led the narco - traffickers involved to purposely cause the crash of the jet — avoiding an airport landing that might well be a trap — so that corrupt law enforcers in Mexico working with the traffickers could get to the scene and make off with some of the cocaine payload .
Reports in the Mexican publication Por Esto !
do raise the speculation that some of the jet ’s payload was , in fact , unaccounted for in the wake of the crash .
A retired CIA case officer , Leutrell Osborne , told Narco News that Urrego ’s arrest might well have been a surprise to the U.S. government agencies using him as an informant .
Osborne also says another possibility is that the Agency purposely set him up in order “ to protect somebody else . ”
Osborne stresses , however , that he has no personal knowledge of CIA ’s alleged relationship with Urrego .

Vega points out that ICE ’s Mayan Express was being carried out unilaterally in Latin America .
DEA employees who spoke anonymously to Narco News said the same .
In other words , government and police officials in Panama , Colombia and Mexico had no idea such an operation was taking place or of Urrego ’s role as an informant .
Several law enforcement officials also say the operation could not have been pulled off in secret south of the border absent substantial assistance from the CIA .

Several law enforcement officials also say the operation could not have been pulled off in secret south of the border absent substantial assistance from the Vega says this secrecy was necessary because U.S. officials were concerned that corrupt elements within those countries ’ political and law enforcement ranks — as well as allegedly corrupt agents in the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá — might compromise the operation and Urrego if U.S. officials made the operation known .
However , that also meant Urrego and ICE ’s Mayan Express were breaking the laws of those Latin American nations , as evidenced by Urrego ’s arrest by Panamanian authorities .
For possible answers to why the CIA and ICE would be involved in such an operation in the first place , see this accompanying report .
The Operation Vega understands well what it is like to work for multiple U.S. agencies at the same time .
From 1997 through 2000 , he made numerous trips to Latin America as part of a mission supported by the FBI , DEA and CIA to broker deals with Colombian narco - traffickers — with an eye toward recruiting them as cooperating sources .
Greg Smith , who is listed on the bill of sale for the Gulfstream II jet , was Vega ’s pilot for most of those trips , Vega confirms .
Vega currently has a lawsuit pending in federal court in Washington , D.C. , in which he alleges the government short - changed him to the tune of some $ 28.5 million in promised payments for his highly dangerous work .
He also alleges that corrupt agents in the U.S. Embassy in Bogota compromised him and his mission because they are in league with Colombian narco - traffickers — which Narco News has reported on extensively in its Bogota Connection series .
Vega ’s documented experience as an informant for multiple U.S. agencies shows that someone as well connected as Urrego in the narco - trafficking world also would be viewed as a highly valued asset by numerous U.S. government agencies .
And each of those might have used Urrego in separate or joint missions to achieve their varied — maybe even conflicting — goals , as happened with Vega .
As a result , Urrego essentially became a narco - trafficker and money launder employed by the U.S. government — without the knowledge of the foreign nations where he carried out his deeds for Uncle Sam .
Vega says that in the case of the Gulfstream II jet , Urrego played a key role in organizing a syndicate of buyers who put together the cocaine shipment for delivery to the U.S. market .
He claims Urrego ’s share of the deal involved contributing some 350 kilos of the nearly four - ton payload , the rest of the cocaine coming from right - wing paramilitaries in Colombia who are involved in the narco - trafficking business .
The game plan , Vega contends , was to track the cocaine after it had been delivered to the United States , with the hope of making arrests along the supply chain inside the United States .
“ Urrego was participating [ in the cocaine shipment ] as an investor on behalf of the United States , ” Vega explains . “…
He was part of the syndicate . ”
Vega adds that once the drug shipment arrived in the United States , Urrego was to be notified by his partners in the deal , and he in turn , unbeknownst to them , would provide that information to U.S. law enforcers ( ICE ) so that the drugs could be monitored from that point and cases built against individuals involved in the distribution of the drugs in the United States .
The problem with such a plan , DEA sources contend , is that by allowing the dope into the country in the first place — a shipment assisted by a jet provided via the U.S. government — ICE , with the support of CIA , essentially becomes a drug smuggling organization , and its operations south of the border could never be revealed in a court of law because they violated international laws .
In addition , should something go wrong — Urrego fails to provide accurate information on where the dope is landing in the U.S. or there are last minute changes he is not made aware of for some reason — some four metric tons of cocaine would hit the streets of the United States unchecked .
In addition , it is likely the cocaine on the Gulfstream II jet was not the only shipment involved , since DEA sources tell Narco News that the Mayan Express is an “ ongoing operation . ”
“ What sense does it make for the government to smuggle drugs into the country itself just to make cases ? ” Gonzalez says .
“ I find it strange for a law enforcement agency to be running a unilateral operation involving that much dope being moved out of Colombia .
It ’s an indication to me that something illegal is going on involving either crooks and / or government people . ”
The Mayan Express : What Was DEA ’s Role ?
Vega contends that before the Gulfstream II ’s crash , DEA did know about the ICE operation .
And DEA spokesman Steve Robertson told Narco News previously that his agency played no role in the Gulfstream II case , other than being charged with investigating the jet ’s cocaine payload after the aircraft collided with the Earth .
“ Our Mexico City office is working an investigation on it now , ” Robertson says .
“ It started after the seizure [ the jet crash ] .
It ’s an ongoing investigation . “…
It was not a DEA operation .
The briefing I ’ve gotten is that our investigation started after the seizure . ”
Narco
News made several efforts to contact ICE officials for comment on this story , both by phone and e-mail .
To date , no one at ICE has responded .

Law enforcement sources tell Narco
News that it is quite possible that DEA chose not to get involved with the operation because it would have violated the laws of Panama , Colombia and Mexico .
DEA would have the most to lose if linked to such an operation , since it operates openly and closely with governments in the region and would risk having that cooperation compromised if the operation were exposed .

And there is a precedent for the DEA refusing to approve operations deemed to be outside the bounds of the laws of the foreign nations where the agency has a presence .
In the early 1990s , the CIA ran a spook mission designed to infiltrate Colombian narco - trafficking groups that resulted in at least a ton of cocaine — some estimates put the figure much higher — entering the United States unchecked .
The former head of the DEA , Robert Bonner , incensed at the Agency ’s actions — which went forward even after DEA refused to sanction the operation — appeared on national TV at the time and essentially accused the CIA of engaging in drug trafficking .
The CIA operation , which was carried out with the assistance of a Venezuelan National Guard general who was a CIA asset , unraveled after U.S. Customs seized a load of the dope in Miami .
However , law enforcement officials Narco News spoke to also say it is likely current DEA leadership would not have openly challenged the ICE operation — particularly if it was approved at high levels within the Bush administration .
If that ’s the case , the irony is that DEA is now charged with investigating a jet crash that they know is linked to a U.S. government operation that was being carried out in violation of the laws of numerous Latin American nations .
Former CIA case officer Osborne says that assuming Urrego is a CIA asset , he would have been of high value for three reasons : his connections to the narco - trafficking world , his skill as a money launderer and his expertise in communications .
However , he says one of those areas would have been given a higher rating depending on the nature of the CIA ’s target in the region .
He also concedes that CIA might well have turned a blind eye to Urrego ’s criminal activity — including narco - trafficking — in order to advance a high - priority “ national security objective . ”
“ If it ’s a [ high - value ] intelligence operation , the CIA will continue the operation to get more information , even if some drugs are getting into the country , ” Osborne says .
Gonzalez , who also held leadership positions in DEA ’s field offices in Miami and El Paso prior to retiring in 2005 , makes it clear that in all likelihood Urrego remained involved in the narco - trafficking and money laundering business while working as a cooperating source for the U.S. government .
And Gonzalez also stresses that in his experience working overseas , the CIA was often an obstacle to overcome when it came to DEA ’s mission of disrupting the narco - trafficking trade .
“ The problem with putting U.S. police and spies overseas is that the spy agenda comes first , before law enforcement , ” Gonzalez says .
“ The only time that does n’t happen is when we do something and do n’t notify the spies , and a lot of times we did it that way because of the hypocrisy of it all . ”

[ The following e-mail was sent out by Rep. Robert Wexler today ]
Tonight , President Bush will issue what will thankfully be his final State of the Union address ; but , little of what he says can be trusted .
For the past seven years , we have watched as America has moved steadily backwards .
We have become a nation that is less free and less fair .
We have become a nation that no longer values the right to privacy and has tragically retreated from our cherished foundations .
Nothing George W. Bush says tonight will change the sad reality of the America he has given us :
– Our economy teeters on the edge of recession while property taxes spike and homeowners are losing their homes at record levels ;
– Our educational system is broken and our teachers are abandoned ;
– Our roads and bridges languish in disrepair , while our borders and ports remain under - inspected and insecure ;
– Our most basic ideals about law and justice have been tossed out , as our President uses fear to pursue his reckless agenda ; and
– We remain mired in Iraq “ “ a war built on lies and manipulated intelligence .
Nowhere in American history – not even Watergate – have we been confronted with an Administration so ambivalent about the truth and established law .
A recent nonpartisan study found that the Bush Administration lied over 900 times in the prelude to the Iraq war , misleading us on nearly every critical issue .
It is time that we reclaim this country and undue the damage wrought by George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
Democrats in Congress must stand up and lead “ “ no matter the cost .
We need to finally act on the promises of the 2006 election and stop at nothing to bring our troops home from the Iraq .
If we do not act Bush will install a permanent US presence in Iraq and John McCain ’s vision of a 100 year US occupation will become reality .
( Click here to read my recent editorial on the Failure of the Bush Surge in Iraq . )
It is time that we faced up to our global responsibilities and begin to prevent global warming .
In the richest nation on earth , it is long past time that we provide health insurance to every single American .
We must aggressively pursue impeachment hearings for Vice President Dick Cheney due to serious allegations of abuse of power including illegal wiretapping , torture , and deliberate lies to bring us to war .
( Click here to see my recent speech on the floor of the House calling for impeachment hearings ) .
Fifteen members of Congress – including 4 Judiciary Committee members – have already joined my call to Chairman Conyers for impeachment hearings and more are joining each day : ( Click here to see the letter I am sending to Congressman Conyers and the list of members who have joined as signatories . )
Bush Administration officials and cabinet members must answer questions – on the record – regarding illegal wiretapping , torture , and what I perceive as deliberate , knowing lies to the American people in an effort to bring us to war in Iraq .
Impeachment hearings are essential because the Administration has recklessly used claims of executive privilege to block key witnesses from testifying .
Impeachment hearings could force the Administration to drop their executive privilege claims and we would then finally get the answers this nation deserves .
We are making progress with over 216,000 Americans already registering their support at WexlerWantsHearings.com .
We must rededicate ourselves to the core values of this nation and finally deliver to the American people the change they demanded when they stood up and voted for Democrats in 2006 .
I value your support , and I am thankful for your patriotism .
Together , we can begin to restore the state of our Union .
With warm regards ,

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Nearly a third of antidepressant drug studies are never published in the medical literature and nearly all happen to show that the drug being tested did not work , researchers reported on Wednesday .

In some of the studies that are published , unfavorable results have been recast to make the medicine appear more effective than it really is , said the research team led by Erick Turner of the Oregon Health & Science University .
Even if not deliberate , this can be bad news for patients , they wrote in their report , published in the New England Journal of Medicine .
“ Selective publication can lead doctors to make inappropriate prescribing decisions that may not be in the best interest of their patients and , thus , the public health , ” they wrote .
The idea that unfavorable test results are quietly tucked away so nobody will see them -- sometimes call the “ file drawer effect ” -- has been around for years .
The Turner team used a U.S. Food and Drug Administration registry in which companies are supposed to log details of their drug tests before the experiments are begun .
“ It tells you where they placed their bets before they saw the data , ” Turner said in a telephone interview .
Of the 74 studies that started for the 12 antidepressants , 38 produced positive results for the drug .
All but one of those studies were published .
REWRITTEN STUDIES
However , only three of the 36 studies with negative or questionable results , as assessed by the FDA , were published and another 11 were written as if the drug had worked .
“ Not only were positive results more likely to be published , but studies that were not positive , in our opinion , were often published in a way that conveyed a positive outcome , ” said the authors .
For example , of the seven negative studies done on GlaxoSmithKline ’s Paxil , five were never published .
The researchers found three studies for GSK ’s Wellbutrin SR , but the two negative ones never reached print .
There were five studies for Pfizer ’s Zoloft , but the three showing the drug to be ineffective were not published .
A fourth study , ruled questionable by the FDA , was written and published to make it appear that the drug worked .
A Glaxo spokeswoman said the company posts the data from all of its trials , positive or negative , on the Internet .
“ GlaxoSmithKline agrees that public disclosure of clinical trial results for marketed medicines is essential and fully supports registration of all trials in progress , ” she said .
“ Pfizer is committed to the communication of results of all registered clinical studies , regardless of outcome .
More specifically , we have committed to disclose clinical trial results within one year after study completion for all of our marketed products , ” Pfizer spokesman Jack Cox said in an e-mail .
Turner and his colleagues did not find out who was to blame for not publishing the studies .
He said medical journals may have played a role by deciding they would rather publish favorable results .
“ There ’s an expectation that if you get a positive result , that ’s what you ’re supposed to do , and if you get a negative result you have failed , ” said Turner .
“ The first impulse is to say , ‘ I was wrong .
Maybe I should move on to something more interesting ’ ” so the results may never get written up .
GAZA CITY ( CNN ) --
The Israeli military carried out two airstrikes Thursday on vehicles in northern Gaza , killing six Palestinians -- including two civilians , Palestinian security sources said .
Palestinians on Thursday carry the body of a man they said died the night before in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza .
One of the strikes hit a wagon carrying an Islamic Jihad militant and his mother , who also was killed , the Palestinian sources said .
A Palestinian civilian driving a nearby car also died in the strike , they said .
Earlier Thursday , Israeli aircraft bombed a car and killed three members of the Popular Resistance Committee 's military wing , Palestinian security sources and witnesses said .
Both strikes happened near Beit Lahya , they said .
The Israeli military confirmed two airstrikes in the region , saying the second one targeted a rocket - launching squad after it fired a spate of Qassam rockets toward Israel .
Under pressure to stop ongoing attacks from Gaza , the Israeli military has clamped down on the Palestinian territory in recent days .
Palestinian militants fired at least 33 rockets Thursday from Gaza into Israel , the Israel Defense Forces said .
Two rockets landed in the central Israeli town of Sderot , one hitting a house and causing major damage , the IDF said .
The IDF identified the devices as Palestinian Qassam rockets , which are crudely made and unguided missiles packed with explosives .
Israeli troops then launched two strikes on militants who fired the rockets , the IDF said .
On Tuesday , an Israeli raid in Gaza City killed 19 Palestinians , including the son of senior Hamas official Mahmoud al - Zahar .
Hamas said it responded by firing 15 rockets into Israel , most in or around Sderot .
Five people were wounded , according to Israeli medical services .
As Tuesday 's IDF operation was under way , snipers near the Gaza border fired into Israel , fatally striking a kibbutz farmer , according to emergency officials and the IDF .
On Wednesday , an errant Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed three members of a family in a car .
The Israeli military confirmed the missile , intended for a car carrying militants , struck the wrong vehicle .
A spokeswoman said the military regrets the loss of innocent life but stressed militants put civilians at risk by operating in populated areas of Gaza .
Watch as rocket attacks and airstrikes threaten to derail a peace deal »
A second airstrike later Wednesday destroyed a car carrying rockets in southern Gaza , killing at least one person , according to Palestinian security sources .
Also Wednesday , Israeli soldiers shot and killed Walid Obeidi , leader of the extremist Islamic Jihad in the West Bank , while trying to arrest him in the northern part of that territory , an IDF spokesman said .
The violence comes as Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and former Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qorei on Monday had their first discussions regarding " final status , " or core issues , aimed at reaching a peace deal by the end of the year .

The crocodile seized the man 's arm and shook him
The victim , in his late 20s , was attacked by the reptile near a popular tourist spot on the Mary River south - east of Darwin .
He was flown to hospital by helicopter for emergency surgery for bite and bullet wounds .
He is currently in a stable condition in hospital .
Two shots
Crocodile attacks and shootings are rare in Australia .
To suffer both at once is - to say the least - unfortunate .
Jason Grant was collecting crocodile eggs at a remote reptile farm when he found himself locked inside a giant set of jaws .
For a few terrifying moments the animal wildly shook its victim before the intervention of a fellow worker .
He fired two shots at the saltwater crocodile .
One hit the target , while the other struck the arm of his stricken colleague .
It was enough though to bring the drama to an end .
The injured man was flown to hospital in Darwin , where he is recovering .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Marine Lance Cpl. Joshua
Bleill lost both his legs above the knees when a bomb exploded under his Humvee while on patrol in Iraq on October 15 , 2006 .
He has 32 pins in his hip and a 6 - inch screw holding his pelvis together .
Joshua Bleill , pictured here with his girlfriend , is walking again with the aid of prosthetics outfitted with Bluetooth .
Now , he 's starting to walk again with the help of prosthetic legs outfitted with Bluetooth technology more commonly associated with hands - free cell phones .
" They 're the latest and greatest , " Bleill said , referring to his groundbreaking artificial legs .
Bleill , 30 , is one of two Iraq war veterans , both double leg amputees , to use the Bluetooth prosthetics .
Computer chips in each leg send signals to motors in the artificial joints so the knees and ankles move in a coordinated fashion .
Bleill 's set of prosthetics have Bluetooth receivers strapped to the ankle area .
The Bluetooth device on each leg tells the other leg what it 's doing , how it 's moving , whether walking , standing or climbing steps , for example .
" They mimic each other , so for stride length , for amount of force coming up , going uphill , downhill and such , they can vary speed and then to stop them again , " Bleill told CNN from Walter Reed Army Medical Center , where he 's undergoing rehab .
" I will put resistance with my own thigh muscles to slow them down , so I can stop walking , which is always nice . "
Watch Bleill demonstrate his legs »
Bluetooth is the name for short - range wireless technology that can connect computers to printers , MP3 players to speakers and -- perhaps the most well - known use -- cell phones to ear pieces .
Older models of computer - controlled legs have to be " programmed " via wire by laptop computers before the amputee can use them .
Those legs required more movement from the amputee 's remaining thigh muscle to generate motion in the prosthetic leg .
Because of built - in motors , the Bluetooth legs allow Bleill to walk longer before he tires .
" We 've compared walking several laps in both sets of legs and one , your legs come out burning and tired and these , you know , you sometimes are not even breaking a sweat yet . "
Bleill says the technology also means he spends less time in a wheelchair .
The Marine uses canes to walk with them .
He 's hoping to get to the point where he can use one cane regularly , and eventually lose the cane altogether .
" I can walk without canes , but it 's not real pretty , " he said .
This new generation of prosthetic technology was originally conceived to help amputees who had lost only one leg .
But it 's working for Bleill and Army Lt.Col .
Gregory Gadson , who is also using the Bluetooth devices in his legs .
What they are experiencing will help future amputees .
" We are the first ever to try this , so it 's learning day - to - day .
The [ prosthetics ] company comes down on a regular basis and checks in with us , " Bleill said .
Gadson , a former linebacker at West Point , said they are breaking new ground for amputees .
" I think we are kind of pioneering and hopefully blazing a trail for others to try the technology also , " he said .
But the technology is not without some problems .
" It 's only going to react to how I move , " Bleill said .
" Unfortunately , sometimes I do n't know those reactions , I do n't know what I 'm doing to make it react .
So sometimes the leg kicks harder than I want it to , or farther , and then I start perpetuating , and I start moving faster than I really want to . "
Aside from the Bluetooth technology , Bleill 's legs have one other thing in common with a cell phone .
They need to be charged overnight .
Currently , there are no spare batteries available .
What are his long - range plans ?
He just wants to make it back to his home state of Indiana and work for a charity or even help the NFL's Indianapolis Colts .
" They do a lot for the community , " he said .
He added he simply wants " to give back . "
" To , you know , just carry on a normal life .
Go home , see my girlfriend , see my family . "

Why is it that George W. Bush gets only a 12 percent favorability rating in Saudi Arabia ?
Even Osama bin Laden and Iran ’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad scored higher in a poll last month by the nonpartisan Terror Free Tomorrow group , which counts both Republican Sen. John McCain and Democrat former Rep. Lee Hamilton on its advisory board .
What ingrates those Saudis are .
Did n’t the Bush family save them twice from Saddam Hussein ?
What more can this president do to curry favor with the Saudis ?
He forgave them for nurturing the Wahhabism that spawned al - Qaida , and he never embarrasses them with the fact that bin Laden and 15 of the19 hijackers who attacked America on 9/11 were born and raised in the kingdom .
Nor did Bush let the inconvenient fact that the Saudi government had backed the Taliban until 9/11 intrude on his cozy relations with the royal family .
That warmth , displayed at ranching cookouts in both countries , has now been reinforced by $ 20 billion in U.S. arms sales to the Saudis and their Persian Gulf allies , officially announced by Bush on Monday .
At first , the Bush administration feared that some pro-Israel members of Congress might be able to derail the arms sale deal , but they solved that one by offering Israel $ 30 billion in new weapons .
That ’s a good deal for the Israelis and for U.S. arms manufacturers , although not for U.S. taxpayers stuck with the tab .
No problem — neither the media nor Congress notices the cost to taxpayers of anything carrying the label of “ national security . ”
Heck , Iraq ’s defense minister was just in Washington with his shopping list for new weapons and did n’t cause much of a stir when he said the United States will have to defend Iraq for at least a decade more .
So much for the impact of the $ 1 trillion already wasted on the Iraq debacle .
At least the Saudis pay their own way and then some , when you look at how our main banks would now be kaput were it not for the almost daily bailouts from Gulf - based holding companies .
It ’s a good deal all around :
The Gulf sheiks get their money by raising oil prices that drive up inflation , thus raising the interest rates on home mortgages , and then , when the banks foreclose on those homes at a loss , the oil money comes pouring in to make the banks whole again .
A good deal for everyone , that is , except for the folks who lose the equity in their homes , but they do n’t have a lobby that Congress or the president has to worry about .
With Bush ’s imperial fantasy fading into dismal reality , our nation saddled with record debt , an immense trade gap and an American public that has seen through his “ What , me worry ? ” con , the president has bizarrely sought validation through visiting the scene of his foreign policy crimes .
Just how bizarre a ploy was summarized in a Wall Street Journal news report predicting , “ As President Bush tours the Middle East on his first official visit , he will encounter an Arab public deeply critical of his policies in the region and skeptical that the U.S. means what it says . ”
The WSJ article quotes the editor of a leading newspaper aligned with Lebanon ’s U.S. - backed government as stating unequivocally : “ Democracy in the Middle East is now part of history .
Nobody believes Bush anymore .
He has turned the Middle East into a big mess , and you ca n’t bring democracy and change with instability . ”
A big mess !
It turns out they hate us not for our success , as Bush once claimed , but for our incompetence , which he has done much to exhibit .
The poll of Saudis found that while only 12 percent hold a favorable opinion of Bush , a much more comfortable 40 percent like the United States .
That ’s a lower approval rating than for China — or for Iran , from which Bush now wants to protect them — but it ’s a start .
The problem is that few believe that Bush is the least bit serious about addressing any of the region ’s problems .
As an editorial in the Arab News , a Saudi English - language newspaper , put it on the occasion of Bush ’s visit : ” … no Palestinian , no Arab believes , he will , or can , deliver .
…
Everything he touches turns to dust and ashes .
Iraq , Afghanistan , maybe now even Iran . ”
There they go again , worrying only about themselves .
Did n’t Bush also touch New Orleans ?
What about Enron ?
Things have gotten so tough here that even Halliburton ’s CEO moved his headquarters to Dubai .
The bad news for the Saudis is that Bush broke the United States — but they own it .
Several genes have been implicated in skin cell ageing
In two - year old mice , Californian researchers found that they could rejuvenate skin to look more youthful .
Further analysis published in the journal Genes and Development showed the skin had the same genetic profile as the skin of newborn mice .
The team said the research would most likely lead to treatments to improve healing in older human patients .
They stressed it was unlikely to be a potential " fountain of youth " but could help older people heal as quickly from injury as they did when they were younger .
The protein in question - NF - kappa - B - is thought to play a role in numerous aspects of ageing .
We found a pretty striking reversal to that of the young skin
Dr Howard Chang
Dr Chang interview
It acts as a regulator , causing a wide range of other genes to be more or less active .
Lead researcher , Dr Howard Chang , from the Stanford School of Medicine in California , said the findings supported the theory that ageing is the result of specific genetic changes rather than accumulated wear and tear .
And that it is possible to reverse those genetic changes later in life .
Regulation
Previous studies have identified several genes which play a part in the ageing process .
Dr Chang and colleagues spotted that the one thing the genes had in common was that they were regulated by NF - kappa - B , which can either make them more or less active .
By blocking the protein in older mice for two weeks , they found the skin was thicker and more cells appeared to be dividing , much like the skin of a younger mouse .
And the same genes were active as in the skin of newborn mice .
It is unclear whether the effects are long - lasting and the protein has also been implicated in cancer and regulation of the immune system .
" We found a pretty striking reversal to that of the young skin , " Dr Chang said .
But he added any application in humans was likely to be on a short - term basis because of other effects of blocking the protein .
" You might get a longer lifespan but at the expense of something else , " he said .
Nina Goad from the British Association of Dermatologists said : " Targeting of gene therapy to skin is still very difficult but this may provide some new avenues of research that will be of value to wound healing , following skin trauma or disfiguring skin cancer surgery .
" However , the researchers ' caveats about the unforeseen consequences of manipulating genes that play a role in many cells are most important and add a strong element of caution . "
Mr. Giuliani was a temple - throbbing Italian - American New Yorker who ruled a cacophonous city seen as the very definition of liberalism .
He was somewhat liberal on social issues  notably immigration and abortion  where Republican candidates are invariably conservative .
And he possessed a complicated family life : he has been thrice - married and has two adult children who rarely speak to him .
At the beginning of his campaign last spring , he sat for a celebrity photo shoot smooching with his third wife , who snuggled in his lap .
“ It bordered on science fiction to think that someone as liberal on as many issues as Rudy Giuliani could become the Republican nominee , ” said Nelson Warfield , a Republican consultant who has been a longtime critic of the former mayor .
“ Rudy did n’t even care enough about conservatives to lie to us .
The problem was n’t the calendar ; it was the candidate . ”
Several of Mr. Giuliani ’s campaign aides acknowledged as much Tuesday .
They say he tried to tack right without ever really convincing voters that he had experienced a change of heart .
And an adviser who has known Mr. Giuliani since the early 1990s and spoke on condition of anonymity said the mayor ’s early poll numbers struck him as ephemeral .
“ His numbers were built on name recognition and celebrity , ” this adviser said .
“ He had so many of his old friends around him , sometimes it was like he was running for president of Staten Island . ”
In his concession speech Mr. Giuliani acknowledged , jokingly , how out of place he often seemed among conservative Republicans .
“ We ’re a big party and we ’re getting bigger , ” he said .
“ I ’m even in this party . ”
After his third - place finish , Republican officials said Mr. Giuliani was expected to drop out of the race and endorse Mr. McCain , possibly as early as Wednesday .
In the beginning , few cracks were evident in the Giuliani campaign machine .
He led the Republican field in polls conducted by The New York Times and CBS News throughout the summer , as his support peaked in August at 38 percent nationally in a four - way fight with Mr. McCain , Mr. Romney and Fred D. Thompson .
That put him 20 points ahead of his next closest competitor , Mr. Thompson , who has since dropped out of the race .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s ambitious policy agenda collided with fiscal reality Thursday as he rolled out a proposed budget that threatens to unravel his investment in schools , healthcare and criminal justice programs .
At the same time he is pushing a $ 14 - billion expansion of healthcare to nearly all Californians , his budget calls for a rollback of existing medical programs for the needy .
His hope of improving schools may be dashed by what he says is a need , for the first time in years , to cut by hundreds of dollars the amount spent on each student .
And an expansion of the prison system he hoped to reform is now eclipsed by his proposal to release tens of thousands of inmates and lay off prison guards .
Schwarzenegger ’s budget recommendations put into stark contrast the disparity between his vision of what the state can accomplish and what it can afford in the current economy -- especially , say state finance experts , if he sticks to his promise not to raise taxes .
“ I do not believe in tax increases , ” the governor said in releasing his spending plan at a news conference in the capital .
“ I think the people of California are sending to Sacramento plenty of dollars .
. . .
If we cannot function with that money , there is something wrong with the system . ”
Yet his vision for the state is costly -- and contradictory .
Proposing that the state more than double the borrowing voters approved 14 months ago for public works , the governor compared himself to Franklin D. Roosevelt with the New Deal .
Bewildered lawmakers and activists said that reference was inconsistent with his administration ’s bid to close nearly one of every five state parks .
“ I do n’t think it represents the governor ’s values , ” Assembly Speaker Fabian Nuñez ( D - Los Angeles ) said of the proposed budget , which is intended to close a $ 14.5 - billion gap over the next 18 months .
The plan includes some immediate cuts and others scheduled for the fiscal year that begins July 1 .
The Democrats who control the Legislature said they would reject most of the governor ’s recommendations .
Many in the majority party are already at work on an alternative : bills to raise taxes on high earners , oil companies and alcoholic beverages , among other targets .
Those bills will be opposed by Republicans , who hold enough votes to block any tax hike .
“ There is no way to move us on that , ” said Assembly Budget Committee Vice Chairman Roger Niello ( R - Fair Oaks ) .
Months of gridlock appear likely as lawmakers set priorities and negotiate with the administration for a compromise budget .
The Capitol is rife with speculation that the harsh budget approach is intended to soften opposition to higher taxes , thus allowing Schwarzenegger ultimately to break his pledge not to raise them .
The governor dismissed such talk .
“ I have made it very clear that we cannot tax our way out of this problem , ” he said .
The governor ’s proposal would involve keeping as many as 50,000 convicted criminals out of state prisons through early releases and changes to the parole system .
It would also mean excusing thousands of criminals sentenced to 20 months or less from serving any time at all .
The governor has also said he is prepared to drop the amount the state spends on each school student by more than $ 300 a year , and to eliminate cash grants for some children at risk of homelessness .
All of these options are preferable to raising taxes , he said .
“ I can see every single person hurt by those cuts , and I understand how difficult they will be for many , many people , ” Schwarzenegger said .
“ But the old way of balancing the budget by just grabbing money anywhere we can , . . . that time is over . ”
The governor ’s fellow Republicans already are criticizing his proposal for a surcharge averaging $ 10 a year on the property - insurance policies of millions of Californians , to pay for fire protection .
The administration says that idea is not a tax but a fee ; fiscal conservatives disagree .
“ We cannot ‘ tax and fee ’ our way out of the crisis we are in today , ” Assemblyman Michael Duvall ( R - Yorba Linda ) wrote Thursday on a conservative blog .
The proposed budget also includes an $ 11 increase in vehicle registration fees to fund the Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Highway Patrol .
Schwarzenegger has offered an austerity budget that conflicts with nearly everything he said about healthcare last year when he pushed his plan to expand coverage and increase efforts for preventive care .
That plan , which passed the Assembly and is pending in the Senate , would raise payments to those who care for the poor and enlarge the very programs the governor now suggests reducing .
The proposed budget would cut $ 4.7 billion from health and human services spending .
It would cut $ 1 billion in payments for doctors and hospitals that take care of the poor .
State - subsidized dental and optometry visits for the needy would be eliminated .
State AIDS programs would be rolled back by $ 11 million .
Advocates for the poor say such cuts could lead to long - term costs for the state , undermining the governor ’s pledge to wipe out what he says is a “ hidden tax ” paid to care for the uninsured .
Medi-Cal patients could have a harder time finding doctors , limiting their access to preventive care and leading to a spike in costly emergency room visits .
A suggested $ 109 - million cutback in a program that provides the frail elderly with workers to do their food shopping , laundry , meal preparation and other chores could force some out of their homes and into institutions , which are far more costly to the state .
The governor says he never again wants to be in the position of calling for such cuts .
His long - term solution is an approach that voters overwhelmingly rejected when he put it before them in 2005 but continues to enjoy strong support from Republican lawmakers : putting a constitutional cap on spending that would take effect during years when revenues are robust .
California would be forced to put the extra money into a rainy - day fund and use it to keep the budget in balance when the economy falters and revenues drop .
The governor said such a system works well in Arkansas .
Like many Democrats , Sen. Dean Florez ( D - Shafter ) said he was not impressed .
“ If the governor is looking at rural Arkansas as a model for addressing California ’s budget issues , ” he said , “ perhaps California is just too big of a state for him to handle . ”

Times staff writers Patrick McGreevy , Jordan Rau , Michael Rothfeld and Nancy Vogel also contributed to coverage of the governor ’s proposed budget .
The iPlayer will allow viewers to catch up with Life on Mars
The charge concerns the use of Microsoft technology in the corporation 's forthcoming iPlayer .
The web service , set for launch later this year , allows viewers to watch shows up to 30 days after broadcast .
The BBC has said it does intend to allow access to its content from computers with other operating systems .
A statement from the organisation read : " The BBC aims to make its content as widely available as possible and has always taken a platform agnostic approach to its internet services .
" It is not possible to put an exact timeframe on when BBC iPlayer will be available for Mac users .
However , we are working to ensure this happens as soon as possible and the BBC Trust will be monitoring progress on a six monthly basis . "
Next steps
The accusations against the BBC have been made by advocacy group the Open Source Consortium ( OSC ) .
They argue that the iPlayer will force people to use and purchase Microsoft products because it will initially only work on Microsoft Windows computers .
This would give the software company an unfair advantage and would be uncompetitive , they say .
BBC iPLAYER
iPlayer will allow viewers to catch up on TV programmes for seven days Some TV series can be downloaded and stored for 30 days Viewers will be able to watch shows streamed live over the internet Users will not be able to download programmes from other broadcasters Classical recordings and book - readings are excluded from iPlayer
Who else offers TV on - demand ?
The OSC would like to see the iPlayer use formats that work on all operating systems .
" The BBC has a mandate to provide equal access to people irrespective of platform , " said Mark Taylor , president of OSC .
" We do n't think it is appropriate to lock people into a particular desktop technology . "
The OSC has compared the situation to the BBC offering programmes that only work on certain makes of television .
" We believe the BBC has a higher duty of care than a purely commercial organisation , " Mr Taylor told the BBC News website .
The group , composed of organisations , businesses and individual proponents of open source software , has already complained to the telecoms and broadcast regulator Ofcom , as well as the DTI and BBC Trust .
Ofcom have previously stated that access to the iPlayer be " only one of many factors influencing the decision to purchase a new computer [ or ] operating system .
However , OSC disagrees and says the next step is to make a formal complaint to the European Commission ( EC ) .
" We 're preparing the full details at the moment and we will be sending a formal letter within the next week , " said Mr Taylor .
The EC will then have to decide whether there is a case to answer .
Public interest
The Windows - only media player was approved by the BBC Trust at the end of April this year .
The BBC had initially chosen to concentrate on a Windows - based system as it is the world 's dominant operating system .
The BBC intends to make content available on all platforms
In addition , it allows the corporation to use Microsoft 's off - the - shelf Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) system that means the programmes are deleted after 30 days .
All programmes , once downloaded , are only playable within iPlayer or using Windows Media Player 10 or 11 .
The DRM also prevents them being copied to other mediums such as DVD .
When the broadband player was approved , the corporation 's governing body asked the BBC to ensure that the iPlayer could run on different systems - such as Apple Macs - within " a reasonable time frame " , initially twenty - four months .
The BBC has previously said it cannot commit to a two - year time frame as many decisions would have to be made by third parties .
A statement from the BBC read : " Our ability to deliver this open approach will be influenced by the availability of alternative DRM systems on the market .
" In order to maximise public value , the BBC must balance extending access to content with the need to maintain the interests of rights holders and the value of secondary rights in BBC programming .
Without a time - based DRM framework the BBC would not be able to meet the terms of the trust 's PVT ( Public Value Test ) decision . "
However , the OSC argue that DRM - free downloads would be in the " public interest " .
" In an ideal world all DRM would be removed , " said Mr Taylor .

Despite his much - heralded “ Mormon speech ” earlier this month , Mitt Romney has avoided talking about the nitty - gritty of his Latter - day Sainthood on the campaign trail .
And therein lies a strategic gaffe perhaps akin to Al Gore ’s refusal in 2000 to campaign on the environment .
Sure , Mormonism may freak people out .
Its rules and rituals — baptizing the dead , the funny underwear — are a bit outside the Christian mainstream for a guy who needs to woo evangelicals in Iowa .
But forget for a moment the golden tablets , and consider this : Mormonism , at its most practical , is a deeply American religion — rooted in Republican Party orthodoxy and many bedrock American values .
While the Book of Mormon may tell tall tales of mythical Nephites romping around North America , LDS church doctrine , as practiced , emphasizes far more pragmatic tenets .
Mormons preach such virtues as moderation , frugality , taking care of your own , giving back to the community , and avoiding dependence on the government .
( They ’re also known for armed resistance , too , a history that should have wide appeal to the GOP gun-nut constituency , but that ’s another story . )
There ’s no better place to see the manifestation of all this than in a crisis .
Mormons are masters of disaster preparedness , a point that neither Romney nor his advisers have yet touted .
The church ’s humanitarian - services arm is an underappreciated asset that Romney has thus far failed to capitalize on as he ’s contended with the charge — or suspicion — that his religion makes him too weird to be president .
Ever since 9/11 , federal and state officials have been imploring Americans to stockpile some food and water and supplies in the basement , without tremendous success ( if my basement is any indication ) .
But long before the war on terror , the Mormon church was teaching its members how to prepare for the worst .
As the church ’s Welfare Services Handbook says , “ No true Latter - day Saint , while physically or emotionally able , will voluntarily shift the burden of his own or his family ’s well - being to someone else . ”
To that end , the church coaches members to stockpile a year ’s worth of food and drinking water , along with other provisions , and most do .
If terrorists or a tornado hits your neighborhood , you definitely want to be living next door to a family of Mormons .
The church ’s self - reliance dogma extends beyond the average family basement to the community at large .
For instance , it runs Bishop ’s Storehouse Services , a network of regional warehouses that became well known during the Great Depression .
When disaster strikes , church elders spring into action to distribute the goods through a welfare organization whose efficiency has been compared by some writers to the German Wehrmacht .
I grew up in Utah and have seen this phenomenon first hand .
In the spring of 1983 , after record levels of snow melted in the nearby mountains , City Creek flooded and threatened major parts of Salt Lake City .
On a Sunday morning , as the water started to rise , the church quickly mobilized thousands of people to make sandbags to save critical parts of downtown ( and , of course , the church infrastructure ) .
We watched with amazement as the volunteers literally diverted the floodwater onto State Street , a major thoroughfare ( where people later went fishing ) .
The efforts were so successful that state officials estimated that they prevented 1,400 acres of land from flooding and $ 140 million in water damage .
More recently , the church went into high gear during Hurricane Katrina in a performance that put the federal government to shame .
Before the storm made landfall , the LDS church in New Orleans safely evacuated all but about seven families out of about 2,500 local members , largely because the church had created an automated telephone emergency warning system that alerted all its members , instructing them to get out of town and telling them where to go .
Two days before the storm made landfall , while FEMA was floundering , the church dispatched 10 trucks full of tents , sleeping bags , tarps to cover wrecked roofs , bottled water , and 5 - gallon drums of gas from its warehouses to New Orleans and other hard - hit areas .
The supplies were distributed in an orderly fashion to people who desperately needed them .
Rather than downplay his religion , Mitt could spotlight the aspects of his church that reflect basic Republican values of self - sufficiency and the primacy of the private sector .
After all , if disaster strikes , who will really care whether the Book of Mormon puts the Garden of Eden in Missouri ?
What matters is that if Romney ends up in the White House , his God will no doubt tell him to dispatch the trucks before the hurricane strikes .

Politics About that NSFW trademark application
1 ) Yes , we applied for it .
2 ) Can't comment on the prank angle other than " stay tuned . "
3 ) Muhahaha .
I 've gotten a few email complaints about the NSFW trademark ap .
It bears mentioning that I received 10 x as many complaints about the DealNews ad with the picture of some guy's ass in it ( removed already , whoever over at DealNews thought that was a good idea needs to be punched in the face ) , and 100x as many complaints when we moved all the boobies links over to
I 'm guessing the complaints are from people who do n't read Fark , otherwise they'd know our end goal could n't possibly be suing everyone using NSFW out of existence .
So far , this one is my favorite :
About the NSFW Trademark Application , I can say three things :
1) Yes , we applied for it .2 ) Can't comment on the prank angle other than " stay tuned .

There 's an interesting yet unsurprising cross section of the priorities of an Internet audience for you .
I 'm guessing the complaints are from people who do n't read Fark , otherwise they'd know our end goal could n't possibly be suing everyone using NSFW out of existence .
So far , this one is my favorite :
How about you stop being dick heads and leave acronyms you did n't create alone .
do n't fark up the internet by being cock licking monkey farkers .
If you go around trademarking things like NSFW then you WILL screw the internet up for everyone else you greedy ass sucking granny douching shiat eaters .
You make me so angry !
To sum up the conclusions of the above email :
1 ) We 're ruining the Internet .
All of it , apparently .
At this rate we 'll have to go back to mailing each other letters and watching network TV .
EVERYBODY PANIC
2 ) Thanks to that last sentence , the voice in my head representing the author is Steve Urkel .
3 ) From the writing style , I can only conclude the author is German , mainly due to the phrase " granny douching shiat eaters " .
No doubt it 's available on Amazon with english subtitles , along with a note that people who purchased this item also purchased " cock licking monkey farkers " .
Additionally , I can't tell whether or not the adjective " cock licking " modifies the word " monkey " or " farkers " because depending on which it was you could make two completely different movies .
An aside : apologies for the late response on this , I was traveling all week and pretty much drunk the entire time .
I try to make a habit of not logging in while under the influence ( damn you eBay ) .
The real problem was I accidentally left my laptop charger at home .
I was trying to save battery power .
Until this happened I had never before thought of using this excuse , it 's a keeper .
I 'm home now so I can recharge both myself and the battery before the final trip of the year .
I 'll be in NYC Thursday doing random christmas stuff , Atlanta Friday to go to the Fark TV Christmas party , and home til 2008 as of Saturday .

Excuse the widget blogging hiatus , please ; I held back on this one till Google had rolled out a fix .
Our topic today , then , is the Gmail dashboard widget — a handy dashboard frontend to Google Mail .
As so many other widgets , this one , too , runs with access to the widget . system method .
However , the bug in question here does not relate to eval ( ) .
Instead , it ’s script - injection into the DOM due to a lack of output cleansing in the client - side JavaScript code .
It ’s , effectively , the same kind of vulnerability that underlies cross-site - scripting vulnerabilities in servers ; for a change , however , this is a client - side problem .
Consider this code fragment :
var titleText = MessagesTable .getTitleTextFromEntryElement(currentEntry ) ; titleText = ' < span class = " title - class " >' + titleText + '</ span >' ; if ( Prefs.getShowSnippets ( ) ) { var summary Text = MessagesTable.getSummary( currentEntry ) ; summaryText = ' < span class= " snippet-class " > - ' + summaryText + '</ span >' ; titleText += summaryText ; } titleText = " < div class='table-overflow -col ' > " + titleText + " < /div > " ; ... titleColumn.innerHTML
= titleText ;
The use of the non-standard innerHTML property to write to the DOM here means that , if we can inject tags into the titleText variable , we can actually write tags into that document object model .
Instead of reading more code , I sent a first message to my GMail account , with this subject :
Subject : < i>italic ?</i>
Now , guess how that message came out in the GMail widget …
So , we can write tags into the DOM .
The simple approach of just dropping some < script > tags into the subject header failed , though : innerHTML does n’t actually execute scripts right away .
However , this worked :
As soon as the mouse pointer hovered over the subject header of this message , a shell script would be downloaded from my web server , and then executed , with the user ’s privileges — the machine was taken over by sending a single e-mail , combined with a likely and innocuous user interaction .
What this example ( as the other , earlier ones ) demonstrates is that , as Web technologies move to the desktop , bad coding practices move with them .
However , what was once a problem that might affect one server - side application now tuns into a way to subvert client computers — easily , quickly , and thoroughly , and with no more tools than the ability to write a simple e-mail .
Possible fixes to this problem include escaping any user - supplied data that is expected to contain text before feeding it to dangerous programming constructs such as .innerHTML , or using safer programming constructs such as createTextNode .
The recent observations about widgets suggest several more general points , though :
On the one hand , figuring out useful security models for widgets is an important task ( that the W3C Web Application Formats Working Group , which works on a widget format , will have to take on , together with the various widget vendors ) .
On the other hand , it ’s clear that fancy security models are not enough :
We need to spread the word about sane programming practices for widgets , and quite likely some code review from those who advertise others ’ code as safe to download .
Finally , these kinds of issues are not just a problem with widgets : Just this Wednesday , Orkut was hit by a worm that was exploiting server - side cross - site scripting vulnerabilities .
As we see more and more cross -site requests and data flows — either through cross-site XMLHttpRequest , or through deliberate cross - site script inclusion – , we ’ll see attacks like these cross site boundaries .
We ’ll also see combined server and client - side attacks , just enabled by web technologies .
I hope to talk more about this at this year ’s Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin , and perhaps at the Web Conference next April in Beijing .
For all practical purposes , President Bush is now a lame - duck President .
If that ’s the case , then why is his administration working so hard to take away even more of America ’s constitutional rights and his departmental heads are ramping - up their efforts to increase the spying on Americans ?
The common logic is that when Bush leaves office , some semblance of sanity will return to the United States and we will continue conducting whatever “ war on terror ” that needs to be undertaken without violating the constitutional rights of innocent Americans .
We are all hoping the 2008 elections will bring back the rule of law to Washington , and these illegal and unconstitutional programs will be dismantled .
That ’s what we are hoping …
But , the signals coming out of Washington speak of a different story - one that is too horrific to imagine !
Based on the rush to dismantle almost off of America ’s rights to privacy - and these actions and initiatives are being carried out at a dizzying speeds , it would appear that Bush has no plans of leaving office or this Presidency fully expects the next President to follow in his footsteps of tyranny and oppression .
The stage is being set for these violations of our civil rights to escalate and careen out of control until eventually - perhaps within months , nothing Americans use their personal computers for will remain private .
No , I ’m not being melodramatic .
I ’ve warned people myself that S 1959 , The “ Thought Crime Prevention Bill ” is being partially implemented even though its still in committee and has n’t been passed into law yet .
Yesterday , a brilliant essay was a written on exactly what privacy the government is attempting to negate by Elliot Cohen , and he describes why this is happening within America .
People must be noticing that none of the Presidential candidates are speaking in depth in regard the way that Americans are losing some of their most basic constitutional rights , and none are pledging to stop the constant fear - mongering that our government is using to push its policies through , nor are they pledging to stop those policies that infringe on our constitutional rights .
The following Op - Ed is powerful and covers many of the issues that seem to be intertwined with S 1959 :
The End of Privacy Posted on Jan 24 , 2008 ( Excerpts ) By Elliot Cohen Amid the controversy brewing in the Senate over Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) reform , the Bush administration appears to have changed its strategy and is devising a bold new plan that would strip away FISA protections in favor of a system of wholesale government monitoring of every American ’s Internet activities .
Now the national director of intelligence is predicting a disastrous cyber - terrorist attack on the U.S. if this scheme is n’t instituted .
It is no secret that the Bush administration has already been spying on the e-mail , voice - over - IP , and other Internet exchanges between American citizens since as early as and possibly earlier than Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The National Security Agency has set up shop in the hubs of major telecom corporations , notably AT&T , installing equipment that makes copies of the contents of all Internet traffic , routing it to a government database and then using natural language parsing technology to sift through and analyze the data using undisclosed search criteria .
It has done this without judicial oversight and obviously without the consent of the millions of Americans under surveillance .
Given any rational interpretation of the Fourth Amendment , its mass spying operation is illegal and unconstitutional .
But now the administration wants to make these illegal activities legal .
And why is that ?
According to National Director of Intelligence Mike McConnell , who is now drafting the proposal , an attack on a single U.S. bank by the 9/11 terrorists would have had a far more serious impact on the U.S. economy than the destruction of the Twin Towers .
“ My prediction is that we ’re going to screw around with this until something horrendous happens , ” said McConnell .
So the way to prevent this from happening , he claims , is to give the government the power to spy at will on the content of all e-mails , file transfers and Web searches .
McConnell ’s prediction of something “ horrendous ” happening unless we grant government this authority has a tone similar to that of the fear - mongering call to arms against terrorism that President Bush sounded before taking us to war in Iraq .
Now , Americans are about to be asked to surrender their Fourth Amendment rights because of a vague and unsupported prediction of the dangers and costs of cyber - terrorism .
The analogy with the campaign to frighten us into war with Iraq gets even stronger when it becomes evident that along with the establishing of American forces in Iraq , the cyber - security McConnell is calling for was , all along , part of the strategic plan , devised by Dick Cheney and several other present and former high - level Bush administration officials , to establish America as the world ’s supreme superpower .
This plan , known as the Project for the New American Century , unequivocally recognized “ an imperative ” for government to not only secure the Internet against cyber - attacks but also to control and use it offensively against its adversaries .
The Project for the New American Century also maintained that “ the process of transformation ” it envisioned ( which included the militarization and control of the Internet ) was “ likely to be a long one , absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event — like a new Pearl Harbor . ”
All that appears to be lacking to make the analogy complete is the “ horrendous ” cyber - attack — the chilling analog of the 9/11 attacks — that McConnell now predicts .
It would be a mistake to underestimate the resolve of the Bush administration .
But it would be a bigger mistake for Americans not to stand united against this familiar pattern of government scare tactics and manipulation .
There are grave dangers to the survival of democracy posed by allowing any present or future government unfettered access to all of our private electronic communications .
These dangers must be carefully weighed against the dubious and unproven benefits that granting such an awesome power to government might have on fending off cyber - attacks .
( Emphasis added . )
Elliot D. Cohen , PhD , is a media ethicist and critic .
His most recent book is “ The Last Days of Democracy : How Big Media and Power - Hungry Government Are Turning America Into a Dictatorship . ”
He is a first - prize winner of the 2007 Project Censored Award .

Only selected excerpts are published and this is an Op - Ed worth reading .
Using a rationale that can only be described as bizarre , the government ’s position is that if we do n’t allow them ( NSA , CIA , etc. ) unfettered access to our private computer activities , documents , searches , and downloads , it opens - up the United States and make us vulnerable to being hacked in a “ terror attack ” on a massive scale .
So the way to prevent this from happening , he claims Mike McConnell , is to give the government the power to spy at will on the content of all e-mails , file transfers and Web searches .

MILAN – Italian scientists are testing a new diet pill that turns into a clear , gelatinous blob the size of a tennis ball that may help shrink waistlines by giving dieters a sense of satiety .
The pill , currently undergoing clinical trials at Rome 's Policlinico Gemelli hospital , would be downed with two glasses of water at the first sign of a stomach rumble .
" The effect is like eating a nice plate of pasta , " said Luigi Ambrosio , lead researcher on the project at the National Research Council 's Institute for Composite and Biomedical Materials in Naples .
" If you sit down for a meal with a stomach that already feels full , you 'll end up eating less . "
The unnamed pill is made from a cellulose compound of hydrogel , a material that 's powdery when dry but plumps up to a cousin of Jell - O when wet .
The gel can soak up to 1,000 times its weight .
A gram in capsule form quickly balloons from the size of a spit wad to a ball that holds nearly a liter of liquid .
Growing waistlines are an increasingly hefty issue .
The World Health Organization calls obesity ( .pdf ) " one of today 's most blatantly visible – yet most neglected – public health problems . "
The WHO estimates that 1 billion adults worldwide are overweight , 300 million of them obese .
Attendant illnesses include type - 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease , hypertension , stroke and certain forms of cancer .
Ambrosio and fellow researcher Luigi Nicolais , now minister for reform and innovation , noticed the burgeoning girth of Americans during a trip to the United States in the '90s .
The pair had been working with a team to develop super - absorbent materials for Swedish paper - product company Sca and wondered whether a hydrogel could produce an effect similar to gastric banding – without the surgery .
Along the way , they discovered the spongelike material could be used to treat edemas , and are currently experimenting with it as a way to slow - water plants .
The versions of the material for use in the diet pill is biocompatible , so the body just flushes it out , the scientist say .
Jelly belly : from about the size of a spit wad the compound grows to a tennis ball so dieters sit down feeling full .

But in a market glutted with miracle cures and trendy diets , some folks do n't gel with the concept .
Lona Sandon , a dietitian at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas , sighed slightly before commenting .
" I do n't think we 'll find the answer to obesity in a pill , " said Sandon , who is also a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association .
" The only long - term solution is cutting back calories and getting exercise . "
Though it may not be a magic bullet , some experts think it could help those whose girth has already grown out of control .
" A pill like that one could be a valid aid when you 've already got a serious problem , " said professor Antonino De Lorenzo of Rome 's Tor Vergata University , who has conducted extensive research on benefits of the classic Mediterranean diet .
" The real challenge is teaching people to eat properly before they need it . "
If trials are successful , researchers hope to put the gel pill within easy reach of calorie counters on both the EU and North American markets in about a year .
" Obesity is such an enormous problem , " said Ambrosio .
" If we managed to reduce it by even 10 percent with this pill , it would be a huge accomplishment . "
Overseas users will see adverts when they visit BBC websites
BBC Worldwide says advertising will generate new income for the BBC , which needs to plug a £ 2bn budget shortfall .
The BBC argues that overseas readers , who do not pay the licence fee , should contribute towards the costs .
However , critics say commercialisation will undermine the editorial integrity of the BBC and is a slippery slope towards privatisation .
BBC Worldwide says the advertising will be introduced on popular web pages but did not say when the first adverts will be carried .
Adverts currently appear on the BBC World television channel , which cannot be seen in the UK , and were recently introduced on the international website 's video content .
' Natural development '
More than half the users of the news site are outside the UK .
" Introducing advertising on international traffic to news pages is a natural development in the growth of the BBC 's commercial news services , " says Richard Sambrook , director of BBC global news .
THE EDITORS ' BLOG
We wo n't be offering any highly intrusive advertising
Richard Sambrook ,
director , BBC global news
Richard 's comments in full
While UK users pay for the website through their licence fee , international audiences are getting the service for free , the corporation says .
Reaching readers outside the UK adds to the BBC 's costs because additional servers are needed .
As more video is made available on the site , more servers will be required , hence costs will continue to rise .
Rivals upset
The decision to carry advertising will also upset online rivals .
The British Internet Publishers Alliance ( BIPA ) , which represents the Guardian Media Group and News International , said earlier this year that the plan would hit revenue its members could make online .
Showing adverts to non-UK readers of BBC websites would also undermine the BBC's " worldwide reputation for integrity and impartiality " , it added .
BBC Worldwide had earlier pledged that the bbc.com site would not feature pop-up promos or the sort of adverts that " give the web a bad name " .
So - called geo-IP technology will be used to ensure that only non-UK users of the site see the advertising , although critics argue that the technology is not 100 % reliable .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy has formally determined that Karl Rove , John Bolten , former White House political director Sara Taylor and her deputy , J. Scott Jennings , are in violation of the Senate subpoenas and must comply “ immediately ” or face legal consequences .
Leahy stated : “ I hereby rule that those claims are not legally valid to excuse current and former White House employees from appearing , testifying and producing documents related to this investigation . ”
This ruling would allow the matter to go to the Senate .
Notably , Leahy found that Bush was not involved in the firing of U.S. Attorneys .
This helped undermine the claim of executive privilege .
The early congresses were more likely to use contempt power .
They did so in cases like Robert Randall in 1795 who was accused of bribing a member and , in 1800 , with newspaper editor William Duane who refused to answer questions before the Senate .
The Supreme Court has held congressional committees must satisfy three conditions to have enforceable subpoenas .
First , the investigation must be properly authorized by Congress .
Second , it must have a “ a valid legislative purpose ; ” and third , the specific inquiries must be relevant to the subject matter area under investigation .
Those conditions appear met here .
If these conditions are met the courts tend to defer to Congress .
Thus , the Court in Eastland v. United States Servicemen said that such subpoena fall under the powerful Speech and Debate clause , which affords “ an absolute bar to judicial interference . ”
Thus , the Senate appears on good footing for a court fight .
The question is not legal but political support .

The White House sent Homeland Security 's Fran Townsend on Fox News Sunday ( obviously , she 's a much more telegenic face than Chertoff ) to discuss the Bin Laden tape .
When Chris Wallace asks if DHS has analyzed the tape , Townsend knew exactly the things to say to keep the fear mongering up : could this tape be a trigger for an attack ?
However - - maybe it 's just me -- but her answer to Chris 's follow up seemed unintentionally honest :
Download Download ( h/t David for vids )
TOWNSEND : Chris , these are all the sorts of things that the intelligence community will do a technical analysis to evaluate .
Obviously , we 're still going through that now .
But looking for ... looking at issues related to his health , his whereabouts , and frankly , the content of the tape to make sure that this is not a trigger for an attack , these are all things the intelligence community is completely devoted to as we speak .
WALLACE : And do you have any answers ?
TOWNSEND : No .
We will obviously " action " any information that we find from that , but as you can understand , the particulars of the technical analysis are not something we 're going to reveal .
QCalc is a spreadsheet program with the Q programming language under its hood .
It lets you run all Q functions , no strings attached , and you can define your own functions in a script and use these in the spreadsheet , too .
As such , it should be useful as an educational tool , or if you simply want to play around with the Q interpreter in a more convenient graphical and interactive environment .
Also note that there 's only one spreadsheet and one script per file in the current implementation .
But the spreadsheet can get as large as you want and each cell may hold an arbitrarily complex Q value .
The user script may import other source files as necessary , using Q's import / include statements , so the single script page does n't really limit what you can do either .
QCalc is a spreadsheet program with Q as its underlying programming language .
The present version is more a replacement frontend to the Q interpreter rather than a full - blown spreadsheet , so some functionality you know from other spreadsheets may still be missing or be implemented in a slightly different way .
But if you 've ever worked with MS Excel or its OpenOffice and KOffice equivalents , you should feel right at home .
The only major difference is that each cell may hold either text , a number or any Q value .
Chapter 2 . Using QCalc
If you have ever used another spreadsheet program then the basic paradigm should be familiar and using QCalc should be rather straightforward .
In the following we discuss the most important aspects of QCalc 's operation , which will hopefully provide you with enough information to get started .
After installing the program , you can simply fire it up using the command qcalc or qcalc mysheet.
qcalc .
To exit the program , use the Quit option of the File menu or just press Ctrl - Q ; you will be warned and get a chance to abort the operation if the current file has n't be saved yet .
The following screenshot shows QCalc in action :
QCalc is a standard Qt application with menu , toolbar , main area ( showing the spreadsheet by default ) and a status bar which displays helpful status information like the current cell index and the line number in the script editor .
The spreadsheet takes the form of a table with columns numbered A , B , etc. , and rows 1 , 2 , etc .
The table is browsed with the usual mouse and keyboard operations .
Online help is available with the F1 key or any of the options in the Help menu .
These options invoke the Qt " assistant " program , which is Qt's HTML help browser .
( As you 're reading the online manual right now , you probably discovered this already . )
The full Q language manual is included , too , to assist you on your journey into the " land of Q " .
Just press Shift - F1 to show the manual in the help browser .
2.1 . The Spreadsheet The File menu provides the necessary operations to create new spreadsheets and load , save and print them .
QCalc saves its spreadsheets in a text format which is in fact valid Q script syntax , but uses the .qcalc extension by default .
( The contents of the spreadsheet are stored as comments at the beginning of the script ; it goes without saying that you should n't remove or alter these lines if you edit the file with a text editor , unless you know what you are doing . )
QCalc also provides some locale support , in that the encoding of a spreadsheet file is recorded in the first line of the file when it is saved .
When the file is loaded again , the encoding tag is read and the contents of the file are converted to the current system encoding on the fly .
It is also possible to open any plain Q script in QCalc , which then becomes an empty spreadsheet with the given Q source as the user script .
( This only works properly if the file actually contains a valid Q script . )
As in other spreadsheets , rows are numbered starting at 1 , while columns are denoted using the letters A through Z. Beyond the 26th column the indices are denoted AA , AB , ... , BA , BB , etc .
In formulas , cell indices are always written with the column letters first .
( These are also valid Q variable identifiers , thus you cannot use a global Q variable in formulas if it looks like a cell index . )
In difference to other spreadsheets , a table cell in QCalc may contain arbitrary Q values and thus cell values may in fact be complex data structures , not just strings and numbers .
It is also possible to populate cells with special GUI elements , including various types of widgets for numerical and symbolic data entry , as well as graphical plots of spreadsheet data using the gnuplot program , see Chapter 3 for details .
Each spreadsheet initially starts out with 128x26 cells , i.e. rows 1 thru 128 and columns A thru Z . ( This is currently hardcoded in the program , but you can change the default size by editing the qcalc.ui file accordingly . )
A spreadsheet grows and shrinks as necessary with certain editing operations ( see Section 2.3 ) , but QCalc always keeps it at a minimum size of 128x26 .
Row and column sizes can be changed by dragging the borders in the row and column headers , and you can also quickly adjust the size by double - clicking on the border .
The sizes will be remembered on a per-file basis when the spreadsheet is saved and then reloaded .
2.2 . Formulas and Evaluation Q expressions to be evaluated are written in the customary " = expr " format .
( Note that the = symbol must be the first character , the formula wo n't be recognized as such if it is preceded by whitespace ) .
Thus , e.g. , if you have the literal values 6 and 7 in cells A1 and B1 , and A2 contains " = A1 * B2 " , then you will get the value 42 there .
The cell will also show a little arrow symbol to indicate that there is a computed value there , so it will actually look like " 42 " .
In your formulas you can also use relative and absolute cell references like A1 , B$ 2 , $ C5 or $ E$ 9 just like in any other spreadsheet .
These work exactly the same , as far as evaluation is concerned , but behave differently when they are copied or filled ( see Section 2.3 below ) .
You can also employ ranges of the form A1:A10 , which are mapped to Q lists ( or lists of lists , if they span multiple rows and columns , as in B5:C12 ) .
You can also do calculations with strings , of course , using Q's string operators and functions , but note that to get an empty string value you 'll have to use the formula ' = " " '.
That 's because the value of an empty cell defaults to the integer 0 ( rather than the empty string ) in calculations .
In fact , this spreadsheet is much more powerful than others in that cells can hold any Q value and you can do calculations with any kind of Q data , including " infinite " values such as streams ( lazy lists ) .
And , because of Q's term rewriting heritage , you can do symbolic calculations , too !
Also note that if an expression does n't evaluate because some arguments do n't match , this is not an error in Q – the expression is then considered a normal form and will be printed " as is " .
So , if the computed value in a cell looks " weird " , take a second look at the computed formula ; you will always find that there 's something in there which " does n't compute " , as they say .
Actually , this feature is quite useful , as it really shows you where your computation went wrong , instead of just giving you some silly error message .
On the other hand , it is an error if an expression does n't have a value , either because it is not valid Q syntax , or because it raises an exception ( e.g. , by calling halt or throw ) when evaluated .
In the former case , the cell will just show the formula as literal text ( without the arrow symbol ) .
The latter kind of error is flagged ( quite literally ) with a little red flag instead of the arrow symbol , showing the offending formula as the contents of the cell : " = halt " .
( Currently QCalc does n't show you the actual exception raised by an expression , but you can easily find out about these by making judicious use of Q's built - in catch function . )
When you enter a new or edit an existing cell value , the evaluation algorithm used by QCalc will only reevaluate the cells affected by this change .
Cyclic computations ( e.g. , if cell A1 is computed using A1 itself , or if there is a cyclic chain of cell dependencies , such as A1=A2+1 and A2=2 * A1 ) are permitted , but are executed in a " depth - first " order which breaks cycles in an apparently random way .
The only thing that you can count on in such cases is that if you edit a given cell , then the change will propagate to other cells from there and each dependent cell will be recomputed at most once using the most recent values of all its requisite cells .
The entire spreadsheet is reevaluated each time it is loaded , or when you recompile the script of the spreadsheet ( see Section 2.4 below ) .
Note that QCalc does n't limit your spreadsheet to operations which always terminate .
If a computation ( indicated by the wait cursor ) takes longer than expected , or just loops indefinitely , you can abort it with Ctrl - G ( this is the only operation active while an evaluation is in progress ) , and correct the offending spreadsheet cells and / or definitions in the script .
In the latter case you can then force a reevaluation of the entire spreadsheet by recompiling the script with F9 ( see Section 2.4 below ) .
Also note that all computations are actually executed in a secondary process running your script in a separate instance of the Q interpreter , so it should n't be possible to mess up QCalc no matter how badly your script behaves .
In the worst case , if your script just " hangs " or " dies " , so that QCalc cannot perform further calculations , you should still be able to correct your script in the editor and then just restart it with F9 .
2.3 . Editing
The editing operations provided by QCalc are rather straightforward .
You can find these in the Edit menu , as well as the Edit toolbar and the context menu which pops up when you right - click on a table cell .
There are also many useful keyboard and mouse shortcuts .
You can browse through your spreadsheet with the mouse or the cursor keys , including the Tab and Backtab keys which traverse to the next and previous table cell ( in row - major order ) , respectively .
F3 or Shift - F3 edits a cell ( the former edits the cell " in-place " , while the latter invokes a separate multiline editor which is often more convenient for complicated formulas ) , Esc aborts the edit ( reverting the cell to its previous value ) , and F2 or Return stores the edited value ( and does any necessary computations ) .
You can force reevaluation of a cell by pressing F2 while the cell is selected , and a double click opens a cell for editing .
You can also just start typing when a cell is selected , to overwrite its current value .
Cell indices and formulas are shown in the status line when you click on them .
NOTE : Browsing the table and selecting ranges of cells with the mouse or the keyboard can be hard to do if the cells contain editable GUI elements like comboboxes and spinboxes ( see Section 3.3 ) , since these will grab the focus when they are selected .
As a remedy , if you are not currently editing a cell , the Esc key allows you to switch the table from the default mode of operation to a special " browse " mode which is indicated by a tiny lock symbol in the status line .
While the table is in browse mode , editing operations on ranges of cells still work normally , but GUI elements are not activated when selected any more .
This makes it much easier to browse the table and make selections with the mouse or the cursor keys .
To leave browse mode , either just press Esc again , or double - click on a cell or press F3 to open a cell for editing .
Rectangular ranges of spreadsheet cells can be selected by sweeping the mouse over them as usual , or by using the cursor keys while holding down the Shift key .
You can also click a row or column header to select the entire row or column .
Selected ranges of cells can be deleted , cut , copied and pasted as usual .
Using cut / copy and paste you can also transfer ranges between different instances of QCalc.
Moreover , QCalc performs automatic adjustment of relative column and row indices in formulas .
Thus , if you copy a cell containing the formula " = foo A1 " to a position at an offset of , say , 2 rows and 3 columns from the original position , it will become " = foo D3 " .
As usual , you can use the $ symbol to indicate absolute row or column indices ( or both ) which will not be adjusted .
The Paste operation always copies formulas for computed cells , but there is also a second " Paste values " operation to just copy the literal cell contents ( without the formulas ) .
QCalc can also exchange data with other programs , using the customary textual " tab - separated values " format to store the selection in the clipboard , which can readily be pasted into almost any other application , including text editors and other spreadsheet programs .
On X11 , the global mouse selection is also supported ; just select a range of cells , and you can paste their contents in tab - separated format into any other application with the middle mouse button .
There 's also a special Fill operation which basically works like dragging the little fill handle in other spreadsheets to copy a value or formula to adjacent cells .
In fact , this operation is even more flexible than the fill handle , since it allows you to fill both rows and columns in a single step .
To use this , select the desired target range , with the value to be copied in the " principal " ( upper - left ) cell of the selected range , and then just push the Fill button ( the one with the magic wand symbol on it ) , or press Ctrl - L .
This will copy the formula in the principal cell to the adjacent cells , adjusting it across the range as usual .
The same operation also allows you to fill a range of cells with arithmetic sequences .
For this purpose , the principal cell value is the starting value of the sequence , and the cells immediately below and to the right of the principal cell ( more precisely , the differences between these values and the principal cell value ) determine the increment in the vertical and horizontal direction , respectively .
If one or both of the adjacent cells are empty or non-numeric then the corresponding increment defaults to 0 ( meaning that the principal value will just be copied ) .
Thus , when the operation has finished , each row or column will be an arithmetic sequence for the indicated horizontal or vertical increment , respectively .
( This sounds more complicated than it actually is .
Just try it out and see what happens . )
The Merge cells option ( F6 ) in the Edit menu allows you to merge adjacent cells into one bigger cell which may span multiple rows and columns ; the Dissociate cells ( Shift - F6 ) option splits them up into their constituents again .
You can also insert and delete entire rows and columns by selecting a cell ( a single cell will do , although you can also select a range , in which case the upper left cell of the range determines where the operation is to be performed ) and choose the corresponding option .
The corresponding keyboard shortcuts are F7 and Shift - F7 to insert and delete a row , and F8 and Shift - F8 to insert and delete a column , respectively .
Each of the these operations only inserts or deletes a single row or column , so you have to invoke the command repeatedly if you want more .
Also note that the other editing operations will enlarge the table if needed , e.g. , when you paste a range of cells near the edges of the spreadsheet .
Thus it is not necessary to explicitly insert table rows and columns in such cases .
QCalc also has an unlimited undo / redo facility , so if you mess up your spreadsheet you can always go back and forth in time as needed .
These operations also adjust the table size as needed .
They may also shrink the table if there is unused extra space ; this also happens when you load a spreadsheet from a file .
However , as already mentioned , QCalc always keeps the spreadsheet at a minimum table size of 128x26 .
2.4 . The Script
You get to the script page by switching to the corresponding tab located right below the menu and toolbar , or by pressing F11 which toggles between the spreadsheet and the script view .
After selecting the script view you see the following :
In the upper pane of the script page , there is a full - featured text editor with syntax highlighting for Q scripts .
In the editor you can enter any Q script , which is submitted to the Q compiler when you invoke the Compile operation ( F9 ) .
The script can also be empty if your spreadsheet only uses the built - in and prelude types and functions of the Q language .
Or it may just consist of the appropriate import declarations for the additional modules containing the needed operations .
But in most cases it will just include any additional definitions required for the operation of your spreadsheet .
If there are any errors or warning messages during compilation of the script , they will be shown in the lower " log " pane of the script page .
The log pane is also used to show output produced by Q's I/O operations like puts or printf .
But note that the log is just that , a log of everything that is printed either by the Q compiler or the operations in your spreadsheet ; it 's not an interactive kind of terminal window , so it is n't possible to interact with the interpreter or enter any input to operations like gets and scanf there .
Also note that the log is cleared automatically whenever you recompile your script or load a new spreadsheet .
You must correct all errors in your script before you can evaluate anything .
As soon as your script is error - free , after pressing F9 the entire spreadsheet will be reevaluated , using the definitions from your script .
For instance , if you want to use a function square in your spreadsheet , which is n't provided by the Q library , you can define it yourself as follows : square X = X*X ; Enter this definition in the script editor and press F9 .
Voila , the new function is now available and you can use it in your spreadsheet just like any other function .
E.g. , you can now type the formula " = square 9 " into a cell and it will evaluate to 81 .
Some special support operations for use in QCalc scripts can be found in the calclib .q module which is to be installed on the Q path .
These are described in some detail in Chapter 3 .
The script editor has two additional editing operations provided for your convenience , the Find / Replace dialog ( Ctrl - F ) which lets you , well , find text and replace it , and the " Goto line " ( F5 ) operation to locate the given line number , which comes in handy to find the lines listed in compiler error messages .
The Find / Replace dialog looks as follows : Just enter the text to be searched and , if applicable , the replacement text in the corresponding fields and hit the Next button to search for the first occurrence behind the cursor , or press the Return key .
Keep on pushing Next or Return to search for further occurrences , or push Replace to perform a replacement and search for the next occurrence .
Backward searches and replacements work analogously , using the Prev button instead of Next .
( You can switch the search direction at any time . )
There are also various options which determine whether the search is case - sensitive and / or for whole words only , and whether to preserve the case of replaced text ( which works as in Emacs ) .
NOTE : With the Qt3 highlighting engine , the syntax highlighting of the script editor can slow things down quite a bit with large scripts .
As a remedy , if the highlighting makes the editor unresponsive and sluggish , you can disable it with the Syntax highlighting toggle ( Ctrl - H ) .
2.5 . View Options
There are a few options which allow you to change the visual appearance of the spreadsheet and the script display .
These settings are global and are remembered across invocations of the program .
You can change the font of the spreadsheet or the text editor by selecting the corresponding tab and invoking the Choose font operation .
Fixed width fonts seem to work best for most purposes , although YMMV .
The configured fonts are also used for printing , see below .
The Zoom in and Zoom out ( Ctrl - + and Ctrl -- ) commands allow you to quickly change the font size on either the sheet or the script page .
The Increase precision and Decrease precision ( Alt -+ and Alt -- ) commands let you to change the precision of floating point values in computed cells .
( This affects the display of floating point values only ; internally , these values are always stored at full precision . )
As already mentioned , the Syntax highlighting toggle ( Ctrl - H ) switches syntax highlighting in the script editor on and off .

The ALP has written to the Australian Electoral Commission demanding action be taken after Ms Kelly 's husband , Gary Clark , and NSW Liberal Party state executive member Jeff Egan were caught distributing bogus pamphlets in Lindsay portraying Labor as sympathisers of Islamic terrorists .
The two were among a group of five caught and photographed in the act by Labor sleuths on Tuesday night .
Speaking on ABC radio this morning , Ms Kelly said she did not approve of the pamphlet , but labelled it a " Chaser - style of prank " , a reference to ABC TV comedy team The Chaser .
" I think its intent is to be a send - up but obviously it has n't worked , " she said .
" I think if you read it you 'd be laughing .
Most people who have read it have said ' That 's a Chaser - style of prank ' . "
Ms Kelly said the " prank " was " really immature stuff " that would not influence any voters .
Ms Kelly described her husband 's actions as " skylarking " after a few beers .
" I'm a bit upset with him , but no , look I love him , " she told Southern Cross Broadcasting .
" He hates the unions with a passion and after weeks and weeks of letterboxing , what gets to be boring material , of a repetitive message that we get them to letterbox all the time , they come up with their own skylarking over a few beers and think that something 's funny , " Ms Kelly said Ms Kelly also accused Labor members of going after the Liberal workers who were distributing the pamphlets .
" An ALP goon squad , which I understand was led by some unionists , have chased down and hunted down and tried to intimidate .
I understand there was even a fight , '' Ms Kelly told ABC radio today .
Labor 's national secretary , Tim Gartrell , names Mr Clark , Mr Egan and Troy Craig , president of the Glenmore Park Action Group , in his complaint to the commission , and urges the matter be referred to the Australian Federal Police and NSW Police .
The scandal was the last thing John Howard needed as he tried to resuscitate his campaign before Saturday , and will likely overshadow his final speech to the National Press Club today .
The bogus pamphlet carries the ALP logo and is from the non-existent " Islamic Australia Federation " .
It applauds the Labor Party for supporting Muslim terrorists .
It thanks Labor for supporting the Bali bombers , who it says were " unjustly " sentenced to death , says Labor backs the building of a new local mosque , and praises the party for allowing Sheik Taj el - Din al Hilaly to live in Australia .
" We gratefully acknowledge Labors [ sic ] support to forgive our Muslim brothers who have been unjustly sentenced to death for the Bali bombings , " it says .
" Labor supports our new Mosque construction and we hope , with the support and funding by Local and State governments , to open our new Mosque in St Mary 's soon . "
Labor 's candidate for Lindsay , David Bradbury , called it " a disgraceful act " .
The ALP campaign spokeswoman , Penny Wong , demanded the Liberals reveal what level sanctioned the behaviour .
" People who are very senior in the NSW division of the Liberal Party are involved , " she said .
The Liberal Party NSW director , Graham Jaeschke , said he became aware of the incident on Tuesday night .
Two of the people involved were Liberal members .
Both , including Mr Egan , were suspended from the party .
All five have been banned from the campaign .
Mr Jaeschke said they were " over- enthusiastic individuals " .
" They were not authorised .
We condemn the action and the people involved are no longer members of the party . "
The Liberals ' campaign spokesman , Andrew Robb , said the action was not sanctioned from on high .
" Silly things happen , wrong things happen , this was wrong , it was offensive , it was unauthorised , there was no knowledge off the party , " he said .
In other incidents , it has been reported car windows were smashed in North Sydney , paint stripper dumped on a car in Bennelong , and signs defaced in Wentworth .
The Liberal MP for Macarthur , Pat Farmer , said his campaign had been targeted during the past fortnight , with vandals burning an election billboard , defacing posters and spray - painting his home and office .

The arrow of time is hot , baby .
I talk about it incessantly , of course , but the buzz is growing .
There was a conference in New York , and subtle pulses are chasing around the lower levels of the science - media establishment , preparatory to a full - blown explosion into popular consciousness .
I 've been ahead of my time , as usual .
So , notwithstanding the fact that I 've disquisitioned about this a great length and considerable frequency , I thought it would be useful to collect the salient points into a single FAQ .
My interest is less in pushing my own favorite answers to these questions , so much as setting out the problem that physicists and cosmologists are going to have to somehow address if they want to say they understand how the universe works .
( I will stick to more or less conventional physics throughout , even if not everything I say is accepted by everyone .
That 's just because they have n't thought things through . )
Without further ado :
What is the arrow of time ?
The past is different from the future .
One of the most obvious features of the macroscopic world is irreversibility : heat does n't flow spontaneously from cold objects to hot ones , we can turn eggs into omelets but not omelets into eggs , ice cubes melt in warm water but glasses of water do n't spontaneously give rise to ice cubes .
These irreversibilities are summarized by the Second Law of Thermodynamics : the entropy of a closed system will ( practically ) never decrease into the future .
But entropy decreases all the time ; we can freeze water to make ice cubes , after all .
Not all systems are closed .
The Second Law does n't forbid decreases in entropy in open systems , nor is it in any way incompatible with evolution or complexity or any such thing .
So what 's the big deal ?
In contrast to the macroscopic universe , the microscopic laws of physics that purportedly underlie its behavior are perfectly reversible .
( More rigorously , for every allowed process there exists a time - reversed process that is also allowed , obtained by switching parity and exchanging particles for antiparticles -- the CPT Theorem . )
The puzzle is to reconcile microscopic reversibility with macroscopic irreversibility .
And how do we reconcile them ?
The observed macroscopic irreversibility is not a consequence of the fundamental laws of physics , it 's a consequence of the particular configuration in which the universe finds itself .
In particular , the unusual low - entropy conditions in the very early universe , near the Big Bang .
Understanding the arrow of time is a matter of understanding the origin of the universe .
Was n't this all figured out over a century ago ?
Not exactly .
In the late 19th century , Boltzmann and Gibbs figured out what entropy really is : it 's a measure of the number of individual microscopic states that are macroscopically indistinguishable .
An omelet is higher entropy than an egg because there are more ways to re-arrange its atoms while keeping it indisputably an omelet , than there are for the egg .
That provides half of the explanation for the Second Law : entropy tends to increase because there are more ways to be high entropy than low entropy .
The other half of the question still remains : why was the entropy ever low in the first place ?
Is the origin of the Second Law really cosmological ?
We never talked about the early universe back when I took thermodynamics .
Trust me , it is .
Of course you do n't need to appeal to cosmology to use the Second Law , or even to " derive " it under some reasonable - sounding assumptions .
However , those reasonable - sounding assumptions are typically not true of the real world .
Using only time - symmetric laws of physics , you can't derive time - asymmetric macroscopic behavior ( as pointed out in the " reversibility objections " of Lohschmidt and Zermelo back in the time of Boltzmann and Gibbs ) ; every trajectory is precisely as likely as its time - reverse , so there can't be any overall preference for one direction of time over the other .
The usual " derivations " of the second law , if taken at face value , could equally well be used to predict that the entropy must be higher in the past -- an inevitable answer , if one has recourse only to reversible dynamics .
But the entropy was lower in the past , and to understand that empirical feature of the universe we have to think about cosmology .
Does inflation explain the low entropy of the early universe ?
Not by itself , no .
To get inflation to start requires even lower - entropy initial conditions than those implied by the conventional Big Bang model .
Inflation just makes the problem harder .
Does that mean that inflation is wrong ?
Not necessarily .
Inflation is an attractive mechanism for generating primordial cosmological perturbations , and provides a way to dynamically create a huge number of particles from a small region of space .
The question is simply , why did inflation ever start ?
Rather than removing the need for a sensible theory of initial conditions , inflation makes the need even more urgent .
My theory of ( brane gasses / loop quantum cosmology / ekpyrosis / Euclidean quantum gravity ) provides a very natural and attractive initial condition for the universe .
The arrow of time just pops out as a bonus .
I doubt it .
We human beings are terrible temporal chauvinists -- it 's very hard for us not to treat " initial " conditions differently than " final " conditions .
But if the laws of physics are truly reversible , these should be on exactly the same footing -- a requirement that philosopher Huw Price has dubbed the Double Standard Principle .
If a set of initial conditions is purportedly " natural , " the final conditions should be equally natural .
Any theory in which the far past is dramatically different from the far future is violating this principle in one way or another .
In " bouncing " cosmologies , the past and future can be similar , but there tends to be a special point in the middle where the entropy is inexplicably low .
What is the entropy of the universe ?
We ’re not precisely sure .
We do not understand quantum gravity well enough to write down a general formula for the entropy of a self - gravitating state .
On the other hand , we can do well enough .
In the early universe , when it was just a homogenous plasma , the entropy was essentially the number of particles — within our current cosmological horizon , that ’s about 1088 .
Once black holes form , they tend to dominate ; a single supermassive black hole , such as the one at the center of our galaxy , has an entropy of order 1090 , according to Hawking ’s famous formula .
If you took all of the matter in our observable universe and made one big black hole , the entropy would be about 10120 .
The entropy of the universe might seem big , but it ’s nowhere near as big as it could be .
If you do n't understand entropy that well , how can you even talk about the arrow of time ?
We do n't need a rigorous formula to understand that there is a problem , and possibly even to solve it .
One thing is for sure about entropy : low - entropy states tend to evolve into higher - entropy ones , not the other way around .
So if state A naturally evolves into state B nearly all of the time , but almost never the other way around , it 's safe to say that the entropy of B is higher than the entropy of A .
Are black holes the highest - entropy states that exist ?
No .
Remember that black holes give off Hawking radiation , and thus evaporate ; according to the principle just elucidated , the entropy of the thin gruel of radiation into which the black hole evolves must have a higher entropy .
This is , in fact , borne out by explicit calculation .
So what does a high - entropy state look like ?
Empty space .
In a theory like general relativity , where energy and particle number and volume are not conserved , we can always expand space to give rise to more phase space for matter particles , thus allowing the entropy to increase .
Note that our actual universe is evolving ( under the influence of the cosmological constant ) to an increasingly cold , empty state -- exactly as we should expect if such a state were high entropy .
The real cosmological puzzle , then , is why our universe ever found itself with so many particles packed into such a tiny volume .
Could the universe just be a statistical fluctuation ?
No .
This was a suggestion of Bolzmann 's and Schuetz 's , but it does n't work in the real world .
The idea is that , since the tendency of entropy to increase is statistical rather than absolute , starting from a state of maximal entropy we would ( given world enough and time ) witness downward fluctuations into lower - entropy states .
That 's true , but large fluctuations are much less frequent than small fluctuations , and our universe would have to be an enormously large fluctuation .
There is no reason , anthropic or otherwise , for the entropy to be as low as it is ; we should be much closer to thermal equilibrium if this model were correct .
The reductio ad absurdum of this argument leads us to Boltzmann Brains -- random brain - sized fluctuations that stick around just long enough to perceive their own existence before dissolving back into the chaos .
Do n't the weak interactions violate time - reversal invariance ?
Not exactly ; more precisely , it depends on definitions , and the relevant fact is that the weak interactions have nothing to do with the arrow of time .
They are not invariant under the T ( time reversal ) operation of quantum field theory , as has been experimentally verified in the decay of the neutral kaon .
( The experiments found CP violation , which by the CPT theorem implies T violation . )
But as far as thermodynamics is concerned , it 's CPT invariance that matters , not T invariance .
For every solution to the equations of motion , there is exactly one time - reversed solution -- it just happens to also involve a parity inversion and an exchange of particles with antiparticles .
CP violation cannot explain the Second Law of Thermodynamics .
Does n't the collapse of the wavefunction in quantum mechanics violate time - reversal invariance ?
It certainly appears to , but whether it " really " does depends ( sadly ) on one 's interpretation of quantum mechanics .
If you believe something like the Copenhagen interpretation , then yes , there really is a stochastic and irreversible process of wavefunction collapse .
Once again , however , it is unclear how this could help explain the arrow of time -- whether or not wavefunctions collapse , we are left without an explanation of why the early universe had such a small entropy .
If you believe in something like the Many - Worlds interpretation , then the evolution of the wavefunction is completely unitary and reversible ; it just appears to be irreversible , since we do n't have access to the entire wavefunction .
Rather , we belong in some particular semiclassical history , separated out from other histories by the process of decoherence .
In that case , the fact that wavefunctions appear to collapse in one direction of time but not the other is not an explanation for the arrow of time , but in fact a consequence of it .
The low - entropy early universe was in something close to a pure state , which enabled countless " branchings " as it evolved into the future .
This sounds like a hard problem .
Is there any way the arrow of time can be explained dynamically ?
I can think of two ways .
One is to impose a boundary condition that enforces one end of time to be low - entropy , whether by fiat or via some higher principle ; this is the strategy of Roger Penrose 's Weyl Curvature Hypothesis , and arguably that of most flavors of quantum cosmology .
The other is to show that reversibilty is violated spontaneously -- even if the laws of physics are time - reversal invariant , the relevant solutions to those laws might not be .
However , if there exists a maximal entropy ( thermal equilibrium ) state , and the universe is eternal , it 's hard to see why we are n't in such an equilibrium state -- and that would be static , not constantly evolving .
This is why I personally believe that there is no such equilibrium state , and that the universe evolves because it can always evolve .
The trick of course , is to implement such a strategy in a well - founded theoretical framework , one in which the particular way in which the universe evolves is by creating regions of post - Big - Bang spacetime such as the one in which we find ourselves .
Why do we remember the past , but not the future ?
Because of the arrow of time .
Why do we conceptualize the world in terms of cause and effect ?
Because of the arrow of time .
Why is the universe hospitable to information - gathering - and - processing complex systems such as ourselves , capable of evolution and self - awareness and the ability to fall in love ?
Because of the arrow of time .
Why do you work on this crazy stuff with no practical application ?
I think it 's important to figure out a consistent story of how the universe works .
Or , if not actually important , at least fun .
Satanism and Objectivism
Nemo
Objectivism , the philosophy of Ayn Rand , is an acknowledged source for some of the Satanic philosophy as outlined in The Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey .
Ayn Rand was a brilliant and insightful author and philosopher and her best - selling novels Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead continue to attract deserved attention for a new generation of readers .
I am a strong admirer of Ayn Rand but I am an even stronger admirer of Anton LaVey for the vital differences between the philosophies of Objectivism and Satanism .
First , Objectivism holds that metaphysics , that branch of philosophy which concerns itself with the nature of reality , determines the nature of epistemology ( which is concerned with how man acquires knowledge ) as well as ethics ( which is concerned with valuing human action ) , politics ( social ethics ) and art .
Current philosophical disagreement on this issue still continues .
It is , in fact , an unproven assertion by Rand that one 's metaphysical assumptions determine one 's ethics .
You do n't have to start with metaphysics to create your ethics .
Satanism does not assert that the fundamental truth of the nature of reality ( metaphysics ) is known .
In fact , Satanists utilize two different metaphysical assumptions regarding reality as evidenced in Satanic ritual as opposed to the rest of life .
In effect , Satanists are pragmatic regarding their beliefs concerning reality .
Thus , as Satanists do not claim to know the absolute “ truth ” regarding what is real they are , by definition , not “ Objectivists ” who hold that reality is totally objective .
Satanists proclaim that doubt is vital in the absence of proof .
At this fundamental level there is division between the two views of reality .
The Satanist holds that the meaning of god is useful when one holds it to mean the most important person in an individual 's universe… himself . ”
Second , Satanism does not hold that “ a life appropriate to a rational being ” is the sole standard of ethical right as does Objectivism .
If anything , Satanism holds that indulgence in life or “ fun ” as perceived by the individual is the highest standard of ethics .
Satanists see that Objectivism has enthroned reason above the individual as opposed to utilizing this sole means to knowledge as a tool to achieve a purpose .
Satanism enthrones the individual as a whole , not reason , as the supreme standard to determine the value of actions ( ethics ) .
Third , Rand 's philosophy rejects as ethical accepting the sacrifice of another to one 's self ( to paraphrase the end of Galt 's oath from Atlas Shrugged ) .
The Satanic view sees as ethical the reality of domination of the weak by the strong .
The assertion in Objectivism is that the use of force to cause others to submit to the will of the stronger or cleverer individual is " wrong " for the individual .
This is a second major assertion which Satanism finds unproven by the Objectivists .
Consequently , the Satanist is far more flexible in the choice of actions available than is the Objectivist who cannot simply accept his personal needs as absolutely reliable to determine the best course of action in any circumstance .
Fourth , Objectivism is purely atheistic with a complete rejection of the value of a god in their metaphysics .
The Satanic view of this is in pure agreement except in two areas .
The Satanist holds that the meaning of god is useful when one holds it to mean the most important person in an individual 's universe and chooses that person to be himself .
The Satanist also ascribes magical god - like qualities to himself when indulging in the alternate view of reality enjoyed in ritual .
In both instances , Satanism sees the cultural effect of religion and god as an emotional asset to be tapped rather than simply rejected .
In other words Satanism is a religion ( with the individual as God ) and Objectism is n't .
Let me conclude this brief overview by adding that Satanism has far more in common with Objectivism than with any other religion or philosophy .
Objectivists endorse reason , selfishness , greed and atheism .
Objectivism sees Christianity , Islam and Judaism as anti-human and evil .
The writings of Ayn Rand are inspiring and powerful .
If the reader has not yet experienced her power , try her novelette Anthem for a taste .
You will almost certainly come back for more .
At the same time , Satanism is a “ brutal ” as well as a selfish philosophy .
We do not hold , as do the Objectivists that the universe is “ benevolent . ”
Satanists view the world as neutral , beyond the concepts of benevolent or treacherous , good or evil .
Satanism enables the Satanist to codify his life beyond the ethical and metaphysical straightjacket which Objectivism unfortunately offers .
This is not written to attack Objectivism but merely to clarify the areas of difference .
Satanism drew from Objectivism as even Rand drew from others .
Both are , however , unique .
Both are different from the other .

The panel of Mort Zuckerman , Eleanor Clift , Monica Crowley and Pat Buchanan on this Friday 's The McLaughlin Group sat down for a discussion on whether our economy is tanking and whether or not it 's in part due to Iraq .
Download Download
Mort Zuckerman paints as gloomy a picture of the economy -- as we heard the other day from Jim Cramer -- but he refuses to admit that the occupation in Iraq might have anything to do with the economy tanking now .
Zuckerman is also completely dismissive of Ron Paul 's arguments about the economy during the ABC GOP debate .
Of course , Buchanan and Crowley think it 's only a minor drag on the economy and Crowley goes so far as to start spouting off about how great the economic growth is in Iraq .
How 's that occupation and genocide going for you , Monica ?
Oh the economy is booming .... it's wonderful .
We do have a real mess on our hands with the sub - prime lending industry and the economic forecast is looking very dreary , to put it mildly , but I do n't understand how anyone can completely separate our irresponsible borrowing and spending on the bottomless pit called Iraq from the state of the economy in general we 're facing now .
The conservatives ' answer to our problems is to lower taxes and cut government spending ( code for gut Medicaid and Social Security ) but that war spending , no problem .
Transcript below the fold
Zuckerman : I do n't think it 's an exaggeration .
It 's an understatement .
You 've heard me say here I think we are facing the worst financial crunch and crisis since the Great Depression .
You have the entire banking system now that is virtually frozen and there are not just the sub - prime mortgage thing .
There are other things called credit default swaps where they 're going to lose as much money , 250 billion dollars on .
The banks are frozen .
They 're not making loans because they have such huge debts that they have to take onto their balance sheets and nobody knows how to deal with that because you had a dramatic ... you had two bubbles that have burst at the same time .
The housing bubble which has collapsed in this country .
The first time since the Great Depression that housing values have gone down for a year since the depression and it's going to go down even more next year .
The credit crunch , you 've just exploded the whole credit system in this country .
We were way over leveraged .
The banking system was over - leveraged .
People did n't even know about it .
The bankers did n't know about it .
They did n't access the risk .
Now that risk is piling in and every body 's going to pay the price .
Uh it 's going to stimulate nothing other , I mean it 's going to de-stimulate the economy .
Nobody has money to lend .
They 're saving all their money to pay off their debts .
They 're borrowing money or looking at uh the rest of the world to enhance their capital and it 's still not going to solve their problems .
McLaughlin : Okay this worthy tried to pull it together .
Why is the economy tanking ?.............. Is Ron Paul right ?
Do you have to deal with the monetary issues before you deal with anything else to account for deficit spending ?
Zuckerman :
You know , I 'm ah , Mitt Romney starts your program and he says he 's going to do something about the economy .
When he was Governor of Mass .
he had 1 / 2 of one percent increase in employment in the four years he was Governor while the country 's employment went up by 5 1/2 percent .
He left the state with the highest unemployment rate of any state in the union .
So his words are just phony words .
This guy does n't even know what he 's talking about .
Romney does know what he 's talking about he 's misleading .....
[ crosstalk ]
..... He has pulled nothing together .
He 's just pulled words together .
McLaughlin :
You do n't think the Iraq war ?.....
Zuckerman : I 'm not saying the Iraq war was , was an economic boom .
All I 'm saying to you it does not deal with the problems that this country is facing .
McLaughlin : Despite the trillion dollar cost of the Iraq war ?
Zuckerman :
We had five years of this war and the country was booming .
The reason why the country is going down is because of the credit system , not because of the war .......
Clift : First of all , Romney went to Michigan and pandered .
He promised them 20 billion dollars if he 's president to revive the auto industry so I 'm not going to heap praise on him .
Ron Paul is the closest thing we have to a Ross Perot .
He is out there hammering away on this issue .
I think he has a point to make and the American people if they really do link a wasteful war in Iraq with problems at home then the politicians will really be up against the wall .
McLaughlin :
What do you think about what Eleanor said ?
Crowley :
Well the UN this week came out with a report projecting that in Iraq , the Iraqi economy this year and next year will grow at the rate of seven to eight percent .
The US economy right now is growing at the rate of 1.5 percent .
So all of these little stimulus packages and Hillary Clinton just recently said she 's going to tack on a forty billion dollar rebate package along the lines of what President Bush is suggesting too .
McLaughlin :
What do you want to do ?
Crowley : Look none of these problems address the long term issues in this economy about job creation and growth .
I want to see a cut , I want to see the Bush tax cuts made permanent .
I want to see a roll back of the tax rates across the board and I want the most important thing John is cutting federal spending .
[ crosstalk ]
McLaughlin : I want a villain here .
I want culpability .
Why should it be this way ?
I have n't heard it yet .
Buchanan : .. John look , the United States is completely tapped out .
We borrow from Europe to defend Europe .
We borrow from the Arabs to fight a war to bring democracy to Iraq .
We borrow from the Chinese and the Japanese to defend their oil lifelines .
The United States saves nothing .
We are now , we 've got five trillion dollars abroad .
It is coming back to bit us .... Citibank .....
McLaughlin :
This goes back to Bush and it goes back to the White House .
Is that right ?
Buchanan :
Well it goes back to 1992 , John .
There is five trillion dollars abroad .
They 're moving it into sovereign wealth funds .
They are snapping up Citibank , Morgan Stanley , 3Com , all these other .... crosstalk ......
McLaughlin :
It 's traceable to overspending by the government ...[ crosstalk ] ...... and misspending by the government .....
[ crosstalk ]
Clift : I agree the government is tapped out but is not the time for the ideological hobby horses .
We 're not going to solve the problem of sovereign wealth and we 're not going to make the Bush tax cuts permanent ....[ crosstalk ] ...
They 're going to do some quick and immediate fixes that are needed for average people .
McLaughlin : Multiple choice on the Iraq war .
Is the cost of the Iraq war A : a major drag on the economy , a medium drag , a minor drag , or no drag ?
Pat Buchanan .
Buchanan :
It is a minor drag , John .
There 's five trillion dollars in American dollars out there that foreign countries have and they 're coming back to buy America .
Clift :
We would n't be reliant on those foreign countries to the extent we are if we were n't funding a trillion or two trillion dollar war .
Major drag .
Crowley : Minor drag in the whole context of this dynamic American economy that 's having some serious problems .
Zuckerman :
You know we 've had four booming years while the war in Iraq has been going on .
It 's no drag at all .
The problems we 're having now have nothing to do with the war in Iraq .
McLaughlin : A major drag .
We 'd have that trillion dollars to spend here at home if we did n't have Iraq .
Apply now !

Brain scans show we measure our success by others ' earnings

The absolute consumption level , or alternatively the absolute level of income , is the most important determinant of individual well - being in traditional economic models of decision - making .
These models typically assume that social comparisons , and therefore relative income , play no role .
This view has long been challenged by social psychologists and anthropologists , who have argued that comparison with other individuals is a central phenomenon within human societies ...
Despite the importance of distinguishing the roles of absolute and relative income levels for subjective well - being , and thus for human decision - making , the underlying neurobiological basis of social comparison is not well understood .
... conditions in which a subject solved the task correctly and received a payment while the other subject did not were contrasted with conditions in which a subject received no payment .
This contrast yielded significant activation in three bilateral and three medial regions , which defined our regions of interest : left and right occipital cortex , left and right angular gyrus , left and right ventral striatum [ see above figure ] , precuneus , and medial orbitofrontal cortex ( two distinct activations ) , thus including the regions known to be critically involved in the processing of reward .
According to our hypothesis , the parameter estimates increased with the ratio between a subject 's reward and the other subject 's reward ...
All other main effects and interactions of the ANOVA analysis turn out to be insignificant .
This holds for the main effect of high versus low payment condition as well as its interaction with relative payment .
The latter result suggests that the importance of relative comparison is independent of the level of payment .
...
All posterior regions ( occipital lobe , angular gyrus , and precuneus / cingulate cortex ) showed a different pattern , with response intensity significantly varying with both absolute and relative payment .
In these regions , responses were highest ... in situations when high amounts of money were unequally paid regardless of which of the subjects received more .
A similar pattern was found in the two orbitofrontal regions .

Whether social comparison affects individual well - being is of central importance for understanding behavior in any social environment .
Traditional economic theories focus on the role of absolute rewards , whereas behavioral evidence suggests that social comparisons influence well - being and decisions .
We investigated the impact of social comparisons on reward - related brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
While being scanned in two adjacent MRI scanners , pairs of subjects had to simultaneously perform a simple estimation task that entailed monetary rewards for correct answers .
We show that a variation in the comparison subject 's payment affects blood oxygenation level –dependent responses in the ventral striatum .
Our results provide neurophysiological evidence for the importance of social comparison on reward processing in the human brain .
Or at least , that 's the implication of this BBC story about the latest neuroimaging paper ( Fliessbach et al. , 2007 ) in What was the study actually about ?
OK , so we already know that social comparisons and relative income matter .
What can we learn from this study ?
Is it much of a surprise that the participants were competitive ?
Yeah , OK , stick people in a scanner and see what happens .
What did the professional subjects do while there ?
Pairs of participants were scanned simultaneously in two different magnets while estimating the number of dots presented on a computer screen .
After each trial , both participants received feedback on how each of them had done , and how much money was earned according to a predefined payment schedule .
So what happened ?
So all these other brain regions were activated as well .
Why occipital cortex and angular gyrus ?
We 'll never know , because the authors never discuss the significance of those responses .
What was so distinctive about the ventral striatum , then ?
In brief , the ventral striatum was uniquely related to greaterreward ( not just absolute reward ) .
So what have we learned ?
It 's rewarding to win a competition and to earn more money than a rival .

Sometimes it seems nothing will ever happen again that cannot pay its way .
Never again will impecunious nobles publish vellum tracts of strange , subversive poetry that just might change the world .
Never again will students commandeer the streets for causes not their own .
Never again will universities and banks endow their ordinary , workaday buildings with the quoins and clocktowers , the flutings and friezes that give human existence a dignity and depth it may otherwise lack .
This single bottom - line mentality could be the slow - burn result of whichever Parisian longhair picked up the first stone to storm the Bastille .

It 's a question of medication .

Energy saving bulbs could reduce carbon dioxide emissions
Fluorescent bulbs can exacerbate skin rashes in people with photosensitive skin conditions , experts said .
The government is planning to prevent the sale of conventional bulbs by 2011 to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
Several groups including the British Association of Dermatologists called for exemptions to allow those affected to continue using traditional bulbs .
But representatives of the lighting industry said there would be alternatives to fluorescent lighting available .
Health conditions which can involve some form of light sensitivity , include the auto - immune disease lupus , the genetic disorder Xeroderma Pigmentosum ( XP ) , certain forms of eczema and dermatitis , photosensitivity , and porphyria .
We certainly do n't want to say no to greener bulbs just that other bulbs need to be available
Andrew Langford , Skin Care Campaign
It has been estimated about 100,000 people in the UK with these skin conditions will be affected .
Spectrum - an alliance of charities that support people with light sensitive conditions - says they have also been contacted with people suffering from ME who have had bad reactions to fluorescent light .
Other groups have warned that low - energy bulbs , which use approximately a quarter of the energy of conventional bulbs , cause migraines and increase the risk of seizures in people with epilepsy .
Phase - out
Conventional or " incandescent " bulbs are being phased out in a voluntary agreement with retailers and will no longer be on sale from December 2011 .
Campaigners want people who have light sensitive conditions to be able to continue to buy conventional bulbs for their homes .
They warned that employers must also be able to purchase incandescent lighting as employees have a right to such adjustments under the terms of the Disability Discrimination Act .
Andrew Langford , chief executive officer of the Skin Care Campaign , one of the charities involved , said : " Incandescent light bulbs are the only source of electric light for many thousands of people with light sensitive conditions .
" Add to this the thousands of people whose conditions or treatments may secondarily cause them to be light sensitive , and you have a large number of people potentially being isolated in the dark .
" We certainly do n't want to say no to greener bulbs just that other bulbs need to be available .
" It 's hard for people to understand what it 's like to live with one of these conditions . "
He also called for a government - funded study into the effects of fluorescent lighting on photosensitive conditions as little research had been done to date .
" We have the anecdotal information - it 's a shame people do n't listen to those affected .
Dr Colin Holden , President of the British Association of Dermatologists , said : " It is important that patients with photosensitive skin eruptions are allowed to use lights that do n't exacerbate their condition .
" It is essential that such patients are able to protect themselves from specific wavelengths of light emitted by fluorescent bulbs , especially as they are often trapped indoors because they can't venture out in natural sunlight . "
Kevin Verdun , chief executive of the lighting association said only two - thirds of incandescent bulbs were being phased out .
" These things have been taken into consideration and there will be bulbs they can still use .
" There are also halogen bulbs and LED bulbs coming in in the next two or three years . "
Click to viewThere 's only one thing better than robots that can destruct things : robots that can destroy things and terrify people by firing flameballs , bowling balls , watermelons and bloody pig entrails at high speed .
Like the Robopult , a gigantic $ 70,000 industrial robotic arm hacked to throw all these things like a Terminator version of Roger Clemens .
We talked with Aaron Rasmussen about how the heck they managed to get an industrial robot and some of the details of this crazy project :

Jesus Díaz :
How the heck did you get your hands on a giant industrial robotic arm ?
Aaron Rasmussen :
My friend had it for his company , and it was caught in some sort of accounting limbo .
So he agreed to let us use it if we did n't break it .
We had to give it back after , sadly .
That robot goes for about $ 70,000 .
JD : OK , so that was free .
What about the cost for the whole project ?
I saw that you " rented " ( buy and return ) an HD camera for free from Fry's ...
AR : The total cost was actually only about $ 1,000 , or about $ 1,220 if you count the camera that gets hit by the bowling ball :
• Truck rental : $ 716.13
• Gas for truck $ 72.86
• Bowling Balls $ 60.00
• The pig entrails , water for us , carrots , watermelons , eggs and such came to around : $ 100
• We found scrap parts for the catapult arm
• We traded computer services for the heavy equipment ( Skylife and tractor ) .
• The RV camper van was a junker from a friend of a friend .

Looking at the full video , it seems like the best way to spend a weekend and $ 1,000 with friends .
I personally can't wait for some kind of laser arm version .

Link : Speed Cameras .
“ This page is probably the highlight of the entire site .
To my knowledge this is the largest collection of wrecked Gatsos on the internet , and its growing rapidly .
So long as these cameras are robbing motorists of their cash they will continue to be destroyed .
“ Five Gatsos have just gone up in Nuneaton .
One of them was completely destroyed before it had even gone live .
The workmen had n’t even finished installing it …. ”
( (( And check out the chest - pounding vigilante manifesto here … my goodness me . ) ) )
http://www.speedcam.co.uk/index2.htm
“ A Summer of MADness ?
“ Motorists Against Detection , the vigilante anti-speed camera group have announced a summer of MADness which will see them target for destruction all speed cameras in the UK .
It ’s now going to be a period of zero tolerance against all speed cameras , said their campaigns director Capt Gatso .
( ( ( A remote descendant of General Ludd , I reckon . ) ) )
“ The group claims speed cameras are just money - making machines and they have given the authorities long enough to prove their worth .
The first camera to fall in the summer campaign is in south east London on the A2 at the Sun in the Sands roundabout on - slip heading northbound towards the Blackwall Tunnel .
“ Capt Gatso , the group ’s campaigns director , ( ( ( he ’s a multitalented guy ) ) ) said : “ We have completely pulled it out of the ground , it is now lying flat .
You can see some of our handiwork posted on www.speedcam.co.uk.
“ He added :
In many areas the cameras have not saved one life – the statistics for road deaths have n’t gone down .
In some areas they have actually gone up – in Essex , for instance , which has a high density of cameras there are more people being killed .
We are now planning to target any and all cameras until the Government sees sense and rethinks its road safety policy .
Before we had speed cameras we had the safest roads in Europe – since their introduction this is no longer true . ”
The announcement will surprise many in road safety circles since the group has publicly declared it would not attack cameras outside schools or on high streets .
But Capt Gatso said :
We need to focus attention on what the cameras are about .
We ’ve said we would n’t attack the ones in built up and urban areas but that ’s not where most of the cameras are .
There are a lot of frustrated people among our members who have seen the number of cameras increase while road safety levels have fallen .
Indeed , the only thing the cameras have done successfully is to reduce the number of traffic officers patrolling our roads and lose a lot of decent people their driving licences and their livelihoods .
( ( ( Giving them lots of spare time to wander around with big jugs of petrol and huge flammable tires to be flung round the necks of videocams . ) ) )
“ MAD is the UK ’s only direct action anti-speed camera group and it ’s been going since summer 2000 . ( ((! ) ) )
In that time they have taken out just over 1,000 cameras .
( ( ( Can such things be ? ) ) )
Their membership who are normally law - abiding people – vary in numbers but there is a hard core of around 200 ( ( ( I ’d be guessing this figure means “ 20 , ” but wow , for a saboteur gang , that ’s a lot ) ) ) people throughout the UK who use Internet chat forums , encrypted email and pay as you go phones to keep in touch and plan campaigns .
“ The group says it has perfected a new and quick way of destroying speed cameras which will enable them to destroy a roadside camera in just a few seconds … ” .
Stock markets are likely to stay volatile for a number of weeks
The UK's FTSE 100 index closed 2.9 % higher after falling more than 4 % earlier .
France 's Cac also bounced back but Germany 's Dax closed 0.3 % down .
In the US , the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes fell , but their declines were less sharp than they had been earlier .
The Fed cut its main interest rate to 3.5 % from 4.25 % in a surprise move .
It came after global markets suffered their worst day since 9/11 on Monday , and as investors continued to dump shares in early trading on Tuesday .
The fears about slowing global growth were so pronounced that they spread to other asset classes , hurting commodities such as oil and gold .
But most stock market indexes and commodities quickly gained ground after their earlier losses in response to the Fed 's biggest interest rate cut in more than two decades .
The UK 's benchmark FTSE 100 index of largest shares finished 162 points , or 2.9 % , ahead at 5,740.1 and the French Cac 40 index gained 2 % , but Germany 's Dax failed to make headway , still down 0.3 % at 6,769.47 .
In the US , shares on the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session 1 % lower at 11,971.19 , while the broader S&P 500 index also shed 1 % .
" This major move might seem like a panic response to the plunge in stock prices , but it also makes sense , " said Dick Green at Briefing.com .
REMEMBER BLACK MONDAY ?
See past UK booms and busts
But other analysts were less convinced .
" This is a cure for the wrong disease , " said Daniel Alpert , managing director of US investment bank Westwood Capital .
" It makes everybody feel good , but it 's not going to have any ongoing benefit .
" We need to get ourselves out of a mountain of debt and overvalued properties . "
Caution rules
The recent stock market declines came after many investors were disappointed by US President George W Bush 's proposed $ 145 bn ( £ 74 bn ) emergency stimulus plan to boost the economy .
At the same time , banks were reporting increasing losses stemming from problems in the US housing market , and some of the main bellwether companies were not meeting analysts ' earnings estimates .
Signs of the tougher economic environment have also been evident in the Christmas corporate trading statements and economic data on both sides of the Atlantic .
Many analysts said that while the Fed 's rate cut might help to ease concerns in the short - term , stock markets were set to be volatile in coming weeks .
" Caution still rules the long - term picture , " said Markus Steinbeis of Pioneer Investments .
' Remain calm '
Before the Fed 's rate cut on Tuesday , stock indexes were under severe pressure .
In Mumbai , India 's main stock index the Sensex fell 9.8 % within minutes of opening , triggering an automatic one - hour halt in trading .
It later recovered some of its losses to close 5 % lower , extending its record one - day fall of 7.4 % on Monday .
India 's Finance Minister P Chidambaram has urged Indian investors to " remain calm " and advised them to " stay invested " .
Mr Chidambaram said that " enough liquidity will be provided to the brokers to tide over the present crisis " .
In China , the main Shanghai Composite Index closed down 7.2 % at a five - month low , having lost 17 % in the past six days of trading .
Trading was also suspended briefly in South Korea , where the market eventually closed down 4.4 % , while Hong Kong 's Hang Seng index suffered its biggest daily fall , closing down 8.7 % .
Global co-operation
Sydney 's market continued its longest losing streak for 26 years , closing 7.1 % lower .
FTSE 100 - BIGGEST FALLS 20/10/87 down 12.2 %
19/10/87 down 10.8 % 26/10/87 down 6.2 %
11/09/01 down 5.7 % 22/10/87 down 5.7 % 22/01/08 down 5.5 %
The Japanese government said it saw no reason to intervene to support the markets and a Bank of Japan meeting left interest rates unchanged .
Japan 's benchmark index , the Nikkei 225 , shed 5.7 % at 12,573.05 , extending its losses since the beginning of the year to 18 % .
" Stock markets across the world are falling and it basically stems from the US , " said Hiroko Ota , the minister for economic and fiscal policy .
" It is difficult at the moment to mull action by Japan alone .
Instead , we should co-operate globally , " she said .

THE annual bonus round is galling enough when times are good ; when times are bad , and the banks are largely to blame , the bile rises even faster .
Investment banks had a large hand in starting the rot that has sent the American economy stumbling towards recession , yet total compensation for employees at Wall Street 's big five securities firms rose in 2007 , to $ 66 billion from $ 60 billion in 2006 .
The average bonus at these banks stood at more than $ 210,000 last year , some four times more than America 's average household income .
“ I get bankers coming to me and asking : ‘ I got an £ 800,000 ( $ 1.57 m ) bonus .
Should I be happy ? ' ” says one disbelieving headhunter in London .
Press luminaries and academics have lined up to criticise a compensation system that apparently creates incentives for risk - taking but fails to penalise bankers when bets turn sour .
“ It 's ‘ heads I win , tails you lose ' ” , says Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago 's business school .
He would like to see a “ clawback ” system that would hold onto portions of bankers ' bonuses in an escrow account until the risks associated with their positions had become clearer .
The tone is less measured in the blogosphere .
“ Bankers are the worst class of ‘ business ' people out there , ” posts one blogger .
“ Commies coming out of the woodwork here , ” blasts back another .
The asymmetry certainly looks awful .
A crisis that started with people taking on too much debt at the bottom of the housing ladder now has bonus - laden bankers viewing townhouses and weekend retreats at its top .
( Rumours about scatological protests by bank traders disgruntled at the size of their pay - outs do nothing for the industry 's soiled image . )
But the reality is more nuanced .
Start with those big bonus pots at the five Wall Street firms .
Banks ended the year in a sea of red , with some notable exceptions , but the first half of 2007 was thumpingly good ( 2008 , by contrast , looks likely to be consistently miserable ) .
Staff numbers surged as a result .
When last year 's totals are divided by numbers of employees , bonuses dipped year on year on average .
Talk of “ averages ” is in any case misleading .
The bonus season is not yet complete , so the influence of Goldman Sachs , by far the best performer on Wall Street , on the aggregate numbers so far is exaggerated .
Eric Moskowitz of Options Group , an executive - search firm , forecasts that bonus pools will wind up dropping by 10 - 15 % at top - tier banks in New York .
Variation within banks is also much greater this year than in previous years .
The rainmakers are pulling in bigger rewards ; others are seeing their slice of the pie shrink sharply .
“ This is not a good year to be at or below the median , ” says Dee Symons of Russell Reynolds , another search firm .
Nor is it a good year to be working on anything to do with structured credit , where bankers are as likely to receive a pink slip as a pay cheque .
Should bankers be getting anything at all , given how far shares and profits at many have fallen ?
Critics point to soaring compensation ratios at Merrill Lynch as an example of how the system appears to be loaded in bankers ' favour .
Banks normally try to keep their compensation as a proportion of revenue just below 50 % ; the ratio at Merrill , which posted its first annual loss since 1989 in 2007 , shot up to 141 % .
That looks indefensible : John
Thain himself , Merrill 's new boss , expressed discomfort with the bonus system , suggesting that it needed to be changed to reflect the performance of the overall organisation rather than individual bits of the bank .
But the outrage can again be overdone .
The ratio of compensation to income naturally rises at any business that suffers a slump ; and the price of not paying the going rate for the top people can be a lethal exodus of talent .
Headhunters report plenty of interest from “ ambulance - chasing ” second - tier banks hoping to prise star employees away from big banks that have not met expectations on pay .
The system is not perfect , of course .
A debate about how compensation policies might encourage bankers to think more about the long term and the overall health of the business is welcome .
Greater use of stock options is one possibility : banks that fared worst in the subprime saga , such as Merrill , UBS and Citigroup , have all been forced to increase the equity component of compensation packages .
But options have their own flaws , as examples in other industries readily show ; and in any case the chances of an industry - wide overhaul of compensation practices ( the only way that meaningful change will happen ) are slim .
The bloggers will be raging for a while yet .
Carrefour is looking to expand in China
The stampede happened at a branch of the French chain Carrefour , in the city of Chongqing , state media said .
The shop was offering large discounts on cooking oil .
A crowd that had been waiting hours for the store to open then burst through the doors .
Carrefour entered the Chinese market in 1995 and has since opened more than 100 supermarkets .
Prices soar
Queues at the store reportedly began at 0400 local time ( 2000 GMT Friday ) .
State media Xinhua said bargain - hunters were crushed underfoot in a sale to mark the 10th anniversary of the store 's opening in the south - western city .
Some of those trying to get in reportedly slipped and were trampled .
At least seven of the injured are in a serious condition , Xinhua said .
An investigation has been launched by local authorities .
Cooking oil prices have soared by more than a third in the past year .
In Chongqing , Carrefour was reportedly offering 20 % off rapeseed oil .
Carrefour , which is the world 's second - biggest retailer , has been keen to expand in China as it booms and recently opened its 101st hypermarket in the country .
Bvdub is Brock Van Wey from San Francisco .
In just the past year , he has had releases on Styrax Records , Quietus Records , Night Drive Music and its sub-label 2600 Records .
While much of his music could be called dub techno , it has deeper roots , delving into emotional chords , retro synths , and late - night ambience .
Brock was kind enough to join me for an interview over email .
Jacob :
Please tell me a bit about yourself .
Were you born and raised in the San Francisco area ?
Brock : I am indeed one of the very few people living in San Francisco who was actually born here .
I then grew up in Livermore , a small suburb city about forty - five minutes from here , and am Bay Area born and raised .
Oftentimes I do n’t realize how much of a product of the area I am until I travel somewhere else , and realize I am Northern California through and through .
For the most part I was your typical bored suburban kid who did n’t know how good I had it , usually hanging out with people I probably should n’t have been hanging out with , and doing things I definitely should n’t have been doing .
We ’ll just leave it at that .
I was , however , fortunate enough to have experienced the phenomenal peak of the underground electronic music and rave scene in San Francisco , which I delved into headlong around 1991 .
This was back when you could pretty much go out to completely underground events seven nights a week to hear everything from ambient to hardcore , with anywhere from ten people to ten - thousand .
They are without a doubt the fondest memories of my life .
From the get - go , I gravitated to the side room and early morning scene , where DJs always seemed to play the deepest and most personal music — the music they themselves loved the most , not necessarily what they felt everyone else wanted to hear .
My friends looked at me like I was insane when I announced one morning as we left a party , squinting in the bright morning sun , that one day I was going to be the guy who played at nine o’clock in the morning , when only a small handful of people remained , too entranced to leave .
( I ’m fully aware of the fact that the drugs did n’t hurt either . )
That desire never left me , and the most memorable times I ever had DJing were always those with just a handful of people left .
I ’ve never felt a stronger connection through music with another human being .
I noticed a mix on your site from 1999 .
How and when did you start making music ?
I began DJing not long after I first started going to raves , probably around 1992 or so , and my first official mixtapes began to appear in stores around 1993 .
They were primarily beat - less ambient and deep trance , until I honed my sound to the deep tech and deep house styles I became ( relatively ) known for throughout the mid- to late - nineties .
In 2001 or so , I had had enough of the deceitful , political , and selfish state of affairs that had overrun the electronic music and DJ world ( at least that of San Francisco ) , which had degenerated to little more than hordes of people simply DJing and throwing parties to think they were cool , try to get chicks , or to make money .
The admittedly idealistic world of underground music I had struggled to maintain for so long had , in my eyes , vanished , and along with it so did I , as I sold off every last one of my records and moved to China for two years to essentially escape and begin a new life in an effort to forget the culture I had devoted the last decade of my life to , for which I had sacrificed everything from my relationships to my money , to my education and my sanity , and which had broken my heart one too many times .
When I returned to San Francisco in 2004 , I made a few ambient mixes here and there just for me and my friends , until at the very end of 2006 , one of my best friends finally succeeded in convincing me to begin making my own music — a pursuit he had been trying to convince me to undertake for years .
I had long protested the idea , assuming that my frankly obsessive - compulsive nature would prevent me from ever finishing anything and that realizing how all the music I loved was made would somehow rob it of its magic .
I was completely wrong on both counts .
( Hey it does n’t happen often , but it can happen . )
So to provide a ridiculously long - winded answer to your question , I have been making my own music for just over a year , probably about thirteen months now .
Who are some of your musical influences ?
Unlike some who will tell you they take influence from all sorts of music spanning all sorts of genres and decades , I take influence pretty much only from electronic music , as it is pretty much all I have listened to in the last 17 years .
That ’s not to say I do n’t have the odd inspiration from this or that part of a song I hear on the radio or in a movie , but for all these years , I have n’t listened to any other kind of music , really , so as far as straight - up influence , it ’s all electronic .
Though I never would have thought it , I think a large subliminal influence also comes from my years of classical training as a kid .
( I played piano for seven years , and violin for nearly ten , eventually playing in a couple of local symphonies . )
The irony was that I always hated listening to classical music , but I loved playing it .
I guess in the end , more of it seeped in than I thought .
I think as a result , much of the time the music I make contains a more musical , dramatic , and almost cinematic quality .
My music is primarily influenced by the three genres I have spent most of my time listening to , especially in the last decade or so : beat - less ambient , deep techno , and a combination of the “ IDM ” of the late nineties , the modern - day direction of experimental — glitch ambient , and electro - acoustic .
( Genre classification within that realm is ridiculously complicated and seems to change every day , so forgive me if I ’m not up on the latest . )
I will refrain from listing off hordes of amazing artists who have influenced me over time , both in the interest of space , and because frankly I think in the end my sound is distinct to me , and though I no doubt carry with me the influence of those I have heard and music I have loved , I do n’t want to be compared to them .
Everyone seemingly has to be compared to someone nowadays .
It ’s out of control .
I think each artist , unless they are blatantly trying to emulate someone else , should be judged on their own merits , and their own vision , rather than being the “ next ” this person , or “ in the footsteps ” of that — not only for themselves , but for those who came before .
Everyone ’s different .
At least they should be .
I think what sucks is that a vast amount of influence over time have come from countless underground producers who put out one record , and then were never heard from again .
No one ( including myself , because I ca n’t remember the names of many , if any ) could name them as their influences even if they wanted to , yet all of them have played a part , some really major , in influencing the music and lives of others , and in constructing the tapestry of the music we know / love / make now .
If only their music had come out in the days of email and Myspace , someone could have told them that .
But most of them will probably never know that their music changed someone ’s life .
At least many of them changed mine , and though I can’t credit them by name , because I too am guilty of letting them slip into obscurity , I would like to thank them for their integral part in the role and advancement of this music we love .
Your first Bvdub release was on Night Drive Music .
What made you decide to debut on a net - label ?
It ’s simple , really .
They were the first label to give me the time of day .
Andre at Night Drive was an instant and fervent supporter of my music , even my first forays , and for that I will always be grateful .
You seem to be linked to the new labels Quietus and Shoreless .
Can you tell me about them ?
Well I am indeed irrevocably linked to Quietus , as it is my label .
I started it late last year to provide a platform for both myself and others to put out both our deepest , most personal music , and that which other labels had overlooked or passed on for being “ too ambient , ” “ too self - indulgent , ” or really “ too ” anything .
Everything about Quietus is as personal as I can possibly make it , from taking the photographs for each release ’s cover myself , to personally undertaking every step of the “ manufacturing ” process — hand - stamping and numbering each photo and hand - numbering each CD .
( Each release is limited to 100 copies . )
I want each copy to serve as a sort of postcard from the artist to the listener , a way for the listener to somehow feel personally connected to both the music and the artist , and I want them to not only have music to listen to , but an entirely personal item which was essentially made just for them .
I think music in its purest form is the most personal way one person can possibly communicate with another , and I want both the music and the release itself to reflect that .
It ’s been great to see that there are people out there who still appreciate such a notion in this age of pay - per - download and peer - to - peer pirating .
While I am also linked with Shoreless ( many mistakenly thought it was my label at one point ) , it is in a different way , as it is run by my good friend Sven Schienhammer , aka Quantec .
And just as he will always have a home in Quietus , I will venture to say I will gladly have one in Shoreless .
Though the two labels are both limited - edition CD labels ( Quietus will remain that way , but I ca n’t say what lies in store for Shoreless ) , each run in their own unique directions , with their own unique ideals and ideas , and so I hope people can appreciate them in very different ways .
Do you stay in touch with other artists doing similar work ?
Do you think it ’s important for artists to build a community ?
Yes on both counts .
I stay in regular contact with many other artists who are doing similar work ( I hesitate to use the term , since I look at each of them as doing very much their own thing in their own way , but I know what you mean ) , and have been fortunate enough to consider many of them not only musical allies , but close personal friends , even though I have never met them in person .
To me that ’s immaterial .
I think it ’s extremely important for artists to build a community with each other .
Just like in life itself , it ’s important to have a group of friends to not only help you out when you need it and pick you up when you ’re down , but also to tell you when you ’re being an idiot .
I consider myself very lucky to have been able to make the friends I have through music , and to have been able to form the family I have with the artists I stay in contact with .
It is extremely easy to become despondent in anything involving art if you do n’t know anyone who shares your vision at least to some extent .
Yes , music , especially that made by yourself , is an individual endeavor .
But I think anyone who truly loves the music they make will also be happy seeing others they know who share a common goal , achieving success and being heard , the music they love taking a step in the right direction .
Otherwise , not only does everything about the music suffer and stagnate , but you will too .
And if that ’s okay with you , I think you need to take another look at why you ’re making music .
If I can do anything to help any of my friends in my musical “ familia , ” as I call it , then I ’m there .
And I know many of them feel the same .
Sometimes it ’s important to know you ’re not alone in the struggle .
Your music seems very dream - like .
What are your inspirations ?
In a way I can see how they come out like that , because I spend the majority of my life lost in the clouds of who knows where , and rarely where I actually am .
I spend most of my time either remembering times past , or imagining idealistic futures that will never come true ; I am rarely anchored in the present .
My entire life I have been an over - thinker , and a person who can easily slip away in the labyrinth of my own head , which has worked to my detriment on more than one occasion .
The majority of my inspirations come from a need to form those thoughts into something somewhat tangible , so in a way I can be relieved of them ( which is only occasionally successful ) .
Most of my music is borne quite frankly from ideas of sadness ( both my own and others ’ , real and hypothetical ) , regret , and even hurt , but also I think a tinge of hopefulness usually shows through as well .
I ’ve always loved sadness , and find a beauty in it — sad movies , books , music , art , anything really .
And it ’s always inspired me when others ( artists , musicians , directors , etc. ) have the courage to express their own life ’s sadness or regrets through their art .
I think they really lay their soul bare , and that ’s no easy task .
Everyone has their own sadness , but not everyone chooses to admit it , face it head - on , or to go as far as to put a tangible form to it for all to see or hear .
But I think through that expression is also their own message of hope for a better tomorrow , which I think a lot of people fail to realize .
My music is a way for me to say things I never got to say , either to people I ’ve known , or ( sort of hypothetically ) as a voice for others in scenarios in which I ’ve been immersed ( such as movies , books , etc. ) , if that makes any sense .
It ’s also a way to paint a portrait of the ideal I would like to hope I and others could reach someday — a sort of mental picture of a utopian place where I long to be , but deep inside know I never will , because ideals are just that .
In a way it ’s uplifting , though .
You have to dream for something , otherwise there ’s no point to life .
How long does it usually take you to compose a piece ?
It really depends .
Sometimes the Fates conspire against me , and I can literally work on one sound for six to eight hours with no result , or only to gain what I think is a result until I wake up the next morning and hear it again and wonder what the hell I was thinking .
Sometimes it all just comes together and everything falls into place , with every note and sound seemingly being put on this earth to be in the track .
I ’ve done a track in as short a span of time as a day ( though rare ) , and as long as two weeks of what seems a daily exercise in futility .
But if there ’s one thing I am , it ’s stubborn .
I will not abandon a track , or put it on hold and move on to something else .
I will keep working on that one track until it comes out how I want it to come out , no matter what it takes .
Eventually , what should happen will click , and it will all come together .
You just have to be persistent .
Or a stubborn S.O.B .
Whichever you prefer .
These days my tracks take longer and longer ( usually between one and two weeks ) , because they have become progressively denser and more layered ; some ( recent ones ) contain anywhere from twenty - five to thirty different simultaneous elements at their peak .
A drum ’n ’ bass producer will likely scoff at such a number , but for ambient and techno , that ’s no chump change .
What do you do when you ’re not making music ?
By trade I am a Chinese translator who translates literary works ( novels , biographies , etc. ) from Chinese to English .
I ’ll never be a rich man off it , but as far as “ work ” goes , I ca n’t imagine anything else I ’d rather do with my life .
I love it .
Plus I am my own boss and set my own hours , so you ca n’t beat that .
Not only do I get to do something I love when I actually have to work , but it luckily allows me a lot of spare time to work on music as well .
I lead a pretty quiet life , and would much rather chill with close friends , or stay home alone to read a book , watch a movie , watch TV , or crack - out on my PS3 or Xbox 360 for hours on end rather than go out .
I guess you could say I ’m not much of a “ people person , ” except with my friends .
Actually , I ’m sure some of them would argue I ’m not really a “ people person ” with them either .
Any time I ’m not working or isolating myself , I spend training Krav Maga , boxing , and kickboxing — the Krav Maga ( a system developed by the Israeli Defense Force ) for the whole self - defense thing and the boxing and kickboxing for the pure fighting .
At the school I train at , we fight pretty much full - bore , with no headgear and way less rules and regulations than most other schools would ever have .
The result , to be honest , is basically a glorified street fight most of the time , but I am sick in the head and find it one of the most fun and satisfying things in the world .
Not only do I love the concept that two people can basically try to knock each other out for however many rounds , then shake hands and sit around and shoot the breeze like nothing ever happened , but there ’s something extremely therapeutic about how your mind and body shut off everything but the basic need to physically dominate someone else to avoid being dominated yourself .
It ’s about as back to basics as you can possibly get .
No matter what problem you ’re having , or how many issues you ’re stressing over , it all goes out the window for those few minutes .
It ’s amazing .
Plus I think everyone should learn to be able to fight and defend themselves with their own two hands .
You never know when you ’re gonna have to use ’em .
What are some of the projects you ’re currently working on ?
I ’m happy to say I have numerous releases coming out this year on a number of labels , including Styrax , Styrax Leaves , Millions of Moments , a very unique release on Southern Outpost , and of course Quietus .
I ’m currently taking a brief hiatus from beat - oriented music however , to devote some time to working on a full - length ambient and drone album I will be releasing on Shoreless later this year .
I ’m excited for and proud of all of my upcoming projects , but that one strikes a special chord in me ( no pun intended ) because to me , ambient is the deepest possible form of music and that which forms the foundation for all of the other music I make .
Someone I met once many years ago said , “ It takes a certain kind of person to be able to sit still and listen to ambient . ”
Indeed .
Jack Kerouac was one of those writers who reinvented literature .
He climbed in James Joyce 's stream of consciousness car then careened down the streets of Beat poetry and the alleyways of Bebop jazz , creating such novels as The Dharma Bums , Big Sur , and the landmark On the Road .
He influenced countless writers and , some say , helped usher in the 1960s counter - culture movement .
Fellow writers were always asking Kerouac how he did what he did .
So Kerouac set down 30 essentials in something he called “ Belief and Technique for Modern Prose . "
These tips may or may not make sense to you , but that 's Kerouac , man :
The Des Moines Register reports some signs that look like VERY good news to Democrats .
Thousands more Iowa independent voters are expected to turn out for Democrat presidential candidates than Republicans at today ’s Iowa caucuses .
Iowa independents are expected to follow the lead set by their national peers in 2006 .
Nationwide , independents backed Democrats heavily in the watershed 2006 elections , in part out of a rejection of President Bush and a loud cry for change that has continued into the 2008 campaign , strategists in both parties agree .
Recent polls have shown the percentage of Iowa independents planning to participate in the Democrat caucuses is far higher than those who say they ’ll caucus for Republicans .
Turnout for the Democrats is projected to be higher than Republicans , perhaps double .
A turnout like this , with twice as many Iowans caucusing on the Democratic side , will be a clear harbinger of sunny days ahead for the Democrats .
Then , there 's the Ron Paul factor .
Experts say that Paul 's strong base among younger voters is not detected in polls because polls call land line phones and younger voters tend to just use cell phones .
This writer has not seen evidence that Paul 's supporters are younger -- more monied yes , but not younger .
But if Paul pulls better than expected , this will be another message to congress that the people want the US out of Iraq -- no more false promises and lame excuses .
The register reports ,
The third smartest thing that the Democratic Party could do for themselves ( and for us ) would be to nominate a decent candidate for president next year .
The second smartest thing they could do would be to assist the Republicans in nominating a loser .
And the very smartest thing they could do , of course , would be to relocate their long - lost spines and then immediately schedule a surgery to have them reinserted and arc - welded into place .
That first item is probably not going to happen , what with the inexplicable Hillary Train chugging along relentlessly toward victory ( what 's up with that , Democratic voters ? ) , and the third item is the subject of a whole ' nuther discussion altogether ( what 's up with that , Democratic ' leaders ' ? ) , so , instead , let 's talk about winning the old - fashioned way : by using some smart guerilla warfare tactics against your opponent .
And one of the very best ways you can do that is to pick your opponent .
My guess is that Hillary , if she does in fact secure the nomination , will run a smart and tough campaign .
But not as smart and tough as Karl Rove would run .
On that , she should reconsider .
It 's not necessary to indulge in the filth and the demonization of your typical Rove scorched earth campaign in order to engage its take - no - prisoners style of hardball politics .
It is necessary to do the latter in order to win , because - Rove or not - Republicans will be doing it , as they always have since the era of Joe McCarthy .
Clinton , if she gets the nomination , will enter the general election campaign with one major strike against her : the person at head of the Democratic ticket .
She brings together into a singularly toxic brew more baggage than JFK airport the day before Thanksgiving , less charisma than a pile of dirty laundry , and all the principled moral exhilaration of a down - on - his - luck bail - bondsman .
Even holding out the very real prospect of becoming the first woman president cuts both ways .
Seven percent of American women tell pollsters that they would never vote for a female to hold the office ( now that 's a truly scary barometer on the state of the union ) ; who knows , maybe twice that many men feel the same way .
Democratic voters could hardly choose a more laden and uninspirational standard - bearer if they sat down at a drawing board to design one on purpose ( Let 's see here - add one part Michael Dukakis to one part Mark Foley and one part Margaret Thatcher , and presto ! , an instant boring and alienating candidate is born , complete with sex scandal history . )
Well , okay , I take that back - maybe Hillary 's not the worst imaginable .
Despite all appearances to the contrary , John Kerry 's attending physician insists that he is actually still alive , and they 've even published his vitals to prove it .
So if Democrats insist on committing political suicide next year , why not just do it the right way and let Kerry report for duty again , complete with the same smarmy salute ?
Maybe Harry Reid could be drafted as the vice - presidential nominee - talk about your charisma factor !
And they could get Bob Shrum to run the campaign again .
After losing his ninth presidential race straight , he'd only need one more after that to advance his perfect record into double digits !
The only reason Hillary has a prayer of winning is because this is the year that any Democrat with a pulse should be able to beat any Republican this side of Jesus himself , hands down .
Never has the American public been more anxious for change , nor more angry at the current class of clowns nominally in charge .
It 's the Democrats ' election to lose , which they - of course - seem intent on doing , having perfected the technique over the last forty years , only twelve of which have seen a Democrat in the White House ( both of whom were , by the way , obscure Southern conservatives who nevertheless seemed to spend most of their time in office happily serving as punching bags for the radical right ) .
A Clinton nomination , with all the negatives and no compensating positives , neutralizes the gift of George W. Bush to the Democratic Party in 2008 and turns the damn thing into a horse race , after all .
( As proof of this point , consider the wagers I offered to a right - wing ranter who was badgering me on email about how wrong I was concerning the mood of the country .
To shut him up , I offered him three bets of $ 100 each :
That the GOP would lose the White House in 2008 , that Democrats would increase their majorities in both houses of Congress , and that these increases would be huge .
My only caveat was that there be no ' national security '
October surprises before the election .
Not entirely surprisingly , he declined all the bets other than the first one , and would only take that on the condition that Hillary was the Democratic nominee .
I believe that 's what poker players and nuclear brinksmanship contestants refer to as having your bluff called - bigtime - but in any case , the more important illustration is of the weakness Clinton introduces to the ticket . )
Having blown their prohibitive advantage by , presumably , nominating Clinton , the Democrats ' best hope will be is to run the smartest and most aggressive campaign they can .
This would involve a number of key steps .
One of them is to choose your opponent .
Nixon did it 1972 , using dirty tricks to sabotage the Muskie campaign so he could run against McGovern instead , a nice fat target for a country unable then , as now , to differentiate true morality and heroism from the manufactured and cynical kind you'd think would lose its appeal at about the same time that playing war in the dirt with GI Joe dolls does for adolescents .
Alas , in too many cases it does not , and the dolls just seem to get replaced with football players on TV .
There is also some evidence to suggest the Rove pulled the same trick with Howard Dean in 2004 , in order to stand up Kerry as his punching bag .
A very smart move , of course .
Democrats need to do likewise for this race , to the extent they can , and they need to start today .
Giuliani ( and to a lesser extent McCain ) is the greatest threat to Democratic hopes of winning the presidency .
To my admitted astonishment , Republican voters seem to understand this and appear willing to forego their true preferences to embrace a winner , just as Democratic voters are doing the opposite .
( Not that there is necessarily a compelling alternative choice for Democrats .
John Edwards is the obvious progressive choice with a chance , but I continue to be nagged by the prospect that he is simply wearing his progressive hat today because he thinks that 's what might sell best among angry Democratic primary voters . )
What makes Giuliani dangerous is that he is the least Bush - like of the four main Republican contenders .
The others - Thompson , McCain and Romney - all more or less ape the troglodyte line on economic , security and social policy , while the Rude Man is only down for the first two ( and the least unappealing ) of those ideological categories .
That makes him a lot more palatable to moderate voters put off by the gay - bashing , Schiavo - intervening , stem - cell - blocking and abortion - halting strains of today 's GOP .
And that marginally greater appeal , along with Hillary 's vulnerabilities , makes him dangerous .
Which means that a smart Democratic Party and a smart Hillary Clinton would do everything in their power to make sure he is not the nominee next year .
That 's no easy trick , especially if - unlike Tricky Dick or Kaveman Karl - you have some ethical and legal limitations on what you 're willing to do .
That said , there are possibilities for making this happen , and there 's no prohibition on campaigning against him now , especially through surrogates .
Ghouliani has massive vulnerabilities , especially among religious right voters , many of which cannot be pointed out , at least overtly , by his GOP rivals , either because they share some of the same weak spots themselves , or because it would be seen as a violation of the GOP 's supposed Eleventh Commandment that thou shall not speak ill of another Republican ( as articulated by Ronald Reagan , who then proceeded in 1976 to run against sitting president Gerald Ford for the Republican nomination , presumably breaking the rather less well - known commandment against costing a fellow Republican the presidency ) .
It 's not clear who among the front - runners in the party would be the weakest opponent - and therefore the one Democrats should help arrange to get the nomination - but only because Mitt Romney is every bit as obsequious as Fred Thompson is comatose .
In the end , though , I think the SmarMitt is probably the better choice .
One of the keys to winning this race is going to be turning the Republican candidate into The Monster from Right - Wing Hell - not exactly a difficult chore , mind you - especially since Romney has been hard at work on that task for the last year , completely reinventing himself as the evil twin brother of the guy who once was the liberal governor of the liberal Massachusetts , but is apparently now locked up securely in an attic somewhere in the suburbs of Worcester .
Even people dumb enough to lap up the gospel of Rush every day are n't so far gone that they do n't find the guy suspicious .
And then if he got the nomination and then tried to tack back to the center , he'd only alienate both sets of voters .
Either way , a smart Democratic nominee could , should and must hammer him or any other GOP nominee as a right - wing freak .
The nice thing about Romney is that he 's spent the last months actually writing that script himself , but Thompson would also do , in a pinch .
Freddy 's lumbering campaign could n't even light a fire in Southern California at this point .
Out on the stump , he 's got the potential to make James Stockdale , Ross Perot 's infamous " Who am I ? " running mate , seem like a Nobel laureate by comparison .
No wonder Nixon thought Thompson was " dumb " back in the Watergate era .
Thirty years of acting and lobbying do n't seem to have improved matters a lot .
A second crucial tactic for Democrats , which could be part of the first as well , is to define the Rude Dude before he gets a chance to define himself to American voters .
This will be crucial whether or not he gets the nomination , but obviously more so assuming he 's the candidate .
Americans really know very little about the former mayor , and what they think they know is false anyhow .
Those guns have to start blazing , and the sooner the better .
There 's a wealth of material to use here , including some outrageous personal stunts like announcing , at a press conference , to his stunned second wife that he was leaving her ( for what would become wife number three , with whom he was then having an affair ) .
Giuliani has lamely told reporters and voters to leave his personal life alone .
Normally , I would tend to agree , but given the transgressions of his party these last decades in all of our personal lives , I 'd say any Republican with a record like this should be savaged well and good , just like they did to Bill Clinton , or to Terri Schiavo 's family , or to any pregnant woman in America ever contemplating an abortion .
At the very least , Giuliani should be forced to repudiate those intrusions , which would of course cost him massively amongst the Republican base .
It 's also crucial to attack Giuliani at his perceived strong spot , above all , just as Rove wisely , though so cynically , did to Kerry in 2004 .
Giuliani's twin claims to fame are that he has successful executive experience , and that he is Mr. 9/11 .
Both of these can readily and credibly be punctured by repeated use of very real evidence to the contrary .
Voters need to be continually reminded that he was hated by New Yorkers on the day before 9/11 , and that he completely botched the emergency responses he talks about endlessly .
Every time he goes on about how he is the only guy to actually run something , it needs to be pointed out that a city is not country , and that he has no foreign policy experience .
Democrats should turn the guy into the best street - cleaner and pothole repairer ever to run for president .
More importantly , though , Giuliani must be morphed into Bernie Kerik - whom he in fact created - and all of the latter 's sex and money scandals , not least the mob ties Giuliani was clearly warned about as he was promoting Kerik .
I think the little taxpayer - supported love nest that the married Kerik had , directly overlooking the 9/11 ground - zero pit no less , might prove instructional to voters , as well .
And Rude -y must have the angry relatives of deceased New York firefighters , who never got the communications equipment from him that would have saved their lives , turned into his virtual running mates as well .
Let him try to run against that .
Let Republicans try to swift - boat the tearful , angry father of some firefighter who perished on 9/11 .
Giuliani - or any Republican nominee - must also be turned into George W. Bush at every turn .
The Democratic nominee should continually push the Republican candidate to denounce Bush .
He wo n't do it , because Bush is still popular with the base , and the hated W will thus become the perfect wedge issue in 2008 .
Over and over it should be emphasized that a vote for the Republicans in 2008 is a vote for more Bush and Cheney - more war , more debt , more incompetence , more corruption , more endless Bushism .
By the time election day rolls around , voters should be made to think Junior is on the ballot yet again .
In point of fact , given the way most Republicans have been campaigning , he is .
Americans have had enough of Republicans and they 've even had enough of conservatism .
Poll data shows an unmistakable and profound shift to the left , and that will grow both as the true horrors of the last decade become known , and the real vulnerabilities of the public become clear .
But this is why a Giuliani campaign is particularly threatening .
Alone among the Republican frontrunners , he can credibly disassociate himself from the most egregious and most abhorrent Terri Schiavo - style social regressivism .
I would like nothing more than for Bushism to continue to be the dominant ideology of the GOP ( in fact , a few more Schiavo - style stunts would be just the ticket ) .
I think more of what we 've seen these last seven years could literally drive the party into extinction , and I for one would n't exactly mourn its loss .
Giuliani , or anybody leading the party back in the direction of Gerry Ford style center - right conservatism , on the other hand , restores some marginal sanity and credibility to Republicans , and postpones the day when the beast finally no longer darkens our national doorway .
The Democratic ticket this year should also return to the old Nixonian tradition of using the VP nominee ( and other surrogates ) to serve as pit bulls attacking the opposition .
Democrats need to be aggressive , rather than waiting to win by default ( just ask the hapless John Kerry , whose is probably still to this day waiting for his ship to come in ) , putting the GOP ticket on the defensive and keeping them there before they are ever able to get up off the mat .
The Dems also need to be relentless .
One reason Democrats are always getting rolled is because they cease and desist in their criticism whenever the right reacts to what they 've said , which means they always lose .
What would happen if they just kept saying the same things over and over again , incessantly ?
Has it never occurred to this brain trust that being shut up is precisely the objective of other side ?
Have they never realized that making the right defend themselves continuously is a victory of sorts , just on its own ?
Do they not understand that the only way to make ideas stick , and to turn them into conventional wisdom , is by repeating them incessantly ?
Plop , plop , fizz , fizz - has Harry Reid never heard of this street in New York called Madison Avenue ?
Democrats are going to need to retrain the press , as well , and that has to start now .
The media - either because of cooptation , intimidation , corporate profit protection , or all of the above - has savaged Democrats like Jimmy Carter , Bill Clinton and Al Gore while giving a free pass to the most egregious inanities and crimes of Reagan and Junior .
That has to stop , and the best way to do that is to publicly humiliate the press for their cowardice , and do so repeatedly .
Every time they come to the Democrats for a response to the latest regressive idiocy , they need to be asked instead why they never investigated GOP crimes , which should be named explicitly .
As in , " Come back to me after you guys have done your job and covered the Downing Street Memos " .
Doing this repeatedly will reopen those cases and earn a little respect for the brand new concept of Democratic pluck , currently the oxymoron of the century .
It will also do to the media what thirty years worth of the " liberal press " myth has done so successfully for the right , namely , getting them to self - edit .
It 's called working the ref , and it's high time a little of that went the other direction .
Or even a lot of it .
Democrats need also to demean Republicans , so that voters would be embarrassed to be associated with the party in any fashion whatsoever .
" I mean , these are the same people who brought us ...[ insert Foley , Craig , Schiavo , Katrina , debt , global warming , 9/11 , or other appropriate Republican fiasco here ] - why in the world would we want to listen to them now ? " needs to become a standard and repeated motif for undermining the very notion in the public mind of even considering taking the party seriously .
These meta- narratives are crucial , because they can win battles before they are even engaged by making any position but yours seem to silly to consider , just as most Americans have been successfully trained to reject the idea of ' socialist ' programs out of hand if they are so labeled , even when they actually approve of a given program 's concept .
And , finally , the campaign should play on the fatigue of the public with the status quo .
Levels of disgust with America 's direction have never been so high and so sustained .
No party could ask for a better environment in which to challenge an incumbent government .
Whoever is the GOP nominee , including Giuliani , must be turned into George W. Bush , and voters must be asked over and over again whether they want four more years of this , and whether the country can afford four more years of this .
It does n't matter that Democrats do n't deserve to win anything given their complicity in the Bush crimes and their pathetic attempts at crime prevention , when they make the attempt at all .
What matters is that the rest of us do n't deserve the equivalent of a third Bush term .
That must be stopped at all costs , even if that means four years of Hillary .
Which would likely not be as bad as it sounds , anyhow .
Never has there been a less principled , more malleable politician than Hillary Clinton , unless you count that other politician named Clinton .
If the left tugs hard , and if Congress is hugely Democratic - which it assuredly will be - we can actually expect some moderately progressive policies to miraculously emerge from Washington in the coming years , especially if an angry and vulnerable - feeling public demands them .
If that is n't compelling enough to get you feeling better than you do now , just imagine having to hear George Bush 's mangled words come out of Rudy Giuliani 's vicious face for the next four years for a point of comparative reference .
Even waterboarding looks good next to that .

Of the various ills the economy can face , inflation is simultaneously the worst for society as a whole , and yet the easiest for individuals to deal with successfully .
The strategies for dealing with inflation are pretty straightforward .
In theory , inflation should n't matter at all , as long as it is predictable .
If you know that inflation is going to be 10 % next year , you demand a 10 % raise ( and your boss gives it to you , because he knows that 10 % inflation means that the raise does n't cost him anything ) .
Everybody else does the same and prices , wages , interest rates , stock market returns , etc. are all 10 % higher , even though in real terms everyone is standing still .
In practice , of course , it is n't so simple :
Just because you demand a raise that matches inflation does n't mean you 'll get it .
When inflation is bad , prices go up every month ( maybe every week ) , but wages and salaries generally only go up once a year .
People are always feeling like they 're playing catch up .
Inflation is never really predictable .
Everybody has their own guess about what inflation will be , and most of them will be wrong .
Whether your estimate is high or low , you 'll have problems to the extent that you 're wrong .
Even if you 're wrong in a good way , such as having negotiated a 10 % raise when inflation turned out to only be 8 % , you 're still in trouble ( maybe your company has to lay you off ) .
Taxes are imposed on nominal returns , so you can find yourself in the perverse situation of losing money in real terms , and yet still paying taxes on supposed profits .
For individuals , the strategies for dealing with inflation are :
Be careful about holding cash .
This is a big change for people who have come of age since 1981 or so -- since then , holding cash has been a perfectly reasonable thing to do .
People whose saving and investing experience includes the 1970s , though , remember having a bank account that was earning 5 % interest rates that was nevertheless worth 5 % less at the end of the year .
Do n't make long - term , fixed rate loans .
Until the inflationary period is over , do n't buy bonds .
High inflation rates completely destroy the value of long - term bonds .
The flip side of this is that borrowing money on a long - term , fixed rate basis ( such as a mortgage ) can make good sense , if you can get good rate .
There are a lot of people who bought a house with a 30 - year mortgage at a fixed 6 % or 7 % and held as rates went up to 14 % or higher .
They made out like bandits .
Invest in " stuff " rather than in money .
This can be gold ( although I 'd hesitate to establish a position at these prices ) .
Even better is stuff that you 're going to use anyway .
If you 're going to use it anyway , and you can get it at a good price now , it makes a great deal of sense to buy stuff now , rather than save cash and then buy it later .
Invest for long - term capital gains .
Inflation tends to produce illusory profits : you look like you 're making a profit even when you 're just keeping up with ( or even failing to keep up with ) inflation -- and you have to pay taxes on those profits .
This makes investing for income ( where a large fraction of the income is really just keeping you even with inflation ) a bad deal .
It also makes short - term capital gains a bad deal for much the same reason -- you have a big ( taxable ) gain , even if in reality you 're just breaking even .
Investing for long - term capital gains helps with these issues .
Use barter and the informal economy .
If your neighbor hires you to help him create a website and you hire him to help you cut down a diseased tree next to your driveway , you both owe income taxes on whatever you 're paid .
If you instead swap these services informally , you still owe the taxes , but you 're expected to declare the income at its fair market value .
It 's perfectly reasonable , though , to declare the income at what the service would have been worth the previous year .
For businesses , the strategies are similar , except that it 's possible to greatly expand on that last point -- use barter and the informal economy -- by vertically integrating the company so that the steps of producing your product are all internal transfers rather than cash transactions with another company .
If company A produces raw materials , company B refines them , company C builds sub-assemblies , company D makes consumer goods , company E ships them , company F wholesales them , and company G sells them to consumers at retail , imagine what happens as inflation forces prices up at each step along the way -- producing illusory profits that each company has to pay taxes on .
On the other hand , if one company handles the entire production chain , the only cash transactions are things like salaries and rents -- that can be fixed for a year at a time .
All the other transactions can be dealt with as an internal accounting matter , with no taxes due .
In addition to vertically integrating , it also makes sense for businesses to reverse the trend toward outsourcing -- instead of paying someone else to haul the trash away ( a taxable transaction ) , haul your own trash away ( an internal transfer that does n't incur any taxes ) .
Likewise , in - source anything you can -- accounting , legal , maintenance , facilities , etc .
Damage to the economy
Inflation works its harm on the economy in several different ways .
None of them are really due to the inflation itself , which is why economists always insist on pointing out that mere inflation does little harm .
The harm is done , though .
It 's just one step removed .
We 've already talked about the damage done when taxes are owed on the illusory profits on transactions that were break - even or worse .
This drains money out of the economy at every transaction .
The government can mitigate this harm in several different ways ( cutting tax rates being the easiest , but also through any of a large variety of tax indexing or tax rebate schemes , special allowances , deductions , credits , etc. ) , but the capricious nature of where the harm lands ( on transactions between parties , rather than on the economic activity itself ) produces perverse incentives to agglomerate businesses together .
This is not invariably bad , but it is often bad -- you generally get maximum efficiency when each entity specializes , but you do n't get enough efficiency to outweigh the tax disadvantages when inflation rates are high .
Another way that inflation hurts the economy is that governments are highly prone to try to attack the symptom of inflation ( rising prices ) rather than the cause ( money becoming less valuable ) .
The usual tactics are price controls , wage controls , and various kinds of tax policies designed to punish wage and price increases ( or reward companies that " hold the line " on prices and wages ) .
These all harm the economy , because the price changes are just symptoms .
All price ceilings do is produce shortages , because the market does n't stop functioning just because the government creates a rule .
The third big way that inflation harms the economy is that it creates uncertainty .
The " positive " effects of inflation ( increasing business activity ) only come when inflation is higher than expected , so inflation rates tend to keep rising until they get so high that the negative effects become unbearable , at which point inflation gets ground out of the economy through a recession .
Since no one knows just when that recession is coming or how bad it will be , people tend to be more cautious .
The result is slower growth , less long - term thinking , and less long - term investment .
Ending inflation
Governments ( through the central bank ) cause inflation , and governments can end it anytime they want , by ensuring that the money supply does n't grow faster than the economy .
But , of course , it 's not that easy .
First , nobody knows how big either the money supply or the economy actually is , and the tools for controlling it are blunt instruments .
There are statistics that give people a clue about how big each was as of a few months ago , but that 's only a partial indication and it 's already out of date .
Back in the 1970s economists liked to use the analogy of driving a car while looking in the rear - view mirror by alternately stomping on the accelerator and then on the brake .
Second , if the money supply has already outstripped the growth in the economy ( which it has , for many years now ) , then the effects will inevitably work their way through the economy , producing however much inflation is necessary to bring things back into balance , no matter what the central bank does now .
Still , all periods of higher inflation end .
Some end with the inflation rate coming back down to the rate where it does n't do much harm to the economy ( basically , to where it 's small enough that things like changes in relative prices and changes in standards of living are more important than inflation , and the inflation component just vanishes in the noise of the economy ) .
Others end with hyperinflation making the money worthless , at which point it is replaced with something else .
Based on the experience in the US so far and the current situation , I do n't think the hyperinflation scenario is likely .
So that means that your strategies for living with inflation need to handle the situation where money supply growth slows and the inflation rate drops -- a scenario that usually involves a recession .
Once the central bank moves to stop inflation in a serious way you need to turn around the strategies you used for surviving it and instead prepare for a recession .
Abstract Background Forthright reporting of financial ties and conflicts of interest of researchers is associated with public trust in and esteem for the scientific enterprise .
Methods / Principal Findings
We searched Lexis / Nexis Academic News for the top news stories in science published in 2004 and 2005 .
We conducted a content analysis of 1152 newspaper stories .
Funders of the research were identified in 38 % of stories , financial ties of the researchers were reported in 11 % of stories , and 5 % reported financial ties of sources quoted .
Of 73 stories not reporting on financial ties , 27 % had financial ties publicly disclosed in scholarly journals .
Conclusions / Significance
Because science journalists often did not report conflict of interest information , adherence to gold - standard recommendations for science journalism was low .
Journalists work under many different constraints , but nonetheless news reports of scientific research were incomplete , potentially eroding public trust in science .

Introduction Despite the rise of electronic media , the print news media continue to provide an important source of science news to the lay public [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
In fact , because the news media influence public opinion , the press is often used strategically by researchers seeking attention and funding [ 3 ] , and by advocates seeking policy change [ 4 ] .
The lay press is also an important source of information on new research for the scientific community [ 5 ] .
When scientific research is reported in the lay press , important information regarding context and methods is often lost [ 6 ] .
A study of science news in three leading papers found the omission of research methods to be a steady problem over three decades [ 7 ] .
Science journalism also often fails to describe the limitations of the study , funding sources supporting the research , or financial conflicts of interests of investigators [ 2 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
Reporting funding sources , financial ties of investigators , and study limitations are important because of potential conflicts of interest .
Many scholars agree that the type of conflict of interest most likely to affect the public 's trust is a financial conflict where the scientist might gain financially as a result of a particular research outcome [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
Financial ties of investigators with their sponsors ( e.g. stock ownership and consulting income ) are associated with the reporting of favorable research results and conclusions for the sponsor [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
Moreover , financial ties between researchers and their corporate sponsors are increasing in prevalence and magnitude [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
Biased research can be intentional or unintentional [ 19 ] , and can result from damaged objectivity at multiple stages in the research process , including conceptualization of the question , design of the research , conduct of the research , or publication ( or not ) of the research [ 20 ] .
For these reasons , many scientific journals are now requiring that authors disclose financial ties and potential conflicts of interest [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
Previous studies of health care journalism do not fully examine the reporting of conflicts of interest , instead focusing on the accuracy of the data being reported .
One study of lay press reports assessed 60 health care stories and developed an instrument for scoring the quality of reporting , considering whether the report contains errors of omission in descriptions of the research and methods , or is otherwise misleading about the credibility of sources [ 24 ] .
Similarly , a review of health news identified “ bias and conflicts of interest ” as a problem area in reporting , and suggested that readers be told explicitly if researchers and funders could financially benefit from the results [ 25 ] .
A study of 207 news stories on new drug therapies found that 85 percent cited experts with financial ties to the drug manufacturer , but that only about one - third of these reported the relationship [ 26 ] .
The few studies to date suggest that there is little reporting on financial conflicts of interest in clinical research .
In addition , few studies have examined how new developments in basic science are reported in the media , with some attention to financial ties .
A study of 228 media stories on genetics found that 13 % of stories mentioned funding sources for the research and 3 % mentioned how the investigator could financially benefit from the discovery [ 27 ] .
The same research team interviewed scientists and science journalists and found that they mistrust each other greatly , and that one solution would be to regularly but responsibly disclose financial conflicts of interest [ 28 ] .
Problems of conflicts of interest in science are themselves occasionally the subjects of news stories , usually with negative connotations that fuel a suspicion of science among the public [ 29 ] .
Forthright discussions of financial ties and conflicts of interest among researchers and funders are associated with public trust and public esteem of the scientific enterprise [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
Our study examines science journalism covering the most important developments in basic science , clinical research , and engineering from 2004 and 2005 .
We sought to describe how print media reported new scientific findings over a two - year period , and how funding and financial ties of researchers were reported .
Methods
Our objective was to determine the extent and nature of reporting of conflicts of interest and research in clinical , engineering , and basic science .
We conducted a content analysis of 1152 newspaper stories according to the methods described below .
Search strategy
We first identified the topics of top news stories in science from the past five years according to year - end lists published in four journals : Discovery , Scientific American , Popular Science , and Science .
We excluded topics not relevant to basic science , clinical studies , and engineering , and then took the top fifteen topics for our study .
These included global warming , nanotechnology , stem cells , gamma ray , new matter , and ten others ( Table 1 ) .

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001266.t001
We searched Lexis / Nexis Academic News , which contains full - text news from a source list of about 260 different United States major and regional newspapers and wire services , for stories on these topics from 2004 and 2005 .
Some of the topics were overly broad as search terms , so they were paired with the word “ study ” or “ research ” in order to find relevant stories describing new studies .
We searched “ US News ” for each of the four regions in the database : Midwest , Northeast , Southeast , and West from January 1 , 2004 to November 30 , 2005 ( when the searching began ) .
This yielded over 9800 hits on news stories .
We included news stories from any section but excluded obituaries , book reviews , editorials , and other items not reporting science research .
We then conducted stratified sampling by randomly selecting 100 stories from each of the 15 topics , although several topics yielded fewer than 100 hits , and so all the stories were included ( Table 1 ) .
After eliminating any duplicates , our final sample consisted of 1152 news stories on the top 15 topics in new science and medicine research .
Data extraction for content analysis of media stories
Three different coders divided the total set of stories .
Our coders were an advanced graduate student , a postdoctoral fellow , and an assistant professor .
Working from a hard copy of the news item , we entered the information into a qualitative data software package .
For each story we noted 20 characteristics : title , author , newspaper , length , section of newspaper , date , topic , category ( basic , clinical , engineering ) , funder of research , financial tie reported for investigators who conducted study , type of financial tie , company with the tie , whose tie , amount of tie , sources quoted , type of financial ties of source quoted , which source with tie , amount of source tie , how the research was portrayed ( positive towards the new finding , neutral , critical ) , and how the financial ties were portrayed .
We also had extra fields for research notes and financial tie notes .
Any discrepancies were discussed and resolved by the three coders and the principal investigator .
Below we report the descriptive statistics from this study .
Determining concordance between reporting of financial ties in media stories and related scientific journal articles
We determined whether the information on funding sources for the study and financial ties of researchers was readily available to journalists .
We conducted a stratified random sample of 1020 newspaper stories that did not report any financial tie information .
Using a random number generator , we selected 112 media stories , representing most of our 15 categories .
Of these , we were able to obtain the citation information for 73 scientific journal articles that were reported in the 112 stories .
We searched PubMed and Google for the scientific journal articles that were mentioned in these media stories .
We then examined these journal articles for disclosures of research funding and statements regarding financial ties of the authors .
Discussion Reporting financial ties of researchers was limited .
Because of the importance of high - quality reporting in science , The Commonwealth Fund publishes a “ Tipsheet for Reporting on Drugs , Devices and Medical Technologies , ” [ 38 ] .
This is arguably a comprehensive “ gold standard ” checklist for responsible reporting of new medical therapy , and could be applied to all scientific findings .
The Tipsheet recommends that reporters consider seven items : the potential benefits , potential harms , sources of information and their financial ties , strength of evidence , historical context , possible alternatives , and costs related to new treatments .
Our study results are relevant to the third “ tip , ” that reporters should determine the links between sources of information and those who stand to gain from promoting the new research .
We found that information about funders , financial ties , and other conflicts of interest seldom appear in the news story , even when the information is clearly available to the journalist .
While the Tipsheet was designed for clinical research news , we found that the reporting of potential conflicts of interest was similarly infrequent across the categories of research ; stories about basic science , clinical research , and engineering were all incomplete .
New developments in basic science and engineering can have significant impacts on the public similar to clinical research describing new therapies .
Furthermore , the vast majority of reporting on new research was favorable or neutral suggesting that readers of the news stories would not be very critical of the research .
Yet financial tie information was reported in only about 10 % of science news stories .
Inclusion of financial tie information in media stories may make readers more skeptical because evidence suggests financial disclosures in scientific articles makes readers more critical of the results [ 39 ] .
If the sources really had no financial ties , this should also be communicated to readers in order to promote more informed judgment of the science research .
Certainly , journalists face various constraints and barriers while reporting science news .
For example , they may confront editorial controls , word limits , time limits and deadlines , and most importantly the facts about sources with financial ties may be difficult to discover .
One source of financial tie information about researchers is from scientific journals , but a recent survey found that just 33 % of scientific journals have a clear policy on disclosure , with engineering journals having the least disclosure [ 21 ] .
In our study , we were able to locate financial disclosures in the cited journal articles just 27 % of the time .
However , even when information on financial ties of researchers was obtainable from the underlying scientific journal article , this information did not make it into the media story .
Furthermore , our definition of financial ties was very broad to include research funding .
Journals from all disciplines routinely report the funding sources of research studies .
Yet funding information , including government and public sources , was reported in less than two - fifths of stories .
Information about the financial ties of researchers is relevant and important to the consumers of the news
As more scientific journals adopt financial disclosure standards , information about funding , financial ties and conflicts of interest is becoming increasingly available to the journalists who report the news .
We urge science journalists to incorporate the Commonwealth Fund recommendations and to consider such information one important piece of the news story .

A generation of " multitasking " children are living their daily lives - including eating and falling asleep - to the accompaniment of television , according to a survey of youngsters ' media habits .
The flickering of the screen accompanies most of them before they go to school , when they return home , as they consume their evening meal and then - for 63 % , far more than read a book each day - in bed at night .
The study of five - to 16 - year - olds shows that four out of five children now have a TV set in their bedroom .
So ubiquitous has television become that many children now combine it with other activities , including social networking online , flicking their eyes from laptop to TV screen and back again .
Even if they are focusing on the television , young people are now reluctant to commit to one programme , with boys in particular often flipping between channels to keep up with two simultaneous shows at once .
The findings , from the market research agency Childwise , will fuel concerns that childhood is increasingly about private space and sedentary activities and less about play , social interaction or the child 's own imagination .
The government 's recent Children 's Plan , while attempting to calm panic over claims of " toxic " childhood , focused on improving play facilities as a means of ensuring a more balanced life for screen - bound youngsters .
Today 's survey findings indicate a revival in television - watching among children after three years of decline , driven mainly by more girls watching soaps such as Hollyoaks and EastEnders .
Internet use - now that the social networking bug is biting younger than ever - is also continuing to grow at a far greater rate than the brief fall - off in TV viewing .
That means British children spend an average of five hours and 20 minutes in front of a screen a day , up from four hours and 40 minutes five years ago .
The rise may have come at the expense of reading books for pleasure , which , in a development that will alarm many parents , continues to decline as a regular pastime .
While four out of five children read books in their own time , only a quarter do so daily and 53 % at least once a week .
The report , based on interviews with 1,147 children in 60 schools around England , Scotland and Wales , found television viewing now averages 2.6 hours a day across the age group , though one in 10 say they watch more than four hours daily .
The survey , which has been conducted annually for 14 years , asked for the first time whether children watched television while eating dinner or in bed before going to sleep .
It found that 58 % watch during their evening meal , while 63 % lie in bed watching the screen ( rising to almost three - quarters of 13 to 16 - year - olds ) .
Two - thirds - particularly the youngest children - watch before school , and 83 % turn on the television after returning home .
Rosemary Duff , Childwise research director , said television was now " almost woven into children 's lives " , but added that the quality of viewing had changed .
" A lot of television viewing has lost the ' pay it attention ' feel it used to have .
It used to be less ubiquitous but much higher in its importance whereas now it is widespread but just part of the background , not just at home but wherever you go . "
The Simpsons remains children 's favourite programme for the third year running , followed by EastEnders , Hollyoaks and Tracy Beaker , but viewing is fragmented with few " must see " shows .
Anecdotal evidence indicated that children now multitask , keeping one eye on the television as they flick through magazines or use the computer , Duff added .
Boys asked by the company to choose between programmes on different channels frequently refused , saying they would " watch both " .
" They flick from one to another and cannot conceive that they should have to make a decision .
They are puzzled that you should put them in a situation of having to make one or anther choice . "
Computers are also now a key part of children 's private worlds .
" The internet is now an essential part of most young people 's lives , " says the study , with 85 % of five to 16 - year - olds accessing the net , and over a third ( including a quarter of five to six - year - olds ) owning a computer or laptop of their own .
On average , they go online just over four times a week , spending two hours each time .
The survey shows a rise in internet use , particularly among younger children , driven primarily by a boom in the use of social networking sites , primarily Bebo .
Communication , says the report , " has overtaken fun ( eg online games ) as the main reason to use the internet and study is now far behind " .
Almost three quarters ( 72 % ) of children have visited a social networking site , and over half have set up their own profile - sometimes lying about their age to sidestep minimum age safeguards .
Children as young as eight are now signing up .
Kathy Evans , policy director of the Children 's Society , which is conducting its own inquiry into modern childhood , said there was now " mounting public and professional concern about the potential impact of children 's TV and internet viewing habits " .
The inquiry will report next month on children and technology as part of its two - year investigation .
The ear was created in the lab from cells
Stelarc on his ear
Cyprus- born Stelios Arcadiou , known as Stelarc , says his extra ear , made of human cartilage , is an augmentation of the body 's form .
But surgeons questioned whether such an operation should have been carried out , given the absence of clinical need .
A patient who had similar surgery to correct a birth defect said she found the artist 's work offensive .
He views this as art but I personally find it offensive
Sasha Gardner , who was born with one ear missing
Stelarc , aged 61 , said it had taken him years to find a surgeon prepared to perform the operation .
The ear does not function , but he hopes to have a microphone implanted to allow others to listen to what his extra ear picks up .
He presented his work to a UK audience at Newcastle 's Centre for Life .
Art ?
Reality TV star and model Sasha Gardner was born with one ear missing and recently took the first steps to have plastic surgery to rebuild the ear .
She said : " He views this as art but I personally find it offensive .
It is a very sensitive subject for a lot of people .
" This is not something people should be using as an expression of art .
It shows a lack of understanding . "
Mr Francis Wells is a surgeon at Papworth Hospital who has helped an artist make a map of " The Sonic Body " , by revealing its sounds , from veins to organs and muscles .
He said : " This will provoke a reaction .
I would not condemn him for it , but it could cause some people distress .
" There are a lot of people who have lost an ear in an accident who cannot easily have that ear replaced .
This type of reconstruction is expensive . "
Mr David Gault , consultant plastic surgeon and member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons , said surgery is normally performed for obvious clinical or psychological benefit .
" Patients have had ears moved onto the forearm and then grafted on to the head before , so this is not something that is technically new .
" It is also possible that the publicity will do some good - if it prompts patients who are missing an ear to seek help that they had not realised was available . "
â€ œThe new capitalist gods must love the poor â€ “ they are making so many more of them .â€ Bill Bonner , â€ œThe Daily Reckoningâ€ 
â€ œThe hope of every central bank is that the real problem can be kept from public view .
The truth is that the public --- even professionals on Wall Street --- have no clue what the real problem is .
They know it has something to do with derivatives , but none of them realize that itâ€™s more than a $ 20 trillion mountain of unfunded , unregulated paper that has just been discovered to not have a market and , therefore , no real valueâ€ ¦
When the dollar realizes the seriousness of the situation --- be that now or sometime soon --- the bottom will drop out .â€ Jim Sinclair , Investment analyst
About a month ago , I wrote an article â€ œStock Market Brushfire :
Will there be a run on the banks ? â€ which showed how the collapse in the housing market and the deterioration in mortgage - backed bonds ( CDOs ) in the secondary market was creating difficulties for the banking system .
Now these problems are becoming more apparent .
From the Wall Street Journal :
â€ œThe rising interbank lending rates are a proxy of sorts for the increased risk that some banks , somewhere , may go belly up.â€ ( Editorial ; WSJ , 9-6-07 )
Ironically , the WSJ editorial staffâ€ ” - which normally defends deregulation and laissez faire economics " tooth - n - nail " --- is now calling for regulators to make sure they are â€œon top of the banks they are supposed to be regulating , so we donâ€™t get any surprise bank failures that spook the markets and confirm the worst fears being whispered about.â€ 
â€ œSurprise bank failures ?â€ 
Henry
Liu sums it up like this in his article , " The Rise of the non - bank system " --- required reading for anyone who wants to understand why a stock market crash is imminent :
â€ œBanks worldwide now reportedly face risk exposure of US $ 891 billion in asset - backed commercial paper facilities ( ABCP ) due to callable bank credit agreements with borrowers designed to ensure ABCP investors are paid back when the short - term debt matures , even if banks cannot sell new ABCP on behalf of the issuing companies to roll over the matured debt because the market views the assets behind the paper as of uncertain market value .
This signifies that the crisis is no longer one of liquidity , but of deteriorating creditworthiness systemwide that restoring liquidity alone cannot cure .
The liquidity crunch is a symptom , not the disease .
The disease is a decade of permissive tolerance for credit abuse in which the banks , regulators and rating agencies were willing accomplices . "
( Henry Liu , â€ The Rise of the Non-bank Systemâ€ , Asia Times )
That 's right ; nearly $ 1 trillion in worthless asset - backed paper is clogging the system putting the kybosh on the big private equity deals and spreading panic through the money markets .
It 's a slow - motion train wreck and there 's not a thing the Fed can do about it .
This is n't a liquidity problem that can be fixed by lowering the Fed 's fund rate and creating more easy credit .
This is a solvency crisis ; the underlying assets upon which this world of " structured finance " is built have no established market value , therefore --- as Jim Sinclair suggests --- they 're worthless .
That means that the trillions of dollars which have been leveraged against these shaky assets --- in the form of credit default swaps ( CDSs ) and numerous other bizarre - sounding derivatives --- will begin to cascade down wiping out trillions in market value .
How serious is it ?
Economist Liu puts it like this :
" Even if the Fed bails out the banks by easing bank reserve and capital requirements to absorb that massive amount , the raging forest fire in the non -bank financial system will still present finance capitalism with its greatest test in eight decades . "
OVERVIEW
Credit standards are tightening and banks are increasingly reluctant to loan money to each other not knowing who may be sitting on billions of dollars in toxic mortgage - backed debt .
( Collateralized debt obligations )
It makes no difference that the â€œunderlying economy is soundâ€ as Bernanke likes to say .
When banks hesitate to loan money to each other ; it shows that there is real uncertainty about the solvency of the other banks .
It slows down commerce and the gears on the economic machine begin to rust in place .
The banks woes have been exacerbated by the flight of investors from money market funds , many of which are backed by Mortgage - backed Securities ( MBS ) .
Wary investors are running for the safety of US Treasuries even though yields that have declined at a record pace .
This is causing problems in the Commercial Paper market as well as for the lesser - know SIVs and â€œconduitsâ€ .
These abstruse - sounding investment vehicles are the essential plumbing that maintains normalcy in the markets .
Commercial paper is a $ 2.2 trillion market .
When it shrinks by more than $ 200 billion --- as it has in the last 3 weeks -- the effects can be felt through the entire system .
The credit crunch has spread across the whole gamut of commercial paper and low - grade debt .
Banks are hoarding cash and refusing loans to even credit - worthy applicants .
The collapse in subprime loans is just part of the story .
More than 50 % of all mortgages in the last two years have been unconventional loansâ € ” no down payment , no verification of income â€ œno docâ€ , interest - only , negative amortization , piggyback , 2 - 28s , teaser rates , adjustable rate mortgages â€ œARMsâ€ .
All of these reflect the shoddy lending standards of the past few years and all are contributing to the unprecedented rate of defaults .
Now the banks are holding $ 300 billion of these " unmarketable " mortgage - backed CDOs and another $ 200 billion in equally - suspect CLOs .
( Collateralized loan obligations ; the CDOs corporate - twin ) .
Even more worrisome , the large investment banks have myriad â€œoff - bookâ€ operations which are in distress .
This has forced the banks to circle the wagons and reduce their issuance of loans which is accelerating the downturn in housing .
Typically , housing bubbles unwind very slowly over a 5 to 10 year period .
That wonâ€™t be the case this time .
The surge in inventory , the financial distress of many homeowners and the complete breakdown in loan - origination ( due to the growing credit crunch ) ensures that the housing market will crash - land sometime in late 2008 or early 2009 .
The banks are expected to write - off a considerable portion of their CDO - debt at the end of the 3rd Quarter rather than keep the losses on their books .
This will further hasten the decline in housing prices .
The banks are also suffering from the sudden sluggishness in leveraged buyouts ( LBOs ) .
Credit problems have slowed private equity deals to a dribble .
In July there were $ 579 billion in LBOs .
In August that number shrunk to a paltry $ 222 billion .
By September those figures will deteriorate to double - digits .
The big deals arenâ€™t getting done and debt is not rolling over .
More than $ 1 trillion in debt will have to be refinanced in the next 5 weeks .
In the present climate , that doesnâ€™t look likely .
Somethingâ€™s has got to give .
The market has frozen and the Fedâ€™s $ 60 billion repo-lifeline has done nothing to help .
In the first 7 months of 2007 , LBOs accounted for â€ œ$ 37 of every $ 100 spent on deals in the USâ€ .
37 % !
How will the financial giants make up for the windfall profits that these deals generated ?
Answer :
They wonâ€™t .
Just as they wonâ€™t make up for the enormous origination fees they made from â€œsecuritizingâ€ mortgages and selling them off to credulous pension funds , insurance companies and foreign banks .
As Steven Rattner of DLJ Merchant Banking said , â€ œItâ€™s become nearly impossible to finance a private equity transaction of over $ 1 billion .
â€ ( WSJ ) The Golden Era of Acquisitions and Mega - mergers is coming to an end .
We can expect that the financial giants will probably follow the same trajectory as the Dot.coms following the 2001 NASDAQ - rout .
The investment banks are also facing enormous potential losses from liabilities that â€œoperate off their balance sheetsâ€ 
In David Reillyâ€™s article â€ œConduit Risks are hovering over Citigroupâ€  ( WSJ 9 - 5- 07 ) Reilly points out that â€œbanks such as Citigroup Inc. could find themselves burdened by affiliated investment vehicles that issue tens of billions of dollars in short - term debt known as commercial paperâ€â€ ¦
Citigroup , for example , owns about 25 % of the market for SIVs , representing nearly $ 100 billion of assets under management .
The largest Citigroup SIV is Centauri Corp. , which had $ 21 billion in outstanding debt as of February 2007 , according to a Citigroup research report .
There is NO MENTION OF CENTAURI IN ITS 2006 ANNUAL FILING with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Yet some investors worry that if vehicles such as Centauri stumble , either failing to sell commercial paper or suffering severe losses in the assets it holds , Citibank could wind up having to help by lending funds to keep the vehicle operating or even taking on some lossesâ€ .
So , many investors donâ€™t know that Citigroup could be holding the bag for â€œ $ 21 billion in outstanding debtâ€ ?
Or , perhaps , the entire $ 100 billion is red ink ; who knows ?
( Citigroupâ€ ™s stock dropped by more than 2 % after this report appeared in the WSJ . )
Another report which appeared in CNN Money further adds to the suspicion that the banksâ€™ â€œbrokerage affiliatesâ€ may be in trouble :
â€ œThe Aug. 20 letters from the Fed to Citigroup and Bank of America state that the Fed , which regulates large parts of the U.S. financial system , has agreed to exempt both banks from rules that effectively limit the amount of lending that their federally - insured banks can do with their brokerage affiliates .
The exemption , which is temporary , means , for example , that Citigroup 's Citibank entity can substantially increase funding to Citigroup Global Markets , its brokerage subsidiary .
Citigroup and Bank of America requested the exemptions , according to the letters , to provide liquidity to those holding mortgage loans , mortgage - backed securities , and other securitiesâ€ ¦This unusual move by the Fed shows that the largest Wall Street firms are continuing to have problems funding operations during the current market difficulties .
â€ ( CNN Money )
Does this mean that the other large banks are involved in the same type of â€œhide - n - seekâ€ strategies ?
Sounds a lot like Enronâ€™s â€œoff - the - booksâ€ shenanigans , doesnâ€™t it ?
Wall Street Journal :
â€ œAny off - balance - sheet issues are traditionally POORLY DISCLOSED , so to some extent , you 're dependent on the insight that management is willing to provide you and that , frankly , is very limited , " says Mark Fitzgibbon , director of research at Sandler O'Neill & Partners.â€â€ ¦ ..
Accounting rules DONâ€™T REQUIRE BANKS TO SEPARATELY RECORD ANYTHING RELATED TO THE RISK that they will have to loan the entities money to keep them functioning during a markets crisis.â€â€¦.â€ 
The vehicles ( SIVs and conduits ) ARE OFTEN ESTABLISHED IN A TAX HAVEN AND ARE RUN SOLEY FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES AS OPPOSED TO TYPICAL CORPORATE ACTIVITIES.â€
Still think the banks are on solid ground ?
â€ œCitigroup , the nation 's largest bank as measured by market value and assets .
Its latest financial results showed that it administers off - balance - sheet , conduit vehicles used to issue commercial paper that have assets of about $ 77 BILLION .
Citigroup is also affiliated with structured investment vehicles , or SIVs that have " nearly $ 100 billion " in assets , according to a letter Citigroup wrote to some investors in these vehicles last month.â€ ( IBID )
Yes ; and how many of these â€œassetsâ€ are in fact cooperate debt , auto loans , credit card debt , and student loans that have been securitized and are now under extreme pressure in a slumping market ?
In an â€œup marketâ€  loans can provide a valuable income - stream that that transforms someone elseâ€™s debt into a valuable asset .
In a down - market , however , defaults can wipe out trillions in market capitalization overnight .
HOW DID WE GET INTO THIS MESS ?
More than 20 years of dogged lobbying from the financial industry paid off with the repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act which was passed by Congress following the 1929 stock market crash .
The bill was written to limit the conflicts of interest when commercial banks are permitted to underwrite stocks or bonds .
The financial industry whittled away at Glass - Steagall for years before finally breaking down its regulatory restrictions in August 1987 , Alan Greenspan -- formerly a director of J.P. Morgan and a proponent of banking deregulation -- became chairman of the Federal Reserve Board .
â€ œIn 1990 , J.P. Morgan became the first bank to receive permission from the Federal Reserve to underwrite securities , so long as its underwriting business does not exceed the 10 percent limit .
In December 1996 , with the support of Chairman Alan Greenspan , the Federal Reserve Board issues a precedent - shattering decision permitting bank holding companies to own investment bank affiliates with up to 25 percent of their business in securities underwriting ( up from 10 percent ) .
This expansion of the loophole created by the Fed 's 1987 reinterpretation of Section 20 of Glass - Steagall effectively rendered Glass - Steagall obsolete.â€ ( â€ œ The Long Demise of Glass Steagall , Frontline , PBS )
In 1999 , after 25 years and $ 300 million of lobbying efforts , Congress aided by President Bill Clinton , finally repealed Glass - Steagall .
This paved the way for the problems we are now facing .
Another contributing factor to the current banking - muddle is the Basel rules .
According to the BIS ( Bank of International Settlements ) website :
â€ œThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision provides a forum for regular cooperation on banking supervisory matters .
Its objective is to enhance understanding of key supervisory issues and improve the quality of banking supervision worldwide .
It seeks to do so by exchanging information on national supervisory issues , approaches and techniques , with a view to promoting common understanding .
At times , the Committee uses this common understanding to develop guidelines and supervisory standards in areas where they are considered desirable .
In this regard , the Committee is best known for its international standards on capital adequacy ; the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision ; and the Concordat on cross - border banking supervision.â€ 
The Basel Committee on Banking ( Basel 2 ) requires â€œbanks to boost the capital they hold in reserve against the loans on their books.â€ 
Sounds like a good thing , doesnâ€™t it ?
This protects the overall financial system as well as the individual depositor .
Unfortunately , the banks found a way to circumvent the rules for minimum reserves by â€œsecuritizingâ€ pools of mortgages ( MBS ) rather than holding individual mortgages .
( which called for more reserves )
This provided lavish origination and distribution fees for banks , but shifted much of the risk of default to Wall Street investors .
Now , the banks are saddled with roughly $ 300 billion in mortgage - backed debt ( CDOs ) that no one wants and it is uncertain whether they have sufficient reserves to cover their losses .
By October , we should know how this will all play out .
As David Wessel points out in â€ œNew Bank Capital requirements helped to Spread Credit Woesâ€ :
â€ œBanks now behave more like securities firms , more likely to mark down the value of assets when market prices fall --- even to distressed levels --- rather than sitting on bad loans for a decade and pretending theyâ€™ll be paid back.â€ 
The downside of this is that once that banks write off these toxic MBSs and CDOs ; the hedge funds , insurance companies and pension funds will be forced to do the same ---- dumping boatloads of this bond - sludge on the market driving down prices and triggering a panic - sell - off .
This is what the Fed is trying to prevent through its $ 60 billion repo-bailout .
Regrettably , the Fed cannot hope to remove half - trillion of bad debt from the balance sheets of the banks or forestall the collapse of related financial institutions and funds which are loaded with these â€œunmarketableâ€ time - bombs .
Besides , most of the mortgage derivatives ( CDOs ) have been massively enhanced with low interest leverage from the â€œcarry tradeâ€ .
When the value of these CDOs is finally determined --- which we expect will happen sometime before the end of the 3rd Quarterâ € ” we can expect the stock market to fall sharply and the housing recession to turn into a full - blown economic crisis .
ALAN GREENSPAN : THE FIFTH HORSEMAN ?
So , whoâ€™s to blame ?
The finger - pointing has already begun and more and more people are beginning to see how this massive economy - busting equity bubble originated at the Federal Reserve --- it is the logical corollary of former Fed-chief Alan Greenspan 's â€œeasy moneyâ€ policies .
Henry C K Liu sums up Greenspanâ€™s tenure at the Fed in his article â€ œWhy the Subprime Bust will Spreadâ€ :
â€ œGreenspan presided over the greatest expansion of speculative finance in history , including a trillion - dollar hedge - fund industry , bloated Wall Street - firm balance sheets approaching $ 2 trillion , a $ 3.3 trillion repo ( repurchase agreement ) market , and a global derivatives market with notional values surpassing an unfathomable $ 220 trillion .
On Greenspan 's 18 - year watch , assets of US government - sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) ballooned 830 % , from $ 346 billion to $ 2.872 trillion .
GSEs are financing entities created by the US Congress to fund subsidized loans to certain groups of borrowers such as middle - and low - income homeowners , farmers and students .
Agency mortgage - backed securities ( MBSs ) surged 670 % to $ 3.55 trillion .
Outstanding asset - backed securities ( ABSs ) exploded from $ 75 billion to more than $ 2.7 trillion .
â€  ( Henry Liu , â€ œWhy the Subprime Bust will Spreadâ€ , Asia Times )
" The greatest expansion of speculative finance in history " .
That says it all .
But no one makes the case against Greenspan better than Greenspan himself .
Here are some of his comments at the Federal Reserve Systemâ€™s Fourth Annual Community Affairs Research Conference , Washington , D.C. April 8 , 2005 .
They show that Greenspan â€œrubber stampedâ€ every one of the policies which have since metastasized and spread through the entire US economy .
Greenspan : Champion of Subprime loans :
â€ œInnovation has brought about a multitude of new products , such as subprime loans and niche credit programs for immigrants .
Such developments are representative of the market responses that have driven the financial services industry throughout the history of our country .
With these advance in technology , lenders have taken advantage of credit - scoring models and other techniques for efficiently extending credit to a broader spectrum of consumers.â€ 
Greenspan : Main Proponent of Toxic CDOs
â€ œThe development of a broad - based secondary market for mortgage loans also greatly expanded consumer access to credit .
By reducing the risk of making long - term , fixed - rate loans and ensuring liquidity for mortgage lenders , the secondary market helped stimulate widespread competition in the mortgage business .
The mortgage - backed security helped create a national and even an international market for mortgages , and market support for a wider variety of home mortgage loan products became commonplace .
This led to securitization of a variety of other consumer loan products , such as auto and credit card loans.â€ 
Greenspan : Supporter of Loans to People with Bad Credit
â€ œWhere once more - marginal applicants would simply have been denied credit , lenders are now able to quite efficiently judge the risk posed by individual applicants and to price that risk appropriately .
These improvements have led to the rapid growth in SUBPRIME mortgage lendingâ€ ¦fostering constructive innovation that is both responsive to market demand and beneficial to consumers.â€ 
â€ œImproved access to credit for consumers , and especially these more - recent developments , has had significant benefits .
Unquestionably , innovation and deregulation have vastly expanded credit availability to virtually all income classes .
Access to credit has enabled families to purchase homes , deal with emergencies , and obtain goods and services .
Home ownership is at a record high , and the number of home mortgage loans to low - and moderate - income and minority families has risen rapidly over the past five years .
Credit cards and installment loans are also available to the vast majority of householdsâ€ 
Greenspan : Big Fan of â€ œStructural Changesâ€ which increase Consumer Debt
As we reflect on the evolution of consumer credit in the United States , we must conclude that innovation and structural change in the financial services industry have been critical in providing expanded access to credit for the vast majority of consumers , including those of limited means .
Without these forces , it would have been impossible for lower - income consumers to have the degree of access to credit markets that they now have .
This fact underscores the importance of our roles as policymakers , researchers , bankers , and consumer advocates in fostering constructive innovation that is both responsive to market demand and beneficial to consumers .
â€ ( Federal Reserve Chairman , Alan Greenspan ; Federal Reserve Systemâ€™s Fourth Annual Community Affairs Research Conference , Washington , D.C. April 8 , 2005 )
Greenspanâ€™s own words are the most powerful indictment against him .
They show that he played a central role in our impending disaster .
The effort on the part of media pundits , talking heads , and so - called experts to foist the blame on the rating agencies , predatory lenders or gullible mortgage applicants misses the point entirely .
The problems began at the Federal Reserve and thatâ€™s where the responsibility lies .

A Multi-perspective Analysis of the Storm ( Peacomm ) Worm
Phillip Porras , Hassen Saidi , and Vinod Yegneswaran
Computer Science Laboratory , SRI International
Since early 2007 a new form of malware has made its presence known on the Internet by its prolific growth rate , its ability to distribute large volumes of spam , and its ability to avoid detection and eradication .
Storm Worm ( or W32 .
Peacomm , Nuwar , Tibs , Zhelatin ) , as it is known , is a highly prolific new generation of malware that has gained a significant foothold in unsuspecting Microsoft Windows computers across the Internet .
Storm , like all bots , distinguishes itself from other forms of malware ( viruses , Trojan horses , worms ) by its ability to establish a control channel that allows its infected clients to operate as a coordinated collective , or botnet .
However , even among botnets Storm has further distinguished itself by being among the first to introduce a fully P2P control channel , to utilize fast - flux to hide its binary distribution points , and to aggressively defend itself from those who would seek to reverse engineer its logic .
Despite all the hype and paranoia surrounding Storm , the inner workings of this botnet largely remain a mystery .
Indeed , Storm is believed to have an automated distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) feature to dissuade reverse engineering , which gets triggered based on situational awareness gathered from its overlay network , e.g. , when the count of spurious probes crosses a certain threshold .
It has also been reported that these defenses have been turned on those that have posted their analysis results of Storm .
In this paper , we attempt to partially address voids in our collective understanding of Storm by providing a multi-perspective analysis of various Storm clients .
Our analysis includes a static dissection of the malware binary and the characteristics of the Storm worm 's network dialog as observed from multiple infection traces .
Finally , we do not only seek to analyze Storm for the greater understanding , but also to develop solutions that can help detect its presence , even as we expect Storm to continue to evolve and elude host security products .
In this report we present our modifications to SRI 's BotHunter FREE botclient detection system .
We explain how BotHunter has been augmented tohunt for Storm infections , as well as other forms of spambot infections .
SC07
One topic - even more so than cheap shrimp - dominated this year 's Supercomputing conference in Reno : Accelerators .
The server and chip industries have felt the rise of the accelerator coming for some time .
Last year 's conference , for example , had the hardware heads pitted against the coders .
The software set wondered if enough developers would ever exist to write custom code for tricky FPGAs and GPGPUs ( general purpose graphics processors ) .
The hardware crowd countered such skepticism by forcing pitches about their super silicon down the throats of anyone who showed even a faint sign of interest in the technology .
Meanwhile , customers in the financial services , oil and gas and media markets hoped these two sides would work out their differences .
They want dramatic performance gains , and they want them now .
Reno 's monument to cheap shrimp
Much of the reticence around the server accelerators vanished at Supercomputing ' 07 .
Yes , the software folks still have their concerns .
And , yes , grizzled veterans complain that they 've seen accelerator fads come and go .
Ultimately , however , it 's clear to us that enough big vendors , ISVs , start - ups and customers have coalesced around the accelerator idea to push the technology forward in a profound way .
So , let 's take a look at a number of the accelerator options out there from both the hardware and software sides and try to see where things stand .
ClearSpeed - The Floater
ClearSpeed is one of the more mature accelerator players in the server market , having specialized in speeding up floating point operations for some time .
The start - up enjoys strong ties to companies such as HP and Sun Microsystems and has its accelerator cards sitting in a couple of the world 's top supercomputers .
At Supercomputing , ClearSpeed rolled out a new , complete accelerator system that complements the company 's X620 and e620 cards , which plug into PCI -X and PCIe slots .
The CATS ( ClearSpeed Accelerated Terrascale System ) unit takes up 1U of rack space and can reach up to a Teraflop .
ClearSpeed manages to cram 12 of the e620 cards into the CATS box , leaving a system that should cost around $ 70,000 .
For the moment , ClearSpeed will sell the CATS units in limited volumes .
The company hopes to see larger OEMs offer the product during 2008 .
During a demonstration , ClearSpeed linked 12 of the CATS units with an HP ProLiant DL360 server .
It then sent all 144 of its 96 - core CSX600 chips at the quantum chemistry code Molpro and reached 11.6 Teraflops while consuming about 6.6 kW of power ( 550 watts per CATS node ) .
( ClearSpeed hits this kind of performance on the back of its CSX600 chip , which can show 25 gigaflops of sustained 64 - bit computing .
Two of the chips sit on each e620 card . )
Most of ClearSpeed 's critics whine about the amount of software work that needs to be done to port a floating point - heavy application over to these custom chips .
ClearSpeed has worked hard to rebuff these claims .
Herding CATS
For one , it notes that a number of applications such as Matlab and Mathematica can run on the CSX600 chips without any changes to the underlying code thanks to work done by ClearSpeed and the software makers and the presence of friendly ClearSpeed libraries .
ClearSpeed also continues to work on its core software package , which is meant to ease the porting process for customers and partners .
It has released a beta of Version 3.0 that includes support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 64 - bit and Suse Linux Enterprise Server 10 64 - bit .
In addition , customers will find support for a wider range of BLAS and LAPACK functions , new library functions and a preview of an Eclipse IDE .
Another nice feature in the ClearSpeed software is the presence of graphical tools that show spots in code which will benefit from acceleration .
It 's easy for rivals to relegate ClearSpeed to the floating point niche and say that its hardware is a pain , but growing mainstream acceptance should make it tougher for end users to ignore the company .
HP has folded ClearSpeed into its accelerator helper program , while Sun relies on ClearSpeed for some of its most prominent high performance computing wins .
ClearSpeed 's story should get stronger in the coming months when it releases revamped silicon that improves overall performance and when it takes care of a lingering denormalized operands issue .
The Tesla Foil
Not to be outdone by some upstart , Nvidia has been hammering away at its accelerator play too .
While at Supercomputing , Nvidia found time to hype up Version 1.1 of CUDA and its Tesla acceleration systems .
Python Programming , news on the Voidspace Python Projects and all things techie .
IronPython Studio : Problems , Victory and Compiled Binaries
After much pain I have finally got IronPython Studio working , fortunately it was worth the effort .
IronPython Studio is an IDE based on the Visual Studio Shell .
Visual Studio 2008 allows you to create ( and freely distribute ) applications built on top of the Visual Studio shell , and IronPython Studio is an ' example ' of this - so the source is available to play with if you have the full version of Visual Studio 2008 .
Whilst I have n't abandoned what I consider to be more featureful Python editors like Wingware 's Wing IDE , IronPython studio does have a few tricks up its sleeve that makes it useful for IronPython development .
The first trick , which I did n't appreciate until I got IronPython Studio working properly , is that it produces compiled binaries from IronPython projects .
It comes with both WPF and Windows Forms designers which generate Python code .
You can either use that code directly or compile the project into an executable .
Last but not least , IronPython Studio has debugger support - including setting break points in IronPython code .
As conventional (!?)
Python debuggers do n't work with IronPython this could come in useful ( despite my general antipathy towards debuggers there are times when they are invaluable ) .
So why did I have such problems getting IronPython Studio working ?
Partly poor instructions and partly down to the fact that I have had several versions of Visual Studio installed on this XP box ( ranging from Visual Studio 2003 , through several versions of 2005 and 2005 express up to 2008 betas and 2008 express ) .
Just in case anyone else has difficulties , here are the problems I had and how I overcame them .
( Thanks to the guys - especially corysama - over on the IronPythonStudio forum ) .
First of all the installation instructions are n't massively clear .
The steps you need are :
Download and install the Visual Studio X redistributable from : Visual Studio Extensibility
After you run the Install for the MS VS 2008 Shell Isolated Mode Redistributable , you must then go to the folder ( " C:VS 2008 Shell RedistIsolated Mode " ) and click on : " vsshellisolated_enu.exe " to actually install the redistributable runtime .
Install IronPython Studio
After doing this I found that attempting to build a project gave me an " Object reference not set to an instance of an object " error ( a particularly frustrating and hard to track down exception whenever we have encountered it in Resolver ) .
The readme that comes with IronPython Studio ( which of course I did n't read ) actually explains this .
You need to register the IronPython CodeDom provider for the compilation to work ( as explained by Aaron Marten on the VSX team ) .
Unfortunately for Windows XP these instructions are just plain wrong ( being charitable I assume they are for Vista and they have just forgotten that most people still want to run XP ! ) .
The instructions tell you insert the new XML " Under the root < configuration > node " ( in machine.config ) .
Instead you should place it between the < system.web > and < system.serviceModel > nodes .
The config XML will look like this :
</ providers > </roleManager > </system.web > < system.codedom > < compilers > < compiler language= " py ; IronPython " ...> </ compilers > </system.codedom > < system.serviceModel > < extensions >
By now I had completely screwed my system and even attempting to use the WPF designer gave me the following error :
The Microsoft.VisualStudio .
Internal .WPFFlavor .WPFPackage , Microsoft.VisualStudio.WPFFlavor , Version=2.0.0.0 , Culture=neutral , PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a ( {B3BAE735-386C-4030-8329 -EF48EEDA4036} ) did not load because of previous errors .
For assistance , contact the package vendor .
To attempt to load this package again , type ' appenv /resetskippkgs ' at the command prompt .
Needless to say appenv does n't exist , but with a combination of clues and guesswork I figured out that it was referring to the studio executable .
Running IronPythonStudio.exe /resetskippkgs restored the designer .
After this I was now getting a really weird error :
Could not load file or assembly ' IronPython , Version = 1.1.0.0 ... or one of its dependencies .
The located assembly 's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference .
( Exception from HRESULT : 0x80131040 )
Now it is failing to load IronPython at all when I attempt to build !
It turns out that it has located the IronPython assemblies that were installed along with the Visual Studio 2005 SDK - which were an older version !
I have n't actually solved this problem ( it must be picking up the location from some environment variable or registry entry set by the VS 2005 SDK ) , but manually copying the right assemblies into the build directory fixes it and I can design and debug to my heart 's content .
phew
Interesting Stuff
A mixed bag .
You must read this fantastic review of upgrading from Vista to Windows XP :
It is wonderfully written and ends :
To be honest there is only one conclusion to be made ; Microsoft has really outdone themselves in delivering a brand new operating system that really excels in all the areas where Vista was sub-optimal .
An interesting quote from the latest blog entry of Resolver developer Jonathan Hartley :
I 'm a firm believer that the winners write history , and have on more than one occasion pondered the lofty ideals of the founding fathers as a superb marketing spin to popularise an act of treason .
Internet Explorer 8 passes the Acid Test 2 !
( A fairly stringent web standards compliance test . )
Firefox does n't do that ( well not sure about version 3 , but version 2 does n't . ) :
Steve Yegge has posted a long blog entry on why code size is a bad thing ( and touting Javascript as the ' Next Big Language ' again ... ) :
Most of that entry is a very long winded way of saying ' code is a liability ' ( which I vehemently agree with ) .
In trying to track down the origin of this phrase I came across this blog entry : Code is a Liability .
It starts :
I have thought for a long time that code is liability , and that viewing code as a liability has the power to transform our art .
One of his commentors disagrees and replies with a parody :
I have thought for a long time that legs are liability , and that viewing legs as a liability has the power to transform our gait .
It is hilarious : Sadly , most companies have to deal with heaping , shaggy mounds of legs . [...]
They have to be reviewed ( hopefully in an efficient way like pairing ) . [...]
Having more legs will typically slow development , and will certainly reduce your ability to walk .
Tim answers in the comments with what I think is a great summary :
I did n't say code was bad .
I said it is a liability .
By that I mean that it costs , and that the costs recur , and that the costs are proportionate to the volume of the code .
Jeff Attwood also has a great blog entry : The Great Browser JavaScript Showdown .
This makes use of the new WebKit JavaScript benchmark : SunSpider .
WebKit is the open source rendering engine behind Safari , and using SunSpider we can ( apparently ) get a good idea of the comparative performance of JavaScript across browsers .
Firefox is worse than you might imagine ( I only knock it because I love it ) ...
In the last two iterations ( four weeks ) at Resolver , we have completed 32 user stories and defects .
I 'm pretty sure that this is a record for us and is a sign that the core functionality has solidified .
I 'm working on the find dialog ( not really a dialog though ) at the moment .
There should be a fresh beta , with some great usability improvements , out very soon .
I had to blog about this video : Bubble 2.0 .
I 'm sure a lot of you have seen it , but if you have n't it is very funny .
Statlib , a Python stats library that has come out of the phenomenally successful Python Project for the Google Highly Open Participation Contest , has changed license .
It is now available under the MIT license which means we can ( and probably will ) use it with Resolver .
Parrot 0.5.1 ( the Virtual Machine intended to run Perl 6 , but also targeting many other dynamic languages ) is now out .
The Python for parrot implementation is called ' Pynie ' and the release notes include : punie and pynie language implementations using PCT and NQP whatever that means ...
It sounds like progress but Perl6 is still well behind Python 3 ...
Speaking of Perl , there was another very interesting post by Jeff Atwood a couple of days ago : Nobody Cares What Your Code Looks Like .
This is a look at the dilemma ( and maintenance nightmare ) that the Bugzilla team are facing - because their codebase is written in Perl ...
Oh and some personal news to finish with .
I 've just had the mortgage agreement through for my first house .
If everything goes well ( a big if ... ) then I will be moving house in January ...
Resolver , IronPython and the Python Papers and the One Minute Screencast
Volume 2 , Issue 4 of the Python Papers is now out .
This has an interview with me about IronPython and IronPython in Action ( including an extract from the book ) .
It also has an interview with Giles Thomas ( our CTO and overlord - in - chief ) about Resolver Systems .
The interview has some interesting facts about our development processes , why Resolver chose Python and how we have found it .
Giles has also put together a new screencast :
Resolver explained in one minute
I think he does a good job of capturing the real value of Resolver .
The news that Resolver will be free for Open Source and personal use has been attracting some attention :
Big Resolver News : New Beta , Release Date and Resolver Free for Personal Use
A new Resolver newsletter has just been fired off to all of our beta users , and it contains three pieces of important news .
The most important one is :
Resolver
One ( the desktop client ) will be free for personal and open source use !
This is especially good , as even though it was our intention I was n't sure how quickly we would be able to put this in place .
We will also have commercial versions and a version for the financial services industry .
We are still working on the pricing model , but being able to make Resolver free for many users is fantastic .
You can read the announcement to see that I 'm not making this up .
In the same announcement you will read that we have set a date for releasing version 1.0 : 15 January 2008 .
This is scarily close , but as a step towards this goal we have also just released a new beta .
Improvements in this beta include :
You can hide columns / rows by dragging their width / height to zero .
Double - click them to show them again .
We handle non-DD / MM / YYYY dates correctly .
Fixed Defect 36 - Hitting escape gives invalid text in the formula bar .
Fixed Defect 109 - Cut / Paste and Clear Contents commands do not update formula bar .
Since the Resolver beta went public we 've now had more than 1,000 downloads .
We 've also done a ' more traditional press release ' about the release of Resolver : http://www.prleap.com/pr/107089/
There will ( almost certainly ) be another beta shortly .
New features and defect fixes that have been checked in or are nearly ready include :
Currency formatting
A ' check for updates ' dialog
Separate scroll position , current cell and selection per worksheet
Defect fix : text formulae are offset when pasted
Defect fix : pasting arrays does n't offset formulae
Fixed a memory leak ( this relates to disposing of old documents and probably is n't an issue for most users but was a problem for our functional test suite that merrily creates a horde of documents )
Printing of worksheets that span multiple pages
Saving of formatting when exporting to excel
Plus several other features and defect fixes that are on the list of ' essentials ' before we hit 1.0 .
Resolver Tips : Using Compiled Modules and Integration with Google Spreadsheets
Now that Resolver is in the hands of a larger number of people , we are starting to see some interesting use cases and tips and tricks emerge .
These are a couple of recent ones :
How to Import Google Spreadsheets into Resolver
This example uses the Google Spreadsheet API to import google spreadsheets into Resolver worksheets .
Using Compiled Python With Resolver Using byte - compiled Python code is one way of preventing your end users from tampering with the source code and creating maintenance nightmares .
One user wanted to do this with Python modules used by his spreadsheets .
This entry walks through using the ability of IronPython 1.1 to create compiled assemblies from Python modules with Resolver spreadsheets .
For more tricks and tips , Resolver Hacks is the place to go of course .
Resolver as XP Pairing Tool
At Resolver Systems we follow the XP practise of pair programming .
This has several key benefits , which include :
Higher code quality without the need for code review
Less distracted developers !
( even when tired or having an off day )
Much more fun !
Easier to mentor inexperienced developers and integrate new hires ( and interns )
Collective code ownership ( and distributed knowledge of the code base )
In order to really effectively distribute knowledge of the codebase we swap pairs daily .
User stories will be ' owned ' by a single developer , but they will pair with a different person each day .
This works very well in practise , but can mean that choosing pairs in our stand - up meeting becomes a bit like a popularity contest as we try to work out who will pair with whom ...
To remove the awkwardness from this , Christian ( one of our two Australian developers ) created a simple ' pair - choosing ' spreadsheet .
Yet another opportunity for us to dog - food Resolver .
Simply enter into the appropriate cell ranges the available developers and the pairs who last worked together , and it will generate a pairing arrangement for today .
If there are an odd number of developers it will randomly assign one of them to spiking .
ACCU 2008 Conference : Dynamic Languages on .NET
I 've just heard that my talk proposal for ACCU 2008 has been accepted .
This is a UK ( Oxford ) Software development conference that was originally focussed on C/ C++ , but in recent years has had a rich dynamic languages track .
This year dynamic language sessions are ' mainstream ' , and functional languages are the ' interesting outsiders ' with their own track .
In 2007 Mark Shuttleworth was one of the keynote speaker and in 2006 one of the keynote speakers was a certain gentleman , Guido van Rossum .
My talk will be ninety minutes long .
As ACCU is a relatively formal conference , this is slightly scary !
However ninety minutes is long enough to get into some real detail , including demonstrating Resolver and showing off the power of Python .
Talk abstract :
IronPython is the first of a new wave of dynamic languages for the .NET framework .
Dynamic languages are gaining in popularity , and with IronPython and the DLR Microsoft are committed to making the CLR a good platform for dynamic languages .
Not only this , but they can also be used with the new platform : Silverlight the browser plugin .
Dynamic languages increase developer choice , enable new programming paradigms for the .NET framework , and provide a readymade scripting engine solution for .NET languages .
In this talk I will explore the following talks :
Why dynamic languages ?
The story of IronPython and the DLR
IronPython on .NET ( interacting with the CLR )
Multiple programming paradigms on .NET ( functional , procedural , OOP , metaprogramming )
Dynamic languages on Silverlight
Embedding IronPython in .NET languages
