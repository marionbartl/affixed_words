TRAPPED after flipping his car while drunk driving , a New Zealand man opened another beer as he waited to be rescued .
Paul Nigel Sneddon , 47 , pleaded guilty to careless driving and drunken driving in a district court in the North Island city of Palmerston North , the Dominion Post newspaper reports .
Sneddon failed to take a corner on June 1 , crashed through a wooden barrier , and flipped his car onto its roof .
The newspaper quoted defence lawyer Peter Young as telling the court when Sneddon found he could not open the doors , " he had nothing else to do at that point , so he had another beer " .
When police found him trapped in the vehicle his breath - alcohol level was 1191 micrograms - nearly three times the legal limit of 400 micrograms .
Prosecutor police Sergeant Ollie Outtrim told the court Sneddon went on a drinking bender after losing his job at a bakery .
Asked by an officer how much alcohol he had consumed , Sneddon replied : " ' Plenty .
I 've been drinking for four days straight , ' adding he had just lost his job in a local bakery , " Sergeant Outtrim said .
Judge Gregory Ross fined Sneddon $ NZ1100 ( $ 888 ) and disqualified him from driving for 10 months .

With the liquidity crisis surrounding the rollover of Greek debt subsiding , the probability of default for that country has plummeted from nearly even odds to just over one in three .
Last Week ’s Numbers : 06 May 2010
Meanwhile , other state and national governments are showing continued stress .
Venezuela tops the list with a CDS spread of 1049 and a risk of default now over 50 % .
Argentina and Pakistan are also now ahead of Greece which is now only the 4th most likely government in the world to default .

The usual suspects are on the list including Dubai , Ukraine and Latvia .
The one thing to notice is that California has now cracked the top ten with a 20 % default probability .

Marie Celeste Arraras is a lady .
She is a lady that some of you –including , shamefully , your humble correspondent who really needs to expand her horizons once again–may not have heard about .
But if you watch Telemundo , you probably have seen her on “ Al Rojo Vivo , ” her daily news broadcast , or her work as a contributor for the “ Today ” show .
She ’s pretty , talented , and good at her job — she ’s been called the “ Katie Couric of Spanish television . ”
She ’s also a lady .
I believe I mentioned that .
Because it turns out to be pretty important .
On May 28 , Arraras called Miami 911 , telling the dispatcher to send the cops right away because her boyfriend had hit her and was trying to choke her .
The police did eventually come to the house , arrested her boyfriend , and observed that she had a swollen lips and marks on her arms .
All this you can read in this story from the Sunday New York Daily News , like I did .
What I find interesting is that in the online version , they left out the transcript of the call .
Which makes for some … what ’s that word we use ?
Interesting ?
Infuriating ?
Depressingly typical ?
Yeah , that one .
Here , in living Minou Transcription , is the 911 call :
Operator : Miami Dade , where is your emergency ?
Arraras : Please send the police to [ redacted ] right now .
Somebody is about to kill me .
Please .
Operator :
What are they doing ?
Arraras : Choking me .
Please hurry .
Operator :
They are choking you ?
Arraras : Please .
Operator : Ma’am , you are on the phone ; they are not choking you .
What did they do ?
Arraras :
They just hit me and tried to choke me .
Please .
Operator : Who did that to you ?
Arraras : Somebody that lives with me .
Operator : Okay then , who is that somebody ?
Let ’s not be silly .
Ma’am , answer my question .
Arraras : I have three kids here .
Operator :
And who is this someone that tried to kill you ?
Arraras :
It ’s somebody that I ’m dating , that lives here … please , could you send somebody right away ?
Operator : Okay , ma’am .
Hello .
Instead of just saying hurry up , why do n’t you answer the question ?
Arraras : Listen to me , I have to go because he ’s trying to get back in .
Could you please …
Operator :
So the person is outside ?
Arraras : Outside , but not for long .
Operator : So , he lives there with you ?
Arraras :
Are you sending somebody right now ?
Operator : I said , yes , if you would have listened instead of just talking .
Okay .
I ’ll say two things right away , because I have to , because if you ’re going to be outraged , on the Internet , while female , you have to say things to cover your ass before the nitpickers and MRAs and rape apologists descend upon you .
First , I do n’t know if that ’s the full transcript .
I tried to dig it up via diligent net browsing , but the best I could find was the print edition of the News .
There are a few ellipses in the transcription which could be gaps in the transcript , or capturing pauses in Arraras ’ speech .
Second , I have n’t heard an audio of the conversation , so I ca n’t speak to the tone of either Arraras or the operator .
Within those narrow dimensions , I ’m still pretty appalled .
We are told , all of us , lady and dude and every other fantastic gender under the sun , that you call 911 when there ’s an emergency .
We are especially told that if we are people of the lady persuasion –not only because we are assumed to be incapable of dealing with anything messy and violent ( except , you know , housework and rape ) , but because if , Cthulu forbid it , something happens to us , and we did n’t call , well then it ’s clearly all our fault .
Now , some folks learn to discount that .
Queer people , for one , are used to not being able to rely on help from the police .
Criminally , far too many people of color in the Good Ol ’ USA are resigned to assuming that the police wo n’t help them .
( Not everywhere , not every officer , but you know where I ’m coming from . )
As for us trans folk , especially trans ladies … the fact that our only universally agreed upon Day of Trans Significance is about Remembering Our Dead gives you a sense of how we expect things to work out … just ask Tyra Hunter .
If you could , which you can ’t , because she ’s dead .
So here we have a lady .
A well - to - do , famous lady , a celebrity especially in Miami .
Who calls the police when her partner attacks her .
And how , pray tell , does that call go ?
Well , we have an interesting grammatical and epistemological discussion about whether or not she “ is being choked ” or “ has recently been choked . ”
Which is all great and good , I like to exercise my critical thinking skills on a regular basis , but should n’t the words “ Somebody ” , “ Choked ” , and “ Me ” have possibly filtered up higher into the conversation ’s consciousness ?
Because somebody , I do n’t know , could have been choked ?
Then we have this lady , who if the transcript is any guide , was severely distressed , told to not be silly .
Silly .
I can think of a lot things that I might be when calling about how somebody I loved , who lived in my house , was attacking me , but silly just does n’t seem to fit in there any place .
And the kicker ?
When Arraras indicates she is now in immediate danger , that her assailant is trying to get back inside , the dispatcher still takes her to task , for not listening and not answering his or her questions right away .
While , I should add , forgetting him or herself that Arraras had already said several times that her attacker lived with her .
Now look .
I get that this is a horrible job , that most 911 dispatchers ’ workday probably consists of prank calls , folks calling without a real emergency , and depressingly repetitive crimes all sandwiched around a few cases of pure brutal horror .
So I ’m not saying that 911 is sexist or that you should n’t call 911 if you ’re in trouble .
You should .
But at the same time , I ’m hardly doing much more than raising the MacKinnon Memorial Prize for Repetitive Observation by pointing out that all too often people in authority do n’t take domestic violence seriously .
Like , for example , this story :
As we first revealed , when Sheila Jones needed help , help never came .
That despite repeated calls to Metro Nashville ’s 911 over a three - hour stretch about an ex-boyfriend who ’d assaulted her and was threatening to come back .
Sheila to 911 : ” They ai n’t sent nobody .
I just do n’t understand .
Is it ’ cause I ’m black ?
Is it ’cause of the neighborhood .
What is it ? ”
And our investigation discovered , this is how one of the last calls ended : Sheila : “ I ’m scared to even leave out my f*** ing house . ”
911 : “ OK , ma’am , I updated the call .
We ’ll get somebody there as soon as possible . ”
Sheila : [ Hangs up . ]
911 : “ I really just do n’t give a s**t what happens to you . ”
You know what that voice is ?
That ’s the voice of every MRA troll who gets smug with you online about “ if it was such a big deal , why did n’t you call the police ? ”
That ’s the voice of anyone who makes the victim in a battering case the one to hang her head in embarrassment .
That ’s the voice of everything that keeps a woman for asking for help , that ’s the smug assurance that it just does n’t matter .
That , ladies and assorted dudes of good cheer , is the voice of patriarchy as sure as if it was broadcasting on Radio Free Patriarchy .
And that voice , that expression , that smugness and boredom and frustration about getting another DV call that will just end up with at most a few protection orders here , a trespass ticket there , that ’s at the heart of the second part of this story .
Because it does n’t end with just a humiliating attempt to , you know , preserve bodily health and integrity .
I mean , does it ever , when you attempt to live while female ?
See , like Brooke Mueller , like Rihanna ( at first ) , like way too many other women , Arraras has tried to downplay what happened , calling it an isolated incident .
Isolation is the right word for it , as this People Magazine ( People ?
People !
People frakking magazine can get this right and 911 dispatch can ’t ? ) excerpt shows :
If anything , the victim will often blame herself – and the attacker will agree with her .
“ The abuser also tries very hard to convince the victim that the attack was their fault , ” says Dr. Elizabeth Miller , a Sacramento , Calif. , pediatrician and domestic violence expert .
“ It ’s common to say , ‘ Honey , if you had n’t upset me , this would ’ve never happened . ’ “
Because that ’s it .
Do n’t call , and what happens to you is your fault .
Do call , and what happens to you is your fault .
Run , and what happens to you is your fault .
Stay , and what happens to you is your fault .
Fight , and what happens to you is your fault .
Do n’t fight , and what happens to you is your fault .
Divorce , and it ’s going to be your fault .
Try to protect your children from an abuser , and it ’s your fault that some bitter men will spam your website .
Get any money to support your children and they ’ll scream matriarchy .
Dare to point out that 90 % of all serious domestic injuries are caused by men hitting women , and that the often quoted studies so dear to their hearts compare verbal abuse ( “ you ’re a pathetic excuse ! ” ) with getting your kneecaps broken , and they ’ll tell you that the bitches run the planet , and men ca n’t win , and what are you whining about because you never had it so good .
Until that day you have to pick up the phone .
And pray somebody on the other end will hear you out before they stop believing you .
But the New York Times was n't quite honest in their article and only showed the edited Youtube clip ala Fox News .
In fact , they did n't point out that in the same speech , Richard Blumenthal corrected himself and pointed it out that he did n't serve in Vietnam but served in the Reserve during the Vietnam era .
The Huffington Post posted the full edition of the speech where Richard Blumenthal clearly states that he served in the US Military Reserve during the Vietnam war not in Vietnam .
It 's pretty clear to me that it was unintentional misstatement .
Or maybe he lied or half - lied .
Who knows ?
But The NewYork Times should have posted the full edition instead of posting an edited video .
MMFA has the story as well .
Their coverage is really good as always .
I wonder if the New York Times will issue a statement ?
UPDATE I
Thanks to Hesiod , we just can read how the NY Times is responding :
Late update : A spokesman for the Times says the video does n't change anything .
" The New York Times in its reporting uncovered Mr. Blumenthal 's long and well established pattern of misleading his constituents about his Vietnam War service , which he acknowledged in an interview with The Times , " said Diane McNulty .
" The video does n't change our story .
Saying that he served ' during Vietnam ' does n't indicate one way or the other whether he went to Vietnam . "
She also urged Blumenthal to " come clean : " " Mr. Blumenthal needs to be candid with his constituents about whether he went to Vietnam or not , since his official military records clearly indicate he did not , " she said .
Funny right ?
The NYTimes is asking Blumenthal to come clean when it's the NYTimes just got caught
UPDATE II
Jean Risley , the woman from the Connecticut Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the source of the Times quote about Blumenthal claiming to have been spat upon , says she was misquoted and that Blumenthal never made false claims to her about Vietnam .
She appeared at Blumenthal 's event yesterday .

Elena Kagan , President Barack Obama ’s latest nominee to the Supreme Court , helped protect the Saudi royal family from lawsuits that sought to hold al Qaeda financiers responsible in the wake of the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks .
The suits were filed by thousands of family members and others affected by the Sept. 11 attacks .
In court papers , they provided evidence that members of the Saudi royal family had channeled millions to al Qaeda prior to the bombings , often in contravention of direct guidance from the United States .

But Kagan , acting as President Obama ’s Solicitor General , argued that the case should not be heard even if evidence proved that the Saudis helped underwrite al Qaeda , because it would interfere with US foreign policy with the oil - rich nation .
She posited Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ that the princes are immune from petitionersÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ claimsÃ¢â‚ ¬Â because of Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ the potentially significant foreign relations consequences of subjecting another sovereign state to suit .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
In an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer published Tuesday , the mother of a man who was killed on United Flight 93 in Pennsylvania said he did n’t know why Kagan argued that the case not even be heard .
By keeping the case off the dockets , the Saudis were spared scrutiny of their finances .
“ We had hoped she would be with us so that we could have our day in court , ” Beverly Burnett said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I find this reprehensible , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â said Kristen Breitweiser , another family member whose husband was killed in the 9/11 attacks , said at the time .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ One would have hoped that the Obama administration would have taken a different stance than the Bush administration , and you wonder what message this sends to victims of terrorism around the world .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
The Obama Administration ’s decision to intervene in the Saudi-al Qaeda case so irritated two Republican senators that they introduced legislation aiming to ensure that Americans have the ability to sue foreign governments .
ADVERTISEMENT
Sen. Arlen Specter ( D - PA ) and Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) offered a proposal to amend the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act , which Kagan cited as one reason the Saudi case should not be heard .
Both senators said that US citizens should be able to sue foreign governments if they are found to be supporting terrorist activity .
Specter , who has since become a Democrat , was unusually blunt .
“ She wants to coddle the Saudis , ” he said .

May 27 , 2010
ISM , 25th May , 2010 I never cease to be amazed at the power of the human spirit to survive .
During my last visit to Gaza in October 2008 I was amazed and deeply moved by the power of the people I witnessed .
In a triumph of hope over adversity and tremendous suffering , love still abides .
Gaza comprises a small strip of land 27 miles long and 6 miles wide .
This coastal strip is bordered by Israel on the one side , the Mediterranean Sea on the other and to a lesser extent by Egypt at the southern end .
With one and a half million inhabitants Gaza is the fifth most densely populated place on the planet , 50 % of which are under the age of 18 .
Two thirds of the total population hold refugees status , and comprise the victims and their descendants of previous acts of Israeli aggression .
Gaza�s people have suffered an Israeli occupation for over 40 years and even though Israel withdrew from Gaza in August 2005 it has continued to control every aspect of life in the tiny coastal strip .
Hamas was democratically elected to power in the 2006 Palestinian elections and has governed the Gaza strip since the summer of 2007 .
It was at this time in 2007 that Israel commenced its devastating blockade of the strip .
Essentially the blockade represents a draconian policy by Israel .
A minimum amount of basic subsistence goods are allowed to enter the strip with the intention of holding a malnourished population just short of outright starvation .
Coupled to the severe food shortages are the restrictions / ban on basic essentials such a medicine and desperately needed reconstruction materials .
This blockade constitutes " Collective Punishment " of a civilian population an act illegal under Article 33 of the fourth Geneva Convention .
But the Culture of Impunity , under which Israel operates , means Israel continues to ignore International Law with many of the World�s Governments and international bodies � remaining silent .
In the words of one Israeli Professor , Israel has made Gaza into the largest open air prison in the world .
Whether by land , sea or air the one and a half million inhabitants of Gaza are trapped , their 6 border crossings are closed ( including the Raffah crossing with Egypt ) , their airport destroyed and their port and coastal waters shut down by a naval blockade .
The people are forced to live a suffocating life of misery and hardship .
The closure has impacted every imaginable aspect of their existence both physical and emotional .
Lives are constantly lost for lack of access to hospital treatments unavailable in Gaza .
Bright and willing students are deprived of an opportunity to progress their studies ; places offered abroad in universities can not be accepted as student are unable to leave .
The Israeli policy of divide , blockade and conquer used against the Palestinian people strikes right to the heart to family life .
Families in Gaza can no longer visit their relatives in the West Bank .
Wives are torn from husbands and husbands from wives .
Many are forced to live apart some in the West Bank others in Gaza .
All across the Occupied Palestinian Territories there is a common shared experience of humiliation .
The West Bank is constantly shrinking under a deluge of illegal Israeli Settlements and new settlement construction .
The countless thousands of Gazans left homeless after the Israeli bombings can find a paler shadows of the same existence among their friends and family in East Jerusalem where forced evictions and house demolitions are a daily occurrence .
The children of Gaza are the ones who suffer most .
During my visit to Gaza in October , 2008 I went to visit the area of Khankhounis .
In all my years of visiting areas of poverty and devastation , I have never witnessed anything so terrible .
The area had been hit by floods which had washed away the roads forming a river which flooded the houses , of many hundreds of people , with mud .
We walked through home after home completely destroyed and yet some families made vain attempts to salvage what they could and live in the midst of this horrific destruction .
The children played on the destroyed roads and footpaths , amidst raw sewerage and the mothers did their best to protect their young ones all too aware of the dangers of disease lurking in the open puddles which , children being children persisted in playing in .
Community leaders explained that they were unable to reconstruct homes , roads and repair open sewers as Israel would not permit the materials and equipment to enter Gaza .
Teachers had no writing materials , the doctors not enough medicines and the children were suffering from malnutrition and showing signs of stunted growth .
One father asked ' if I give you some money , next time the Free Gaza boat comes in will you bring in some milk , the children have no milk� .
( In June , 2009 , twenty - one of us tried to sail on the Freegaza boat to Gaza , but our boat was hi-jacked in International waters by Israeli navy and we were all forcibly taken to Israel , put in prison for a week and then deported ) .
Since 2008 all of this suffering has only magnified and worsened due to the shattering effect of operation " Cast Lead " Israel�s brutal attach on Gaza which took place in December / January 2008 / 2009 .
Disease from raw sewerage and shortage of medicines are not the worst things to affect the children these days .
During the Israeli assault on Gaza , bombs and white phosphorus were dropped on Palestinian civilians and of the l,400 people who died , over 400 were children .
The agricultural land is now radiated with depleted uranium and holds it own terrible dangers for the people of Gaza .
Many who depended on the land for their livelihood have seen their stock and crops destroyed and the soil poisoned .
Where is the hope ?
Where is the love in the midst of such suffering and injustice ?
The international community has all but failed in its duty of care and seems unwilling or unable to take a stand against Israeli brutality but thankfully there are those who still refuse to stands aide .
And so in an expression of love and solidarity the " Freedom Flotilla " takes to the water in an attempt to breach the siege on Gaza .
The Freedom Flotilla comprises 8 boats , in a joint effort including Turkey and Greece , over 600 People from over 60 countries , will sail to Gaza in May , 2010 .
The flotilla will be joined by a cargo boat from Ireland , the MV Rachel Corrie .
Its large cargo includes tonnes of construction material , cement , medical equipment and a special donation of printing paper from Norway .
This trip will again highlight Israel�s criminal blockade and illegal occupation .
In a demonstration of the power of global citizen action we hope to awaken the conscience of all .
We hope the Freedom Flotilla will provide a way to open up the sea .
When we arrived in Gaza on the Freegaza boat in October 2008 last we stayed at Marna House , the hotel owner was overjoyed as he invited us to sign the register .
He explained his joy telling us that , with closure of their Port to the outside world , we were the first people to enter Gaza by port and stay in his hotel in over 40 years of Israeli occupation .
It would be wonderful if the sea passage could be permanently opened for the people of Gaza so they can freely enter and leave their own land , and be reunited again as a part of the Mediterranean family , selling their produce and buying what they need without let or hindrance .
This journey , by boat , will be my third with The Freegaza Movement and it has shown me that people can make a difference .
The Free Gaza Movement was started by a few people with an idea and the courage to make it happen .
If people wish to support their work and follow us on the boat journey to Gaza visit their website at freegaza.org
But above all we are inspired by the people of Gaza whose courage , love and joy in welcoming us , even in the midst of such suffering gives us all hope .
They represent the very best of humanity and we are all privileged to be given the opportunity to support them in their nonviolent struggle for human dignity , and freedom .
All the Rage Islamic Fundamentalists Do n't Just Have a Problem with Cartoons , They Have a Problem with Freedom
It began last September .
Danish author Kaare Bluitgen could n’t find an illustrator for his biography of Muhammad .
Fundamentalist Muslims frown on depictions of the prophet and — in one of many European cases of self - censorship since the November 2004 murder of Dutch filmmaker and Islam critic Theo van Gogh — artists feared a reaction .
Europe , you see , is n’t the liberal paradise you think it is , or knew it to be 10 or 20 years ago .
At this very moment , European liberalism is caught in a steadily intensifying struggle with fundamentalist Muslim censoriousness — call it creeping Sharia .
Concerned about this trend and eager to make a statement about free speech , Denmark ’s largest newspaper , Jyllands - Posten , invited illustrators to submit drawings of Muhammad .
On September 30 , the paper printed 12 of them .
Most of the cartoons , frankly , were lame and witless .
A couple ( notably one depicting Muhammad as a terrorist ) were provocative in the way editorial cartoons are supposed to be .
But compared to the lusty Christian baiting in movies like Life of Brian — or in various artworks by Gilbert and George , among others — they were pretty tame stuff .
When artists bait Christians , the Christians ( at most ) wave signs and send out press releases .
When Danish Muslims saw the Muhammad cartoons , they went ballistic .
Thousands protested in Copenhagen .
Death threats were issued .
On October 12 , a group of Muslim ambassadors demanded a meeting with Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen .
He refused .
“ It is so self - evidently clear what principles Danish society is based upon , ” he said later , “ that there is nothing to have a meeting about . ”
Now , in today ’s Europe — where cultural appeasement by political and media elites of the continent ’s largely unintegrated and antidemocratic Muslim minority is standard practice — Fogh Rasmussen ’s blunt stance was encouraging .
Yet Danish Muslim leaders stepped up pressure — claiming that the cartoons had wounded the delicate sensibilities of a billion of their co-religionists around the world — and won allies .
In December , Louise Arbour , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , promised that “ action ” on the cartoons would be forthcoming .
( Apparently free speech was not on her list of human rights . )
The Council of Europe ’s Committee of Ministers condemned the Danish media ’s “ intolerance . ”
In statements read by many as apologies , both Fogh Rasmussen and Jyllands - Posten Editor Carsten Juste said they regretted that Muslims had been offended .
But they were n’t contrite enough to satisfy critics .
In late January , Saudi Arabia — top funder of Europe ’s radical mosques and Muslim schools — pushed for a boycott of Danish goods .
Hacker attacks originating in the Middle East closed down Danish newspaper websites and blogs .
Terrorists ordered Scandinavians out of Gaza .
Palestinians burned Danish flags .
Mobs attacked and burned Danish embassies in Damascus and Beirut .
Every day , it seemed things could n’t get worse — and they kept getting worse .
Many Europeans agree with Kofi Annan that freedom “ should always be exercised in a way that fully respects … religious beliefs , “ and with Sunday Times ( UK ) columnist Simon Jenkins that the main question here is “ whether we truly want to share a world in peace with those who have values and religious beliefs different from our own . ”
What ’s called for , they say , is “ respect , ” “ restraint , ” and “ responsibility . ”
And , above all , “ sensitivity . ”
For them , this is simply a case of the powerful mocking the faith of the weak .
On the contrary , what ’s happening here is that a gang of bullies — led by a country , Saudi Arabia , where Bibles are forbidden , Christians tortured , Jews routinely labeled “ apes and pigs ” in the state - controlled media , and apostasy from Islam punished by death — is trying to compel a tiny democracy to live by its own theocratic rules .
To succumb to pressure from this gang would simply be to invite further pressure , and lead to further concessions — not just by Denmark but by all of democratic Europe .
And when they ’ve tamed Europe , they ’ll come after America .
After all , the list of Western phenomena that offend the sensibilities of many Muslims is a long one — ranging from religious liberty , sexual equality , and the right of gay people not to have a wall dropped on them , to music , alcohol , dogs , and pork .
After a few Danish cartoons , what ’s next ?
Make no mistake , this is no isolated incident .
It ’s one step in a long - term effort by extreme Muslim forces to erode Western liberties and turn free , affluent countries into mirror images of their own dysfunctional dictatorships .
“ Muslims have a dream of living in an Islamic society , ” declared a Danish Muslim leader in 2000 .
“ This dream will surely be fulfilled in Denmark … .
We will eventually be a majority . ”
( Or as a T - shirt popular among young Muslims in Stockholm puts it : “ 2030 — then we take over . ” )
Even after the bombings in Madrid and London and the riots in Paris , many European leaders continue to be in denial about this effort ; others , as eager as Neville Chamberlain at Munich to “ keep the peace , ” seem already to have chosen a policy of gradual surrender , accompanied by flurries of sycophantic praise for Islam and apology for Western liberties .
Bat Ye’or , a Jewish Egyptian woman whose splendid 2005 book Eurabia is a veritable catalog of the European political establishment ’s systematic toadying to autocratic Muslim governments , has a name for this toadying : “ dhimmitude , ” a reference to the historical Islamic practice of tolerating infidels so long as they accept their role as “ dhimmis , ” i.e. , second - class citizens without rights under Muslim law .
Clearly , many agitators saw Jylland - Posten ’s cartoons as an opportunity to nudge an already largely passive and sycophantic Europe a step closer to full - fledged dhimmi status .
No , most Danes do n’t want to be dhimmis :
In poll results released in late January , 79 percent of them said Fogh Rasmussen owed nobody an apology .
( This is , let it be remembered , the only European country that stood up to the Nazi “ final solution ” by ferrying its own Jews to safety . )
But millions of Europeans have already internalized Islamic taboos and accepted the need to curb liberties in order to “ keep the peace . ”
For them , Muslim rage — and its expression in acts of violence and death threats — is already an accepted part of life that is simply not to be questioned or criticized ; in their view , the fault lies with those who provoke the rage by failing to be good enough dhimmis .
“ There is something wrong with a democracy , ” read a typical viewer SMS on a Norwegian news discussion program , “ where an editor can put the whole country in danger ! ” EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson was one of many who spoke of outraged Muslims as if they were a force of nature — every re-publication of the cartoons by other European newspapers , he said , “ is adding fuel to the flames . ”
Across Europe , the same kind of leftists who reflexively cheer art for outraging Christians now uphold Muslims ’ sacred right not to be offended .
For me , the most positive surprise in all this has been the courage with which many European editors — some of whom I ’d considered dhimmis — have reprinted the cartoons in a show of support for free speech .
Most impressive of all , Le Monde , widely viewed as French dhimmi central , ran its own witty drawing .
For this American , the most disgraceful development has been a statement by the U.S. State Department suggesting that the U.S. stands alongside Islamist agitators and against Denmark — perhaps our most loyal ally in the struggle against Islamist terror .
“ After this act of betrayal , ” Danish journalist Lars Hedegaard e-mailed me , “ one might well ask why we should keep our troops in Iraq and increase our presence in Afghanistan . ”
( Later , in an interview with Jyllands - Posten , Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried said that the U.S. ’s posture was one of “ unconditional solidarity ” with Denmark .
Let ’s hope so . )
As for Juste , the editor of Jyllands - Posten , he said the other day that European integration “ is perhaps an impossible project .
This affair shows that there is a gulf between Western man and the Muslim world that is greater than the Grand Canyon . ”
As the unrest has grown exponentially by the day , this truth has become increasingly hard to deny .

Sometimes a migration needs to do more than add or remove a column .
When you must convert existing data , migrations can get nasty because SQL is all you can use .
You can never call models in a migration because your models will evolve away from your migrations and everyone will die .
Seriously , do n't do that .
Think of the children !
Fortunately , there is a way to use ActiveRecord magic in your migrations and still get the girl .
By inlining classes you decouple your migration from any future changes in your models .
Here is an example :
Say you have two classes Article and Vendor .
Each Article has_many :vendors .
Now you want to introduce a boolean flag current to your Vendor class , which determines whether the article is currently being procured from that vendor .
But what about the 14000 articles already in the database ?
You call up your client and decide on the following migration rule :
The first vendor created for an article is to be flagged as " current " .
While you can express that rule in pure SQL , you 'd much rather use vanilla Ruby .
So you write your migration like this :
class AddCurrentToVendor < ActiveRecord :: Migration class Vendor < ActiveRecord :: Base end class Article < ActiveRecord :: Base has_many :vendors , : class_name => ' AddCurrentToVendor :: Vendor ' , :order => ' created_at ' end def self .
up add_column :vendors , : current , : boolean Article.all.each do |article| article.vendors.first.andand.update_attribute( : current , true ) end end def self .
down remove_column : vendors , : current end end
Previewing the tone of his testimony in Austin on Wednesday ahead of a crucial vote , NAACP president Ben Jealous forcefully condemned the influential Texas State Board of Education ’s slew of pending revisions to history and social studies curriculum .
The modified curriculum Ã¢â‚¬â€œ approved in March on a party line vote and facing a final motion this Friday Ã¢â‚¬â€œ diminishes Thomas JeffersonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s significance and commitment to secularism , tempers criticism of McCarthyism , downplays Darwin ’s theory of evolution , and emphasizes the “ conservative resurgence of the 1980s and 1990s . ”

“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s outrageous , ” Jealous said Tuesday on a conference call with reporters .
“ It ’s going to lock kids into the dark ages , where the whole world ’s been turned upside down Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ where Thomas Jefferson is not a founding father , thereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s no good reason to talk about [ the first black Justice ] Thurgood Marshall , and Joe McCarthy is a hero . ”
The alterations by the Board stand to have major national implications .
Texas , as one of the largest purchasers of textbooks , wields momentous influence in what children across the country will learn because textbook companies generally sell the same books across the country .
Jealous will testify against the revisions alongside former education secretary Rod Paige today .
The NAACP chief accused the 15 - member Texas education board of “ changing the record on slavery , celebrating the Confederacy and shedding a positive light on Jim Crow laws . ”
With Republicans outnumbering Democrats by two - to - one , and seven of its 15 members comprising a Christian conservative bloc , the NAACP and other opponents of the new curriculum face an uphill battle in preventing its ratification Friday .
“ We really need each person who cares to pick up the phone and to call the State Board of Education , ” Jealous said .
“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a critical vote that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s going to impact school books for ten years . ”

“ If the proposed textbook changes take place , children will not learn about civil rights icons like Malcolm X and Ã‚Â George Jackson .
[ And ]
Sam McCollough , who gave his life for Texas independence , ” he added .
“ In addition , they will not learn that Texas seceded from the Union to fight for the Confederacy in the Civil War . ”
Board member Don McElroy , who leads the seven - member social conservative bloc , called the effort an attempt at “ adding balance ” in the classroom .
“ Academia is skewed too far to the left , ” he said , according to Yahoo News .
The Obama administration has finally come up with a plan to deal with the real cause of the credit crunch : the infamous " toxic assets " on bank balance sheets that have scared off investors and borrowers , clogging credit markets around the world .
But if Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner hopes to prevent a repeat of this global economic crisis , his rescue plan must recognize that the real problem is not the bad loans , but the debasement of the paper they are printed on .
Today 's global crisis -- a loss on paper of more than ...

LIKE MANY people , I spent a good portion of last week looking at pictures of oil - drenched birds and marveling at the chutzpah of BP .
The company ’s ads are contrite on the surface but brazen underneath , filled with images of pristine beaches and industrious volunteers , suggesting that soon , all will be well in the Gulf of Mexico so offshore drilling can start again .
Just buck up , America , and have faith !
Stiff upper lip and all that .
Pity the birds ; hate the company .
But I could n’t help but wonder how much I should hate myself , too .
My life , after all , is one giant petroleum glut , from the diapers and diaper rash ointment for my son to the toothpaste in my bathroom to the Lycra in my jeans .
Oil gets me to work and back , puts food on my plate , gets pumped into the tank in my basement every winter .
Imagining a world without it is next to impossible .
But there are some people who are trying .
Their work is based on the controversial concept of “ peak oil , ’’ the theory that US oil production reached its apex in the 1970s and global production will reach its high point by 2020 .
There will still be oil to be had , the theory goes , but less of it , harder to reach , requiring risky technology like BP ’s deep underwater wells .
The threat of ecological disasters and foreign encumbrances are nothing compared to the spectre of the spigot turning off .
And the theory implicates us all ; according to Richard Heinberg , senior fellow at the California - based Post Carbon Institute , half of the world ’s non-renewable resources have been used up in the lifetime of the Boomer generation .
Even as a thought experiment , refuted by some scientists and futurists and optimists , “ peak oil ’ ’ is an opportunity to think past the relative placebo of renewable grocery bags and remember that our oil dependence was n’t preordained .
Early plastics were made from coal resin , says Brian Black , professor of history and environmental studies at Penn State Altoona .
Petroleum just made them more malleable and cost - effective .
Early car production was electric ; Henry Ford even fiddled with an electric version of the Model T. But during World War I , we got hooked on the internal combustion engine , which fueled the suburbs and the road trip and the frequent flier and the culture of expansion we ’re accustomed to now .
Changing that culture will be tough , because it inevitably means sacrifice .
“ No politician wants to stand up in front of his constituency and say look , fossil fuel should be more expensive , we should be traveling less and so on .
He ’d be hooted off the stage , ’’ Heinberg told me .
But he paints a dire portrait of contraction if no one acts , a time when oil is so costly that it limits economic expansion , when big houses are a liability and cars hard to afford .
( His institute is developing ways to facilitate carpools , a sort of post - petroleum Zipcar by necessity . )
The trick , he says , will be to put a positive spin on the change :
We ’ll get used to having smaller houses and less stuff .
We ’ll spend more time outdoors with our families .
Black ’s vision is less dramatic .
He imagines a slow weaning process that begins with reducing our dependence on foreign oil ; he supported the president ’s call for more offshore drilling before the BP disaster struck .
He calls for policies such as cap and trade that put a price on oil ’s long - term implications .
And because transportation takes up the bulk of oil consumption , he believes that if we all convert quickly to fuel - efficient vehicles , we ’ll still have enough petroleum available for the little things we rely on , the pharmacutical ingredients , diapers , and toothpaste tubes .
There have been moments when we ’ve entertained these sorts of ideas .
The Exxon Valdez spill , 21 years ago , reminded us how much oil can hurt the environment .
The gas price spike , two summers ago , made us pity anybody with an SUV .
Neither of them stuck .
Will pictures of birds and anger at Tony Hayward do the trick now ?
Or will we wait until — sooner or much , much later — the wells really do run dry ?

WASHINGTON  The Environmental Protection Agency is 10 years behind schedule in setting guidelines for a host of toxic air pollutants , according to a report from the agency ’s inspector general .
The report , which was released last week , found that the agency had failed to develop emissions standards , due in 2000 , for some sources of hazardous air pollutants .
These included smaller sites often located in urban areas , like dry cleaners and gas stations , but also some chemical manufacturers .
The inspector general also found that the agency had not met targets outlined in a 1999 planning document , the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy , including tracking urban dwellers ’ risk of developing health problems from exposure to pollutants .
Some experts said the failures were persisting largely because the E.P.A. ’s Office of Air and Radiation , which is responsible for regulating air pollutants , lacked the money needed to meet its deadlines .
Who was Robin Hood ?
As with any long - lived figure in the popular imagination  and the legend of the outlaw of Sherwood Forest and his Merry Men goes back to the Middle Ages  the answer changes with the times .
In the movies he has been played most memorably by Errol Flynn , most forgettably by Kevin Costner and now , least merrily , by Russell Crowe .
In the long , bloody , self - serious new version of the legend , directed by Ridley Scott from a script by Brian Helgeland , Robin is not “ Hood ” at all , but Longstride , an archer in the army of King Richard the Lionheart on his way home from the Crusades .
Perhaps taking its cue from the recent spate of superhero origin stories , “ Robin Hood ” takes us back to the character ’s early life , and shows how he became the mischievous outlaw of future Mel Brooks and Bugs Bunny spoofs .
You may have heard that Robin Hood stole from the rich and gave to the poor , but that was just liberal media propaganda .
This Robin is no socialist bandit practicing freelance wealth redistribution , but rather a manly libertarian rebel striking out against high taxes and a big government scheme to trample the ancient liberties of property owners and provincial nobles .
Do n’t tread on him !
So is “ Robin Hood ” one big medieval tea party ?
Kind of , though that description makes the movie sound both more fun and more provocative than it actually is .
The film ’s politics , in any case , are more implicit than overt , so that the filmmakers can plausibly deny any particular topical agenda .
Which is fair enough : the fight of ragged warriors against sniveling and sadistic tyrants appeals across tastes and ideologies .
In our own minds , at least at the movies , we are all embattled underdogs standing up for our rights against a bunch of overprivileged jerks who wo n’t leave us alone .
Introduction
Slimbox is a 4 KB visual clone of the popular Lightbox 2 script by Lokesh Dhakar , written using the MooTools javascript framework .
It was designed to be very small , efficient , standards - friendly , fully customizable , more convenient and 100 % compatible with the original Lightbox 2 .
Note : Slimbox 2 is now also available .
It is using the jQuery library instead of MooTools .
Demo
Visit the Demo page to test the latest version .
You can also test Slimbox for MooTools 1.2.5 and Slimbox for MooTools 1.11 .
Features
From a functional point of view , Slimbox has the following added features compared to the original Lightbox :
Slimbox is ready to launch as soon as the document is ready .
This means that you do n’t have to wait for all images of the page to be loaded before clicking on a link that will launch the Lightbox effect .
Slimbox also centers images vertically on startup , not just horizontally .
Vertical scrolling is still possible .
It works perfectly on horizontal - scrolling websites .
It temporary hides flash animations and other embedded videos while it is open to avoid display bugs in some browsers .
It also hides select boxes in Internet Explorer 6 .
Using a special option ( “ loop ” ) , it allows you to navigate between the first and last images .
Slimbox is more responsive ; it allows you to close it immediately at any time using the keyboard or mouse and to instantly navigate to any image before the current image has loaded or the animations are complete .
The script is more robust ; for example you can try to start and stop Slimbox or navigate between images very quickly to interrupt the animations and resume them and you wo n’t notice any bug like in the original Lightbox where sometimes the animation stops or the elements are wrongly sized or positioned .
Slimbox can be launched from the traditional image links inside the page like the original Lightbox , but also directly from Javascript using its complete API .
From a design point of view , Slimbox is very different from Lightbox :
The code is optimized to an insane level and has been written from scratch with efficiency in mind for the MooTools framework instead of the huge Prototype / Scriptaculous .
The script itself is as tiny as 4 kb ( minified , uncompressed ) .
Slimbox can be entirely customized thanks to many options .
You can change the duration of any effect , the counter text translation or even the navigtation keys .
Slimbox has a much more powerful API , allowing you to apply the Lightbox effect easily on any clickable element or from any script .
For example , it can be easily integrated with links pointing to Flickr or Picasa Web Albums pages or with any javascript image gallery .
, allowing you to apply the Lightbox effect easily on any clickable element or from any script .
For example , it can be easily integrated with links pointing to Flickr or Picasa Web Albums pages or with any javascript image gallery .
The Slimbox Cascading Style Sheets are simpler and 100 % valid ( no more CSS hacks ) .
Also , every visual aspect of Slimbox ( including images ) is specified in the CSS instead of the Javascript so it is easier to style .
You may even change any border size in the CSS and Slimbox will still work fine , which means that nothing is “ hard - coded ” in the source code .
The total download size for the required modules of mootools 1.3 + Slimbox 1.8 , both minified and gzipped , is as small as 24 KB .
Without gzipping , it ’s 73 KB .
By comparison , the download size of the original Lightbox 2.05 and its required libraries is 51 KB with gzip compression .
Without gzipping , it ’s 222 KB .
Compatibility
Slimbox 1.8 for mootools 1.3 is compatible with all modern browsers : Firefox 2+ , Internet Explorer 6 + , Opera 9 + , Safari 3 + and Google Chrome 4 +.
It works with both strict mode and quirks mode web pages .
Unlike many Lightbox - like scripts , it displays fine in case of horizontal scrolling of the web page .
It is disabled by default on mobile devices ( Android , iPhone / iPod , Symbian , Windows Mobile , BlackBerry ) .
Older versions :
Slimbox 1.71 for mootools 1.2.5 is also compatible with Firefox 1.5 , Safari 2 and Google Chrome 1 - 3 .
Slimbox 1.58 for mootools 1.11 is also compatible with Safari 1.3 , Firefox 1.0 , Opera 8.x and Opera for Wii .
It works with strict mode web pages only and support for recent browsers is not garanteed , so it is not recommended to use this version anymore .
Requirements
Slimbox 1.8 requires the MooTools framework , version 1.3 or more recent .
Because MooTools is modular , you can make your download smaller by only downloading the modules your scripts are actually using .
Here are the core modules required by Slimbox :
Element .
Style , Element .
Event , Element .
Dimensions
Fx.
Tween , Fx. Morph ( optionally Fx.Transitions )
DOMReady
The Slimbox download package already includes MooTools with the above dependencies only .
If you need more dependencies for your own scripts or want to use a different MooTools version , you have to download the full MooTools Core or build your own version of it from the MooTools download page .
Slimbox 1.71 , which uses MooTools 1.2.5 , is also available for download .
It provides the same features set as the latest version .
Its dependencies are detailed in the provided readme file .
You may need to use this version if your website is still using MooTools 1.2 or if you want a smaller total download size .
Usage
Usage is exactly the same as for Lightbox by default , but Slimbox offers more options .
Because it was designed to be 100 % compatible with Lightbox , you just need to replace the scripts combination “ Prototype + Scriptaculous + Lightbox ” with “ MooTools + Slimbox ” in the header of your pages and your Lightbox effects will work just as well as before .
Well , a little better .
Setup
1 . Include the script in the header of your page , after the inclusion of the MooTools framework :
< script type= " text/ javascript " src= " js/mootools.js " ></script > < script type= " text/ javascript " src= " js/slimbox.js " ></ script >
There are some options that you can specify in the form of a javascript object inside the script ( look for “ put custom options here ” ) .
The default values should be just fine , however if you want you can change the following :
loop : Boolean ; if set to true , allows the user to navigate between the first and last images of a Slimbox gallery , when there is more than one image to display .
Default is false .
Boolean ; if set to , allows the user to navigate between the first and last images of a Slimbox gallery , when there is more than one image to display .

Many transitions require a longer execution time to look good , so you should adjust the resizeDuration option above as well .
Default is MooTools ’ default transition , sineInOut .

Inside the text , {x} will be replaced by the current image index , and {y} will be replaced by the total number of images .
Set it to false ( boolean value , without quotes ) or " " to disable the counter display .
Default is " Image {x} of {y} " .

Transitions .
Elastic .
easeOut , captionAnimationDuration : 0 , counterText : " Image {x} sur {y} " , closeKeys : [ 27 , 70 ] , nextKeys : [ 39 , 83 ] }
2 . Include the CSS file in the header of your page , or add it to an existing CSS style sheet :
< link rel= " stylesheet " href= " css/slimbox.css " type= " text /css " media= " screen " />
Or , if you are using a right - to - left language :
< link rel= " stylesheet " href= " css/slimbox-rtl.css " type= " text /css " media= " screen " />
If you keep the provided CSS as is , you must place the 4 required images in the same folder as the CSS file .
Of course you can change the images or move them to another place , then you just need to edit the CSS URLs ( and the image width and height for the “ Close ” image ) to reflect your changes .
You do n’t even need to edit the javascript .
You can also change the fonts for the caption and the image counter , the width of the border around the lightbox and the caption , the margins in the caption and every color .
You must not add new CSS rules .
Activate
Add the rel=" lightbox " attribute to the links pointing to your full - sized images .
Use the optional title attribute if you want to show a caption :
< a href= " images /image - 1.jpg " rel= " lightbox " title= " my caption " > image # 1 </a>
You can even use HTML in the caption if you want .
You must replace the < and > characters with HTML entities and use single quotes instead of double quotes .
For sets of related images that you want to group and make navigable , add a group name to the rel attribute just after the “ lightbox ” word , for example :
< a href= " images/image - 1.jpg " rel= " lightbox - atomium " > image # 1 </a > < a href= " images/image - 2.jpg " rel= " lightbox - atomium " > image # 2 </a > < a href= " images/image -3.jpg " rel= " lightbox -atomium " > image # 3 </a>
It is not recommended to use square brackets “ [ ] ” around group names in the rel attribute like the original Lightbox script does because these characters are invalid for XHTML and XML attributes , meaning that your web page would not validate against these standards .
API for Javascript programming
Additionally , Slimbox also allows you to :
Launch Slimbox directly from Javascript code to display a single image or a collection of images .
Register any link or DOM element for opening Slimbox when clicking .
element for opening Slimbox when clicking .
Change the way the image URL and description are retrieved from DOM elements .
and description are retrieved from elements .
Create custom image groups based on any criteria .
Please read the complete API documentation to learn how to do this .
The possibilities are limitless .

Changelog
v1.8 ( 2011-08 - 21 ) , requires MooTools >= 1.3 .
Updated core code and plugins for mootools 1.3 , including the usage of CSS selectors instead of filtering functions .
selectors instead of filtering functions .
Added CSS file for full support of right - to - left languages .
Everything is inverted , including “ previous ” and “ next ” buttons .
v1.71 ( 2009 -11-19 )
Now Slimbox does not activate by default on mobile devices .

Sen Bennett is barred by state law from running as an independent
The conservative Tea Party movement in the US has blocked a three - term Republican senator from Utah , Bob Bennett , in his bid for re-election .
Sen Bennett came third at a Republican Party convention in Salt Lake City .
The two challengers , one backed by the Tea Party , will face each other in a primary next month for the right to contest November 's Midterm elections .
It is the first major victory for the grassroots movement that objects to big government and opposes high spending .
I would n't have cast any of them any differently even if I had known at the time they were going to cost me my career
Senator Bob Bennett Sen Bennett was criticised by Tea Party activists for supporting the Wall Street bail - out , co-sponsoring a bipartisan bill mandating health insurance coverage and aggressively seeking funding " earmarks " for his state .
" The political atmosphere obviously has been toxic and it's very clear that some of the votes that I have cast have added to the toxic environment , " he told reporters after Saturday 's convention vote .
" Looking back on them , with one or two very minor exceptions , I would n't have cast any of them any differently even if I had known at the time they were going to cost me my career . "
TEA PARTY
The movement takes its name from the 1773 protest against British taxation , the Boston Tea Party American colonists rebelled against attempts by Britain to impose parliamentary taxes on them without allowing the colonists representation in the British parliament
The modern - day Tea Party is described as a grassroots movement that supports limited government and opposes high government spending
The informal movement is unified against President Barack Obama 's healthcare proposals , his economic stimulus package and other aspects of his agenda Sen Bennett is barred by state law from running as an independent , but he has not ruled out standing as a write - in candidate - whose name does not appear on the ballot and so must be written on the ballot by the voters .
" I do think I still have a lot of juice left in me , " he added .
The two candidates in June 's primary , businessman Tim Bridgewater and Tea Party - backed lawyer Mike Lee , both claimed during the campaign that they were better suited to rein in government spending than Sen Bennett .
" There is a mood that has swept across this country and has certainly swept across Utah that is demanding a new generation of leaders .
Leaders committed to constitutionally limited government , " Mr Lee told the Reuters news agency .
Correspondents say the winner of the Republican nomination is all but guaranteed victory in November because Utah is so conservative .

Over -zealous doctors are one of the major causes of death after a heart attack .
Their aggressive interventions - such as angioplasty and clot - dissolving drugs - double the chances of the patient dying after he has survived a heart attack or heart failure .
It 's all to do with timing , researchers from the Quebec Healthcare Assessment Agency in Montreal have discovered .
Aggressive treatments on the heart - attack patient are supposed to be carried out within a very short time of him being admitted to hospital .
Done immediately , the interventions can be life - savers - but even a delay of a few minutes can kill the patient .
Techniques such as angioplasty are supposed to be carried out within 90 minutes , but the researchers discovered that 68 per cent of the operations took place after that optimum time , and clot - dissolving drugs were given after the recommended 30 - minute window in 54 per cent of cases .
As a result , the patients given late treatment were twice as likely to die as those given the same treatments within the recommended timeframe .

Prime Minister David Cameron has welcomed Conservative predecessor Baroness Thatcher back to 10 Downing Street for a reception in her honour .
They shook hands and waved at photographers before entering the building but did not answer questions .
A smiling Mr Cameron said : " It 's good to have her back here . "
Baroness
Thatcher , 84 , is one of the first guests to be hosted in Downing Street since the coalition entered office last month .
She wore a light blue dress and coat for her meeting with Mr Cameron , emerging from Number 10 some 45 minutes after going into the building .
Labour 's Gordon Brown also hosted her in Downing Street after taking office in 2007 .
In 2005 Baroness Thatcher , prime minister from 1979 until 1990 , was advised by doctors that she should not make public speeches in the wake of some minor strokes .
She became the first living prime minister to be honoured with a statue in the House of Commons in 2007 .
Baroness
Thatcher was last in 10 Downing Street in November last year when she attended the unveiling of her portrait .
By Robert Samuelson - May 10 , 2010
WASHINGTON --
What we 're seeing in Greece is the death spiral of the welfare state .
This is n't Greece 's problem alone , and that 's why its crisis has rattled global stock markets and threatens economic recovery .
Virtually every advanced nation , including the United States , faces the same prospect .
Aging populations have been promised huge health and retirement benefits , which countries have n't fully covered with taxes .
The reckoning has arrived in Greece , but it awaits most wealthy societies .
Americans dislike the term " welfare state " and substitute the bland word " entitlements . "
The vocabulary does n't alter the reality .
Countries cannot overspend and overborrow forever .
By delaying hard decisions about spending and taxes , governments maneuver themselves into a cul de sac .
To be sure , Greece 's plight is usually described as a European crisis -- especially for the euro , the common money used by 16 countries -- and this is true .
But only up to a point .
Euro coins and notes were introduced in 2002 .
The currency clearly has n't lived up to its promises .
It was supposed to lubricate faster economic growth by eliminating the cost and confusion of constantly converting between national currencies .
More important , it would promote political unity .
With a common currency , people would feel " European . "
Their identities as Germans , Italians and Spaniards would gradually blend into a continental identity .
None of this has happened .
Economic growth in the " euro area " ( the countries using the currency ) averaged 2.1 percent from 1992 to 2001 and 1.7 percent from 2002 to 2008 .
Multiple currencies were never a big obstacle to growth ; high taxes , pervasive regulations and generous subsidies were .
As for political unity , the euro is now dividing Europeans .
The Greeks are rioting .
The countries making $ 145 billion of loans to Greece -- particularly the Germans -- resent the costs of the rescue .
A single currency could no more subsume national identities than drinking Coke could make people American .
If other euro countries ( Portugal , Spain , Italy ) suffer Greece 's fate -- lose market confidence and can't borrow at plausible rates -- there would be a wider crisis .
But the central cause is not the euro , even if it has meant Greece can't depreciate its own currency to ease the economic pain .
Budget deficits and debt are the real problems ; and these stem from all the welfare benefits ( unemployment insurance , old - age assistance , health insurance ) provided by modern governments .
Countries everywhere already have high budget deficits , aggravated by the recession .
Greece is exceptional only by degree .
In 2009 , its budget deficit was 13.6 percent of its gross domestic product ( a measure of its economy ) ; its debt , the accumulation of past deficits , was 115 percent of GDP .
Spain 's deficit was 11.2 percent of GDP , its debt 56.2 percent ; Portugal 's figures were 9.4 percent and 76.8 percent .
Comparable figures for the United States -- calculated slightly differently -- were 9.9 percent and 53 percent .
There are no hard rules as to what 's excessive , but financial markets -- the banks and investors that buy government bonds -- are obviously worried .
Aging populations make the outlook worse .
In Greece , the 65 - and - over population is projected to go from 18 percent of the total in 2005 to 25 percent in 2030 .
For Spain , the increase is from 17 percent to 25 percent .
The welfare state 's death spiral is this :
Almost anything governments might do with their budgets threatens to make matters worse by slowing the economy or triggering a recession .
By allowing deficits to balloon , they risk a financial crisis as investors one day -- no one knows when -- doubt governments ' ability to service their debts and , as with Greece , refuse to lend except at exorbitant rates .
Cutting welfare benefits or raising taxes all would , at least temporarily , weaken the economy .
Perversely , that would make paying the remaining benefits harder .
Greece illustrates the bind .
To gain loans from other European countries and the International Monetary Fund , it embraced budget austerity .
Average pension benefits will be cut 11 percent ; wages for government workers will be cut 14 percent ; the basic rate for the value added tax will rise from 21 percent to 23 percent .
These measures will plunge Greece into a deep recession .
In 2009 , unemployment was about 9 percent ; some economists expect it to peak near 19 percent .
If only a few countries faced these problems , the solution would be easy .
Unlucky countries would trim budgets and resume growth by exporting to healthier nations .
But developed countries represent about half the world economy ; most have overcommitted welfare states .
They might defuse the dangers by gradually trimming future benefits in a way that reassured financial markets .
In practice , they have n't done that ; indeed , President Obama 's health program expands benefits .
What happens if all these countries are thrust into Greece 's situation ?
One answer -- another worldwide economic collapse -- explains why dawdling is so risky .
The Obama administration has announced plans to regulate the Internet through the Federal Communications Commission , extending its authority over broadband providers to police web traffic , enforcing " net neutrality . "
Last week , a congressional hearing exposed an effort to give another agency — the Federal Election Commission — unprecedented power to regulate political speech online .
At a House Administration Committee hearing last Tuesday , Patton Boggs attorney William McGinley explained that the sloppy statutory language in the " DISCLOSE Act " would extend the FEC 's control over broadcast communications to all " covered communications , " including the blogosphere .
The DISCLOSE Act 's purpose , according to Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Chris Van Hollen and other " reformers , " is simply to require disclosure of corporate and union political speech after the Supreme Court 's January decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission held that the government could not ban political expenditures by companies , nonprofit groups , and labor unions .
The bill , however , would radically redefine how the FEC regulates political commentary .
A section of the DISCLOSE Act would exempt traditional media outlets from coordination regulations , but the exemption does not include bloggers , only " a communication appearing in a news story , commentary , or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station , newspaper , magazine or other periodical publication … "
In Citizens United , the Supreme Court explicitly rejected disparate treatment of media corporations and other corporations ( including nonprofit groups ) in campaign finance law .
" Differential treatment of media corporations and other corporations cannot be squared with the First Amendment , " Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority .
No legitimate justification exists for excluding media corporations from regulations on political speech applicable to other corporations , unless the goal is to gain the support of editorial boards funded by the New York Times Co .
The DISCLOSE Act would ban U.S. subsidiaries from speaking if foreign nationals own 20 percent of a company 's voting shares .
Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim owns a 7 percent stake in The New York Times Co. — yet the New York Times would not be restricted if other non-citizens owned 13 percent of the company 's stock .
The Times editorial board expressly advocates the election or defeat of candidates , acts of political speech worth thousands of dollars , yet it is exempted from similar regulations imposed on other companies wishing to speak out about candidates .
The Times also writes unsigned , anonymous attacks , yet the DISCLOSE
Act would compel the political speech and identification of nonprofit groups : a bulky , filmed disclaimer estimated to be 2 - 3 times longer than candidates ' disclaimers .
All this has n't stopped the Times and other dead - tree media outlets from enthusiastically endorsing the DISCLOSE Act .
Perhaps the Times scribes would n't be so rah - rah about these regulations if they realized they would give government the power to regulate political speech on the Web and determine which companies are " media " — meaning exempt from regulation — and which are " political " — meaning heavily regulated .
The House version of the DISCLOSE Act , expected to be marked - up next week , includes the definitions " communication " and " covered communication , " which differs from the term " public communication " adopted by the FEC in a 2006 rule exempting online speech from government control .
When McGinley and the Center for Competitive Politics pointed this out amid the Democrats ' rush to pass this poorly - written bill , " reformers " attacked the messengers .
In a post called " Who would 've known that the DISCLOSE Act calls for burning books , regulating the Internet — and even creates death panels ? "
Public Citizen lobbyist Craig Holman compared pointing out a serious consequence of sloppy statutory language in this campaign finance bill to " invent[ing ] the myth that the [ health care bill ] would create the infamous ' death panels . ' "
The Brennan Center for Justice 's Ciara Torres - Spelliscy accused us of " a blatant attempt to kick sand in the eyes of lawmakers , " and attempted to deny the plain meaning of the statutory language .
Nonetheless , she admitted that " the FEC is most likely to stand by the 2006 Internet rules and only reach PAID political banner ads ; not bloggers . "
( Emphasis added . )
The response of " reformers " to serious questions about a bill imposing civil and criminal penalties for engaging in political speech would be shocking if it was n't so typical .
Most likely is n't good enough for people who want to speak out in politics without threat of jail time and hefty fines .
There 's little reason to trust the " good government " crowd on this .
When the issue of internet regulation first came up after passage of the McCain - Feingold law in 2002 , the goo - goos denounced a deregulated Internet as a " loophole " in campaign finance law , a " poison pill , " " anti-reform , " and a " step backwards . "
In court filings , they called the Internet " a favored conduit for special interests to fund soft money and stealth issue ads into federal campaigns . "
While most pro-regulation groups eventually endorsed the FEC regulations exempting the Internet amidst a public backlash , this was simply a tactical consideration to head off passage of the Online Freedom of Speech Act of 2006 , which would have codified a broad exemption for political speech online ( " reformers " unanimously opposed the bill ) .
Solicitor General Elena Kagan , who President Barack Obama nominated to the Supreme Court last week , argued at the rehearing of Citizens United that " the FEC has never applied this statute to a book , " referring to the now - abolished corporate source prohibition on independent speech .
The FEC , though , launched an investigation into a book George Soros wrote in 2004 advocating the defeat of President George W. Bush .
Chief Justice John Roberts did n't find Kagan 's argument convincing : " We do n't put our First Amendment rights in the hands of FEC bureaucrats ; and if you say that you are not going to apply it to a book , what about a pamphlet ? "
Kagan responded that political pamphlets could be banned .
Last Thursday , after meeting with the newly - minted nominee , Sen. Arlen Specter ( D - Penn . ) told reporters that he felt more comfortable about Kagan 's views because " we talked about the Citizens United case and she said she thought the court was not sufficiently deferential to Congress . "
Now that Democrats in Congress seek to ram through an expansive regulatory regime for regulating political speech by Independence Day ( no joke ) , it seems Kagan would defer to Congress 's wisdom on such restrictions rather than the plain text of the First Amendment : " Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press . "
If Congress can ban political TV ads and pamphlets , why not blogs ?

Source of ancient carbon ' burp ' detected
Scientists have detected what they think is the source of a huge carbon ' burp ' that helped end Earth 's last ice age .
Australian geoscientist Dr Stewart Fallon from the Australian National University in Canberra and colleagues report their findings today in Science .
As ice sheets melted at the end of the last ice age , around 19,500 years ago , CO2 gas in the atmosphere jumped by 50 % .
Scientists have presumed this sudden influx came from a release of CO2 gas previously trapped in the ocean , but until now the evidence for this remained elusive .
Fallon and colleagues have now found evidence trapped in the shells of tiny organisms called foraminifera , that once lived in the ocean .
The researchers compared the carbon isotope ratio in surface - and bottom - dwelling foraminifera .
The findings suggest that during the last ice age , a pool of deep water developed in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean that was much older than surface sea waters at that time .
" What appears to have happened is deep water was being isolated from the water above it , " says Fallon .
Over thousands of years , as cold water dropped to the bottom of the ocean it slowly became enriched in dissolved CO2 from sinking decaying organic matter , the researchers say .
Eventually , says Fallon , the CO2 was released , possibly because retreating sea ice exposed a larger ocean surface area to bursts of wind .
He says water moved by the wind may have been replaced by deeper water below , leading to upwelling and more mixing from the bottom up .
The researchers say their findings support the hypothesis that glacial - interglacial increases in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 arise from rapid release of the gas sequestered in the deep sea , primarily the Southern Ocean .
' Controversial '
Geologist Professor Mike Sandiford , director of the Melbourne Energy Institute at the University of Melbourne says the result is " interesting but controversial " .
Recent radiocarbon analyses from Chilean sites failed to find evidence of the missing Southern Ocean CO2 , he says .
" There are challenges in getting sufficient data to really point to [ the missing source ] , " says Sandiford .
" What they 've done here is show there was a dramatic change in C14 at this time , so we must have an ocean reservoir that was out of contact with the atmosphere for several thousand years .
That 's a much longer time than usual . "
Fallon agrees more data is needed as the data gathered so far accounts for only half of the discrepancy in carbon .
" We need to get more information from additional deep sea cores to work this one out fully , " he says .
But he says getting obtaining deep sea cores containing preserved foraminifera is tricky .
University of Sydney geologist Dr John
You says the results are " important " .
" Discussions of oceanic processes such as water circulation , mixing and upwelling / downwelling are most speculative since [ during ] glaciation ocean conditions could be different from the present , " says You .
He says the research helps to " fill the gap " in the transition between glaciation and deglaciation between 25,000 to 10,000 years ago .
With the launch of Steam for the Mac , a lot of attention has been focused on the relative performance of Mac gaming .
Early benchmarks have shown that the same Steam games run at a significantly slower framerate under Mac OS X than under Windows .
The reason for the discrepancy has been described as due to relatively immaturity of drivers on the OS X side as well as other slowdowns .
Some modest improvements may be seen with the upcoming release of Mac OS X 10.6.4 , but more dramatic improvements remain in the pipeline .
Responding to concerns about performance on some Mac Steam games , Valve employee rbarris provides some reassurance that further performance updates will be coming :
Performance is going to improve as drivers are updated .
I would expect modest improvements in short term and larger ones in longer term .
No , I can't put dates on them .
We are making a lot of progress is identifying specific issues that need work inside the game and inside OpenGL and drivers .
Apple , ATI and NVIDIA are all involved .
Steam is said to be working with Apple , ATI and NVIDIA on these optimizations for improved gaming performance .
Driver - level features should arrive over time with future Mac OS X updates .
At a time when many news organizations are cutting back , the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is continuing its efforts to bolster in - depth journalism in public media .
The corporation said on Tuesday that it was giving “ Frontline ” a $ 6 million , two - year grant that would allow it to expand its investigative programming to a year - round schedule on PBS stations .
The money , plus an additional $ 1.6 million that is still being raised , will pay for seven to eight new programs each year , so the 28 - year - old show will no longer have to take a summer hiatus .
The expansion was announced in Austin , Tex. , at PBS ’s annual meeting .
The corporation ’s investment was “ brought on by the recognition that there ’s a crisis in journalism and there ’s a real call for public media to step up , ” David Fanning , the executive producer of “ Frontline , ” said in a telephone interview before the announcement .
“ The summer hiatus did stop us from doing certain stories , ” he added .
The new episodes , interspersed throughout the year , will include three stories an hour , not the usual hourlong “ Frontline ” investigations .
“ With shorter pieces , you do n’t have the high bar of having to justify a full budget , ” Mr. Fanning said .
Nick Vujicic ( pronounced Voy- a - chich ) was born in Australia on December 4th , 1982 .
Doctors were shocked when he was delivered , as Nick has no arms nor legs .
This was completely unexpected , ultrasounds did n’t show any complications or issues .
As you can imagine , life was tough for Nick .
Growing up Nick was teased and by age 8 , Nick contemplated suicide .
Eventually , Nick realized that limits were self - imposed .
Now Nick travels the world as a motivational speaker and shares his experiences .
Nick can teach us much about what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur when faced with what seem to be impervious obstacles to overcome .
Perspective - Nick said “ You must realize where you are and what you have . ”
You ca n’t let yourself see obstacles , they will only serve to demotivate you .

The crowd applauses .
He then went on to say “ she just does n’t know it yet . ”

The message is clear .
Do n’t be afraid to dream big .
Apple was almost bankrupt , Google was n’t taken seriously , and Facebook was created in a dorm room .
Dreams can help establish a purpose .
Dream big .
Perseverance - Never ever give up .

THE relationship between the world 's biggest web company and Australia 's communications minister appears to have broken down entirely .
Google Australia head of engineering Alan Noble today said the search giant was all but resigned to the fact that Stephen Conroy had singled it out as the poster boy for everything bad about the internet because of its stance on the Government 's controversial internet filtering policy .
" Right now , he 's decided that filtering 's all about Google , for some reason , " he said .
" Singling out companies like Google or Facebook is distracting .
It 's not about Google , it 's about you , me , all Australians . "
Mr Noble said Google had been in talks with Senator Conroy about the policy for up to two years , but they had recently broken down .
" We 've had extensive discussions with Senator Conroy through the past two years , " he said at the company 's I/O event in Sydney .
" We 've been pretty clear in our views about filtering and stuck to our guns but clearly Senator Conroy is pushing his view very hard .
" Right now , no , I do n't think he is listening ( to us ) . "
Mr Noble 's comments came after Senator Conroy last night labelled the company as " creepy " and accused it of " the single greatest breach in the history of privacy " .
Senator Conroy was referring to Google 's collection of Wi-Fi data with its Street View cars while gathering data for the mapping service .
Google co-founder Sergey Brin last week said the company had " screwed up " by accidentally collecting the data , which attracted the ire of privacy organisations around the world .
Senator Conroy last night disputed collection of the data was an accident .
" It was actually quite deliberate ... the computer program that collected it was designed to collect this information , " Senator Conroy told a Senate committee hearing .
However some commentators , including Greens communication spokesman Scott Ludlam , understood the attack to be " payback " for Google 's stance on internet filtering .
" Google 's harvesting of unsecured Wi -Fi data has been rightfully condemned worldwide , " Senator Ludlam said .
" But you get the sense that this is just a convenient foil for the minister 's frustration at the rising opposition to the net filter . "
Under the Government 's internet filtering plan , internet service providers like Telstra and Optus would be forced to block access to a secret list of banned web pages .
One reason Google has been in talks with the Government over the plan is because of the problems presented by its YouTube video sharing website .
Because of YouTube 's popularity , to filter it in the same way as other sites could slow down internet speeds .
Earlier this year media reports claimed Google had refused a Government request for the company to enforce its filtering policy on YouTube internally .
However Google Australia head of policy Iarla Flynn last month told news.com .au the company would wait until legislation was introduced before making a decision .
" It 's difficult to give an absolute answer when even draft legislation has not been released , " he said .
" But like any law - abiding company , we would consider a request to remove material in the light of what a law actually said . "
The Government is expected to introduce legislation for its filtering plan later this year .
The world 's strongest animal , the copepod , is barely 1 mm long .
It is also the world 's fastest animal and the most abundant multicellular animal on the planet .
So what is it that makes the copepod so successful ?
" The copepods ' evolutionary success should be seen in relation to their ability to flee from predators .
Their escape jump is hugely powerful and effective , " says Professor Thomas Kiørboe from the National Institute of Aquatic Resources at the Technical University of Denmark ( DTU Aqua ) .
Together with researchers from DTU Aqua and DTU Physics and with the aid of high - speed video recordings , Thomas Kiørboe has been able to give a detailed picture of the copepods ' escape jump .
The powerful jump has made an incredible impression upon the researchers .
" They jump at a rate of half a metre per second , and that 's within a few thousandths of a second , " says Thomas Kiørboe , continuing : " It shows that copepods -- in relation to their size -- are more than 10 times as strong as has been previously documented for any other animal or even [ human - made ] motors ... "
The results of the impressive escape jump have just been published in full in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface .
Fine - tuned swimming legs with superior gearing
The researchers have now concluded that the strength of the copepod is 10 - 30 times that measured in any other species , where the maximum force production is surprisingly constant .
advertisement
" The explanation is that the copepod has two separate propulsion mechanisms , " says Thomas Kiørboe , DTU Aqua .
While other species have just one mechanism for movement ( e.g. a bird 's wings , or a horse 's legs ) , and due to the risk of ' material fatigue ' , there is a maximum limit on the force production in a propulsion mechanism that is used almost constantly .
The copepod has vibrating feeding limbs that create a feeding current , while at the same time allowing it to move or swim almost continously .
In addition , it has 4 - 5 pairs of swimming legs or jumping legs , which allows it to jump in order to escape or to attack .
These are used less frequently and very briefly .
The muscles in the two systems are fairly similar , but the gearing of the jumping mechanism is tuned to short bursts of immense force .
" The copepod does not experience material fatigue , because it has two systems of movement at its disposal .
The swimming legs , which it uses to jump , are finely tuned , and the copepod 's hydro - dynamic design is optimised for high speeds , making the escape jump unusually forceful and fast , " explains Thomas Kiørboe .
Highly developed senses
Even though the copepod is both blind and so tiny that the water feels as thick as syrup , it has managed to solve the engineering feat of fleeing quickly and efficiently from predators .
The solution is the two propulsion mechanisms with different gearing .
Its well - developed senses interpret extremely quickly signals from the ambient and sends the message on to the swimming legs .
This is made possible by a nerve transmission system that is exceptionally rapid for an invertebrate animal , and which can be explained by the special design of the neural pathways .
The streamlined , hydro - dynamic shape and pure muscular strength of the copepod is what explains its most powerful jump .

The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has closed its investigation into the $ 750 million Google / AdMob buyout and given a green light to the deal .
The reason is simple : Apple , Apple , and more Apple .
In its official statement ( PDF ) , the FTC mentions " Apple " 10 times in a page and half , all because of Apple 's own decision to launch a mobile ad network called iAd .
" The Commission reached this decision based on important developments in the mobile advertising marketplace , particularly actions by Apple that should mitigate the anticompetitive effects of Google ’s AdMob acquisition , " said the FTC .
The vote in favor of closing the investigation was 5 - 0 .
The Commission had been concerned over Google 's dominance in online ads ; purchasing one of the big iPhone ad players would have extended that dominance into the mobile space .
Apple 's announcement changes the game , though : " As a result of Apple ’s entry , AdMob ’s success to date on the iPhone platform is unlikely to be an accurate predictor of AdMob ’s competitive significance going forward , whether AdMob is owned by Google or not .
This is particularly important given that AdMob ’s revenue and market share are derived largely from the iPhone platform . "
Google , which has of late taken to publicly calling for quick action on the deal and vowed to fight a negative ruling , was predictably thrilled .
" The decision is great news for the mobile advertising ecosystem as a whole , " said the company in a statement today .
" As mobile phone usage increases , growth in mobile advertising is only going to accelerate .
This benefits mobile developers and publishers who will get better advertising solutions , marketers who will find new ways to reach consumers , and users who will get better ads and more free content . "
Over at AdMob , CEO Omar Hamoui said that he was " extremely pleased with today ’s decision from the Federal Trade Commission to clear Google ’s acquisition of AdMob .
Over the past six months we 've received a great deal of support from across the mobile industry — and we deeply appreciate it .
Our focus is now on working with the team at Google to quickly close the deal . "
BP ’s first effort to contain the oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico failed this weekend .
They are now looking at a plan B and plan C , and are so “ befuddled ” may even be open to attempting “ Plan 9 from Outer Space . ”
Comedy Central ’s Stephen Colbert untangles the confusing oil company spin Monday and determined “ no one knows what the fuck they ’re doing . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
A four - story , 100 - ton box was lowered Friday to the seabed to try to capture most of the oil and allow it to be funneled up to a ship on the surface , but it was rendered useless on Sunday when ice crystals formed in its domed roof .
BP found a way to spin this unsuccessful attempt as something other than a failure .
“ I would n’t say it ’s failed yet .
What I would say is what we attempted to do last night did n’t work , ” Doug Suttles , BP ’s Chief Operating Officer said Saturday .
“ Okay .
It has n’t failed .
It has not failed .
Just like I would n’t say oil has spilled .
It just did n’t stay in the rig , ” joked Colbert Monday .
The oil company has articulated plans B and C for dealing with the problem .
BP experts believe a smaller “ top hat ” containment box would not suffer the same problem as the first containment dome because it would not hold so much freezing cold seawater , and they are preparing to drop it into the inky depths to carry out a similar fix to what is unfolding as one the worst oil spills in US history .
ADVERTISEMENT
In tandem with the “ top hat , ” BP is also preparing for a bizarre operation to inject golf balls , tires and other “ junk ” into the main leak , 1,500 meters ( 5,000 feet ) down on the seabed , and then jam it up .
“ We actually pump that material in and plug up the blowout preventer and follow that with heavy fluids followed by cement , ” explained Suttles .
The “ junk shot ” could be risky as experts have warned that tinkering with the blowout preventer — a huge 450 - ton valve system that should have shut off the oil — could see crude shoot out unchecked at 12 times the current rate .

“ Oh .
So no one knows what the f*ck they ’re doing .
It ’s play time in the world of imagination , ” remarked Colbert .
But the crazy ideas do n’t stop there .
One Russian solution is to use a nuclear warhead to stop the leak .
True / Slant ‘s Julia Ioffe flagged the concept presented in Komsomoloskaya Pravda .
According to Ioffe :
ADVERTISEMENT
[ I ] n Soviet times such leaks were plugged with controlled nuclear blasts underground .
The idea is simple , KP writes : “ the underground explosion moves the rock , presses on it , and , in essence , squeezes the well ’s channel . ”
Colbert introduced the “ Oil Containment Solution Randomizer ” Monday , an invention that is sure to provide countless ridiculous ideas for staunching the oil flow .
Colbert ’s device utilizes three wheels .
Each containing a partial solution .
The outer wheel describes choices for how the plug is prepared .
The middle wheel describes what the plug is made of and the inner wheel denotes how it ’s delivered to the spewing wellhead on the sea floor .
ADVERTISEMENT
His first spin solved the problem by delivering “ breaded juggalos ” by way of “ trained dolphins . ”
The next spin suggested “ ultraconcentrated packing peanuts ” delivered by “ monkey submarine . ”
Colbert ’s final spin advised “ bundled used futons ” dispatched by the “ hot chick from Mythbusters . ”

Fairmount and St Viateur Bagels have been in competition since the 1940s
By Katie Beck
BBC World News America , Montreal
Nestled in among the Hassidic Jews and the hipsters in the historically Jewish neighbourhood of Le Plateau Mont - Royal in Montreal a quiet battle has been raging for over five decades .
The war is on .
The prize ?
The title for Montreal 's best bagel and there are two serious contenders .
St Viateur Bagel and Fairmount Bagel , situated a block apart , each claim to be the best bagelry in a city known for its distinctive style of bagels .
The story tracing the origins of Montreal bagels is more folklore than fact and has been smoothed over with years of history .
In 1910 , according to some , two Jewish immigrants arrived in Montreal and opened a bagel shop in the Mile End neighbourhood , bringing the old world traditions of hand rolling bagels and baking them in a wood burning oven to Canada for the first time .
Then , as the story goes , the two men had a falling out in the mid 1950s , parted ways and both went on to have successful businesses with loyal customers .
History of the bagel 1683 : First produced by an Austrian baker 1880s : Reaches North America in with Eastern European immigrants 1993 : Americans eat one bagel every two weeks on average
One upstart Erwin Shlafman , the current owner of Fairmount Bagel said there is no dispute over the fact that it was his grandfather , Isadore Shlafman , who brought the first bagel to Montreal .
" My grandfather arrived in Montreal in 1910 .
He looked for a job as a bagel baker but there were n't any .
So he opened his own bakery , " Shlafman explained .
" Then in 1957 , a former employee of my Grandfather who had worked for him opened up the St Viateur bakery . "
According to Shlafman , " It is the Fairmount bakery that is the origin of bagels in Montreal - St Viateur is the upstart . "
A couple of generations later , both bagel shops are still thriving .
Each is open 24 hours a day , churning out a steady stream of bagels being rolled , boiled , and baked to perfection .
Each shop boasts a steady line of eager customers , that often snake out the door and onto the sidewalks .
Robert Morena , the jovial owner of St Viateur Bagel , said the rivalry between the bakeries is civil .
" We have an amicable relationship .
We have our customers , they have theirs and we do n't share many .
Whoever eats Fairmount eats Fairmount and the St. Viateur loyalists eat ours . "

But there are those who do take sides .
One regular customer said she has been buying her bagels from St Viateur 's for 40 years .
" It 's the best , I 'm telling you , " said the regular .
" I have been here for a long long time and they are wonderful .
I used to go to Fairmount but here is the best .
The best , the best , the best . "
Morena certainly agrees with that statement .
" We were nominated for one of the Wonders of the World and people were voting like crazy .
Montrealers love this place .
We give them the best bagel and they keep coming back , " he said .
Around the corner , Fairmount Bagel has equally enthusiastic customers .
Raymond Younian , who is familiar with both , said there is no contest .
Fairmont customers enjoy the huge variety of bagels " These are the best , " said Younian holding a brown paper bag full of Fairmount bagels .
" I have come here , I 've tried St Viateur Bagel and other bagel shops but we always make a detour to come here to Fairmount bagel .
You can not compare the taste to any other bagel . "
Shlafman said the secret to his success has been passed down through the generations .
" In my place we are still making bagels the way my grandfather made them .
My grandfather taught my father and my father taught me . "
With so much history behind them , these bakeries have become beloved landmarks in Montreal and for some , choosing between a Fairmount or a St Viateur bagel is tantamount to a betrayal .
Robert Miller who frequents both bakeries refused to say which he prefers .
" I 'm not going to go there .
They 've both been in business for a long long time and I 'm not going to go there . "

WHEN the federal government announced plain packaging for cigarettes by January 2012 , tobacco companies cried foul .
They warned a legal battle could ensue , and that plain packaging would breach trademark law , international trade agreements and intellectual property rights .
The world will be watching Australia to see how the pioneering legislation progresses .
Anti-smoking campaigners claim plain packs and more prominent health warnings will particularly discourage teenage smokers , who are more likely to view a cigarette brand as a status symbol .
Since 1980 , smoking rates in Australia have dropped from 34 per cent to 19 per cent in 2007 .
But the war is not yet won : 4000 Victorians die of smoking - related conditions each year , and 750,000 Victorians still smoke .
Since anti-smoking campaigns began , smokers and tobacco companies have argued that restrictions have infringed civil liberties .
They have attempted to persuade citizens they have a " right to smoke ' ' , and that the nanny state is taking away that right .
But bans on smoking in bars , restaurants and the workplace have eventually been accepted - even by smokers - despite an initial flurry of protest .
This suggests many smokers are ambivalent about their habit , and do not wish to inflict harmful cigarette smoke on others .
Vic Zurek , the head of the newly formed group , Australian Smokers Rights , expressed this ambivalence when he said : " I agree with helping people quit if they want to and to try to stop kids taking up the habit , but I do n't agree in a free country in forcing people . ''
Measures introduced so far have made it more difficult and expensive to smoke , and have made smoking less socially acceptable , but cigarettes have not been outlawed for those over 18 .
It can certainly be argued , however , that cigarette companies are behaving immorally by distributing such a harmful product .
'' Working people do n't have much in life ; a beer and a cigarette are just a couple of small pleasures and we can't even do that any more , '' says Mr Zurek .
Measures making it more difficult to smoke seek to protect the community 's wellbeing , but for an addict this self - evident truth can be difficult to see .
Meanwhile , tobacco companies continue to make big returns .
The profits of Philip Morris and Imperial Tobacco grew by 20 per cent in Australia in 2009 .
Big tobacco values money , not morality , with little respect for the truth and even less consideration for the genuine rights of their customers .
Surely the right to life , to health , is more significant than a ' ' right to smoke ' ' .
A Synopsis of the

For centuries there was no such conflict .
In the 19th century the land of Palestine was inhabited by a multicultural population – approximately 86 percent Muslim , 10 percent Christian , and 4 percent Jewish – living in peace .
[ 1 ]
Zionism
In the late 1800s a group in Europe decided to colonize this land .
Known as Zionists , they represented an extremist minority of the Jewish population .
Their goal was to create a Jewish homeland , and they considered locations in Africa and the Americas , before settling on Palestine . [ 2 ]
Historic Palestine
more maps
At first , this immigration created no problems .
However , as more and more Zionists immigrated to Palestine – many with the express wish of taking over the land for a Jewish state – the indigenous population became increasingly alarmed .
Eventually , fighting broke out , with escalating waves of violence .
Hitler ’s rise to power , combined with Zionist activities to sabotage efforts to place Jewish refugees in western countries [ 3 ] , led to increased Jewish immigration to Palestine , and conflict grew .
UN Partition Plan Finally , in 1947 the United Nations decided to intervene .
However , rather than adhering to the principle of “ self - determination of peoples , ” in which the people themselves create their own state and system of government , the UN chose to revert to the medieval strategy whereby an outside power divides up other people ’s land .
UN Plan of Partition
more maps Under considerable Zionist pressure , the UN recommended giving away 55 % of Palestine to a Jewish state – despite the fact that this group represented only about 30 % of the total population , and owned under 7 % of the land .
1947-1949 War
While it is widely reported that the resulting war eventually included five Arab armies , less well known is the fact that throughout this war Zionist forces outnumbered all Arab and Palestinian combatants combined – often by a factor of two to three .
Moreover , Arab armies did not invade Israel – virtually all battles were fought on land that was to have been the Palestinian state .
Finally , it is significant to note that Arab armies entered the conflict only after Zionist forces had committed 16 massacres , including the grisly massacre of over 100 men , women , and children at Deir Yassin .
Future Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin , head of one of the Jewish terrorist groups , described this as “ splendid , ” and stated : “ As in Deir Yassin , so everywhere , we will attack and smite the enemy .
God , God ,
Thou has chosen us for conquest . ”
Zionist forces committed 33 massacres altogether .
[ 4 ]
By the end of the war , Israel had conquered 78 percent of Palestine ; three - quarters of a million Palestinians had been made refugees ; over 500 towns and villages had been obliterated ; and a new map was drawn up , in which every city , river and hillock received a new , Hebrew name , as all vestiges of the Palestinian culture were to be erased .
For decades Israel denied the existence of this population , former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir once saying : “ There were no such thing as Palestinians . ” [ 5 ]
1967 Occupation
more maps 1967 War & USS Liberty In 1967 , Israel conquered still more land .
Following the “ Six Day War , ” in which Israeli forces launched a highly successful surprise attack on Egypt , Israel occupied the final 22 % of Palestine that had eluded it in 1948 – the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Since , according to international law it is inadmissible to acquire territory by war , these are occupied territories and do not belong to Israel .
It also occupied parts of Egypt ( since returned ) and Syria ( which remain under occupation ) .
Also during the Six Day War , Israel attacked a US Navy ship , the USS Liberty , killing and injuring over 200 American servicemen .
President Lyndon Johnson recalled rescue flights , saying that he did not want to “ embarrass an ally . ”
( In 2004 a high - level commission chaired by Admiral Thomas Moorer , former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , found this attack to be “ an act of war against the United States , ” a fact few news media have reported . ) [ 6 ]
Current Conflict
There are two primary issues at the core of this continuing conflict .
First , there is the inevitably destabilizing effect of trying to maintain an ethnically preferential state , particularly when it is largely of foreign origin . [ 7 ]
The original population of what is now Israel was 96 percent Muslim and Christian , yet , these refugees are prohibited from returning to their homes in the self - described Jewish state ( and those within Israel are subjected to systematic discrimination ) .
[ 8 ]
Second , Israel ’s continued military occupation and confiscation of privately owned land in the West Bank , and control over Gaza , are extremely oppressive , with Palestinians having minimal control over their lives . [ 9 ]
Thousands of Palestinian men , women , and children are held in Israeli prisons . [ 10 ]
Few of them have had a legitimate trial ; Physical abuse and torture are frequent . [ 11 ]
Palestinian borders ( even internal ones ) are controlled by Israeli forces . [ 12 ]
Periodically men , women , and children are strip searched [ 13 ] ; people are beaten ; women in labor are prevented from reaching hospitals ( at times resulting in death ) [ 14 ] ; food and medicine are blocked from entering Gaza , producing an escalating humanitarian crisis .
Israeli forces invade almost daily , injuring , kidnapping , and sometimes killing inhabitants . [ 15 ]
According to the Oslo peace accords of 1993 , these territories were supposed to finally become a Palestinian state .
However , after years of Israel continuing to confiscate land and conditions steadily worsening , the Palestinian population rebelled .
( The Barak offer , widely reputed to be generous , was anything but . [ 16 ] )
This uprising , called the “ Intifada ” ( Arabic for “ shaking off ” ) began at the end of September 2000 .
U.S. Involvement Largely due to special - interest lobbying , U.S. taxpayers give Israel an average of $ 8 million per day , and since its creation have given more U.S. funds to Israel than to any other nation . [ 17 ]
As Americans learn about how Israel is using our tax dollars , many are calling for an end to this expenditure .

In many places Zionists manipulated local Jewish populations into going to Palestine / Israel , in some cases using subterfuge and terrorism .
Sami Hadawi , Bitter Harvest , p. 37 : “ Commenting , author Erskine H. Childers , wrote , “ one of the most massively important features of the entire Palestine struggle was that Zionism deliberately arranged that the plight of the wretched survivors of Hitlerism should be a ‘ moral argument ’ which the West had to accept .
This was done by seeing to it that Western countries did not open their doors , widely and immediately , to the inmates of the DP .
( displaced persons ) camps .
It is incredible , that so grave and grim a campaign has received so little attention in accounts of the Palestine struggle – it was a campaign that literally shaped all subsequent history .
It was done by sabotaging specific Western schemes to admit Jewish DPs . ”
A number of authors have discuss Zionist connections with Nazis ; for example : Ben Hecht , Perfidy
Edwin Black , The Transfer Agreement : The Dramatic Story of the Pact Between the Third Reich and Jewish Palestine
Lenni Brenner , 51 Documents : Zionist Collaboration with the Nazis
Hannah Arendt , Eichmann in Jerusalem
Sami Hadawi , in Bitter Harvest 1914 - 79 , pp. 35 - 39 , discusses the use of manipulated , sometimes invented , anti-Semitism in promoting
Zionism , e.g. : “ Ian Gilmour [ wrote ]
‘ In the Arab countries , Jewish difficulties and emigration to Israel were the result not of anti-Semitism
but of Zionist activities and the existence of the state of Israel . ’ ”
Zionism , e.g. : “ Ian Gilmour [ wrote ]
‘ In the Arab countries , Jewish difficulties and emigration to Israel were the result not of anti-Semitism but of Zionist activities and the existence of the state of Israel . ’”
In “ The Jews of Iraq , ” The Link , April - May 1998 , Naeim Giladi describes Zionist activities to push Jews to emigrate to Israel .
He describes this in greater detail in his book : Ben-Gurion ’s Scandals : How the Haganah and the Mossad Eliminated Jews : “ I write this book to tell the American people , and especially the American Jews , that Jews from Islamic lands did not emigrate willingly to Israel ; that , to force them to leave , Jews killed Jews ; and that , to buy time to confiscate ever more Arab lands , Jews on numerous occasions rejected genuine peace initiatives from their Arab neighbors .
I write about what the first prime minister of Israel called ‘ cruel Zionism . ’
I write about it because I was a part of it . ” [ 4 ]

Convey my regards to all the commanders and soldiers .
We shake your hands .
We are all proud of the excellent leadership and the fighting spirit in this great attack .
We stand to attention in memory of the slain .
We lovingly shake the hands of the wounded .

Gordon Brown has told the Independent today that he wants to see an anti-Tory alliance between Labour and the Liberal Democrats .
Lord Mandelson said something similar on the Today programme yesterday .
A Lab -Lib deal is suddenly all the rage – in Labour circles .
I 'm as interested in a Lab - Lib deal as anyone else , but I do n't think it 's going to happen .
Here 's why .
Labour has a secret in this election .
They think they are going to lose .
They think their only hope of retaining power is by some kind of deal with the Lib Dems .
That 's why they are suddenly agreeing with Nick all the time .
Look at the polls .
In today 's two new opinion polls Labour is third on 28 % with Populus in the Times and third on 26 % with YouGov for the daily Sun tracker .
This is beginning to look like a pattern – and unless something significant happens in Thursday 's debate , the pattern could become set in stone .
Labour 's interest in the Lib Dems , in other words , is the interest of the condemned man in a get out of jail free card .
Why should the Lib Dems give this the time of day ?
Search me .
For 13 years , the Labour government in general , and in many respects Brown in particular , has been an implacable foe of co-operation with the Lib Dems .
Brown can't even bring himself to call the Liberal Democrats by their real name ; he calls them the Liberals , rather as some Tories always insist ( or at least used to insist ) on referring not to Labour but the Socialists .
Any anti-Tory alliance proposed by Brown would be an opportunist alliance on his own terms .
In any case , and as the Guardian is reporting today , Labour is very divided , and always has been , about such co-operation .
So what 's in this approach for Nick Clegg ?
Not a lot that I can see .
Lenin 's remark about supporting the government as the rope supports the hanging man comes to mind here .
But in reality , for the Lib Dems to support Labour would solve Labour 's pressing survival problems while creating immense problems for the Lib Dems .
Why bother ?
There are , in fact , some reasons why there may be a window of opportunity for co-operation after 6
May that may not come again so starkly for a long time to come .
A hung parliament on 7 May may be a big moment of opportunity for radical change in the electoral and political system .
By the time of the next election things will look very different .
But look at today 's polls again .
The Lib Dems are first on 34 % in YouGov and second by a single point on 31 % in Populus .
Does that suggest anything ?
To me it suggests that the increasingly real question is not whether the Lib Dems will support a Labour government after 6 May .
It is whether Labour will support a Liberal Democrat government .
Forget about the Lab - Lib deal , in other words , and start thinking about a Lib - Lab one .
If I were Clegg I would sit tight and make Labour sweat .
Brown is not really interested in co-operation .
He is interested in clinging to power .
And if there is one thing I am clear about amid the swirling currents of this election it is that the voters want Brown out , not Brown rescued .
BLOG@CACM Errors in Database Systems , Eventual Consistency , and the CAP Theorem
Recently , there has been considerable renewed interest in the CAP theorem [ 1 ] for database management system ( DBMS ) applications that span multiple processing sites .
In brief , this theorem states that there are three interesting properties that could be desired by DBMS applications :
C : Consistency .
The goal is to allow multisite transactions to have the familiar all - or - nothing semantics , commonly supported by commercial DBMSs .
In addition , when replicas are supported , one would want the replicas to always have consistent states .
A : Availability .
The goal is to support a DBMS that is always up .
In other words , when a failure occurs , the system should keep going , switching over to a replica , if required .
This feature was popularized by Tandem Computers more than 20 years ago .
P : Partition - tolerance .
If there is a network failure that splits the processing nodes into two groups that cannot talk to each other , then the goal would be to allow processing to continue in both subgroups .
The CAP theorem is a negative result that says you cannot simultaneously achieve all three goals in the presence of errors .
Hence , you must pick one objective to give up .
In the NoSQL community , this theorem has been used as the justification for giving up consistency .
Since most NoSQL systems typically disallow transactions that cross a node boundary , then consistency applies only to replicas .
Therefore , the CAP theorem is used to justify giving up consistent replicas , replacing this goal with “ eventual consistency . ”
With this relaxed notion , one only guarantees that all replicas will converge to the same state eventually , i.e. , when network connectivity has been re-established and enough subsequent time has elapsed for replica cleanup .
The justification for giving up C is so that the A and P can be preserved .
The purpose of this blog post is to assert that the above analysis is suspect , and that recovery from errors has more dimensions to consider .
We assume a typical hardware model of a collection of local processing and storage nodes assembled into a cluster using LAN networking .
The clusters , in turn , are wired together using WAN networking .
Let ’s start with a discussion of what causes errors in databases .
The following is at least a partial list :
1 ) Application errors .
The application performed one or more incorrect updates .
Generally , this is not discovered for minutes to hours thereafter .
The database must be backed up to a point before the offending transaction (s ) , and subsequent activity redone .
2) Repeatable DBMS errors .
The DBMS crashed at a processing node .
Executing the same transaction on a processing node with a replica will cause the backup to crash .
These errors have been termed Bohr bugs . [ 2 ]
3 ) Unrepeatable DBMS errors .
The database crashed , but a replica is likely to be ok .
These are often caused by weird corner cases dealing with asynchronous operations , and have been termed Heisenbugs [ 2 ]
4 ) Operating system errors .
The OS crashed at a node , generating the “ blue screen of death . ”
5 ) A hardware failure in a local cluster .
These include memory failures , disk failures , etc .
Generally , these cause a “ panic stop ” by the OS or the DBMS .
However , sometimes these failures appear as Heisenbugs .
6 ) A network partition in a local cluster .
The LAN failed and the nodes can no longer all communicate with each other .
7 ) A disaster .
The local cluster is wiped out by a flood , earthquake , etc .
The cluster no longer exists .
8 ) A network failure in the WAN connecting clusters together .
The WAN failed and clusters can no longer all communicate with each other .
First , note that errors 1 and 2 will cause problems with any high availability scheme .
In these two scenarios , there is no way to keep going ; i.e. , availability is impossible to achieve .
Also , replica consistency is meaningless ; the current DBMS state is simply wrong .
Error 7 will only be recoverable if a local transaction is only committed after the assurance that the transaction has been received by another WAN - connected cluster .
Few application builders are willing to accept this kind of latency .
Hence , eventual consistency cannot be guaranteed , because a transaction may be completely lost if a disaster occurs at a local cluster before the transaction has been successfully forwarded elsewhere .
Put differently , the application designer chooses to suffer data loss when a rare event ( such as a disaster ) occurs , because the performance penalty for avoiding it is too high .
As such , errors 1 , 2 , and 7 are examples of cases for which the CAP theorem simply does not apply .
Any real system must be prepared to deal with recovery in these cases .
The CAP theorem can not be appealed to for guidance .
Let us now turn to cases where the CAP theorem might apply .
Consider error 6 where a LAN partitions .
In my experience , this is exceedingly rare , especially if one replicates the LAN ( as Tandem did ) .
Considering local failures ( 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) , the overwhelming majority cause a single node to fail , which is a degenerate case of a network partition that is easily survived by lots of algorithms .
Hence , in my opinion , one is much better off giving up P rather than sacrificing C. ( In a LAN environment , I think one should choose CA rather than AP ) .
Newer SQL OLTP systems ( e.g. , VoltDB and NimbusDB ) appear to do exactly this .
Next , consider error 8 , a partition in a WAN network .
There is enough redundancy engineered into today ’s WANs that a partition is quite rare .
My experience is that local failures and application errors are way more likely .
Moreover , the most likely WAN failure is to separate a small portion of the network from the majority .
In this case , the majority can continue with straightforward algorithms , and only the small portion must block .
Hence , it seems unwise to give up consistency all the time in exchange for availability of a small subset of the nodes in a fairly rare scenario .
Lastly , consider a slowdown either in the OS , the DBMS , or the network manager .
This may be caused by skew in load , buffer pool issues , or innumerable other reasons .
The only decision one can make in these scenarios is to “ fail ” the offending component ; i.e. , turn the slow response time into a failure of one of the cases mentioned earlier .
In my opinion , this is almost always a bad thing to do .
One simply pushes the problem somewhere else and adds a noticeable processing load to deal with the subsequent recovery .
Also , such problems invariably occur under a heavy load–dealing with this by subtracting hardware is going in the wrong direction .
Obviously , one should write software that can deal with load spikes without failing ; for example , by shedding load or operating in a degraded mode .
Also , good monitoring software will help identify such problems early , since the real solution is to add more capacity .
Lastly , self - reconfiguring software that can absorb additional resources quickly is obviously a good idea .
In summary , one should not throw out the C so quickly , since there are real error scenarios where CAP does not apply and it seems like a bad tradeoff in many of the other situations .

" Degenerate network partitions " is a very good point - in practice i have found that most network partitions in the real world are of this class .
I like to term certain classes of network partitions " trivial " .
By trivial , if there are no clients in the partitioned region , or if there are servers in the partitioned region , it is then trivial .
So it could involve more than one machine , but it then readily handled .
Alaric Snell - Pym
I think a lot of the discussion about distributed database semantics , much like a lot of the discussion about SQL vs. NoSQL , has been somewhat clouded by a shortage of pragmatism .
So an analysis of the CAP theorem in terms of actual practical situations is a welcome change :-)
My company ( GenieDB ) has developed a replicated database engine that provides " AP " semantics , then developed a " consistency buffer " that provides a consistent view of the database - as long as there are no server or network failures ; then providing a degraded service , with some fraction of the records in the database becoming " eventually consistent " while the rest remain " immediately consistent " .
Providing a * degraded * service rather than * no * service is a good thing , as it reduces the cost of developing applications that use a distributed database compared to existing solutions - but not something that somebody too blinded by the CAP theorem might consider !
In a similar vein , we 've provided both NoSQL and SQL interfaces to our database , with different tradeoffs available in both , and both can be used at once on the same data ... people need to stop fighting over X vs. Y , and think about how to combine the best of both in practical ways !
Michael Malone
Hey Michael ,
Interesting read .
I 'm with you on most points .
I do have a couple comments though ...
Failure mode 1 is an application error .
Failure mode 2 should result in a failed write .
It should n't be too hard to trap errors programmatically and handle them intelligently / not propagate them .
Of course the devil 's in the details and hardware / interpreter / other problems in components that are outside of the DBs control can make things more difficult .
These are the sorts of issues that tend to stick around until a system is " battle tested " and run in a couple of large / high volume operations .
Failure modes 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ( partition in a local cluster ) - this seems to be where the meat of your argument is ... but you totally gloss over your solution .
I 'm not sure I believe that network partitions ( even single node failures ) are easily survived by lots of algorithms ...
Or , more specifically , I do n't believe that they can be survived while maintaining consistency ( in the CAP sense , not the ACID sense ) .
I threw together a super simplified " proof " of why consistency is essentially impossible in this situation in a recent talk .
See http://www.slideshare.net/mmalone/scaling-gis-data-in-nonrelational-data-stores
- slides 16 through 20 .
What algorithms are there to get around this ?
If a replica is partitioned you either can't replicate to it and have to fail ( unavailable ) or you can't replicate to it and succeed anyways ( replica is inconsistent ) .
I also do n't buy the argument that partitions ( LAN or WAN ) are rare and therefore we should n't worry about them .
For a small operation this may be true , but when you 're doing a million operations a second then a one - in - a - million failure scenario will happen every second .
Failure mode 7 will probably result in some data loss unless ( as you mention ) you 're willing to live with the latency of waiting for durable multi-datacenter writes to occur .
But having that option is definitely nice , and that 's a trade off that I 'd like to be able to make on a per - write basis .
I may choose to accept that latency when I 'm recording a large financial transaction , for example .
Another thought related to this issue - in a lot of ways writing something to memory on multiple nodes is more " durable " than writing it to disk on one .
So you may be able to do multi-DC replicated writes in memory with tolerable latency assuming your DCs are close enough that the speed of light is n't limiting .
That should get you durability up to the point where the entire eastern seaboard disappears , at least .
Failure mode 8 is another core issue that I think you 're glossing over .
WAN failures ( particularly short - lived ones ) can and do happen on a regular basis .
It 's true that routing issues are typically resolved quickly , but it 's another law - of - large - numbers thing .
Amazon AWS had an issue that took an entire data center offline a while back , for example .
Shit happens .
In CAP terms this is really the same thing as a failure modes 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 though .
So the same arguments apply .
Re : your argument that only a small segment splits - what happens when a read comes into the small split segment ( maybe from a client in the same datacenter ) ?
If data has been updated on the larger segment it could n't have been replicated , so again you 're either serving stale data or your data store is unavailable .
Thanks for putting this together , it was an interesting read .
Looking forward to hearing more about some of these issues !
Paul Prescod
I find this blog post quite confusing .
The key to my confusion is this paragraph : " Error 7 will only be recoverable if a local transaction is only committed after the assurance that the transaction has been received by another WAN - connected cluster .
Few application builders are willing to accept this kind of latency . "
If you are correct that few applications are willing to accept the latency of a synchronous write to another WAN - connected cluster , then the only alternatives are asynchronous write or no write at all .
Asynchronous write is Eventual Consistency .
Eventually the remote cluster is consistent with the local one .
So you claim that you are arguing against eventual consistency , but I interpret your words as : " Eventual Consistency is the only option when you are working at WAN scale . "
That is the same conclusion that Amazon , Yahoo , Google , Facebook , Twitter and Rackspace have made .
Are you agreeing with them or disagreeing with them ?
You claim that LAN failures are rare .
Facebook has 60,000 servers at last count .
Some people estimate that Google has upwards of 250,000 servers .
Yahoo has around 150,000 servers .
Rackspace has more than 50,000 .
Amazon must be in the ballpark somewhere there .
It seems to me that one cannot operate at that scale without frequent LAN and server failures .
Eventual Consistency is just the mechanism by which transient outages are seamlessly handled at massive scale .
I certainly do not need to deal with that volume of data .
But I do look forward to seamless outsourced management of the data that I do control ( I 'm not in a highly secretive industry ) .
What those big vendors sell as their cloud database products are variants of what they use in - house , and naturally handle all of the LAN , WAN and node outages that would otherwise make my application unavailable .
If they are willing to go through the engineering effort to make downtime nearly non-existent ( as opposed to " rare " ) then I am happy to pay them a reasonable monthly fee for the use of their technology .
I look forward to doing so as these products mature .
Paul Prescod
One more thought :
Most people discussing these trends do not know that Cassandra ( for example ) allows you to decide on a * per- query * basis ( whether a read or write ) whether you want strong consistency ( ConsistencyLevel .
ALL ) or weak ( ConsistencyLevel.ONE ) .
The choice is write there in the API and the developer gets to decide based on the semantics of the query .
" Writing an instance message ... better use a low consistency level for low latency .
Writing out a financial transaction ?
Better make sure that every replica knows about it so we do n't double charge . "
Not that I would manage financial data in a datastore versioned 0.7 of course ....
Michael Malone
Paul , small correction ... and I could be wrong here .
But , to be fair , I believe even with Cassandra 's ConsistencyLevel .ALL
you may only get eventually consistent behavior when node failures occur .
I believe ALL means " write to N nodes , " where N is your replication factor .
If all N of the authoritative nodes for a given key are down , I believe Cassandra will still write to the next N nodes in the cluster .
And , if I 'm understanding things correctly , I believe the argument Michael is trying to make is that it should n't ...
Instead it should fail the write .
The trouble is , when the N authoritative nodes come back up , reads will go to them .
And even with ConsistencyLevel .ALL your reads will be inconsistent until hinted - handoff , anti-entropy , or read - repair kicks in .
That should be pretty damn fast though .
I suppose one solution to this would be to run hintend - handoff before unavailable nodes rejoin the cluster .
Not sure if that 's feasible though .
In all other cases ( failure and non-failure ) as long as one of the N authoritative nodes for an item is up , I believe ConsistencyLevel .ALL will give you strong consistency .
Even with ConsistencyLevel.ONE
Cassandra will give you strong consistency if there are no partitions .
So Michael 's argument seems to be that if you get to the point where lots of failures pile up you should just become unavailable , because it 's pretty rare that you actually get to that point ( e.g. , the point where an authoritative quorum is unavailable for a read / write ) .
I still disagree .
I believe that large scale operations are often in a state where more than N nodes are unavailable , which would mean some fraction of data is unavailable .
It 's also nice operationally to have the ability to restart , decommission , and otherwise futz with individual nodes in a cluster without worrying about breaking stuff .
But reasonable minds can differ .
Lou Montulli
I rarely see discussions that include consensus quorum database design .
This is probably due to the lack of consensus quorum relational implementations .
Consensus quorum solves many of the CAP issues and can be used to make an incredibly robust implementation .
What do you think ?
Russell Okamoto
Thanks Mike for an eloquent explanation of CAP considerations .
In recent discourse about the CAP theorem , I wonder if another of Eric Brewer 's important contributions , " Harvest , Yield , and Scalable Tolerant Systems " , http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/fox99harvest.html, has been overlooked .
Brewer 's 1999 paper describes strategies for dealing with CAP based on probabilistic availability and application decomposition , resulting in graceful degradation and partial failure modes .
By decomposing applications into independent subsystems , for example , the failure of one subsystem can be isolated from other subsystems enabling the system at large to still operate ( but possibly with reduced functionality ) .
Since individual subsystems have different requirements for what can be relaxed -- e.g. , one subsystem may prioritize CA while another may prioritize AP - - decomposition also hints at the need for " tunable CAP " , i.e. , the ability for system designers to choose where in their system - wide workflows to use CA or CP or AP .
Not all activities ( subsystems ) in a complex workflow have the same data requirements -- a billing subsystem might prioritize consistency whereas a web recommendation subsystem might deprioritize consistency and permit eventually consistent , stale reads .
Hence being able to relax C or A or P at different places and times and subsystems can result in an optimal system - wide design .
So to evoke another Stonebrakerism : " one size does not fit all " .
Tunable CAP ideas have in fact already been incorporated ( for several years ) into state - of - the - art data fabric products currently adopted by all top banking institutions for scalable , continuously available , high - speed trading applications ( e.g. , http://www.gemstone.com/hardest-problems#whatshard).
As an approach for dealing with CAP issues , application decomposition also enables system designers to identify and exploit " orthogonal mechanisms " ( Brewer page 3 ) for non-invasive subsystem management .
As an example , data schema interdependence policies can become orthogonal mechanism that allows users to configure requisite availability semantics for individual subsystems .
The value here is that data interdependency policies can be declared at " compile - time " ( system configuration time ) enabling early detection of problematic / risky configurations that can be quickly corrected by administrators .
Second , at " run-time " , process survivability decisions can be guided by the rational logic of schema data dependencies rather than randomness of primary network partitioning models ( where the losing " side " of a partition gets killed arbitrarily ) .
And finally , a consequence of CAP and the use of application decomposition is that deconstructing a system into holistic , autonomous business chunks that communicate via message passing and are transactionally independent leads to a service " entity " abstraction ala Pat Helland 's " Life Beyond Distributed Transactions " , http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2007/papers/cidr07p15.pdf.
This service entity model , in turn , can be thought of as an Actor model for concurrent computation .
So to summarize :
CAP ==> Application Decomposition ==> Service Entities ==> Actor Model

There has been quite a collection of comments to my posting .
Rather than respond individually , I will make two points that addresses several of the comments .
Specifically , I will discuss error frequencies and draw some conclusions as a result , and clarify my comment about application builders not being willing to pay for two phase commit .
The various respondents have posited various error characteristics , and then drawn conclusions as a result .
At this point there is very little hard data that I am aware of concerning exactly how frequently various DBMS errors occur .
Also , such error frequency is clearly a function of the operating environment , and that obviously varies .
There is considerable data on specific hardware failures ; for example , the frequency of disk crashes or RAM failures .
However , what is really needed is the relative frequency of all of the failure modes mentioned in my blog .
In the 1980's Jim Gray published just such an analysis of errors in Tandem systems .
Unfortunately , I cant seem to locate that paper , which was Tandem - specific , in any case .
In short , I would really welcome somebody publishing data on the current distribution of errors in DBMS applications .
In the absence of hard data , here is my ( not scientific ) spin on the topic .
Remember " your mileage will vary . "
1 ) Application errors .
The application performed one or more incorrect updates .
Generally this is not discovered for minutes to hours thereafter .
The data base must be backed - up to a point before the offending transaction (s ) , and subsequent activity redone .
My sense is that this happens once every three years per application .
However , it depends a lot on how well the application is tested .
2) Repeatable DBMS errors .
The DBMS crashed at a processing node .
Executing the same transaction on a processing node with a replica will cause the backup to crash .
These errors have been termed Bohr bugs [ 2 ] .
Most Bohr bugs occur during the early days of a release ; i.e. , most of them are fairly quickly beaten out of a DBMS release .
Most serious users decline to use a new release of any system software until this break - in period is over .
As such , I believe Bohr bugs are quite rare , happening perhaps once every 12 months , per database .
Of course , the corrective action is workarounds and vendor patches .
3 ) Unrepeatable DBMS errors .
The database crashed , but a replica is likely to be ok .
These are often caused by weird corner cases dealing with asynchronous operations , and have been termed Heisenbugs [ 2 ] .
Heisenbugs generally occur under heavy load and are devilishly hard to locate and even harder to test for in advance .
My experience is that a Heisenbug also occurs about every 12 months per database .
Again , these are rarely seen by lightly loaded systems ; hence the rate of Heisenbugs is very sensitive to operating characteristics .
4 ) Operating system ( OS ) errors .
The OS crashed at a node , generating the " blue screen of death . "
The frequency of OS errors depends a great deal on which OS is being run .
The gold standard is MVS , which is hyper - reliable , typically crashing less than once a year .
Most other OSs crash considerably more frequently .
In my experience , a production OS on a given node crashes about every 6 months .
5 ) A hardware failure in a local cluster .
These include memory failures , disk failures , etc .
Generally , these cause a " panic stop " by the OS or the DBMS .
However , sometimes these appear as Heisenbugs .
In my experience a disk error on a node occurs once a year ( though this depends on how many disks are attached ) , and a hardware error elsewhere in the node also occurs once a year .
In aggregate , a node crash occurs every six months .
Also , hardware problems are quite " time - skewed , " i.e. , both " infant mortality " and " old age " are problematic .
6 ) A network partition in a local cluster .
The LAN failed and the nodes can no longer all communicate with each other .
In my experience , a LAN partition failure occurs rarely , perhaps every fourth year .
It is way more likely that the LAN connection on the local node fails , causing a single node to be separated from the rest of the LAN .
This " single node separation " might occur every six months .
7 ) A disaster .
The local cluster is wiped out , by a flood , earthquake , etc .
The cluster no longer exists .
In my experience , a node totally disappears every 20 years or less .
8 ) A network failures in the WAN connecting clusters together .
The WAN failed and clusters can no longer all communicate with each other .
In my experience , a WAN failure causing a partition in a private network ( as opposed to the Internet ) is quite rare , occurring perhaps once every other year .
Again in my experience , the most likely failure is in the interface between a local cluster and the WAN , i.e. , a partition that disconnects a single node from the WAN is 20 times more likely than a more general network partition .
In other words , a site cannot connect to the WAN once a month .
Now consider an operating environment consisting of 15 nodes in a LAN cluster .
The cluster is dedicated to a single DBMS to which three applications are connected .
Consider all of the failure modes above and divide them into four groups :
Group A ) : The application cannot continue ( error modes 1 and 2 ) .
In our scenario , an error in Group A happens every six months .
Regardless of your high availability strategy , blocking is inevitable .
Group B ) :
There is an easy - to - survive error consisting of a single node failure or a single node being isolated from its processing peers in a cluster ( errors 3 , 4 , 5 and some of 6 ) .
An error in this group happens about every six days .
Group C ) :
There is a failure that causes a cluster to fail or to be isolated from its peers ( error modes 7 and some of 8 ) .
This error happens once a month .
Group D ) :
There is a general network partition ( some of error modes 6 and 8 ) .
This error happens every couple of years .
In round numbers , an easy - to - survive error ( B and C above ) happens once a week , an error which forces the system to block occurs every six months and a general network partition occurs every couple of years .
You can easily do the above analysis assuming your specific hardware environment and failure characteristics .
This will move the rate at which the various errors happen up or down ; however , I would be quite surprised the relative frequencies noted above change a great deal .
As such , the point I am trying to make is that forced blocking from application errors and Bohr bugs is way more likely than general network partitions .
Put differently , staying up during general network partitions does not " move the blocking needle , " because they are dwarfed in frequency by blocking errors .
Hence , the P of the CAP theorem is a rare event , and one that is dominated by other errors that force blocking .
Hence , surviving general network partitions without blocking does not improve availability very much .
As such , trading consistency ( C ) for partition tolerance ( P ) does not appear to be warranted .
The second point I am trying to make concerns WAN replication .
Consider a specific series of events ( this is obviously not the only way to do the work , but it is the way several systems I am aware of do things ) :
1 ) Application sends transaction to a co-ordinator ( generally co-located with the " primary " storage node )
2 ) Co-ordinator does the transaction locally ; in parallel sends the transaction to a " backup "
3 ) Primary responds to the co-ordinator " done "
4 ) Co-ordinator responds " done " to application
5 ) Backup site finishes executing the transaction .
This is an active - active system , in which the transaction is executed twice , once at the primary and once at the backup , which is assumed to be at the other end of a WAN .
A very possible failure scenario is the co-ordinator finishes the transaction at the primary and responds done ( step 4 ) and then fails ( let 's say the rare but possible disastererror 7 ) .
In this case , the transaction at the primary is permanently lost .
Consider now a network failure in which the message to the backup is lost .
In this double failure scenario , the transaction is completely lost , even though the user was sent a " done . "
Hence , consistency ( or eventual consistency for that matter ) is not possible .
The only way to avoid data loss in this scenario is to perform a two - phase commit , a long latency tactic that few are willing to pay for .
The point I am trying to make is that there are rare , corner cases , such as the above , where application designers are not willing to pay for either consistency or eventual consistency .
Put differently , consistency and eventual consistency are not , in practice , 100 % guarantees , but are engineering tradeoffs between cost , latency , and code complexity .
-- Michael Stonebraker , April 15 , 2010
Frank Patz - Brockmann
As I understood it , consistency and consistency are not the same .
If your database is a model of the real world ( financial transactions , say ) , not being consistent is disastrous for the application 's purpose .
If your database * is* the virtual world ( twitter , say ) , loosing or delaying a user 's update is far less important and can be easily traded for the ability to keep the application available for millions of other users .

By telling Whitman that " Nurses Wo n't be Pushed Around . "
Here 's how Carla Marinucci describes it in the San Francisco Chronicle :
Nurses Mount " pushy " Campaign Against Whitman
OAKLAND --
One of the state 's most powerful labor unions , saying it " wo n't be pushed around " by Meg Whitman , unveiled a scathing ad campaign Friday seizing on an altercation between the former eBay CEO and one of her employees .
The California Nurses Association said the incident shows how disconnected the GOP gubernatorial nominee is from working people .
At a news conference outside its Oakland headquarters that was attended by 150 nurses in red scrubs , the union unveiled a new ad campaign - " Nurses Wo n't Be Pushed Around " - and released posters showing a heavily jeweled hand adorned with rings that was meant to represent the billionaire candidate .

We had a press conference on Friday , well attended and well covered by state and even national media , giving us a great chance to tell our story of why Whitman is wrong for nurses , patients and the people of California .
From the AP :
OAKLAND , Calif .
—
The feud between California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman and a powerful nurses union intensified Friday as the California Nurses Association announced it would bring its gripes to the Republican businesswoman 's hometown .
Union leaders at a news conference Friday railed on Whitman , whom they accuse of bullying nurses for their private information .
" Meg Whitman is trying to push around the registered nurses of California because she has gotten away with pushing around people in her past , " said Jill Furillo , a registered nurse and Southern California director of the CNA .
Nurses from across the state would attend a July forum in the tony Silicon Valley enclave of Atherton , Furillo said .
From the Oakland Tribune
OAKLAND " " The California Nurses Association opened a new battle Friday in its war on Republican gubernatorial nominee Meg Whitman , promising to put thousands of nurses and patients on her doorstep next month .
The " Nurses Won "t Be Pushed Around " campaign " " starting with 10,000 posters , to be followed next month by radio and TV ads " " is a not - so - subtle reference to the $ 200,000 settlement that eBay reportedly paid to a former employee who had claimed Whitman , then the company "s CEO , shoved her during a 2007 altercation .
The union says it "s pushing back against a candidate who has put more than $ 91 million of her personal fortune into her campaign so far , yet complains the union won"t give her its member lists to help her communicate with nurses .
And finally , from the Sacramento Bee :
It was the latest volley in a war of words between Whitman and the CNA .
Last week , Whitman asked the union to share the contact information of its members , a request that was swiftly rejected .
Whitman , in fact , was already conducting a telephone poll of licensed nurses in the state asking them how they felt about the CNA 's political activities .
For months now , the union has been sending Queen Meg and member protesters to Whitman 's events denouncing the candidate 's proposals to reduce state employee numbers by 40,000 people and reduce business regulations .
The union then invited Whitman to appear at a public forum with nurses alongside Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brown .
Whitman declined the invitation to that event as well as a subsequent invitation to appear alone at least one public forum with nurses .
Those responses sparked scorn from union leaders Friday such as Jill Furillo , a registered nurse who 's the union 's Southern California director .
" What is Meg Whitman afraid of ? " Furillo asked .
" Why does n't Meg Whitman want to speak to nurses directly ? "
I told you in the first diary that attacking our union was not going to work out well for NutMeg .
And so far it is n't .
Her campaign against us seems , at least so far , to be limited to the same tired old anti-union cliches that did not work for Arnold , did not work when another union tried to use them against us and have not worked when union busters have used them in organizing campaigns .
Her campaign seems to be as lacking in creativity as it is in strategic smarts .
But the power of her nearly limitless resources is not to be scorned .
We expect this fight to heat up , we expect it to get nastier yet .
As I said a few days ago : Meg as governor may seem like a joke , but she 's a joke with a whole lot of money .
Here 's a final quote from the Chronicle piece :
But Democratic strategist Chris Lehane said the Whitman campaign 's effort to attack the nurses could become as big a distraction for the GOP candidate as it was for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger after he quipped to nurses union protesters that he could " kick their butts . "
" I do n't understand the political calculations , " Lehane said .
" Sometimes , you pick fights with the third parties - but it's the tobacco companies .
You do n't pick fights with nurses , wounded vets or America 's soccer team . "

Kids accidentally — or intentionally — just obliterating photos .
It ’s been a bit since I did a list of photos ruined by stuff going on in the background .
So today , it ’s 11 photos ruined by kids doing inappropriate things in the background .
Or , in some cases , foreground .
1 | Another use for his bottle
Man I hope that this photo was taken in Japan where this mom could run that bottle through one of their super - advanced dishwashers that not only disinfects but gives you movie showtimes and grants you three wishes .
2 | Bad use of a balloon animal
This is why , if your kid wants a sword instead of a traditional balloon animal like a dog or the letter “ O ” , you should probably veto it .
3 | Back to the Future Part III kid
This is actually a screen grab from Back to the Future Part III .
At the very end , when Doc introduces Marty to his kids , the kid playing “ Verne ” starts making a hand gesture like he ’s asking someone to come over , then he starts pointing at his private area .
The prevailing theory is that he really had to pee and did n’t think he could make it through Christopher Lloyd ’s big flowery speech .
Check it out yourself and decide .
4 | This must be a daily occurrence at Chuck E Cheese
To quote Adam Sandler ( and , amazingly , NOT a line from Billy Madison but rather Wedding Singer ) — somebody put some pants on that kid .
And , on a personal note , I really hope they disinfected the ball pit once he left .
5 | That ’s one interpretation of the “ OK , everyone do something wacky ! ” photographer directive
And the kid next to him making the pig nose must be happy this guy really took all the heat off of him .
6 | Checking to make sure everything ’s still in place
What ’s really crazy is that this must ’ve been the BEST take for the family , the one they actually bought from Sears and put up in their living room .
What could the kid have done in the other takes that was worse ?
Turned around and motorboated his mom ?
Grabbed his brother ’s pants ?
Had his eyes close and neglected to say “ Cheese ” ?
7 | They start ’em young in Toronto
When I ’m at a hockey game , I ’m generally making this gesture at the person who talked me into going to a hockey game .
8 | Is he coughing ?
My favorite part here is that the older guy in the photo TRIED to be funny in the background … but got completely trumped by the kid accidentally (? ) making a fellatio gesture .
9 | Crawling the red carpet
There ’s no way this kid leaves this experience without being traumatized .
You have to work your way up to being able to stare down female genitalia without wanting to Men in Black memory ray yourself afterward .
There ’s no way this kid is mentally prepared — you ’re not officially prepared until you enter the phase of your life where you ’re so hormonal and horny that there ’s no sight in the world that can deter you from your sexual to - do list .
10 | Scotchtoberfest
I take back what I said about the previous photo .
THIS is more traumatic .
11 | A vacation photo to cherish
He ’s got such a future ahead of himself as a pervert .
This is definitely the kid who leads the initiative to drill a hole to see into the girls ’ locker room .
Which , if I ’m to understand today ’s schools ’ zero tolerance policies correctly , would be punishable by expulsion not because he’d be violating hundreds of underage girls ’ privacy , but because the drill is pointy .

This post is part of the How to Start an Architecture Firm series .
In February 2006 , Christian , Michael and I went to work on forming our own architecture firm .
The following is tip number six of seven in our start - up strategy .
Tip 06 : Stay Flexible
photo credit
Starting your own architecture firm is not a settling experience .
It 's not glamorous .
There are many implications to being a flexible company , but I 'm going to focus on our flexibility with regard to physically moving our office .
Office 01
As mentioned back in Tip 01 , we started our firm in Michael 's basement .
We did n't have money for fancy furniture .
We could only afford IKEA .
This turned out to be a blessing .
Our IKEA desks are simple .
The $ 20 laminate table top is sold separate from the $ 4 metal legs .
After a few minutes mounting the leg brackets with a drill , the legs screw right into the table top .
Equally important , the legs unscrew , without tools , in about 30 seconds .
A genius design , especially considering that we moved into our fourth office space by the time our company was 40 months old .
IKEA Vika Amon table top and Vika Curry legs
Office 02
After a few months in Michael 's basement doing start - up stuff and completing our first few jobs , we had enough money for a real office .
Well , not a real office , but a small office suite in a tower by the airport .
The conference room was shared with other businesses on our floor .
Our office suite looked right out on the 405 freeway ( see picture 02 below ) .
Our four offices in 40 months overlaid on a map of Los Angeles .
Office 03
Our third office space , as touched upon in Tip 02 , was a converted old house located on a commercial property .
The property was the future site of a project we were designing , the Venice Boulevard Urban Dwellings .
We worked out free rent as part of our design fee .
Office 04
When that project was put on hold as a result of the housing market collapse , we had to move next door into a commercial building .
Rent was n't free anymore .
The space required some upgrading , but nothing like what we went through with the old house .
We 're still here and it 's working well for us .
One way we maintained consistency was to get a mailbox in our first month of operation .
We opted for a UPS mailbox near where I live .
We still have the mailbox , which is a small price to pay for staying flexible .
One less obstacle to moving the office quickly .
While I never expected to be moving so much , we always had a positive mindset .
Each move was not only a physical upgrade , but an opportunity to rethink our internal organization .
Keeping things fresh .
Stay tuned as we fill in the final tip of our 7 Tips for Starting an Architecture Firm .

Vitamin B12 Deficiency , the Epidemic of Misdiagnosis
by Jeffrey Dach MD
this article is part one of a series , for part two click here .
A good friend of ours , otherwise healthy , had severe leg pain which baffled her doctors who could not explain it .
After many months of suffering and no relief from many different medications and treatments , she tried inexpensive vitamin B12 injections , which gave her complete relief .
Occasionally the pain returns and reminds her that it is time for another B12 injection .
The injections are simple to do , with a syringe and tiny needle , the B12 is injected under the skin twice a week .
Above Left Image B12 sign Courtesy Wikipedia .
I found this B12 story interesting , and there are many more B12 stories of misdiagnosis in this book , Could It Be B12 ? : An Epidemic of Misdiagnoses ? ” by Sally M. Pacholok R.N. and Jeffrey J Stuart D.O. ( 1 ) .
How Common is B12 Deficiency ?
Vitamin B12 deficiency is estimated to affect 10 % - 15 % of individuals over the age of 60 ( 2 ) .
A recent study in Israel of elderly hospitalized patients found 40 % had low or borderline serum B12 levels .
( 3 ) .
Vegetarians are another group with inadequate dietary B12 intake since much of our B12 comes from meat consumption .
A recent study showed 50 % of long term vegetarians have B12 deficiency , with decreased serum B12 levels and elevated homocysteine levels . ( 4 ) ( 5 )
What Causes B12 Deficiency ?
B12 is a large molecule ( see diagram at left ) , and Gastrointestinal absorption depends on many Co-factors , so that it is quite possible to take adequate amounts of B12 in the diet , yet have a B12 deficiency from malabsorption .
Left image B12 Chemical Structure , Note Cobalt at center of ring , surrounded by four nitrogen molecules , courtesy of Wikipedia .
Low Gastric Acid-Acid Blocking Drugs
Absorption of B12 requires gastric acid , so anything which reduces gastric acid production such as gastric surgery , atrophic gastritis , or antacid drugs could produce B12 deficiency .
The very popular class of antacid drugs called PPI ’s ( proton pump inhibitors ) such as Prilosec ( omeprazole ) has been clearly shown to decrease B12 absorption . ( 6 ) ( 7 ) .
Other antacid pills such as Prevacid , Protonix , Zantac , Nexium , Aciphex , Zantec , Tagamet , Pepcid , Maalox , Mylanta , reduce gastric acid , inhibit B12 absorption , and may produce B12 deficiency .
Diabetes Drugs and Others
Drugs such as Metformin and other diabetes drugs can cause B12 deficiency .
The anesthetic agent , Nitrous Oxide , or “ laughing gas ” , used in dental or surgical procedures causes B12 deficiency . ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 )
Pernicious Anemia
Pernicious anemia is the second most common cause of B12 deficiency .
This is an autoimmune disease with loss of Intrinsic Factor , in which antibodies damage the stomach lining interrupting the B12 absorption mechanism .
The diagnosis is made with blood test positive for anti-parietal cell antibodies .
Vegetarians
Other people at risk for B12 deficiency include vegetarians , people with eating disorders such as bulemia and anorexia , inflammatory bowel disease with malabsorption ( crohn’s ) .
Auto - immune diseases such as Hashimoto ’s thyroiditis may be associated with B12 deficiency ( pernicious anemia ) .
In addition ,
Defective B12 Transport Proteins - Genetic Functional B12 Deficiency
Miller has identified genetic defects in which transport proteins are absent or deficient causing B12 deficiency ( 11 ) .
Diagnosis can be difficult .
By running the urinary methyl malonate and the serum B12 test together , one can detect genetic transport protein defect .
The serum B12 will be normal in the face of a very elevated urinary methylmalonate .
This diagnosis will be missed by conventional doctors who order only a serum B12 and do not run a urinary methyl malonate .
These patients have a severe functional B12 deficiency , sometimes symptomatic for many years , which responds well to B12 injections .
Symptoms Which Might Indicate a B12 Deficiency
Neurological Symptoms
Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause unusual neurological symptoms such as tremor , gait disturbance , severe pain , and can mimic MS ( multiple sclerosis ) or even Parkinson ’s Syndrome .
B12 deficiency damages the the fatty insulating material surrounding the nerve fibers called myelin sheath .
This myelin sheath is also similarly damaged in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis .
Mental Changes :
B12 deficiency may cause Irritability , apathy , sleepiness , paranoia , personality changes , depression ( including post - partum depression ) , memory loss , dementia , cognitive dysfunction or deterioration , fuzzy thinking , psychosis , dementia , hallucinations , violent behavior , in children ; autistic behavior , developmental delay .
Neurological Signs and Symptoms :
B12 deficiency may cause abnormal sensations ( pain , tingling , and / or numbness of legs , arms trunk or anywhere ) , diminished sense of touch , pain or temperature ( may mimic diabetic neuropathy Charcot foot ) , loss of position sense , weakness , clumsiness , tremor , any symptoms which may mimic parkinson ’s or multiple sclerosis , spasticity of muscles , incontinence , paralysis , vision changes , damage to optic nerve ( optic neuritis ) .
Vascular Problems :
Atherosclerotic vascular disease is increased by B12 deficiency including ; Coronary artery disease , Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) , Cerebrovascular accident , stroke ( CVA ) , heart attack , heart failure , claudication , are all associated with elevated homocysteine levels caused by B12 deficiency .
Megaloblastic Anemia ( enlarged red blood cells with anemia )
Large Read Blood Cells .
B12 deficiency may be associated with a peculiar type of anemia , the red blood cells are fewer in number , yet larger in diameter ( called megaloblastic ) and is measured on the CBC with the mean corpuscular volume , MCV ) .
The anemia can cause fatigue , and weakness .
( left image : Red blood cells courtesy of wikimedia commons )
Increased Cancer Risk from B12 Deficiency
Cervical Dysplasia and increased risk for other dysplasias and cancers are associated with B12 deficiency .
B12 supplementation is part of our cancer prevention program .
Testing for the Diagnosis of B12 Deficiency
Most doctors ignore B12 testing , and even they do a blood test , they do the standard serum B12 only .
( 12 ) A more accurate screening method is to run both serum B12 and the urinary methyl malonate test . ( 13 ) ( 15 ) ( 16 )
This is our office routine .
It is important to discover B12 deficiency early , since nerve damage can be irreversible if diagnosis is delayed /
B12 Treatment
B12 comes in various forms .
For the more severe cases , genetic transport protein defect and B12 deficiency associated with neurological symptoms , B12 injections with hydroxycobalamin 1,000 mg weekly is standard .
This is ordered from the compounding pharmacy and shipped to the patient ’s home for self injection at home .
The corner drug store version is the Cyano - Cobalmine injectable which in my opinion is an inferior form of B12 , and no longer preferred .
For the finicky patient who declines the B12 injectable , there is another option called Nascobal , a Nasal Spray form of Cyanocobalamin , one nostril once a week .
Most people prefer the B12 sublingual tablets .
We use the 5 mg SL tabs from Source Naturals MethylCobalamin Vitamin B - 12 , These are Cherry Flavored sublingual tablets .
In addition , Methylcobalamin oral capsules are widely available .
Kuzminski showed that daily 2 mg. oral B12 serves as well as monthly 1 mg intramuscular B12 injections . ( 14 )

Mike and Carol Hall were visiting the far East in 2004 when the tsunami disaster struck ; they were unfortunately killed .
Scam artists then solicited e-mails stating that the couple had 10 million in their bank account when they died , telling individuals that if they pretended to be relatives to collect the inheritance , the couple ’s lawyers would back up their claim for a share of the inheritance money .
Where the scammer profit came in was the “ trust ” fee that would be sent to the “ lawyers ” in good faith .
It ’s unknown if these wretches were even arrested , but anyone who fell for this one deserved it may ’ve whatever happened to them .

9. Virginia Tech Charity Scam
An official fund for the victims of the VA Tech shootings was set up online and at Virginia Tech itself following the tragedy , but given 25 fraudulent funds were set up online at the same time as the real one , it was difficult to discern which VA Tech charity was the real one .
People who fell victim to this VA Tech scheme faced the threat of identity theft more than simply being robbed .
Thankfully , the US Computer Emergency Response Team was instrumental in rapidly shutting these fraudulent sites down .

8. The Missouri AFCEF Charity Scam
The Armed Forces Children ’s Education Fund is a legitimate , Washington - based charity that gives the proceeds of their donations to the children of soldiers killed during the Iraq War .
However , a Missouri man who placed candy inside of several local vending machines and claimed that money from these sales would go to AFCEF was never an employee of AFCEF , and District Attorney Jay Nixon made this clear to Henry County , MO citizens with an indictment against the scammer .

7. The Foundation of Hope Scam
There are literally thousands of e-mail scams out there , but most of them are very transparent to the untrained eye .
The Foundation of Hope e-mail scam is different in that the misleading e-mail is actually very convincing and professional in its appearance ; making a heartfelt plea to the mark to donate money for disadvantaged Canadian youth .
The commendable people of scamwarners.org deserve the credit for notifying people of this scam , and a few others like it very similar in its design .
The eloquently - written FoH letter itself can be found at http://www.scamwarners.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=266.
6. French Scientology Fraud
The Church of Scientology is not entirely corrupt , but to be fair , the late L. Ron Hubbard ’s religious organization has been involved in more than too many financial - based scandals .
Among these was the 1999 fraud trial of five French Scientology officials who took up to 14,000 Euros each from various church members for donations and “ purification ” , then pretty much pocketed the money .
According to news sources , even before this incident , Scientology was considered a “ dangerous cult ” in France .

5 . The Deniz Feneri Foundation Fraud
The Deniz Feneri Foundation , an Islamic charity , faced backlash from the Muslim community in 2008 when Aykut Zahid Akman , lead organizer of charity , was convicted on fraud and embezzlement charges in Germany along with several members of his staff .
The leaders of Deniz Ferari are reported to have stolen at least 16 million Euros in donations from benevolent Muslims , then used the money to not only supplant their own lifestyles , but also to buy a cruise boat , a TV station , and Turkish stocks .
Aykut Zahid Akman was sentenced to 69 months in German prison while his staff received lighter sentences within maximum security prisons .

4. The Nigerian 419 E - Mail Scams
Nndugu .
This name and his many changing last names strikes fear into the heart of your average Internet user–or at least an eye roll .
Millions of e-mails each year are sent by this assiduous Nigerian , and his jobs change more than The Pretender ; one day he ’ll be an ousted prince struggling to free his people , the next he ’ll be a Nigerian charity president , then he ’ll be the sweetest little boy trying to survive amidst African poverty .
Nndugu always needs money , no matter how many people help him with his plight .
First of all , Africa is n’t as poor as some would have you believe .
Secondly , Nndugu does n’t exist and he ’s just the cover for one of the longest running and efficacious internet scams : the 419 Advance Fee Scam .
419 is n’t a Nigerian area code , it ’s the penal code for which this crime falls under .
The 419 scam may be the oldest mass - communications scam there is , as during the 1980 ’s it was done via fax machines , but due to the fact that the design of the 419 scam has been one of the most basic “ confidence ” tricks for centuries , we could consider the 419 scam to have existed long before the 1980’s .
The most common variation of the 419 scam is the “ fake lottery ” , where a mark is informed that they have won the lottery but must send money to a third party ( a lawyer , the lottery commission , etc. ) in order to have the money transferred to them .
The charity variation of the 419 scam is far simpler ; the scammer either poses as a non-existent Nigerian relief foundation , or a dying person who is willing to give the mark an inheritance to donate to charity .
As sending money directly to the source would alert the mark , it ’s usually requested the fees be sent to the subject ’s “ lawyer ” instead .
Unmistakably , each and every person reading this article , regardless of where you live in the world , has had one of these e-mails fall into their box .
This scam is best dealt with by never sending money to someone who requests it through e-mail .
Never ever .

3. ACORN
Thought Enron was bad ?
ACORN , through so many breaches of business and charity ethics might just be America ’s current epitome for organizational corruption within a country where there ’s a new corporate scandal daily .
Though to be fair , not all of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now is corrupt , in fact the majority of the organization strives to do good things within their community .
Since 1970 , ACORN has been a very active and positive force in providing housing for the poor , as well as improving public schools and going court for community issues when the people in the neighborhood can’t afford a lawyer .
Having witnessed the effects of living poor , I wholeheartedly laud the concept and intent behind ACORN .
Unfortunately , ACORN ’s infrastructure might just be dirtier than a 4th grader on Sports Day ; the non-profit , non-partisan organization has been implicated in everything from voter registration fraud to embezzlement .
In 2008 , brother of ACORN founder Wade Rathke , Dale Rathke , was ousted from ACORN for embezzling $ 948,000 from ACORN and related charities - except he stole the money between 1999 and 2000 .
Huh ?
As it turns out , the leadership of the company knew about Dale Rathke ’s indiscretion , but swept it under the rug until a whistleblower alerted the press in 2008 .
It gets worse .
According to the Washington Examiner which has given the story the most coverage , in the wake of the scandal , ACORN arranged for two members of the ACORN executive board to look into the financial scandal , but they barred these investigators from actually looking at the organization ’s financial records .
When these ACORN employees sued ACORN for the documents , ACORN tossed out the suit and the board members .
Senator John McCain even suggested that ACORN was one of the groups responsible for America ’s flailing economy , a sharp contrast to the fact that ACORN is supposed to be one of the saving graces for people deeply affected by the U.S. recession .
ACORN may be a legitimate organization that does far more damage than any purely fraudulent one .

2. The Katrina Internet Scams
Between 2000 and present , two terrible things have occurred on American soils that have embedded themselves into our culture : 9 - 11 and Hurricane Katrina .
In the case of Hurricane Katrina , if FEMA ’s failure to respond and the American president ’s ineptitude were n’t bad enough , there was no shortage of opportunistic leeches prepared to steal from the displaced and disadvantaged in order to make their own pockets a little fatter .
The first scam of note was one located at Katrinafund .name and neworleanscharities.com which was geared towards raising money solely for Caucasian victims of Katrina .
Shortly thereafter , A Brazil website solicited millions of e-mails where the scammer posed as a representative of the American Red Cross .
ABC
News described one of these websites as appearing very credible ; the trick to this was when a “ mark ” clicked the donate button , their personal information was actually sent to the third party while the mark was redirected to American Red Cross website .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that following Hurricane Katrina , over 4,600 websites popped up , most either claiming they could send money to Katrina relief efforts or claiming to actually be a Katrina relief effort .
The Internet ’s most devious truly used every trick in the book to bilk decent people out of desperately needed Katrina relief money through a combination of phishing and solicitous e-mail .
Thankfully , the federal government was quicker in shutting these internet abominations down than they were in actually responding to the hurricane .
Florida resident Gary Kraser was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison for posing as a relief effort pilot on his fraudulent website , AirKatrina.com .
Kraser even went so far as to keep a “ tearful ” web diary of his imaginary journeys to Louisiana , in which he wrote “ I saw dogs wrapped in electrical lines still alive and sparks flying from their bodies being electrocuted , as well as some people dead already . ”
Twenty - one months may not have been enough time .

1. The 9 - 11 Charity Scams
It ’s hardly a stretch to say that the tragedies of 9 - 11 not only transformed the American culture and consciousness , but also changed the world .
9-11 may be the ultimate source of every US triumph and failure within this decade , domestic or abroad .
The unspeakable crimes that took place on 9 - 11 caused royalty , elitists , politicians , even entertainment giants to waste no effort in financially curtailing the impact of the 9 - 11 attacks , and while America suffered through its darkest hour , fraudulent and opportunistic animals committed their darkest deeds .
9 -11 set the criminal standard for using the internet to take advantage of a crisis ; every internet based scam that has been included in this list was either used or originated from the 9 - 11 internet frauds .
Through relief scams , false charities , variations of the 419 scam , cyber - hustlers literally used every trick in the book to dupe and steal from financial contributors worldwide .
9 -11 charity fraud may be unique in that some cases may have involved individuals stealing from legitimate charities rather than donating to non-existent ones .
A former Navy officer who was working at the Pentagon on 9 - 11 faced trial for allegedly faking a leg injury to collect $ 300,000 from a victim ’s fund .
When the case deadlocked , his wife was eventually tried , which also resulted in a hung jury .
9 - 11 may have set the standard for fraud and opportunism in the face of disaster , when people are the most emotionally vulnerable , but not everyone walks into the well - laid traps of these internet predators .
9 - 11 , and the fraud that ensued , also awakened individuals to the dangerous world outside of American borders and within their own broadband .

In the race to find answers about ovarian cancer , researchers now have something to cluck about .
For five years , University of Illinois researchers have been using the chicken as a model to study this deadly disease and have recently discovered that a diet enriched with flaxseed decreases severity of ovarian cancer and increases survival in hens .
Flaxseed is the richest plant source of alpha - linolenic acid , one type of omega - 3 fatty acid .
Several studies have already shown that flaxseed inhibits the formation of colon , breast , skin and lung tumors .
For these reasons , it was logical to study how omega - 3 fatty acids affect ovarian cancer as there continues to be no effective treatment at this time , said Janice Bahr , a professor emerita in the U of I Department of Animal Sciences and one of the nation 's leading poultry researchers .
According to Bahr , 25,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year and 15,000 die .
The incidences of death in other cancers have dropped recently , but ovarian cancer death rates have remained the same .
" The chicken is the only animal that spontaneously develops ovarian cancer on the surface of the ovaries like humans , " Bahr said .
" In this study , we evaluated how a flaxseed - enriched diet affected 2 - year - old laying hens ( hens that have ovulated as many times as a woman entering menopause ) . "
The results showed that hens fed a flaxseed - enriched diet for one year experienced a significant reduction in late - stage ovarian tumors .
advertisement
" Most women diagnosed with ovarian cancer have a very poor prognosis because they are not diagnosed until stage 3 or 4 when the cancer has metastasized and spread to other parts of the body , " Bahr said .
Hens fed the control diet had significantly more late - stage tumors that presented with fluid and metastases as compared to the hens fed a flaxseed diet .
Though hens fed the flaxseed diet did not have a decreased incidence of ovarian cancer , they did experience fewer late - stage tumors and higher survival rates .
" In hens fed flaxseed , we found that more tumors were confined to the ovary and they had less metastatic spread , " she said .
" This is an important finding as the metastases that accompany late - stage ovarian cancer are the main cause of death from this disease .
If the cancer is found at an early stage , when the tumor is still confined to the ovary , women have a much better prognosis and more treatment options . "
In addition , researchers found that hens fed the flaxseed diet had better weight control which is important because obesity increases cancer risk .
Both diets had equal caloric content , however the flaxseed - fed hens weighed less at six months than the control - fed hens .
But at 12 months , the flaxseed - fed hens were the same weight and the control - fed hens had loss significant weight , which was indicative of their failing health .
Ultimately , the flaxseed - enriched diet helped the birds maintain a healthy weight and resulted in less sickness and death .
" Through this research , we have proven that flaxseed supplementation for one year is able to reduce the severity of ovarian cancer in hens , " she said .
" These findings may provide the basis for a clinical trial that evaluates the efficacy of flaxseed as a chemosuppressant of ovarian cancer in women . "
The cause of ovarian cancer remains unknown , but one of the most prevalent theories is the " incessant ovulation hypothesis , " proposed by MF Fathalla in 1971 .
He suggests that inflammation associated with continuous ovulation leaves ovarian surface epithelial cells susceptible to malignant transformation .
The observation that egg - laying domestic hens frequently develop ovarian cancer supports this hypothesis .
Bahr believes this hypothesis is valid and is currently in the middle of a four - year study to determine if long - term dietary intervention with flaxseed will reduce the incidence of ovarian cancer development .
The hens started the flaxseed - supplemented diet at 22 weeks of age , as soon as they commenced egg laying and before damage from ovulation had accumulated .
This research was published in Gynecologic Oncology and funded by a National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Grant , an American Institute for Cancer Research Grant , and an NIH Training Grant .
Researchers included principal investigator Dale Buchanan Hales of Southern Illinois University .
Co-principal investigators include Janice Bahr of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign ; Kristine Ansenberger and Cassandra Richards of the University of Illinois at Chicago ; and Yan Zhuge , Judith Luborsky and Animesh Barua of Rush University Medical Center .
My position on so - called " fan fiction " is pretty well known .
I 'm against it , for a variety of reasons that I 've stated previously more than once .
I wo n't repeat 'em here .
My position is not unique .
It is not universal either , I realize .
Some writers actually encourage fan fiction ( I know some of them , have heard their arguments ) , others do n't seem to care one way or another ( I know many of those ) .
Many writers have no idea that it exists , no concept of what it is ( in part because of the confusing term " fan fiction , " which subject I will return to later ) , and have given the subject no thought .
So there 's a wide range of opinion on this matter , even among writers .
There are lots of us who oppose fan fiction , though .
One such is my friend Diana Gabaldon , author of the mega - bestselling OUTLANDER series ... and the occasional terrific short story and novella , some of which Gardner Dozois and I have been privileged to publish in our anthologies .
Diana recently outlined her own feelings about fan fiction -- especially fan fiction involving her own world and characters -- in a series of posts on her blog : Subsequent to Diana 's first post , all hell broke loose .
( As it seems to do more and more often on this " interweb " thingie ) .
A thousand comments on her first two blog posts on the subject .
It 's all there , for those who want to check out the " debate . "
Which soon , alas , became heated , as hundreds of ... what 's the correct term here ?
fanficcers ? fan fictioneers ?
fans of fanfic ?
defenders of fanfic ?... arrived from all over the internet to take issue with Diana .
A good number of them seemed to open their posts with variations on ' I do n't know who you are and I 've never read your books and I 've never visited this blog before , but I 've come by specially to lambast you .
' Sigh .
I have a colorful metaphor in mind to describe what this reminds me of , but I wo n't use it .
Metaphors seemed to spark much of the outrage here .
Writers have a natural prediliction for the colorful phrase , the striking comparison , but in political discussions -- and this is , at base , a political discussion -- that can lead to hyperbole , which can lead to anger .
So let me try to eschew all that and remain calm .
I am not going to rehash the arguments for and against " fan fiction . "
If you want to read those , go to Diana 's blog .
In between the shouting and the abuse and the endless restatement of the same three or four points by several hundred different posters , there 's actually some fairly cogent posts on both sides , arguing the pros and cons of the issue .
I would like to say a couple of things that I do n't think anyone else covered , however ( and yes , I read all thousand - plus comments , though admittedly I skimmed some that just seemed to be more of the same ) .
As I said , my reasons for opposing fan fiction have been stated in the past .
They are more - or - less the same reasons as those cited by Diana Gabaldon , and pretty much the same reasons that would given by any writer who shares our viewpoint on the matter .
So I wo n't repeat them here .
But I 'll add a few thoughts .
One of the things I mislike about fan fiction is its NAME .
Truth is , I wrote fan fiction myself .
That was how I began , when I was a kid in high school writing for the dittoed comic fanzines of the early 1960s .
In those days , however , the term did not mean " fiction set in someone else 's universe using someone else 's characters . "
It simply meant " stories written by fans for fans , amateur fiction published in fanzines . "
Comic fandom was in its infancy then , and most of us who started it were kids ... some of whom did make the mistake of publishing amateur fan - written stories about Batman or the Fantastic Four in their ' zines .
National ( what we called DC back then ) and Marvel shut those down pretty quickly .
The rest of us knew better .
Including me .
I was a fan , an amateur , writing stories out of love just like today 's fan fictioneers ... but it never dawned on me to write about the JLA or the Fantastic Four or Spider - Man , much as I loved them .
I invented my own characters , and wrote about those .
Garizan , the Mechanical Warrior .
Manta Ray .
The White Raider .
When Howard Keltner , one of the editors and publishers of STAR - STUDDED COMICS , the leading fanzine of its day , invited me to write about two of his creations , Powerman and Dr. Weird , I leapt at the chance ... but only with Howard 's express invitation and permission .
So that 's the sort of fan fiction I wrote .
How and when the term began to be used for what is called fan fiction today , I do n't know .
I wish there was another term for that , though I confess I cannot think of one that is n't either cumbersome , vague , or prejorative .
But it does bother me that people hear I wrote fan fiction , and take that to mean I wrote stories about characters taken from the work of other writers without their consent .
Consent , for me , is the heart of this issue .
If a writer wants to allow or even encourage others to use their worlds and characters , that 's fine .
Their call .
If a writer would prefer not to allow that ... well , I think their wishes should be respected .
Myself , I think the writers who allow fan fiction are making a mistake .
I am not saying here that the people who write fan fiction are evil or immoral or untrustworthy .
The vast majority of them are honest and sincere and passionate about whatever work they chose to base their fictions on , and have only the best of intentions for the original author .
But ( 1 ) there are always a few , in any group , who are perhaps less wonderful , and ( 2 ) this door , once opened , can be very difficult to close again .
Most of us laboring in the genres of science fiction and fantasy ( but perhaps not Diana Gabaldon , who comes from outside SF and thus may not be familiar with the case I am about to cite ) had a lesson in the dangers of permitting fan fiction a couple of decades back , courtesy of Marion Zimmer Bradley .
MZB had been an author who not only allowed fan fiction based on her Darkover series , but actively encouraged it ... even read and critiqued the stories of her fans .
All was happiness and joy , until one day she encountered in one such fan story an idea similar to one she was using in her current Darkover novel - in - progress .
MZB wrote to the fan , explained the situation , even offered a token payment and an acknowledgement in the book .
The fan replied that she wanted full co-authorship of said book , and half the money , or she would sue .
MZB scrapped the novel instead , rather than risk a lawsuit .
She also stopped encouraging and reading fan fiction , and wrote an account of this incident for the SFWA FORUM to warn other writers of the potential pitfalls of same .
That was twenty years ago or thereabouts , but that episode had a profound effect on me and , I suspect , on many other SF and fantasy writers of my generation .
Okay , it was one incident a long time ago , you may say .
Fair enough .
Let me bring up a couple other writers , then .
Contemporaries of an earlier age , each of whom was known by a set of initials : ERB and HPL .
ERB created Tarzan and John Carter of Mars .
HPL created Cthulhu and his Mythos .
ERB , and later his estate , was extremely protective of his creations .
Try to use Tarzan , or even an ape man who was suspiciously similar to Tarzan , without his / their permission , and their lawyers would famously descend on you like a ton of bricks .
HPL was the complete opposite .
The Cthulhu Mythos soon turned into one of our genres first shared worlds .
HPL encouraged writer friends like Robert Bloch and Clark Ashton Smith to borrow elements from his Cuthulhu Mythos , and to add elements as well , which HPL himself would borrow in turn .
And in time , other writers who were NOT friends of HPL also began to write Cthulhu Mythos stories , which continues to this day .
Fair enough .
Two writers , two different decisions .
Thing is , ERB died a millionaire many times over , living on a gigantic ranch in a town that was named Tarzana after his creation .
HPL lived and died in genteel poverty , and some biographers have suggested that poor diet brought on by poverty may have hastened his death .
HPL was a far more beloved figure amongst other writers , but love will only get you so far .
Sometimes it 's nice to be able to have a steak too .
The Burroughs estate was paid handsomely for every Tarzan movie ever made , and collected plenty on the PRINCESS OF MARS movie I worked on during my Hollywood years , and no doubt is still collecting on the one currently in development ... though the book is in the public domain by now .
Did the Lovecraft estate make a penny off THE DUNWICH HORROR movie , the HERBERT WEST , REANIMATOR movie , the recent DAGON movie , the internet version of CALL OF CTHULHU ?
I do n't know .
I rather doubt it .
If they did , I 'll betcha it was just chump change .
Meanwhile , new writers go right on mining the Cthulhu mythos , writing new stories and novels .
Cthulhu , like John Carter , is in the public domain by now , I know .
But it would n't matter .
Because HPL let so many others play in his sandbox , he essentially lost control of his own creations .
That 's what I mean by ( 2 ) , above .
The fan fiction door , once opened , is hard to close again .
A writer 's creations are his livelihood .
Those copyrights are ultimately all that separates an ERB from a HPL .
Is it any wonder that most writers are so protective of them ?
Those of us , like Diana Galabdon and myself , who prefer not to allow fan fictioners to use our worlds and characters are not doing it just to be mean .
We are doing it to protect ourselves and our creations .
Furthermore , we HAVE to do it .
That 's something no one addressed , in those thousand comments about Diana 's blog .
There was a lot of talk about copyright , and whether or not fan fiction was illegal , whether it was fair use ( it is NOT fair use , by the way , not as I understand the term , and I have a certain familiarity with what is and is n't fair use thanks to my own experiences with THE ARMAGEDDON RAG ) , but no one mentioned one crucial aspect of copyright law -- a copyright MUST BE DEFENDED .
If someone infringes on your copyright , and you are aware of the infringement , and you do not defend your copyright , the law assumes that you have abandoned it .
Once you have done that , anyone can do whatever the hell they want with your stuff .
If I let Peter and Paul and Nancy publish their Ice & Fire fanfics , and say nothing , then I have no ground to stand on when Bill B. Hack and Ripoff Publishing decide they will publish an Ice & Fire novel and make some bucks .
Peter and Paul and Nancy may be the nicest people in the world , motivated only by sincere love of my world and characters , but Bill B. Hack and Ripoff do n't give a damn .
They just want the bucks .
Once you open that door , you can't control who might come in .
No one would ever do that , I hear someone muttering in the back .
Hoo hah .
The history of publishing is full of such cases .
Even the famously and fiercely litigious ERB estate was famously victimized back in the 60s , when someone forget to timely renew the copyright on a Tarzan book , and a bottom rung comic company noticed and promptly started up a completely unauthorized ( and unpaid for ) Tarzan comic .
Those are some of the reasons writers like me will not permit fanfic , but before I close , let me put aside the legal and financial aspects of all this for a moment , and talk about more personal ones .
Here , I think , Diana Gabaldon absolutely hit the nail on the head in the latest of her blog posts on the subject .
And here , she and I agree completely .
Many years ago , I won a Nebula for a story called " Portraits of His Children , " which was all about a writer 's relationship with the characters he creates .
I do n't have any actual children , myself ( Diana does ) .
My characters are my children , I have been heard to say .
I do n't want people making off with them , thank you .
Even people who say they love my children .
I 'm sure that 's true , I do n't doubt the sincerity of the affection , but still ... I have sometimes allowed other writers to play with my children .
In Wild Cards , for instance , which is a shared world .
Lohengrin , Hoodoo Mama , Popinjay , the Turtle , and all my other WC creations have been written by other writers , and I have written their characters .
But I submit , this is NOT at all the same thing .
A shared world is a tightly controlled environment .
In the case of Wild Cards , it 's controlled by me .
I decide who gets to borrow my creations , and I review their stories , and approve or disapproval what is done with them .
" No , Popinjay would say it this way , " I say , or " Sorry , the Turtle would never do that , " or , more importantly ( this has never come up in Wild Cards , but it did in some other shared worlds ) , " No , absolutely not , your character may not rape my character , I do n't give a fuck how powerful you think it would be .
" And that 's Wild Cards .
A world and characters created to be shared .
It 's not at all the same with Ice & Fire .
No one gets to abuse the people of Westeros but me .
Anyway ... I have gone on longer than I intended , but I think this is important stuff .
" Fan fiction " -- or whatever you want to call it -- has been around for a long time , but never like now .
The internet has changed everything .
Whereas before the fanfic might be published in obscure fanzines with a circulation of a hundred , now tens of thousands , maybe hundreds of thousands , can read these ... well , let 's just call them " unauthorized derivative works . "
( Except in cases where the writer has authorized 'em , which I suppose would be " authorized derivative works . " )
More than ever , we need some boundaries here .
I salute Diana Gabaldon for opening the debate .
And now I step back , and await the onslaught .
( But a word of warning .
I 'm not nearly as nice a person as Diana is , and this Not A Blog is screened and monitored by my assistant Ty. Diana was willing to let everything go in her comments section .
I 'm not .
So -- my roof , my rules .
Disagree , if you want .
Disagree vigorously .
Argue your points .
But no name - calling , no abuse , no threats .
And you can spare me the " I have never read any of your books , but now I 'm not going to , and I 'm going to tell all my friends not to read your books either " posts as well .
Fine , you just want to read books by authors who support fan fiction , go ahead , do that , there are a number of very fine writers in that group , we do n't need to hear about it here .
No derailing the discussion , please .
Let 's talk about the issue , not tone .
I 'd love to see some rational discourse here , thanks ) .

Advertisement Greek riot police have used tear gas to disperse angry protesters in Athens , during a march against government cuts to tackle the country 's crippling debt .
Clashes erupted at the finance ministry and a state TV truck was petrol bombed .
A tense stand - off continues , with protesters hurling bottles and rocks .
Thousands of Greeks are taking part in May Day rallies called by trade unions and left - wing parties .
The EU is demanding the austerity cuts in exchange for a huge bail - out deal .
The rescue package is expected to amount to as much as 120bn euros ( £ 100 bn ; $ 160 bn ) over three years .
The full details of the bail - out are expected to be revealed on Sunday if the eurozone leaders finally sign off the deal , which is designed to prevent Greece from defaulting on its enormous debt obligations .
' Unpopular measures '
Angry protesters marched through Athens shouting : " Hands off our rights !
IMF and EU Commission out ! "
Ericos Finalis , who was taking part in the march , described the planned government cutbacks as " the biggest attack on workers for centuries " .
AT THE SCENE The BBC's Malcolm Brabant in Athens
I 'm outside the University of Athens where a Greek state television truck is on fire .
Anarchists who were marching past saw that it was standing there and it is a symbol of the state and so they smashed the windows and somebody put a petrol bomb inside and set it on fire .
The fire brigade is now here and has put out the flames , the riot police have chased off the anarchists and there is a terrible searing taste of tear gas in the air .
" They want to return us to the 19th Century - this is not going to be a battle but a war that will last for months or even years , " he was quoted by AFP as saying .
Another protester , Marina Yotis , told AFP : " Nobody knows what really is going to happen but people know that there is no other way than to come down into the streets and protest . "
During the protests , a prominent hotel was vandalised in the central Syntagma square .
There were reports of similar scenes in the northern city of Thessaloniki as youths attacked banks and business premises with iron bars .
There is huge public resistance to the wage cuts , tax rises and pension reductions that are expected to be implemented .
Our correspondent says the unions hope that the rallies will demonstrate to the government , the eurozone , the IMF and the international markets , that they can mobilise enough " troops " to defeat the new austerity programme .
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou is expected to announce details of the cuts once the rescue package is approved .
He says the loan is essential to save the country and protect its future , and has warned citizens to brace themselves for a period of hardship .
He has said he will not weaken despite opposition and the political cost of the unpopular measures .

The first day will be the announcement , introduced with Meet The Medic .
The last day will provide you with Meet The Pyro .
We ’re aiming for it to span for 4 days long .
Tues - Friday release .
We know when we release these things everyone plays the certain class .
However , do n’t worry about everyone settling down on their side of the map with a sentry .
With the updates the “ classes ” are getting , this will not be an issue .
For the slower Heavy types , I ’m saying each class will get one new weapon available to be found or unlocked through achievements ( must have all ) ; along with the Engineer update .
Expect 18 new hats
Expect 4 new community weapons
There ’s a lot more in this update , trust me .
It may have seemed like I told you much .
But that ’s not even half of it . ”
I figure this at least deserves a discussion .

MOSCOW — Opponents of the interim government in Kyrgyzstan stormed administration buildings in three southern cities on Thursday , forcibly installed a new governor and seized an airport apparently in an attempt to take power in the south a month after the country ’s president was ousted in an uprising .
After seizing the buildings , the protesters issued a statement demanding the return to power of the former president , Kurmanbek Bakiyev .
It was the worst turbulence in Kyrgyzstan since the bloody uprising that led to the overthrow of Mr. Bakiyev last month .
He is in exile in Belarus , but he retains support in his homeland in the south of the country , where discontent has been rising .
Kyrgyzstan , a landlocked mountainous nation in the heart of Central Asia , hosts a military base important to the United States ’ war efforts in Afghanistan .
Russia , which considers Kyrgyzstan within its sphere of influence , has opposed the base .

WASHINGTON ( AP )  Regulators on Friday shut down a Nevada bank , raising to 83 the number of U.S. bank failures this year .
The 83 closures so far this year is more than double the pace set in all of 2009 , which was itself a brisk year for shutdowns .
By this time last year , regulators had closed 40 banks .
The pace has accelerated as banks ' losses mount on loans made for commercial property and development .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. took over Nevada Security Bank , based in Reno , with $ 480.3 million in assets and $ 479.8 million in deposits .
Umpqua Bank , based in Roseburg , Ore. , agreed to assume the assets and deposits of the failed bank .

The failure of Nevada Security Bank is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund $ 80.9 million .
In addition , the FDIC and Umpqua Bank agreed to share losses on $ 368.2 million of Nevada Security Bank 's loans and other assets .
The number of bank failures is expected to peak this year and be slightly higher than the 140 that fell in 2009 .
That was the highest annual tally since 1992 , at the height of the savings and loan crisis .
The 2009 failures cost the insurance fund more than $ 30 billion .
Twenty - five banks failed in 2008 , the year the financial crisis struck with force , and only three succumbed in 2007 .
As losses have mounted on loans made for commercial property and development , the growing bank failures have sapped billions of dollars out of the deposit insurance fund .
It fell into the red last year , and its deficit stood at $ 20.7 billion as of March 31 .
The number of banks on the FDIC 's confidential " problem " list jumped to 775 in the first quarter from 702 three months earlier , even as the industry as a whole had its best quarter in two years .
A majority of institutions posted profit gains in the January - March quarter .
But many small and midsized banks are likely to continue to suffer distress in the coming months and years , especially from soured loans for office buildings and development projects .
The FDIC expects the cost of resolving failed banks to grow to about $ 100 billion over the next four years .
The agency mandated last year that banks prepay about $ 45 billion in premiums , for 2010 through 2012 , to replenish the insurance fund .
Depositors ' money — insured up to $ 250,000 per account — is not at risk , with the FDIC backed by the government .

The UK Amateur Photographer magazine is giving away free lenscloths silk - screened with the Photographers ' Bill of Rights with its July issue .
UK anti-terror legislation gave the police sweeping powers to harass photographers for shooting in public places , and to compound matters , tabloid - driven hysteria over paedophilia has seen many photographers accused to paedophilia for taking pictures of ( for example ) public busses and empty playgrounds .
UK law enforcement heads and the new government have spoken out against the practice , but it does not seem like word has reached the copper on the street , as there are still numerous accounts of photographers being rousted for taking pictures in public .
Photographers ' rights campaign spawns lens cloth launch
Galaxy 15 , seen here in this pre-launch photo , suffered an irreparable malfunction last month that is causing it to drift through the GEO belt even as it continues to broadcast .
( credit : Orbital Sciences Corporation ) Dealing with Galaxy 15 : Zombiesats and on - orbit servicing
On April 8 , 2010 , news broke that the world ’s largest provider of fixed satellite services , Intelsat SA , had lost contact with one of its approximately 50 geosynchronous satellites .
More important , the satellite ’s receiver and transmitter equipment was still functioning as it started to drift eastwards from its location in the geosynchronous ( GEO ) belt .
Quickly dubbed “ zombiesat ” by the media , this combination of uncontrolled drifting while still having an active communications payload means that Galaxy 15 poses a serious concern to other satellite operations in the region of the GEO belt .
The first satellite it will encounter , AMC 11 , receives digital programming from cable - television channels , including the Food Network and MTV , and transmits it to all US cable systems for distribution .
The inability to easily and accurately determine what caused Galaxy 15 ’s malfunction is a strong incentive to improve the ability to attribute on - orbit failures , both to try and create solutions and to reduce tensions that could arise from a case of assumed hostile action .
Over the last two months that this story has developed , many significant questions have been raised about the long - term viability of operations in the GEO region given the current operational practices of global military , civil , and commercial operators .
This article examines the Galaxy 15 event in detail , explains what happened and why it poses such serious problems , and discusses some recommendations for dealing with this in the future in such a way we can continue to use space for benefits on Earth .
Part one of this article will discuss the Galaxy 15 situation in detail , based on all the facts and reporting to date .
Part two will examine the orbital mechanics of the GEO orbit and the implications for situations like Galaxy 15 .
Part three looks at the radiofrequency interference concerns .
Part four discusses solutions to future situations of this nature and presents policy recommendations .
In summary : This is a first - of - its - kind event , and Intelsat is setting a high standard for how a spacecraft operator should behave in a responsible manner , by communicating the problem to other space actors ( including competitors ) and working with them to minimize the negative impacts .
While there is no chance of Galaxy 15 colliding with another satellite in the near - term , it is now one of the hundreds of known pieces of space debris in the most heavily - used and economically valuable zones in Earth orbit , and will pose a long term hazard to GEO satellites located over North America for decades .
The inability to easily and accurately determine what caused Galaxy 15 ’s malfunction is a strong incentive to improve the ability to attribute on - orbit failures , both to try and create solutions and to reduce tensions that could arise from a case of assumed hostile action .
Development of on - orbit servicing ( OOS ) technologies and capabilities , along with improved global space situational awareness , are essential tools to help prevent situations like this in the future and minimizing the negative impacts such situations have on space activities and the space environment .
The dual - use and security implications of OOS technologies means they should be developed , and more importantly used , in an open and transparent manner to promote confidence and stability in space security .
1 . Just the facts , ma’am :
The situation with Galaxy 15 According to news reports , on April 5 , Galaxy 15 stopped responding to commands from ground operators .
Galaxy 15 was providing a variety of media services to North American customers , including video transmissions , and also had a payload used by the US Federal Aviation Administration .
Intelsat quickly decided to move one of its on - orbit spare satellites , Galaxy 12 , from a holding location to take Galaxy 15 ’s spot and customers .
Since the satellite continued to provide service to customers , originally Intelsat deemed the anomaly not terribly serious .
It would take a while for Galaxy 15 to drift far enough where its service was disrupted ; by then Galaxy 12 would be in place and able to take over .
On April 20 , Orbital Sciences , the company which built Galaxy 15 , suggested that the communications problems with Galaxy 15 were potentially caused by a large geomagnetic storm occurring in space .
In the early morning hours of April 5 the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center in Colorado released a space weather advisory warning bulletin about the storm .
Galaxy 15 had come out of the Earth ’s shadow and into view of the Sun as this storm was occurring , and some experts suspect this event somehow damaged the satellite ’s ability to receive or execute commands .
However , this has not nor may never be fully verified , in large part because of the lack of ability to correlate space weather with specific malfunctions and failures .
Whatever malfunction did occur did not affect either the satellite ’s ability to re-broadcast signals or its ability to keep its transponders pointed at the Earth and solar panels aligned with the Sun ( known as “ Earth lock ” ) .
This allowed the spacecraft to continue to receive and transmit signals .
What it did affect was the ability of Intelsat ’s ground controllers to maneuver Galaxy 15 to maintain its orbital position .
Intelsat issued between 150,000 and 200,000 commands to the satellite in an attempt to get a response to either turn off its communications payload or maneuver .
When these efforts failed , the company attempted to send an even stronger signal to try and force an overload of the satellite ’s power system and cause it to shut down .
This too failed .
As a result , the satellite continued to drift slowly eastward through the GEO belt .
What had seemed like a small problem was about to get much bigger .
On April 30 , the issue of possible interference with other satellites was publicly raised for the first time .
On May 4 , Intelsat announced that Galaxy 15 was too close to another satellite , AMC 11 , to attempt any further interventions .
Galaxy 15 drifted into AMC 11 ’s orbital slot around May 23 and is planned to exit around June 7 .
During this time , it could cause interference with AMC 11 ’s broadcasts .
Over the next few months , Galaxy 15 will continue to drift through the GEO belt and past other satellites , potentially causing more interference along the way .
As a result , the satellite continued to drift slowly eastward through the GEO belt .
What had seemed like a small problem was about to get much bigger .
Intelsat has announced that they will continue their attempts to regain control or turn off the satellite when the satellite is safely separated from others systems .
Given the immense effort Intelsat has already attempted in this regard , it is unlikely that this will succeed .
Fortunately , there is a failsafe option .
At some point , the momentum wheels used to maintain the satellite ’s orientation will saturate and the satellite will lose Earth lock .
Once that happens , the satellite will no longer able to point its solar panels at the Sun , will lose electrical power , and will shut down .
Even if control cannot be re-established at that point , it will mean Galaxy 15 will no longer be able to interfere with the broadcasts of other satellites .
The only question is how long it will be before this happens :
Intelsat ’s current estimates suggest that the failsafe scenario will occur at some point this summer .
In the meantime , SES , the owner of AMC 11 , has announced a plan for minimizing any interference caused by Galaxy 15 as it drifts past .
The plan involves moving another satellite , SES - 1 , into the same orbital box as AMC 11 .
As Galaxy 15 passes through the area , traffic will be switched to SES - 1 and then back to AMC 11 to stay as far away from Galaxy 15 as possible .
SES has posted a computer animation of this process on their website .
The plan also includes using a very high power antenna owned by Intelsat in Clarksburg , Maryland , to be able to better distinguish between the three satellites in the same box and transmit to the correct one with pinpoint accuracy .
2 . The big racetrack in the sky :
The orbital mechanics of GEO
To fully understand the technical issues involved in this event , one needs to take a close look at the space environment .
The geosynchronous region is defined by the Inter - Agency Debris Coordination Committee ( IADC ) as : a segment of the spherical shell defined by the following :
Lower altitude = geostationary altitude minus 200 km
Upper altitude = geostationary altitude plus 200 km
inclination of ±15 degrees from the Equator
where geostationary altitude is defined as 35,786 km Within this region is the geostationary belt , defined as a circular orbit 35,786 kilometers in altitude above the Earth with an inclination of zero ( meaning it is directly over the Equator ) .
Figure 1 illustrates this region graphically ( the geosynchronous region is in blue and the geostationary belt is in green ) : Figure 1 : IADC protected zones ( credit : European Space Agency )
One can imagine the geostationary belt as a giant circular racetrack and the satellites in that orbit as the cars , going around the Earth in the same general direction and altitude .
Although satellites in the belt are moving around the Earth at just under 11,300 kilometers per hour ( 7,000 mph ) , they appear to an observer on the surface of the Earth to be almost stationary in the sky because GEO spacecraft make one complete orbit in the same time it takes the Earth to rotate once .
If a spectator was to stand in the middle of the infield of a circular racetrack and turn in place at the same rate the cars were moving around the track , you would see the same effect — the cars would appear stationary .
Of course nothing in physics is ever this simple in reality , and indeed the situation in geostationary orbit is much more complex .
It is virtually impossible to have an exactly circular orbit at exactly the right altitude , which means every object in GEO is in an orbit with some amount of inclination and eccentricity .
Thus , instead of being a perfect stationary dot in the sky , satellites in GEO actually drift in a way that appears to trace a racetrack pattern on surface the Earth , with the north and south height of the racetrack corresponding to their inclination .
Satellites that can stay in a relatively fixed position relative to the Earth provide many useful services .
The biggest of these is the ability to provide communications , including television broadcasts and voice services .
Since the initial concept of a GEO communications satellite was theorized by Arthur C. Clarke in 1945 and the launch of the first commercial communications satellite , Telstar - 1 , in 1962 , it has become a massive global industry .
In 2008 , the worldwide satellite services industry , much of which utilizes the GEO belt , brought in revenues of $ 67.3 billion .
Because of this massive demand to place satellites in such a narrow region , there are measures in place to regulate the GEO zone .
An international legal framework managed by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) was put in place to license and distribute satellite frequencies ( in 1963 ) and slots ( in 1973 ) for geostationary orbit .
Each state or private entity that wishes to place a satellite in a specific position over the Equator must apply to the ITU for a license and receive permission if they would like their physical position and operating frequency to be protected from interference .
The ITU specifies “ slots ” in GEO by a certain amount of longitude along the Equator .
A slot is defined as the separation needed between satellites to prevent them from interfering with others .
Over North America these slots are currently two degrees of longitude , which translates to about 1470 kilometers ( 915 miles ) in the GEO belt .
There are almost twice as many dead and drifting objects in the GEO belt as there are operational payloads .
Within their assigned slot , a satellite operator usually maintains their satellite within a specific orbital “ box ” .
The size of this box depends on a number of factors , including how precise the satellite ’s position needs to be to serve its customers and how accurately the operator can determine and maintain its position .
Typically a GEO box is around 0.1 deg of longitude or 70 kilometers ( 43.5 miles ) in length .
In certain situations , a satellite operator might be operating multiple satellites within the same slot in what is called a cluster .
Clusters allows for a lot more satellites to be packed into the same area , but create significant challenges for keeping the satellites separated .
A satellite operator must periodically perform “ station - keeping maneuvers ” to stay within their box and slot because there are several natural forces at work in the GEO region called perturbations that change orbits over time .
There are three significant perturbations to focus on in GEO .
The first major perturbation is the gravitational pull of the Earth .
The exact forward velocity of a satellite in orbit around the Earth is determined by the strength of the Earth ’s gravitational pull and the altitude of the satellite .
The Earth is not a perfect sphere so it follows that its gravitational field , which is a function of its mass , is not the same everywhere around it .
In fact , there are two “ bulges ” along the Equator at approximately 75° East longitude and 105° West longitude , over the Indian subcontinent and North America , respectively .
As described earlier , these gravity “ troughs ” ( officially called libration points ) pull satellites in geostationary orbit east or west towards whichever point is closest , giving the satellite an apparent east or west drift as viewed from the ground .
The second major perturbation in the GEO orbit is the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun .
The Moon orbits the Earth at an average altitude of 384,400 kilometers ( 238,800 miles ) and at an inclination of between 18° and 28° with respect to the Equator .
This means that the Moon is always either above or below the GEO belt and thus its gravity pulls objects in GEO north or south with respect to the Equator .
The Sun , although incredibly massive , is much further away at an average of almost 143 million kilometers ( 93 million miles ) from the Earth , so its gravitational pull has less of an impact on satellite orbits , although it is still important .
The third major perturbation is called solar radiation pressure and it is caused by photons being emitted by the Sun .
A photon is the particle that makes up light .
It has no mass but carries momentum .
The photons being emitted by the Sun striking objects in orbit transfers some of this momentum , and causes a change in the object ’s orbit .
The amount of change depends on the object ’s surface area in relation to its mass .
A compact or heavy object will barely be affected by solar radiation pressure .
However , for objects with huge solar panels , such as a communications satellite , it can significantly change their orbit over time .
The annual Classification of Geosynchronous Objects , published by the European Space Agency ’s Space Debris Office , is the best reference for what sorts of objects are located in GEO and how many there are .
The February 2010 report provides the following details : A total of 1,238 objects known objects are in the GEO region : 391 are under some level of control ( either in longitude , inclination , or both )
594 are in a drift orbit
169 have been captured by one of the two libration points
11 are uncontrolled with no recent orbital elements available ( usually meaning they are lost )
66 do not exist in the U.S. military ’s public satellite catalog but can be associated to a specific launch
As these numbers illustrate , there are almost twice as many dead and drifting objects in the GEO belt as there are operational payloads .
And there are likely to be many more pieces of space debris that have not yet been detected : current space situational awareness ( SSA ) capabilities can only reliably detect objects to about the size of a basketball at GEO altitudes .
Compounding the problem of space debris are satellites that are left in the GEO belt at the end of their service life .
According to the recently adopted United Nations Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines , which are based on the more extensive IADC Guidelines , spacecraft operators are supposed to perform an end - of - life disposal maneuver to remove their satellite from the protected GEO region .
This usually involves a series of maneuvers to boost it at least 250 kilometers ( 155 miles ) above the active GEO belt .
Unfortunately , the guidelines do n’t resolve problems associated with spacecraft left in the GEO belt during the early years of the space age , and compliance with these guidelines for new spacecraft is still spotty at best .
According to the February 2010 Classification of Geosynchronous Objects report , of the 21 GEO spacecraft that reached end - of - life in 2009 , only 11 were disposed of properly .
Several were moved out of the active belt but not into an orbit high enough to ensure that they do not cause problems in the near future .
Three spacecraft , all Russian , appear to have been abandoned in the active belt and are now librating about the 75° East libration point .
Four rocket bodies , three Russian and one American , which were used to place payloads in GEO , also orbit within the protected zone .

Figure 2 sums up all of this information about active satellites , debris , and drifters to give a picture of what the GEO environment looks like .
Active satellites are in green and orange , while space debris is in red .
Far from being the simple , straightforward , organized region as it is sometimes portrayed , the GEO environment is in reality a chaotic place .
Accurate stationkeeping by all satellite operators is extremely important , and the in - place failure of a satellite like Galaxy 15 makes this problem worse .
While it is unlikely that Galaxy 15 will collide with another object in the near future , our current inability to remove it from the active belt means that it will remain in the region essentially forever .
While it is unlikely that Galaxy 15 will collide with another object in the near future , our current inability to remove it from the active belt means that it will remain in the region essentially forever .
Over the next several weeks , Galaxy 15 will continue to drift eastward from its original slot at 133° W towards the libration point over North America at 105° W , approximately where the Rocky Mountains are .
To picture what happens next , consider a car on top of a hill with a road that goes down into a valley and then back up to another hill .
If the car is pushed down the hill , it will go through the bottom and up the other side .
If it has enough speed , it will go up and over the other side and escape the trough .
But if it does not , then it will stop somewhere on the far hill short of the top and then roll back down , through the bottom , and then back up the first hill .
Eventually , after several trips up and down , the car will settle at the bottom of the valley .
The same physics are at work with the libration points .
If Galaxy 15 ’s drift rate is high enough , it will drift through the 105° W libration point and continue across the Atlantic Ocean and perhaps be captured by the 75° E point over India .
But it is much more likely that Galaxy 15 will be trapped in the gravitational valley created by the 105° W libration point and oscillate back and forth on either side of it , joining the other 43 pieces of space debris already trapped there , all of which pose a long - term navigation hazard to the GEO satellites located over North America .

[ Could Remedy actually have harmed Alan Wake 's fear factor by ... developing it too correctly ?
Gamasutra 's Leigh Alexander looks at why it's not that scary , and where design best practices fail the horror genre . ]
What truly scares us ?
Uncertainty , desperation , feeling lost in the darkness , a sense of lurking threat , or a sudden moment of immediate danger .
And these are elements that can't feel deliberate or engineered -- they should be organic , personal and spontaneous .
It 's because of all of this that Remedy 's Alan Wake is n't all that scary .
Sure , it has its moments -- the fluid , shadowy enemy bodies are completely creeptastic , and when one suddenly hits Alan with a projectile , making his vision go red , it can be arresting .
Alan
Wake is a game whose overall sum is actually harmed by how well - made are its parts .
It sounds counterintuitive , but bear with me .
Game design is continually evolving to better couple depth with accessibility , to better communicate with players , and to avoid frustrating them .
One primary way of achieving these ends is to use clear communication -- auditory , environmental , verbal and user interface cues , for example .
Alan Wake employs these tactics brilliantly .
The work 's over - arching light - and - dark language and the eerily luminous paint cues that lure the player smartly in the right direction are effective and immediately comprehensible .
In fact , perhaps they 're too comprehensible .
Thanks to the creative execution of the concept that " when you 're in the light you 're safe , and when you 're in the dark , you 're not " -- plus the subtle , cinematic application of environmental sound and atmospheric music -- players always know when they 're liable to be attacked and when they 're not .
Element of surprise , gone .
And those gilded paint signatures hidden elegantly in the dark , visible only when they reflect light ?
Brilliant as player guides ... that often lead to hidden caches of extra supplies .
This means that when resources are low , the player can have at least some confidence that they 'll soon uncover more .
Cross off the element of threat , too .
Aside from the goal of making games accessible and deep at the same time , game designers are continually challenged to find creative ways not just to communicate clearly with players , but to do so without without being literal .
This means teaching through evolving gameplay rather than forcing a tutorial , for example , or providing information with environmental cues rather than on - screen text .
But in the " thriller " genre in particular ( what we 'd call " survival horror " in the heyday of Silent Hill and Resident Evil ) , if the environment is communication - friendly , the fear factor is gone .
Fear and tension is derived from one 's inability to understand the environment around them .
A player that never gets lost , tricked or frustrated wo n't be scared .
Alan Wake 's story does n't help it much either .
Its tone and conventions should be fairly familiar to anyone who 's ever read the back of a Dean Koontz paperback in the grocery store line .
Those paperbacks , of course , have sold jillions , so it makes sense that a game developer wanting to build a broad - audience product would take cues from it .
Nonetheless , familiarity 's not frightening either , and neither is predictability -- plus , the faint gloss of pulp breaks investment .
Alan
Wake does show just how many lessons have been learned since the clumsier , more frustrating survival horror days .
But while no one wants to go back to bad combat , punishing difficulty and hours wasted on unclear objectives , those games were somehow much more frightening .
Remedy did everything right here , but the result is illustrative : games have n't gotten horror quite down yet , and maybe it 's because the " best " way to make a broadly - appealing video game does n't necessarily apply to the genre .
AN AMERICAN cartoonist whose work inspired the controversial " Everybody Draw Mohammed Page " on Facebook has condemned the effort and issued an apology to Muslims .
Molly Norris , of Seattle , drew a cartoon in April to protest the decision by the US television channel Comedy Central to cancel an episode of the popular show South Park over its depiction of the Prophet Mohammed in a bear suit .
In her cartoon , Norris satirically proposed May 20 as an " Everybody Draw Mohammed Day " .
An " Everybody Draw Mohammed Day " page quickly turned up on Facebook but Norris , writing on her website at mollynorris.com , said she had nothing to do with it .
" I did NOT ' declare ' May 20 to be " Everybody Draw Mohammed Day , " she said , adding that her idea was satire but " was taken seriously , hijacked and made viral " .
" I never started a Facebook page ; I never set up any place for people to send drawings to and I never received any drawings , " she said .
" The vitriol this ' day ' has brought out , of people who only want to draw obscene images , is offensive to Muslims who did nothing to endanger our right to expression in the first place , " she said .
" I apologise to people of Muslim faith and ask that this ' day ' be called off , " she said .
The " Draw Mohammed " page has led to Facebook being blocked in Pakistan and sparked angry protests and condemnation from the foreign ministry , which denounced the " publication of blasphemous caricatures of our holy prophet . "
The Facebook page on Tuesday had drawn over 89,000 fans - and a slew of crude photo - shopped pictures and caricatures .
Among the dozens of pictures and drawings submitted to the Facebook page are depictions of a man in Arab garb engaged in sexual acts , blowing things up or portrayed as a pig , an animal considered unclean by Muslims .
The purported creator of the Facebook page said meanwhile that he started it to stand up for " freedom of expression . "
" We did n't really know that this would expand so extremely , " the man , who would be identified only as " Andy , " said in a voice - only interview with the US television channel MSNBC .
" We know that the fight for freedom of expression , freedom of speech can't be stopped by a country like Pakistan censoring the internet , " he added .
The Facebook page itself calls for " creative and funny depictions of Mohammed " and says " there is no need to make hateful and totally respectless depiction of him . "
" We are not trying to slander the average Muslim , it 's not a Muslim / Islam hatepage , " the page says .
" We simply want to show the extremists that threaten to harm people because of their Mohammed depictions , that we 're not afraid of them .
" That they can't take away our right to freedom of speech by trying to scare us to silence , " it says .
Islam strictly prohibits the depiction of any prophet as blasphemous and Muslims across the globe staged angry protests over the publication of satirical cartoons of Mohammed in European newspapers four years ago .

Science & Exploration Rosetta ’s blind date with asteroid Lutetia
15/06/2010 2795 views 3 likes
ESA ’s comet - chaser Rosetta is heading for a blind date with asteroid Lutetia .
Rosetta does not yet know what Lutetia looks like up - close but beautiful or otherwise the two will meet on 10 July .
Like many first dates , Rosetta will meet Lutetia on a Saturday night , flying to within 3200 km of the space rock .
Rosetta started taking navigational sightings of Lutetia at the end of May so that ground controllers can determine any course corrections required to achieve their intended flyby distance .
The close pass will allow around 2 hours of good imaging .
The spacecraft will instantly begin beaming the data back to Earth and the first pictures will be released later that evening .
Rosetta flew by asteroid Steins in 2008 and other space missions have encountered a handful of asteroids .
Each asteroid has proven to be an individual and Lutetia is expected to continue the trend .
Rosetta encountered asteroid Steins in 2008
Although recent high resolution ground - based images have given some idea of the overall shape of Lutetia , we have no idea what it looks like in detail .
Rosetta will tell us that .
Orbiting in the main belt of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter , initially it was thought that Lutetia is around 95 km in diameter but only mildly elliptical .
Recent estimates suggest 134 km , with a pronounced elongation .
Rosetta will tell us for certain and will also investigate the composition of the asteroid , wherein lies another mystery .
By any measure , Lutetia is quite large .
Planetary scientists believe that it is a primitive asteroid left on the shelf for billions of years because no planet consumed it as the Solar System formed .
Indeed , most measurements appear to back this picture , making the asteroid out to be a ‘ C - type ’ , which contains primitive compounds of carbon .
Rosetta 's ultimate destination is Comet Churyumov - Gerasimenko
However , some measurements suggest that Lutetia is an ‘ M - type ’ , which could mean there are metals in its surface .
“ If Lutetia is a metallic asteroid then we have found a real winner , ” says Rita Schulz , ESA Rosetta Project Scientist .
That is because although metallic asteroids do exist , they are thought to be fragments of the metallic core of larger asteroids that have since been shattered into pieces .
If Lutetia is made of metal or even contains large amounts of metal , Dr Schulz says that the traditional asteroid classification scheme will need rethinking .
“ C - class asteroids should not have metals on their surfaces , ” she says .
Asteroid science stands to gain once this observational conundrum is resolved because Rosetta ’s data will provide a valuable collection of ‘ ground truths ’ that can be used to resolve conflicting ground - based observations not just for Lutetia but for other asteroids as well .
Rosetta spacecraft
For 36 hours around the moment of closest approach , Rosetta will be in almost continuous contact with the ground .
The only breaks will come as Earth rotates and engineers have to switch from one tracking station to another .
Good contact is essential because the uncertainties in the asteroid ’s position and shape may demand last minute fine - tuning to keep it centred in Rosetta ’s instruments during the flyby .
“ The skeleton of the operation is in place , and we have the ability to update our plans at any time , ” says Andrea Accomazzo , ESA Rosetta Spacecraft Operations Manager .

Two boys , aged 13 and 14 , have been convicted of the gang rape of an intoxicated 12 - year - old girl in the Kimberley .
The girl visited one of the boys ' homes on a quiet street in Kununurra on December 24 .
The 12 - year - old was so drunk she passed out .
After a discussion between themselves , both boys decided to have sex with the sleeping girl .
They later put her clothes back on and called her mother to collect her .
The incident was reported to police after she woke up .
Detective Alan Goodger says the investigation was disturbing on many levels .
" There 's a number of issues police are concerned with , " he said .
" We 're obviously very concerned when a 12 - year - old girl is subject to an offence like this because we 're obviously aware of the long - term effect it can have on a juvenile .
" And we 're appalled at the apparent lack of supervision of those children . "
Two of the boys have been sentenced to eight and 15 months ' detention .
An 11 - year - old also involved in the assault has been convicted and will be sentenced in August .

Not Exactly Rocket Science covers a fascinating study on how touching different objects influences how we perceive the world – based on abstract associations between things like weight and seriousness .
Weight is linked to importance , so that people carrying heavy objects deem interview candidates as more serious and social problems as more pressing .
Texture is linked to difficulty and harshness .
Touching rough sandpaper makes social interactions seem more adversarial , while smooth wood makes them seem friendlier .
Finally , hardness is associated with rigidity and stability .
When sitting on a hard chair , negotiators take tougher stances but if they sit on a soft one instead , they become more flexible .
The study , led by psychologist Joshua Ackerman , involved a series of innovative experiments that asked people to complete tasks and looked at the effect of simply changing texture or sensation on how the participants ’ behaved or perceived the situation .
For example :
Ackerman also looked at the influence of an object ‚Äôs hardness .
He asked 49 volunteers to touch either a hard block of word or a soft blanket , under the pretence of examining objects to be used in a magic act .
Afterwards , when they read an interaction between a boss and an employee , those who felt the wood thought the employee was stricter and more rigid than those who touched the blanket ( but no less positive )
This has obvious practical implications and I suspect attractive shop assistants will find themselves puzzled by sudden influx of the oddly alluring strangers who keep asking for a couple of peaches before asking them out .

Two - time gubernatorial loser Dino Rossi is going for thirds , but this time he 's after Senator Patty Murray 's seat .
Rossi is Washington State 's biggest douche - bag .
That 's quite the honor , because our state has no shortage of douche - bag Republicans who are desperate losers .
When progressives heard he was running for Senate after losing against Governor Christine Gregoire two times in a row , there was a collective moan heard throughout the world .

CIA director says ‘ at most ’ 50 to 100 Al Qaeda in Afghanistan
How can a company allegedly responsible for killing 17 unarmed civilians in Baghdad in 2007 continue to get State Department and CIA contracts ?
CIA Director Leon Panetta says there is “ not much choice ” because few companies have the capabilities of Blackwater .
“ Since I have become director , I have asked our agency to review every contract we have had with Blackwater and whatever their new name is now —
Xe — to ensure first and foremost that we have no contract in which they are engaged in any CIA operations .
We ’re doing our own operations .
That ’s important that we not contract that out to anybody , ” Panetta told ABC ’s Jake Tapper Sunday .

“ But at the same time I have to tell you that in the war zone , we continue to have needs for security .
You ’ve got a lot of forward bases .
You ’ve got a lot of attacks on some of those bases .
We ’ve got to have security .
Unfortunately , there are few companies that provide that kind of security , ” Panetta continued .
“ State Department relies on them .
We rely on them to a certain extent .
So , we ’ve bid out some of those contracts .
They provided a bid that underbid everyone else by about $ 26 million and a panel that we had said that they can do the job , that they ’ve shaped up their act , ” he said .
“ There was really not much choice but to accept that contract , ” said Panetta .
“ But having said that , I will tell you that I continue to be very cautious about any of those contracts and we ’re reviewing all of the bids that we have with that company , ” he concluded .
The CIA recently signed a new $ 100 - million contract with Blackwater to guard its facilities in Afghanistan .

50 TO 100 AL QAEDA IN AFGHANISTAN
Panetta also told ABC ’s Jake Tapper that he estimates there are somewhere in the vicinity of 50 to 100 Al Qaeda operatives inside Afghanistan .
“ ThereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s no question that the main location of Al Qaeda is in the tribal areas of Pakistan , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said .

Faiz Shakir at ThinkProgress notes that , with approximately 100,000 US troops in Afghanistan , that works out to 1,000 troops per Al Qaeda agent .
FEDS WON’T CHARGE BLACKWATER IN ATTEMPT TO BREAK SANCTIONS

The US wo n’t charge Blackwater over its attempts to secure security contracts in restive southern Sudan , even though the company ’s attempts evidently violated sanctions placed on Sudan by the US , McClatchy news service reports .
The effort to drum up new business in East Africa by Blackwater owner Erik Prince , a former Navy SEAL who had close ties with top officials in the George W. Bush White House and the CIA , became a major element in a continuing four - year federal investigation into allegations of sanctions violations , illegal exports and bribery .
The Obama administration , however , has decided for now not to bring criminal charges against Blackwater , according to a U.S. official close to the case .
Had the company been indicted , it could have been suspended from doing business with the U.S. government , and a conviction could have brought debarment from all government contracts , including providing guard services for the CIA and State Department in war zones .

City after city is taking LA 's lead on boycotting Arizona because of their draconian immigration law , so it was time for the xenophobes to respond .
An Arizona utility commissioner said he 's willing to pull the plug on Los Angeles if the city goes through with a boycott of his state .
In a letter to the city of LA , a member of Arizona 's power commission said he would ask Arizona utility companies to cut off the power supply to Los Angeles .
LA gets about 25 percent of its power from Arizona .
" That is one commissioner who has that idea -- whether he can do that or not is another idea , " said LA Councilman Dennis Zine .
" They are the ones who have to make the move , not us . "
The commissioner 's power grid play is in response to the city 's approval of a resolution directing city staff to consider which contracts with Arizona can be terminated .
Here 's part Arizona Corporation Commission member Gary Pierce 's letter to the mayor :
If an economic boycott is truly what you desire , I will be happy to encourage Arizona utilities to renegotiate your power agreements so Los Angeles no longer receives any power from Arizona - based generation .
I am confident that Arizona ’s utilities would be happy to take those electrons off your hands .
If , however , you find that the City Council lacks the strength of its convictions to turn off the lights in Los Angeles and boycott Arizona power , please reconsider the wisdom of attempting to harm Arizona ’s economy .
-- Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is in Washington D.C. , meeting with Mexican President Felipe Calderon , but his deputy chief of staff issued the following statement : " The mayor stands strongly behind the city council and he will not respond to threats from the state that has isolated itself from an America that values freedom , liberty and basic civil rights . "
Councilmember Tom LaBonge said he'd like to talk with Pierce .
LaBonge said the city needs to look into its long standing utility agreements with Arizona .
LaBonge met Wednesday morning with LA Department of Water and Power officials .
" We have right of ownership of the power plants , " LaBonge told NBCLA .
" We partially own them . "
Other California cities , including Oakland and San Francisco , have passed similar measures .
On Tuesday , Berkeley became the latest California city to boycott Arizona .
The City Council voted unanimously to restrict staff from traveling to the state on city business .
There is no " Power Play , " really , because after reading the letter from Commissioner Pierce , he 's talking about renegotiating power agreements and not just shutting off those electrons .
The letter is a PR ploy .
Does Arizona want to lose even more valuable revenue since they 've lost so much business already because of SB 1070 ?
And if they really could cut off the sales , and yet did n't have a buyer , it would fall into that old " who would they sell it to " mode .
That 's called " cutting off your nose to spite your face . "
Meanwhile , Gov. Brewer is in serious panic mode and transfered 250K from her Dept. of Commerce to Arizona 's Office of Tourism to try and rebrand the state 's image .
Acknowledging that Arizona has developed a serious image problem because of its tough new immigration law , Gov. Jan Brewer and tourism - industry leaders said Thursday that they will launch a new effort to stanch the flow of lost trade and convention business in the state .
The legislation and firestorm of negative publicity that followed brought calls for boycotts , moved groups to back out of local conventions and led several cities to cut business ties with Arizona companies .
The loss of business is critical in a recession - battered state vitally dependent on visitor spending .
" It 's up to us to get the truth out there .
This is impacting Arizona 's face to the nation , " said Brewer , who blamed the controversy on misconceptions about the law .
A new task force is charged with rebranding and repositioning the state as a unique destination spot .
That is sure to be a tough task after weeks of talk - show comedians , celebrities , politicians and others making Arizona a punch line , calling the law racist and drawing comparisons to fascism and Nazi Germany .
Senate Bill 1070 , which Brewer signed April 23 and which takes effect in late July , requires police to ask a person about his or her immigration status if there is " reasonable suspicion " the person is in the country illegally .
Being in the country illegally will be a state crime under the law .
One of the task force 's first goals will be trying to stop the trend of boycotts , officials said .
An early plan for how to do that is due in about a month .
" The end goal is to reassert that we are a safe , inviting , diverse and culturally aware community , " said Steve Moore , president and CEO of the Greater Phoenix Convention and Visitors Bureau .
Steve Moore meant to say that Arizona is safe for the Pat Buchanan's of America .

Faux Randomness Strikes Again : How Researchers Realized Research 2000's Daily Kos Data Looked Faked
from the random - ain 't - so - random dept
Common sense says that that result is highly unlikely , but it helps to do a more precise calculation .
Since the odds of getting a match each time are essentially 50 % , the odds of getting 776/778 matches are just like those of getting 776 heads on 778 tosses of a fair coin .
Results that extreme happen less than one time in 10228 .
That 's one followed by 228 zeros .
( The number of atoms within our cosmic horizon is something like 1 followed by 80 zeros . )
For the Unf , the odds are less than one in 10231 .
( Having some Undecideds makes Fav and Unf nearly independent , so these are two separate wildly unlikely events . )
There is no remotely realistic way that a simple tabulation and subsequent rounding of the results for M's and F's could possibly show that detailed similarity .
Therefore the numbers on these two separate groups were not generated just by independently polling them .
How do we know that the real data could n't possibly have many changes of +1 % or - 1 % but few changes of 0 % ?
Let 's make an imaginative leap and say that , for some inexplicable reason , the actual changes in the population 's opinion were always exactly +1 % or - 1 % , equally likely .
Since real polls would have substantial sampling error ( about +/- 2 % in the week - to - week numbers even in the first 60 weeks , more later ) the distribution of weekly changes in the poll results would be smeared out , with slightly more ending up rounding to 0 % than to - 1 % or +1 % .
No real results could show a sharp hole at 0 % , barring yet another wildly unlikely accident .

You may have heard by now that the political website Daily Kos has come out and explained that it believes the polling firm it has used for a while , Research 2000 , was faking its data .
While it 's nice to see a publication come right out and bluntly admit that it had relied on data that it now believes was not legit , what 's fascinating if you 're a stats geek is how a team of stats geeks figured out there were problems with the data .
As any good stats nerd knows , the concept of " randomness " is n't quite as random as some people think , which is whyrandomness almost always leads to tell - tale signs that the data was faked or manipulated .
For example , one very , very common test is to use Benford 's Law to look at the first digit of data in a data set , because in a truly random set , the distribution is not what people usually expect .
In this case , the three guys who had problems with the data ( Mark Grebner , Michael Weissman , and Jonathan Weissman ) zeroed in on just a few clues that the data was faked or manipulated .
The first thing they noticed was that when R2 K did polls that tested how men and women viewed certain politicians or political parties ( favorable / unfavorable ) there was an odd pattern : if the percentage of men that rated a particular politician favorable or unfavorable was an even number , so was the the percentage of female raters .
It seemed like these two points always matched up .
If the male percentage was even the female percentage was even .
If the male percentage was odd , the female percentage was odd .
Yet , as you should know , these are independent variables , not influenced by each other .
That 34 % of men find a particular politician favorable should have no bearing on why an even percentage of women find that politician favorable .
In fact , this happened inthat R2 K did , to such a level as to suggest it being as close to impossible as you can imagine :
The other statistical analysis that I found fascinating was that when you looked at weekly changes in favorability ratings , the R2 K data almost always changed a bit .
But , if you look at other data , no change is the most common result .
As they point out , if you look at , say , Gallup data , you get this nice typical bell curve :
But if you look at the R2 K data , you get things like the following : Notice that substantial dip at the 0 % mark .
That seems to indicate a likelihood of faked or manipulated data , from someone who thinks that " random " data means the data has to keep changing .
Back to Grebner , Weissman and Weissman : Kos is apparently planning legal action , and so far R2 K has n't responded in much detail other than to claim that its polls were conducted properly .
I 'm not all that interested in that part of the discussion however .
I just find it neat how the " faux randomness " may have exposed the problems with the data .

A Northern Ireland garage mechanic who drove for three miles with a disgruntled customer clamped to the bonnet of his car has been cleared of a raft of charges including assault and dangerous driving , the Belfast Telegraph reports .
Gerry Brown , 53 , was at his yard near Castlewellan in February 2008 when Lesley Quirey and his uncle Philip Quirey turned up to demand a refund on a second - hand car Brown had sold to the former for £ 350 .
The vehicle had broken down after a week , and the Quireys were evidently none too pleased .
A row quickly ensued , and Lesley Quirey " ran around to the back of his car , where there was a Staffordshire bull terrier and pickaxe handle and I immediately thought that something was n’t right " , as Brown explained .
He continued : " I just wanted to get out of there .
They followed me in their car through Castlewellan .
I had to stop at temporary traffic lights and Philip Quirey got out of his car and ran over to mine .
“ I saw him coming through my wing mirror and I locked the doors as I did n’t want him getting at me .
He started banging on the car with his fists then jumped on the bonnet .
He is a very big man , about 6ft 4 and about 19 stone and he left a dent in the bonnet .
All I could think of was to keep driving and to get to the police station . ”
Brown added : “ I really thought I was in danger .
I do n’t feel that I had any other choice but to keep driving .
I was n’t driving fast , about 30 mph and he had plenty of chances to get off .
I phoned the police to tell them there was someone on the bonnet of my car and I was too afraid to stop .
I told them to get someone there quick as it was an emergency .
" They said there was nobody available and kept telling me I had to stop , but I told them I was n’t stopping until I got to the police station .
They told me I could n’t drive down the Main Street of Newcastle with someone on the bonnet of my car and I said ‘ yes I can ’ . ”
After three miles Brown was pulled by cops and subsequently charged with the aforementioned assault and dangerous driving , plus driving while using a mobile phone .
Two years later , Downpatrick District Judge Mr Mervyn Bates has shown all the charges the door , having listened to a recording of Brown 's 999 call , in which he said : “ I ’ve got a New Zealander on the bonnet of my car .
He ’s f****** lost it .
He ’s going to kill me .
I ’m not stopping .
This man is going to kill me .
He ’s three times the size of me . ”
Bates said he was was “ extremely satisfied that these two men , heavily - built , were intent on intimidating Mr Brown , who is of slight build , into doing something or refunding cash " .
He declared : “ I accept as a fact that Mr Brown drove at moderate speed and did not swerve despite his obvious concern and fear that I could hear in his voice .
I do n’t think he had a choice but to drive on with Mr Quirey on the bonnet of his car . ”
Regarding the Staffordshire bull terrier , Philip Quirey admitted he and his nephew happened to have one in the car boot , but " denied this was to intimidate the defendant " .
He claimed the pickaxe handle was " a toy for the dog " .
The judge expressed surprise that the Quireys had not been prosecuted " in relation to the contents of their car " . ®
Ireland 's economic miracle was a mirage and it should consider leaving the Euro say two leading economists writing in The New York Times .
They also say Ireland 's real economic situation is as bad if not worse than Greece when you take multinational tax havens out of the equation .
Simon Johnson , former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund , and Peter Boone of the London School of Economics say that " Ireland ’s politicians , rather than facing up to their problems , are making things ever worse .
Simply put , the Irish miracle was a mirage driven by clever use of tax - haven rules and a huge credit boom that permitted real estate prices and construction to grow quickly before declining ever more rapidly . ”
They claim that " Ireland ’s problems are , sadly , far deeper than the need for simple fiscal austerity .
The Celtic Tiger ’s impressive reported growth over the past decades was in part based on its aggressive attempts to help major corporations in the United States reduce their tax bills .
" The remarkable success of this tax haven means that roughly 20 percent of Irish gross domestic product is actually ‘ profit transfers ’ that raise little tax for Ireland and are owned by foreign companies .
Since most of these profits are subject to the tax code , they are accounted for in Ireland where they are lightly taxed ; they should not be counted as part of Ireland ’s potential tax base .
A more robust cross-country comparison would be to examine Ireland ’s financial condition ignoring these transfers ....
“ When we adjust Ireland ’s figures accordingly , the situation is dire .
The budget deficit was about 17.9 percent of G.N.P. in 2009 , and based on European Commission data ( and assuming the G.N.P. - G.D.P. gap remains the same ) it will be roughly 14.6 percent in 2010 and 15.1 percent in 2011 .
“ There is no simple escape , but if the government hopes to avoid a sovereign default , the one overriding priority should be to stop bailing out the banks .
Instead , the government should wind down existing banks in a “ bad bank , ” while moving their deposit base and profitable businesses into new , well - capitalized banks that can function without a taxpayer burden .
This will be messy , but it is far better than a sovereign default .
“ Finally , the Irish need to consider seriously whether being in the euro zone is worth the cost .
The adjustment to this awful situation would be far easier outside the euro zone — even though leaving the zone might have adverse repercussions for other nations .
Once again , a comprehensive program with European Union and I.M.F. support might make this the least worse option . ”
I love San Francisco so much that it 's almost a problem .
When I think about taking a trip somewhere , my next thought is , " yeah , but there 's so much awesome stuff going on right here , too . "
Of course , no city is perfect .
San Francisco 's faults are common to most big cities : parking is a pain traffic gets unwieldy during rush hour .
Enter the moped .
I used to think that " moped " was another name for scooter , but it 's not .
Considering that mopeds , with a few exceptions , have n't been mass produced since the 1980s , it 's not all that surprising that no one knows what they are anymore .
A moped is actually a hybrid between a small motorcycle and a bicycle .
They were originally designed for the motors to assist in pedaling , not to completely take over .
As small engines became more powerful the need for human power diminished and eventually they were replaced with scooters .
If you want a moped these days , you have to buy an old one , usually from the seventies .
And if you live in a city , it might be something you should consider .
Here 's why :
Parking
Mopeds walk the line between bikes and motorcycles , and in most places get the benefits of each .
My moped goes between 40 - 50 mph at top speed , which means that just like a motorcycle , I can keep up with traffic , go up steep hills , and get places quickly .
However , unlike a motorcycle , I can park it absolutely anywhere I want , including sidewalks .
I go anywhere I want in San Francisco without even considering parking , and 100 % of the time am able to chain the bike up to a street sign or parking meter .
Speed
Like motorcycles , I can drive in between lanes of traffic .
That means that if there 's a huge line for a red light , I zoom up to the front and cut the whole line .
It 's considered rude if other bikers are in it , but I can also use bike lanes .
And , in a pinch , I can even drive slowly on a sidewalk if I need to go the wrong way on a one - way street .
I 've timed myself against friends with cars a few times , and I always get places faster than them , usually 30 % faster -- and that 's not even factoring in parking .
Fuel Efficiency
Just like the average car driver , I fill up my tank every week .
The difference is that I put in about .7 gallons , which comes out to $ 2 usually .
I use the moped as my primary transportation around the city , driving every day , and that covers me .
If you happen to run out of gas you can put it into bike mode and pedal it around .
Fun
This is mostly just a summation of the benefits I already mentioned , but together they make the moped a really fun and effortless way to get around .
Zipping around the streets , weaving past cars stuck in traffic , and never worrying about parking make it a real joy to get around the city .
Cheap
A totally awesome moped will cost you less than a thousand .
I 'm selling my old one for $ 700 , but you can buy slow - but - running ones for as low as $ 400 .
Parts and upgrades are all pretty cheap , too .
A new big carb is $ 70 , a new pipe is $ 100 - 200 , a 64 cc upgrade kit is $ 150 .
Laws vary by state , but you generally do n't have to buy insurance for them .
If you have to register them ( in some places you do n't ) , it 's likely to be a one time fee of around $ 20 for the lifetime of the moped .
The Downsides
People get annoyed ( maybe rightly so ) when I declare something the best thing ever and then do n't address the downsides .
So let 's get to that .
I consider this to be a positive , but since these things are forty years old or so , you can't exactly bring them to the dealership to get them serviced .
You end up doing a lot of the maintenance yourself .
Believe it or not , that 's one of the reasons I bought my moped initially ; I felt like as a guy / human , I should understand how engines work and be able to work on them .
I went in knowing just about nothing about engines , and now have done all sorts of work , including scary sounding things like replacing the cylinder and piston , replacing the carburetor , and adjusting the brake cables .
Maybe most importantly , I have a decent idea of how a two stroke engine works and how all the components work together .
Most of this knowledge is thanks to moped enthusiasts at the shops and from mopedarmy.com .
Mopeds have the simplest engines possible , so they 're great to learn on .
If you 're not willing to learn , you 'd better live near a moped shop .
San Francisco and Austin both have excellent ones , but most places do n't .
Which one to Buy ?
My moped is a 1974 Vespa Ciao with a 64 cc kit , Polini Top One pipe , 13:13 carb , variator , and Red air filter .
That 's about as tricked out as a Vespa Ciao can get .
A Vespa Ciao was my only option because I needed something light and small so that I can store it in my RV while driving .
It 's a great choice , but a stock Ciao needs to be upgraded before it can handle any sorts of hills .
The most popular brand is Puch , and I believe they 're a bit more powerful out of the gate .
The best place to find one is your local Craigslist .
PESHAWAR : Pakistan will need 3,057 additional health facilities , 4.6 million housing units and 8.6 million employment opportunities in the current year , just to maintain the current per capita levels services , according to a PPI report .
The estimates above use figures from the year 2000 as basis .
At 1.9 % Population Growth Rate ( PGR ) annually , Pakistan ’s population will be doubled in 37 years , unless and until there is a well - coordinated combination of measures to reduce fertility rate
Pakistan , with a population of 153.45 million in mid 2005 was the 6th most populated country in the world .
Since 1901 , the population of the area now constituting Pakistan has increased nine - fold .
In absolute numbers ; almost 111 million persons have been added to the population in the 44 years ( 1961-2005 ) .
As a result , movement of population to urban areas had increased from 6 million in 1951 to 43 millions in 1998 .
In 1998 , almost one - third of population of Pakistan was residing in urban areas imposing competing demands on available infrastructure like housing , transportation , electricity , water , sewerage , sanitation , etcetera .
The fast growth of population is also putting pressure on agricultural land ; there were 4.1 million agricultural farms in 1980 .
Due to fragmentation their number had risen to 6.2 million in 2000 .
Pakistan ’s rapid population growth is one of the main impediments in way of government efforts for achieving the overall National Development Goals and Sustained Socio - Economic growth .
It is imperative to stabilize population so that burden on existing infrastructure is reduced and the reward of economic growth is not diluted by rapid increase in population .
The recent improvement in the micro economic indicator of Pakistan and its trickle down effects would not be shared by a larger segment of population due to the growth rate .
A high level of poverty is an indication that even the process of urbanization has not helped .
Rather it has added a new dimension to economic and social challenges .
Urban population has doubled between 1951 and 1998 .
An urgent step in the right direction would be to bring population to the centre stage of development .
Developing countries of the world , by their experience have learnt that rapid population growth is a hurdle in way of economic development .
Pakistan will be facing serious shortages in the years to come if the present rate of natural population increase persists .

However , voices from within the fashion industry have questioned the code 's chance of success .
New Zealand designer Denise L'Estrage Corbet said that the fashion industry needed thin models .
" We know our clothes look good on thinner people .

Hello !
Back again , it has been a while from our last review on this great book , Software Estimation .
We have already reviewed the first part of the book which discusses the critical concepts about software estimation .
Now , we are moving on to another stage .
This book now turns to a discussion of detailed estimation techniques that can be applied to specific estimation problems .
This chapter is just an introduction to lay out the ground for the upcoming chapters which will discuss specific techniques .
What I have learned ?
There are many considerations you have to take into account before choosing the right estimation technique to your specific problems .
What is being estimated ?
Do you have features , and you want to estimate schedule and effort ?
Do you have budget and development time frame , and you want to estimate how many features can be delivered ?
In this book , estimating size refers to estimating the scope of technical work of a given feature set — in units such as lines of code , function points , stories , or some other measure .
Estimating features refers to estimating how many features can be delivered within schedule and budget constraints .
These terms are not industry standards ; I ’m defining them here for the sake of clarity .
Project Size Small : <= 5 total technical staff .
Best estimation techniques is “ bottom - up ” techniques based on estimates made by individuals who will do the job .
<= 5 total technical staff .

Large : >= 25 people lasts for 6 to 12 months or more .
Best estimation techniques are in the early stages , the best estimation approaches tend to be “ top - down ” techniques based on algorithms and statistics .
In the middle stages , a combination of top - down and bottom - up techniques based on the project ’s own historical data will produce the most accurate estimates .
In the later stages of large projects , bottom - up techniques will provide the most accurate estimates .

In the later stages of large projects , bottom - up techniques will provide the most accurate estimates .
Medium : 5 to 25 people and last 3 to 12 months .
They have the advantage of being able to use virtually all the estimation techniques that large projects can use and several of the small - project techniques , too .
Software Development Style
For purposes of estimation , the two major development styles are sequential and iterative .
Industry terminology surrounding iterative , Agile , and sequential projects can be confusing .
For this book ’s purposes , the primary difference between these kinds of projects is the percentage of requirements they define early in the project compared to the percentage they define after construction is underway .
Evolutionary prototyping : Iterative .
Extreme Programming : highly iterative .
highly iterative .
Evolutionary delivery : normally practiced as iterative .

Staged delivery : S equential .

Rational Unified Process ( RUP ) : Sequential .
Sequential .
Scrum : Iterative from multi-sprint point of view .
Development Stage Early :
On sequential projects , the early stage will be the period from the beginning of the project concept until requirements have been mostly defined .
On iterative projects , early refers to the initial planning period .
On sequential projects , the early stage will be the period from the beginning of the project concept until requirements have been mostly defined .
On iterative projects , early refers to the initial planning period .
Middle :
It is the time between initial planning and early construction .
It is the time between initial planning and early construction .
Late : Refers to the time from mid-construction through release .
Accuracy Possible
The accuracy of a technique is a function partly of the technique , partly of whether the technique is being applied to a suitable estimation problem , and partly of when in the project the technique is applied .
Some estimation techniques produce high accuracy but at high cost .
Others produce lower accuracy , but at lower cost .
Normally you ’ll want to use the most accurate techniques available , but depending on the stage of the project and how much accuracy is possible at that point in the Cone of Uncertainty , a low - cost , low - accuracy approach can be appropriate .
Most of the remaining chapters in this book begin with tables that describe the applicability of techniques in the chapter .
Here ’s an example :

Gare du Champ de Mars
Last week Pascal noticed an old building that seemed abandoned near Bois Colombes train station .
According to wikipedia this building was first built at the Champ de Mars train station for the 1878 world fair .
For the 1889 world fair the Eiffel tower was build just behind it .
And in 1897 the building was moved to Bois Colombes and used as a train station there from 1924 to 1936 .
It is now abandoned .
You can see how it used to look like near the Eiffel tower on this page or in Bois Colombes on this page .
And how it looks like in May 2010 :

On March 26 , I was happy to report this :
Always nice to hear when a spec sells , but especially so when it ’s ‘ first - timer . ’
Greg emailed me last night , so I was able to congratulate him directly .
In fact , Greg was gracious enough to agree to do a GITS Q&A .
And here it is :
How did you wind your way into screenwriting ?
When you went to college at Vassar , did you take film studies and screenwriting classes ?
Longtime fascination or stumble into screenwriting after college ?
I earned a degree in film studies at Vassar , but really it was a life - long fascination .
I remember when I was a kid , I used to carry around a book with me , in which I ’d write down every movie I had ever seen .
My goal was to fill that book up .
I think I stopped at around six or seven hundred films by the time I hit junior high , but the interest was sprung really young .
I used to ride my bike to the movies , sometimes four or five times a week .
My favorite thing to do was the “ double header ” .
Buy tickets to one , sneak into the next show .
You had to plan it out in the newspaper in advance to get the timing right or you were screwed .
My parents also encouraged my love of film .
My Mom took me to “ Pulp Fiction ” when I was fourteen , and I remember my favorite movie when I was a kid was “ Die Hard ” thanks to my Dad who showed it to me on VHS when I was eight .
I also had a teacher in high school , Joe Truitt , who taught a class called Film Appreciation , where I was exposed to international films , Truffaut , Godard , Kurosawa , stuff at the time , we had no real access to .
( pre-DVD ) .
And we ’d get to watch the actual prints .
He fought tooth and nail to make sure we got to watch the original prints and not VHS .
Thank God , for him .
Naturally , this love of film turned into a desire to express my own stories .
Since I broke every camera I ever touched , and was always a decent writer , screenwriting felt like a natural step .
What resources did you use ( i.e. , books , seminars , lectures ) to help learn the craft of screenwriting ?
Which do you recommend to aspiring screenwriters ?
I never took a screenwriting class , nor attended a lecture or anything like that and barely read books .
You can learn everything you need to by buying the screenplays to your ten favorite films and studying what made them so effective on paper to begin with .
I ’d recommend that .
Find good scripts and study them while networking your ass off .
It ’s a hell of a lot cheaper than 40 K a year to learn basically the same thing .
No knock against film school , it ’s just in this day and age , we have so much information at our fingertips to begin with .
Before you wrote “ Down , ” how many full - length feature film screenplays had you completed ?
Did you only write horror - thriller stories or test out other genres ?
How did you decide to focus on the horror - thriller genre ?
Off the answer above , I was determined to teach myself how to write .
And the only way I knew to do that was to write as much shit as I possibly could .
So I completed 8 scripts in three and a half years in broad comedy , romantic comedy , horror , drama , and fantasy genres .
It ’s a great lesson if you have the time and ambition and one I feel worked for me .
Try writing in different genres .
I was surprised which ones felt more natural to me than others , thrillers being my final choice when all was said and done .
The premise for “ Down ” has been described in the trades as ‘ Buried ’ meets ‘ 1408 . ’
Both of those movies are what is referred to as “ contained thrillers ” .
Did the inspiration for “ Down ” start with you thinking you wanted to write a contained thriller , either due to your interest in that as a narrative conceit or its popularity right now with the studios ?
Did you start with the actual idea of people trapped in an elevator ?
Or was your ‘ aha ’ moment for “ Down ” something else entirely ?
I had the idea around four years ago .
I was always fascinated with elevators and how scary they are .
We never realize it , but every day we step into an enclosed box with complete strangers .
For many of us , it ’s the closest human interaction we ’ll have all day .
I always look at the other people I get into an elevator with and think , “ who is that guy ” or “ what ’s her story ? ”
There ’s this whole elevator etiquette involved as to where we stand and what we do inside the car .
It ’s really interesting .
The natural progression of a narrative started to form around that concept .
Being enclosed in a tiny space with complete strangers who may or may not have ulterior motives .
I think it ’s worth noting that contained thrillers seem to be hot right now .
It never hurts to have your finger on the pulse of what the desired genres are but the real skill is trying to anticipate it in advance .
Write the next big genre before it becomes popular and then you ’re really ahead of the pack .
“ Down ” is a terrific read and I do n’t want to give away any of the key plot elements , but I ’m curious how you approached a challenge unique to a contained thriller :
How to build and sustain tension when your main characters are confined much of the time to a small space .
How much of your focus in writing “ Down ” had to do with layering in each different narrative element to keep building the suspense and how did you go about doing that ?
Thanks !
I appreciate that .
Tension can be a tricky thing .
For me , I love Hitchcock , so I cribbed a lot of technique from him as I think most modern thriller writers do .
He ’s the master of slow - burn and misdirection .
And that ’s really what it ’s all about .
Slow reveals and careful manipulation of your narrative to keep the reader guessing and off - guard .
I think too often , and where many thrillers falter , is the writer rushes to get to their “ a - ha ” moments .
Slow things down .
One might think it would cause the narrative to also slow , but that it easily fixed in how interesting your characters are and how quickly you get me as a reader to follow them along on their journey .
You know going into the script or the film that things are n’t going to work out as happily as these characters planned when they woke up that morning .
You know that .
And I know your know that .
It ’s my job to always be ahead of you .
It ’s about thinking like a magician .
Always keeping in mind that the fun for your reader is n’t WHEN the rabbit disappears .
The fun for them is trying to figure out HOW .
A “ contained ” thriller poses challenges sure .
But also adds some wonderful perks to your narrative .
Using an enclosed space to your advantage can really up the tension .
I had a couple claustrophobics who told me they had to put the script down and walk away .
That ’s when you know you got something good .
Did you plot out the entire story before you typed FADE IN or did you jump in and feel your way through the page - writing process ?
And in general , how would you describe your approach to writing a script ?
First thing for me is to always figure out the big moments in the story .
That includes the opening , the break into act two , the midpoint , the break into three , and the ending .
I make sure I have those structural pieces in place .
Then I hammer down the characters and work my way into the story .
I do n’t outline every scene usually as it always ends up changing anyway .
For me , it ’s more about getting the big pieces of the puzzle down , then letting the story and characters show me where the rest of the smaller pieces fit .
Do you work with a specific screenplay structure in mind — three acts , eight sequences , or some other paradigm ?
And if so , did you find that knowledge helpful in guiding you when you wrote “ Down ” ?
I feel like Syd Field might kill me for this answer .
Like I mentioned above , it ’s about the big story moments .
The rest is about rhythm .
It ’s hard to describe but I think the story will tell you where you need certain beats .
It sounds odd , but it ’s true .
Give your story enough room to live and breathe without outlining the hell out of it , and it will show you the way .
That sounds kind of creepy , I guess .
How many drafts do you think you wrote all told before the final draft was ready to go out to buyers ?
Two .
To be honest , I was waiting for another assignment to begin and had around a month of down time .
When I ’m not writing , I go out of my head , so I told my manager I was going to revisit an old idea as an experiment while I waited .
Four weeks after I typed the first word , it went out .
Three weeks after that , it sold .
Crazy .
Trust me .
I know .
Your manager is Dan Halsted with Manage - Ment .
How did you find him / he find you ?
And I say the following with the complete knowledge of how lucky I was to get a manager like Dan , with the experience and clout he has , and me having had exactly zero scripts ever set up .
Shortly after I moved to LA , I wrote a family adventure film with another writer who used to intern for Dan .
Dan was the first person in the industry I ever sent a script to .
The next morning , he signed me .
Once again .
Crazy .
I know .
But I guess he saw something and took a chance on me , and I ’m extremely thankful .
Okay , now the fun part .
Could you give us a brief rundown of how the sale of “ Down ” to Relativity Media happened ?
Well , when your spec goes wide , it ’s always an incredibly unnerving experience .
If a writer tells you differently , I ’d have to call him jaded .
It ’s exciting and miserable at the same time .
I actually lost five pounds during the process .
Without going into all the crazy details , I can tell you I could n’t be happier with Relativity .
They ’re a driving force in this industry and I deeply respect what they do .
They saw what I saw .
That this would make a great piece of entertainment and I can’t wait to see what happens next .
So here you are , an outsider to the movie business having sold your first spec script .
How does it feel to be a “ tyro / freshman scribe ” ?
Have you been meeting with many producers and studio execs ?
And what is that experience like ?
I liken it to a book tour , and I hope all your readers get to experience it .
Because once the stress is over , this is the real fun part .
Getting to meet all these smart , fantastic producers and production companies , all of which have really cool ideas that for once , they ’d like YOU to work on .
It ’s a little overwhelming at first , but I ’d be lying if I said it was n’t exhilarating .
For me , I ’m hammering down who my agents will be , which is almost done .
Then , we ’ll decide what the next best step is .
And the rewriting on “ Down ” has already begun so it ’s time to get back to work .
Finally this :
With “ Down , ” you have joined a fairly exclusive group — people who have sold a spec script .
What advice do you have for GITS readers as they attempt to emulate your success ?
First off , it ’s possible , so do n’t give up .
I ’m not trying to be a motivational speaker , but it ’s really easy to give into that voice in the back of your head that tells you you ’re never going to succeed .
Just shut him or her the hell up as best you can and believe that no matter how many people may reject you or tell you you ’re not good enough , all that matters is what you think of yourself .
Second , align yourself with like - minded , smart , and ambitious people and try to get to know everyone you can .
It ’s certainly a business of “ who do you know , ” and since we spend most of our times in tiny rooms , that process can be daunting .
For me , my wife graduated from the Peter Stark program at USC and now works at Disney .
So I made sure I got to know all the young producers in her program .
It just turns out that one of them used to intern for Dan .
It goes to show , you never know .
Third , keep up with the business .
Follow the trades .
We ’re lucky to have sites like GITS that bust their ass to provide us with all this useful information .
For Free !
Learn the names of writers , production companies , agents , managers .
Build a dialect and database in your head .
This is your trade and I ’d advise to learn it inside and out .
Finally , read .
Everything and anything you can get your hands on .
Keep reading .
It should be the second most important thing you do .
I do n’t have to remind you what the first thing is .
Americans were greatly displeased with the Bush administration 's response to Hurricane Katrina -- but they like the Obama administration 's handling of the BP crisis even less , a new survey suggests .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Poll : Oil response worse than Katrina
More than two - thirds of Americans rate the federal government ’s response to the oil spill off the Gulf Coast negatively — topping the number of those who said the same about Hurricane Katrina soon after it hit the region nearly five years ago , according to a new ABC News / Washington Post poll .
Sixty - nine percent of the 1,004 adults polled nationwide held a negative view of the federal government ’s response to the massive spill ; only 28 percent gave the government a positive rating .

Two weeks after Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in August 2005 , the same survey showed 62 percent of Americans held a negative view of the government ’s response .
Democrats and Republicans were split in their views of the two disasters .
Asked about the oil spill , 56 percent of Democrats gave the government a negative rating , while 81 percent of Republicans did .
Two weeks after Katrina , 79 percent of Democrats were displeased with the government ’s reaction , compared with 41 percent of Republicans .
While the federal government ’s response gets low marks in the poll , more Americans were dissatisfied with BP ’s attempts to cap the runaway well .
Eighty - one percent gave the giant energy company ’s response a negative rating , compared with 16 percent who had a positive view .
Asked whether criminal charges against BP should be pursued , 64 percent said yes and 28 percent said no .
That a majority lean toward criminal charges against BP is likely linked to the 73 percent of respondents who believe “ unnecessary risks taken by BP and its drilling partners ” were the spill ’s cause .
Asked to characterize the spill , 73 percent said it was a “ major disaster , ” while 25 percent framed it as a “ serious problem . ”
The telephone survey was conducted June 3 - 6 , with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points .

The Pandora is a handheld gaming console that went on " sale " in 2007 .
It 's only now arriving in the hands of customers , eager to get their hands on something that looks like a DS , but is actually so much more .

Long written off as vapourware , the Pandora is an open source handheld .
What this means is that it 's not locked in any way , like a DS or a PSP is .
Instead , running on a form of Linux , you can install pretty much anything that the Pandora 's hardware can run , with ports currently underway on everything from Homeworld to Quake to Lemmings .
Being open source , it's also a perfect platform for emulation , with the Pandora capable of running games originally intended for the NES , SNES , Neo Geo , N64 , Dreamcast , PlayStation , Amiga , Game Boy Advance and more .

As you 'll see in the above vid , it 's got a touch screen , d- pad , dual analogue sticks ( take note , Sony ! ) and even a full keyboard .
You 'll also see that , courtesy of its onboard storage and reliance on emulation , it 's soon to be very unpopular with companies like Nintendo .

Advertisement UK ministers have put on a united front after Defence Secretary Liam Fox suggested the focus in Afghanistan should move away from reconstruction .
He had said troops were there for UK security not for " the education policy in a broken 13th - century country " .
But after talks with Afghan leaders in Kabul he and International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell both stressed their commitment to redevelopment .
Foreign Secretary William
Hague refused to set a date for UK troop withdrawal .
Before the talks , which took place on an unprecedented trip to Afghanistan by the three Cabinet ministers , Dr Fox argued in the Times newspaper that British troops were not in the country to fix Afghan society .
' Strong words '
" We have to reset expectations and timelines , " he said .
" National security is the focus now .
We are not a global policeman .
We are not in Afghanistan for the sake of the education policy in a broken 13th - century country .
We are there so the people of Britain and our global interests are not threatened . "
The BBC's Mark Dummett in Kabul said these were " strong words " from Dr Fox that signalled the new administration was considering a different approach to the war from its Labour predecessors .
But in a separate interview , Mr Mitchell said creating a stable society in Afghanistan was " absolutely crucial " .
Liam
Fox does demonstrate that you can't get a cigarette paper between his views and mine on the importance of joining together better and more effectively defence , diplomacy and development
Andrew Mitchell
Send us your comments
" We need to ensure that we help the Afghan people to build a functioning state , " he said .
" That 's about providing basic education and healthcare facilities but it's also about ensuring there are opportunities for promoting livelihoods so that people have jobs . "
Dr Fox and Mr Mitchell later put on a united front when they appeared at a press conference at the British Embassy after the talks .
Dr Fox said Mr Karzai himself had used the phrase " a country that looked like a 13th or 14th century state " to refer to the Afghanistan left behind by the Taliban .
He added : " Of course , what I was pointing out , and I welcome the opportunity to amplify it , is that the primary reason for sending our armed forces to Afghanistan was one of national security .
" But clearly if we are to make the long term gains that will provide the stability to maintain the momentum when our armed forces eventually hand over to the forces of the Afghans , we will require a long period of development in concert with the international authorities , the NGOs and our and other countries ' aid programmes . "
' No end date ' Mr Mitchell added : " Liam Fox does demonstrate that you can't get a cigarette paper between his views and mine on the importance of joining together better and more effectively defence , diplomacy and development . "
Mr Hague refused to set any time frame for Britain 's military involvement in Afghanistan .
He told reporters : " Our commitment to success in Afghanistan is one of the things that will help to bring about success .
" And therefore setting end dates for any part of our activity does n't help actually bring it to a successful conclusion . "
Earlier , Col Richard Kemp , former commander of British troops in Afghanistan , told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there seemed to be a " change of approach " from the government but that ministers needed to " get their act together on the message " .
Fighting the insurgents that threatened the security of Britain and creating a functioning Afghan state and were both valid objectives , he said .
William Hague and Hamid Karzai took part in discussions " The priority , as Liam Fox says , is to deal with the security situation in Afghanistan and to ensure the streets of the UK and the rest of the world are safer than they are at present .
" But in order for them to do that , we must rebuild and repair the society in Afghanistan - and that does include things like education policy , the economy , governance etc . "
Mr Hague earlier said the three ministers were travelling together to ensure they had " a properly coherent British approach to Afghanistan " .
The three Conservative ministers met senior Afghan politicians , including President Hamid Karzai , and General McChrystal .
The talks came after a Sea King helicopter carrying British troops was hit by enemy fire while landing in Helmand province in the south of Afghanistan .
An Army spokesman said the aircraft was arriving at a checkpoint in the Nad-e Ali on Friday when it was hit .
The Ministry of Defence has also announced that about 8,000 British troops based in Helmand province are to come under the operational command of the US .
The move is part of a restructuring of Nato forces , with command and control in southern Afghanistan split into two .

Who wants to have MILLIONS of dollars coming in EACH MONTH without having to do ANYTHING ?
Raise your hand !
Who wants to retire at 32 and watch the money pile up while enjoying a 6 month vacation ?
Raise Your Hand !
All you need to do is pay $ 499 and make just 20 sales , and find 3 other people to do the same and help them find 3 other people to do the same , and anyway who cares about the specifics , it ’s not so hard and you can make more money than you can DREAM about !
Now who ’s feeling that ?
RAISE YOUR HAND !
That ’s right , can I get a hell yeah ?
Guys , we ’re talking about MILLIONS of dollars .
Louder .
I said can I get a HELL YEAH !!
The nicest thing I can do for friends that try to recruit me into a Multi Level Marketing business is to destroy their motivation and tell them to get the fuck out .
I know the drill so well at this point .
Friend goes to meeting .
Friend is asked to think of a real mover and a shaker , who can help grow his / her network .
Friend thinks …
Judd !
Friend calls me about a vague opportunity , or a business meeting , or a social mixer .
I ask , “ this does n’t have anything to do with Multi Level Marketing , does it ? ”
Friend gets defensive , tells me just to come anyway , it will all be explained .
Sigh .
Massive respect is lost .
Multi Level Marketing ( MLM ) , it ’s a unique way to market products by recruiting sales people who earn commission on the sales of their recruited salespeople , and on the sales of their salespeople ’s recruited salespeople , and so on endlessly .
That approach has never worked well to generate significant sales .
So how are MLM companies making money ?
Independent analysis of over 350 of the most prominent MLMs leads to the conclusion that virtually all MLMs … are recruitment driven product - based pyramid schemes with a 99 % loss rate .
www.mlm-thetruth.com/MLMsSmokingGuns
Let ’s get one thing straight ;
MLMs do n’t make their money from selling products to the public , that is only incidental , to make things appear legitimate , learn from them in depth about this scheme .
They make their money by selling large signup fees to YOUR FRIENDS .
Your friends are their target .
Your job is n’t really to sell anything , it ’s to recruit your friends , trick them if you have to , and let the speakers at the meetings lie about what your friends should expect .
Then they encourage you to use the bond of your friendship to get your friends to write a check for a few hundred dollars and sign up as a salesperson .
Soon your friends realize , selling product does n’t pay the bills , in order for your friends to make their money back , they need to recruit their friends to sign up .
Rinse and repeat and the MLM collects the signup fees .
( The only thing that separates MLM from illegal Pyramid and Ponzi schemes and makes it legal is its weak association with selling a real product . )
Anyone who has ever earned any money in MLM has worked VERY hard for it .
NO ONE , not one person in the world has ever experienced the smooth sailing experience pitched every week to the millions of recruits at the recruitment meetings .
The speakers are inspiring .
They energetically tell you just how easy it is to make so much money .
It ’s an abject lie .
Everyone who has actually received cash doing MLM knows this .
Proven by the fact that they ’re busy desperately trying to recruit you for your signup fee , instead of enjoying their yacht .
But I would guess that most of them do n’t realize they ’re lying to you ..
That ’s because they ’re lying to themselves .
This is not an accident .
People stereotype MLM groups as cult like .
Well , it really does feel like that .
Notice how everyone is so cheerful and full of enthusiasm .
Wow , everyone here is just so positive !
The opening paragraph to this article is accurate , not exaggerated , that ’s how they talk at the recruitment meetings .
If you ’re going to sell delusions , you ’ll need to compensate with enthusiasm to keep everyone delusional .
( Commercials For Herbalife that do n’t mention Herbalife .
Notice that the websites for these great career opportunities are now down . )
You are being sold bullshit .
And your job is to sell bullshit to your friends , and then to help your friends sell bullshit to their friends .
The only way not to feel bad about it is for everyone to cheer and constantly be full of enthusiasm .
Critical observations , explicitly not allowed .
Motivation and enthusiasm are just too important to be jeopardized by logic .
Unfortunately , the target market is desperate , weak , and ignorant people , who feel lucky to finally find the secret to easy wealth .
MLMs do n’t frequently pull in legitimate strong businessmen .
I know these things because I worked an MLM business when I was much younger .
DO NOT think your MLM company is different .
NO .
All MLM companies are junk .
Why ?
Because as an MLM Associate , you ’re not actually offering anything of much value .
You ’re simply offering your friends an opportunity to scam their friends .
This is n’t setting up a stable future .
Simple calculations reveal that the great residual income you were promised is almost impossible .
Not only is it always tiny , but it ’s constantly dropping , as your customer base abandons your product .
The only way to keep making money is to keep recruiting , and that is NOT residual income .
Since nearly all MLM participants lose money , it is not difficult to come up with a list of income opportunities that are likely to be a lot more profitable than MLM .
Here are some examples :
- Babysit
- Walk the neighbor ’s dog
- Mow lawns
- Deliver newspapers
- Use a metal detector to find coins in vacant lots
- Search garbage for aluminum cans to sell for recycling
- Sit on the sidewalk and beg

Even worse , the better you do the worse things become .
Animosity from your social circle grows and you find a lot of your downline is unable or unwilling to bring in their friends , and thus they lose their signup fees .
Those who eventually do reach that great high level status that is supposed to guarantee amazing riches , they find that if they do n’t keep recruiting , they have no significant money coming in .
When they finally reach that high level they fought so hard for , instead of enjoying perpetual vacations and non stop cash , most give it all up and leave .
It ’s easy to find something better with their skills .
In the business world there is no stable shortcut to offering legitimate value .
The magic pill is n’t real .
If you find yourself tricked into going to an MLM recruitment meeting , remember to keep your eyes open , and that MLM is seriously fucking hard work , it ’s not “ working smarter ” .
If you are actually able to make decent money with it , you are certainly able to make a lot more elsewhere .
And remember , if this really is as easy as they say it should be , why is your recruiter trying so desperately hard to get you in ?
Do you really want to be doing this with your friends ?
UPDATE : Ok , I ’ve gotten heat from Multi Level Marketers that say they did in fact make some money from MLM .
Good job guys !
Here , I ’ve got an idea for you to make even MORE MONEY !!!
Send me $ 495 , and for everyone else that you get to send me $ 495 , I ’m going to send you a check for $ 132 .
That ’s even better than what ACN is paying you at about $ 90 / recruit .
I know , seriously , this opportunity is so exciting !
The world is ours !
Dude , we ’re going to make so much money together !!!

April 1st is traditionally a day for pranks and jokes , but the Russian - led torrent site Vertor has picked this day to inform the RIAA , MPAA and various other anti-piracy outfits that their bullying tactics are not appreciated .
The Vertor team has shipped condom packs with a special message to the offices of six leading anti-piracy groups .
The pressure mounting on BitTorrent sites worldwide has increased dramatically over the last year .
This worsening climate can be largely attributed to a handful of entertainment lobby groups that try to shutter these sites through legal actions and political influence .
One torrent site that has been floating under the radar , relatively speaking , is now pushing back at these outfits with a rather unusual action .
The Russian - based team of operators behind Vertor.com has sent special packages to six of the leading anti-piracy groups through which they hope to send a clear message .
The packages , containing the local brand of Vizit Overture aroma flavored condoms , are accompanied with a note that does n’t allow for much speculation .
“ We wish your parents had used it , ” the message reads , venting the frustration of the Vertor team and many of the site ’s users .
The Note
The people behind Vertor informed TorrentFreak that their action is a joke , but one with a clear message .
“ I ’m sure that every one of us would want to say something like this to these bloodsuckers , but not everyone has the opportunity to be heard , ” an anonymous source from the Vertor team said .
The condom shipments were sent out yesterday are expected to arrive within a day at the anti-piracy offices .
They are believed to be free of anthrax and other kinds of hazardous materials .
From Russia with love …
The UPS tracking numbers for the packages and scans of the shipping documents have also been posted on the Vertor blog .
Over the weekend I was lucky enough to travel to Washington , D.C. , and visit Capitol Hill , speaking to legislators about the Responsible Education About Life Act , Title V and the Global Sexual and Reproductive Health Act .
While doing this , a few of us took the opportunity to speak to our legislators and Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s office about the Employment Non-Discrimination
Act and repealing “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell , ” as well .
We kicked of our visits with Republican Sen. George Voinovich , from Ohio .
Congress is in recess and most of his staff was out of the office , so we were not able to speak with anyone , but we did ask the receptionist to tell Voinovich to support ENDA and the repeal of “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell . ”
We had an appointment with an aide for Sen. Sherrod Brown , a Democrat from Ohio .
I was impressed from the get - go with Sen .
Brown ’s office :
All of his business cards are printed in braille and his office is that of President Barack Obama ’s office when he was a senator .
The visit with Brown ’s office was mostly a thank - you visit .
He is already a co-sponsor of the REAL Act and he supports ENDA , the repeal of “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell , ” comprehensive sex education and reproductive freedom .
Next up was Rep. Jean Schmidt ‘s office , of whom I am a constituent .
The staunch Republican represents Ohio ’s Second Congressional District , spanning from the east side of Cincinnati to Portsmouth .
I had no visit scheduled , but one of Schmidt ’s aides agreed to meet with me .
We sat in Schmidt ’s office and briefly discussed the REAL Act from an economic standpoint — spend money on medically accurate reproductive health education so we do n’t spend it on the myriad of social services provided to many people with HIV / AIDS and / or unintended pregnancies .
I also took an economic standpoint on ENDA and “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” :
By discriminating against potential employees in the hiring process or dismissing members of the armed forces because of their identities , potentially valuable individuals are taken out of the talent pool .
Also , employees that are not out at work are less productive .
Her aide argued with me on every issue .
Schmidt currently stands behind the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy , because high - ranking military officials support the ban .
Her aide also indicated testimony , studies and reviews of the policy are still pending , and Schmidt is waiting for recommendations to come out of them .
I asked Schmidt ’s aide if pending studies and reviews indicated “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell , ” should be repealed , would she support a repeal .
He again emphasized waiting on a decision until the studies and reviews are released .
The visit with Schmidt ’s office was quite upsetting .
I have previously visited members of Congress who did not have the same standpoint as me on an issue , and I have always been treated with the utmost respect , listened to and assured my comments would be passed on to the member of Congress .
This is not the case with my interactions with Schmidt ’s staff .
Schmidt may never agree with me , but as the person representing me on the federal level , I would at least appreciate her staff to be open to hearing from me .
It is not her staff ’s job to argue with everything I say when I interact with them ; it is their job to explain Schmidt ’s position on the issue , listen to what I have to say and pass on my comments .
It would be unrealistic to expect my representative to agree with me on every issue , but her office should at least take constituents ’ view into account .
We then moved on to a meeting with Rep. Steve Driehaus ‘s office , a Democrat representing Ohio ’s First Congressional District of metropolitan Cincinnati .
This interaction was mostly to a thank - you visit as well .
Driehaus supports ENDA and the repeal of “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” ( He is a cosponsor of the Military Readiness Act , which would repeal “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” . ) , but he is pro-life .
However , his aide explained , he understands comprehensive sex education is an issue separate from abortion and supports comprehensive sex education as a way to decrease unplanned pregnancies , and in turn , abortions .
Finally , we stopped by Speaker Nancy Pelosi ‘s office to urge her to bring ENDA to a vote .
After the March 18 ENDA sit-ins , we thought it would only be fitting to let Pelosi know we would also like some movement on ENDA .
A staff member promised to pass on our comments .
While we were in Washington , we stayed at a hotel across the street from the Human Rights Campaign , so on the way back to the airport we popped in .
I wanted to speak with someone regarding the way the organization handled the Lt. Dan Choi debacle , but no one was available .
The receptionist took down my comments electronically and e-mailed them out to someone in charge of member relations .
Now that I am back in Cincinnati , I plan on making follow - up visits with Schmidt ’s and Voinovich ’s offices .
Congress is currently in recess , so the legislators are back here in Ohio , and the latest news on ENDA indicates it could come to a vote in the next few weeks .
And while my faith in the government and politicians to do much of anything productive has certainly reached all - time lows , I still live in a land governed by these people — I am going to make sure they hear my voice .

One raw day in early February , Vicki Valentine stood by helplessly as real estate investors snatched her West Baltimore home over what began with an unpaid city water bill of $ 362 .
As snow threatened to fall , she watched a work crew hired by the new owners punch out the lock on her front door .
A sheriff ’s deputy was on the scene while Valentine and her teenage son piled whatever they could into a borrowed car .
Running out of time , Valentine scrambled to pack up clothing and mementos .
The home had been her family ’s for nearly three decades , and her father had paid off the mortgage in 1984 .
“ It ’s hard to say goodbye to this house , ” she said .
“ It ’s like someone forcing you out of something that belongs to you .
I do n’t get it . ”
Valentine lost the two - story brick row home after the city sold her debt to investors through a contentious and byzantine legal process called a “ tax sale . ”
This little - known type of foreclosure can enrich investors as growing numbers of property owners struggle to pay their bills .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
These foreclosed homeowners are not the families making headlines for taking on mortgages they could ill afford .
Families ensnared in the tax sale sometimes are unable to overcome relatively small debts owed to local tax collectors .
Rather than collect the overdue money they are owed , many local governments are selling tax liens .
Buyers range from behemoths such as JPMorgan Chase & Co , and some regional banks and law firms , to small - fry investors lured by late - night television commercials promising quick riches .
Investors generally bid in an auction for the right to collect delinquent taxes and other municipal debts on property owners , sometimes by paying only a few hundred dollars .
When owners can’t pay , investors can pick up property at bargain prices .
It can be a good deal for everyone except the property owner .
Selling the debts to investors can help governments efficiently ease budget woes without having the added expenses of debt collection , foreclosing and being a landlord .
Investors , meanwhile , can rake in hefty profits .
That ’s because they can tack on fees and steep interest rates , which can amount to 18 percent annually in Baltimore .
In Valentine ’s case , legal fees and other charges climbed past $ 3,600 – nearly 10 times her original bill .
Investors purchased an estimated $ 30 billion of real estate tax debt held by governments across the country in 2009 , double the amount a year earlier , according to the Florida - based National Tax Lien Association .
Altogether , 29 states and the District of Columbia can sell tax lien debt to investors .
Lien sales in Baltimore have nearly doubled since the housing bubble of 2006 .
On Monday , the city sold 12,689 liens – a probable record .
Properties ranged from boarded - up shells and vacant lots to row homes in gentrified neighborhoods and some commercial buildings .

The US District Court of California denied adult entertainment company Perfect 10's request for an injunction against file - sharing service RapidShare on Thursday , saying that the company did not offer sufficient proof that RapidShare itself had infringed on Perfect 10's copyrights .
Perfect 10 filed its lawsuit against RapidShare in late 2009 , alleging that the Germany - based service illegally hosted the company 's images for its members to distribute and download .
Since P10 is a for - pay service , it argued that RapidShare was violating its distribution rights and making money off of its stolen content due to RapidShare 's affiliate program that pays members for referring new users .
Perfect 10 also argued that RapidShare had induced users to download its adult content because , after all , RapidShare is good for nothing but copyright infringement .
Basically , the mere existence of RapidShare as a file sharing service was equivalent to inducement in P10's eyes .
In her ruling this week , District Judge Marilyn L. Huff said that P10 failed to make a sufficient case of direct infringement against RapidShare , though she did concede that the service had specific knowledge of infringement by its users thanks to the copyright notices sent .
She also said that P10 did n't show enough evidence to convince the court of inducement , and that P10 could n't even show that it would suffer irreparable harm if she did n't order an injunction ( the fact that Perfect 10 waited four years from the time it first discovered its content on RapidShare to file a lawsuit did n't help its case ) .
As such , she said the public interest would not be served by an injunction and she therefore denied P10's request .
RapidShare founder Christian Schmid was understandably happy with the decision .
" The view that RapidShare does not promote any infringements of copyright , unlike other file - hosts , appears to be gradually catching on , " Schmid said in a statement .
" It is a milestone for us that this is also happening in the US .
We are happy that the court in California has not bought into the odd line of argument put forward by Perfect 10 and we look forward to increasingly emphasise the major difference between RapidShare and illegal share - hosts . "
It should be noted that RapidShare 's success in this case was in no small part due to P10's inability to successfully follow up on most of its claims .
The porn company has a long and somewhat pitiful history of unsuccessfully suing major companies for what it considers copyright infringement .
P10 has shown that it will go after anyone associated with a company that might have touched one of its images , including credit card processors ( a case the Supreme Court refused to hear ) .
It seems that P10 is a " shoot first , ask questions later " kind of company , and RapidShare should just count itself lucky that it was P10 behind this lawsuit and not a more competent body like the RIAA .
RapidShare has been on a roll lately with court decisions .
Earlier this month , a German court ruled that RapidShare was n't liable for distribution since it does n't make files publicly available , and therefore would not have to filter user uploads .
P10 will undoubtedly continue to push ahead with its legal attack , however , and a trial is the next logical step after a failed injunction request .
For an increasing number of parents , the notion of raising bilingual children is an appealing one .
But how is it done ?
Children begin learning a language — any language , be it their first or second — simply by having it spoken to them .
Of course , there ’s a bit more to it than that .
Though it may seem daunting at first , parents hoping to teach their children a second language should n’t be intimidated : Raising bilingual children is actually easier than one might think .
Read on for five steps to success if you ’re raising bilingual children .
1 ) Decide Who Will Speak What Language
For parents interested in raising bilingual children , it ’s important to find a balance when deciding how much exposure the child should have to two different languages .
If one parent speaks Spanish , for example , and the other is a native English - speaker , it may be best to have one parent always speak Spanish to the child and the other always speak English .
This ensures that the child is exposed to both languages equally .
2) Include the Language in Daily Life
The key to raising bilingual children is to incorporate the second language into everyday life .
By exposing your child to a second language every day , you will ensure that they learn much more than they would in a language class that meets only twice a week for a couple of hours .
From speaking the language in front of your child to reading aloud in the second language , incorporating a second language into everyday routines can be a simple task .
3 ) Set Aside the Time
Ideally , a second language will naturally become part of the daily household routine for parents raising bilingual children .
To ensure that both languages are being spoken on a regular basis , it may be necessary for parents raising bilingual children to set aside specific chunks of “ language time . ”
This does n’t have to be as regimented as it might sound — it does n’t mean scheduling a daily grammar lesson with your child .
Simply designating times when the language should be spoken , such as during dinner , can be a big help .
4 ) Network with Other Parents
Building a network of parents raising bilingual children is a great way to share tips and tricks — and compare difficulties — when it comes to raising bilingual children .
Such a network can also be a great way to find bilingual playmates for children to play and practice speaking with .
5 ) Work to Keep Kids Motivated
After a child reaches a certain age , he might lose interest in learning a language or prefer to speak the one language he is more comfortable with , such as the language spoken at school .
To deal with reluctant learners , parents should get their children involved in fun activities where they must speak the second language from an early age .
Activities could include clubs or sports teams where the other children involved are native or bilingual speakers , too .
Raising bilingual children and keeping them interested in learning a second language may be difficult , but it ’s well worth the effort .
Who knows , when your child grows up he or she may decide to be a professional translator or pursue another language - related career .
So remain patient , encourage your child to use both languages and provide rewards for continued practice .
Your kids will thank you for it later .
The campaign to rid our nation 's prisons of cell phones went to the next level on Wednesday , with a call from the Department of Commerce for intel on devices that can get the situation under control .
The government is " seeking comment on technical approaches " to the problem , Commerce says .
" The illicit use of cell phones by prisoners is a danger to public safety and must be addressed , " declared the DoC's National Telecommunications and Information Administration boss Lawrence Strickling upon release of a Notice of Inquiry .
" At the same time , we need to make sure that any technical solutions do not interfere with 911 calls , government or other legitimate cell phone use . "
Congress is all over the place on this issue .
The Senate has passed the Safe Prisons Communications Act , which would allow prisons to jam cell phones .
The Federal Communications Commission forbids this practice at present , and the wireless industry wants to keep it that way .
There 's also the Cell Phone Contraband Act , which would make illegal possession of a mobile wireless device by the resident of a Federal prison .
The Senate has passed this proposed law , too , but neither bill has made it through the House of Representatives .
What has gotten to home plate is a some language added to the massive 2010 Appropriations bill tasking the NTIA , Federal Communications Commission , Bureau of Prisons , and National Institute of Justice " to develop a plan to investigate and evaluate how wireless jamming , detection , and other technologies might be utilized for law enforcement and corrections applications in Federal and State prison facilities . "
That 's what the NTIA is following through on now , since it's the agency that will coordinate the final report .
The three technological methods that the NOI identifies as possible are jamming , managed access , and detection .
Managed access involves " capturing " then rerouting unauthorized cell phone calls .
Its virtue is that it allows some authorized use .
But : " It is unclear whether or how well these systems can discriminate among prison authorized cell phone numbers and ' unknown ' phones to avoid capturing / canceling calls that do not involve inmates , " the NOI notes .
Detection , as the word suggests , involves identifying cell phone calls as they come into the facility , and then , presumably , doing something punitive about them .
We asked CTIA - The Wireless Association , which methods it favors .
The trade association will focus on explaining why the government " should support non-interfering technologies such as cell detection and managed access to solve the problem of contraband phones in correctional institutions , " CTIA 's Steve Largent told us .
On top of this debate , expect a wide variety of gadget and gizmo vendors to chime in on this probe , urging the government to smile on their particular product — in the interest of public safety , of course .

Why do free social networks tilt inevitably toward user exploitation ?
Because you 're not their customer , you 're their product .

Law enforcement officials offered a more detailed description of the makeup of the failed car bomb found in Times Square on Saturday night , and said they were reviewing surveillance footage that showed a white man who appeared to be in his 40s walking away from the area as he looked over his shoulder and removed a layer of clothing .
Raymond W. Kelly , the New York City police commissioner , said on Sunday that the materials found in the Nissan Pathfinder — gasoline , propane , firecrackers and simple alarm clocks — also included eight bags of a granular substance , later determined to be nonexplosive grade of fertilizer , inside a 55 - inch - tall metal gun locker .
The bomb , Mr. Kelly said , “ would have caused casualties , a significant fireball . ”
Had it exploded , said Paul J. Browne , the Police Department ’s chief spokesman , “ It would have been , in all likelihood , a good possibility of people being killed , windows shattered , but not resulting in a building collapse . ”
While the authorities said they were treating the failed bombing — described as a “ one - off ” by Janet Napolitano , the homeland security secretary — as a potential terrorist attack , they said there was no evidence of a continued threat to the city .
Diane Campbell scrimped and saved from her fixed income for an iPad , but was turned away at a Silicon Valley Apple Store because you need a credit card to buy one .
Apple would n't budge , even when local ABC affiliate appealed .
Apple wants to keep Americans from re-selling the iPad overseas , where the tablet device is not available for a couple more weeks , a clerk told Campbell , who is disabled .
Credit cards offer
Apple the easiest way to positively identify people and enforce a limit of two iPads per customer .
So , even with a low - income advocacy group on her side , Campbell can get an iPad only by purchasing one second - hand from a credit card holder .
Which is precisely the sort of re-selling Apple was trying to avoid in the first place .
Maybe the company should just start requiring DNA samples .

Image caption Recycling of cigarette ends could become financially viable
Scientists working in China say they have found a novel use for discarded cigarette butts .
They have discovered that chemicals extracted from these filters can protect steel pipes from corrosion .
The research is published in the journal Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research .
The work could make the prospect of recycling cigarette butts financially viable , experts say .
On pavements , nature trails and especially on beaches , wherever you find people on this planet you inevitably find cigarette butts .
Around 4.5 trillion of these remnants find their way into the environment every year .
Capable of surviving up to 15 years in the sea , cigarette ends contain chemicals that are toxic to many forms of fish .
Now researchers in China say they have found a novel use for these chemicals that could make the recycling of cigarette butts financially worthwhile .
The scientists found that by immersing the butts in water they were able to extract nine different chemical compounds , including nicotine .
When these extracts were applied to a type of steel widely used in the oil industry they were found to be very effective in preventing corrosion , even under harsh conditions .
The replacement of rusting steel pipes is a major ongoing cost for oil producers around the world .
China itself has no shortage of cigarette butts for scientists to experiment with - one third of the world 's cigarettes are consumed there .
Zogajs : Schulabschluss noch möglich
Die Zogajs sollen Österreich " unverzüglich " verlassen - so steht es im Schreiben , das Arigona und ihre Familie gestern von der zuständigen Behörde , der Bezirkshauptmannschaft Vöcklabruck erhalten haben .
Unverzüglich bedeutet aber doch : nicht sofort .
Morgenjournal , 23.06.2010
Schreiben der Behörde
Die Betreuer der Familie zeigen sich entsetzt - hat doch die Bezirkshauptmannschaft vergangene Woche noch von einer angemessenen Frist gesprochen , die man den Zogajs eingeräumen wird .
Nun , nur eine Woche , nachdem der Verfassungsgerichtshof festgestellt hat , dass eine Ausweisung von Arigona und ihre Familie rechtens ist , haben die Zogajs das Schreiben der Bezirkhauptmannschaft Vöcklabruck erhalten - mit der Formulierung " unverzüglich " .
" Ausreise in geordneter Weise "
Im Innenministerium spricht man von einem Formalakt .
Das sieht auch der Verfassungsexperte Bernd Christian
Funk so .
Diese Aufforderung " liegt in der Logik der Dinge " , sei der Abschluss des Verfahrens und versuche eine Zwangsvollstreckung zu vermeiden .
Der Begriff " unverzüglich " schließe nicht aus , dass die Behörde " im Sinne eines verhältnismäßigen Vorgehens " die erforderlichen
Tage noch einräumt , wie etwa den Schulabschluss Arigonas , " um die Ausreise in geordneter Weise durchführen zu können " .
Fekter beruhigt
Auch Innenministerin Maria Fekter ( ÖVP ) räumt ein , dass unverzüglich nicht bedeute , dass eine freiwillige Ausreise der Zogajs in einer angemessenen Frist nicht mehr möglich sei .
" Nein , ich gehe davon aus , dass sich die Familie entscheidet , doch selbständig die Heimreise anzutreten . "
" Unverzüglich " steht im Gesetz
Für Details zur Ausreise der Zogajs verweist Fekter einmal mehr auf die zuständige Behörde in Vöcklabruck .
Der dortige Bezirkshauptmann Peter Salinger , der vergangene Woche von einer angemessenen Frist für die Zogajs gesprochen hat , erklärt : " Der Begriff ' unverzüglich ' ist nur ein Zitat des Gesetzes . "
Und die Familie Zogaj müsse schließlich noch Dinge regeln , wie etwa einen Flug zu buchen .
" Und um all dieses zu regeln , ist die Aufforderung der Behörde ergangen . "
Signal erwartet
Jetzt seien die Zogajs am Zug , so Saliniger .
" Die Familie ist aufgefordert uns mitzuteilen , wann sie das Land verlassen wollen .
Wir erwarten jetzt von der Familie ein Signal , ob sie ausreisen wollen und wann sie das vorhaben . "
Freiwillige Ausreise angekündigt
Die Behörde werde nur dann von sich aus aktiv , wenn sie den Eindruck bekomme , dass die Zogajs nichts tun , so der zuständige Bezirkshauptmann Peter Salinger .
Soweit wird es aber wohl nicht kommen .
Die Zogajs haben ihren Betreuern nämlich angekündigt , freiwillig auszureisen , um sich eine zwangsweise Abschiebung zu ersparen .

London , England ( CNN ) -- Did Google just turn the tables on Apple ?
Having entered the mobile software market late with its Android offering , Google 's initial efforts were a pale imitation of the iPhone OS , a clunky user experience on sub-par handsets .
Fast forward to 2010 .
Suddenly , Google Android is winning over the hearts and minds of technologists and signing up 100,000 converts a day .
That raises the question :
Is the iPhone losing its sheen ?
Android edges ahead
The changing of the guard was signaled earlier this month : Stats released by market research firm NPD showed that Android phones had outsold iPhones in the first quarter of 2010 .
Google 's operating system accounted for 28 percent of U.S. smartphone sales , versus 21 percent for the iPhone OS .
RIM retained the lead , however : BlackBerry phones captured 36 percent of the market .
What turned the tide ?
NPD attributes the change to the success of the Motorola Droid and Droid Eris .
Finally , Android is being coupled with appealing handsets , driving mainstream adoption .
Globally , the iPhone retains its lead , however : Apple commands 46 percent of the market , versus Android 's 25 percent .
Apple vs. Microsoft : Round 2
Google must surely hope the mobile race has the same ending as the original operating system wars : Microsoft versus Apple .
While Apple insisted on running its Mac OS on Apple hardware , Microsoft implemented no such restrictions and chose to license its software to hardware vendors instead .
We all know how that story ended .
Windows became ubiquitous ;
Macs were marginalized .
Android , too , seems to be headed toward ubiquity .
Google 's usurping of Apple in the mobile market had little to do with its own handset -- the much - maligned Nexus One -- and instead can be credited to the breakout success of Motorola 's offerings .
Samsung , meanwhile , has committed to running 50 percent of its handsets on the Android OS .
Google must now learn its lesson : Stay out of the hardware business and let others build spectacular Android handsets .
Developers jump ship ?
There 's another reason the iPhone is losing its edge .
Developers may be switching to Android .
The iPhone 's appeal is in large part tied to the hundreds of thousands of applications available in the App Store .
But Apple 's controlling nature has frustrated developers .
Its esoteric App Store rules mean that applications can be rejected for all manner of reasons , creating a strong disincentive to develop on the platform .
Apple has earned enemies , too , in its battle against Adobe Flash .
By essentially banning Flash from the iPhone , Apple has provided fuel to critics who say the iPhone is a " closed " platform :
You can play in Apple 's sandbox , but only if you abide by their rules .
The rules , it seems , become stricter every day .
No wonder , then , that Google 's I / O conference this week hinged around one word : " open . "
Developers audibly cheered , writes Mashable 's Jolie O'Dell , as Google execs presented their latest creation , Android Froyo .
To the delight of developers in attendance , Froyo supports Flash .
Vic Gundotra , Google 's vice president of engineering , received enthusiastic applause as he quipped : " It turns out that on the Internet , people use Flash . "
Amid the applause , there was laughter , too .
A rebellion against Apple 's encumbered system .
Apple is losing on two fronts
Apple is fighting two wars and losing both .
It 's losing in the fight for market share .
With Android shipping on a myriad of phones and Apple 's growth limited to its own devices , Google seems destined to win the numbers game .
By providing more fertile ground for developers , meanwhile , Google is winning the hearts and minds of app makers .
Google 's mastery of the mobile space appears imminent .
Apple strikes back ?
Apple , however , could still play a winning hand .
The fourth - generation iPhone is expected to launch next month at WWDC , the Apple developer conference .
While we 'll no doubt see a spike in iPhone sales and a short - term reversal in market share versus Android , I doubt the launch will prove an adequate defense against Android 's rise .
One factor may stem the tide , however .
Rumors persist that the iPhone may soon be available to Verizon customers .
If the mutterings prove true , Apple may regain those customers who abandoned its phones for a reason unrelated to the software , notoriously poor service from Apple 's exclusive partner , AT&T .
Android , then , seems equipped to win the mobile OS wars .
But hold off on the parade .
Google 's victory is far from guaranteed .
Let ’s just suppose that an organization existed that did n’t permit gays or atheists to join .
Regardless of whatever good qualities this organization might have , would it be worthy of a formal legislative commendation ?
A couple of Inland Empire politicians see nothing wrong with legitimizing this insidious form of discrimination .
Assemblyman Curt Hagman and would - be assemblyman Mike Morrell have written the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin to condemn Democrats for refusing the pass a resolution honoring the Boy Scouts of America on its 100th birthday .
I do n’t quarrel with the Boy Scouts ’ right to determine its own membership qualifications , although I think what they ’ve done is short - sighted in the least and actually downright bigoted .
( Other organizations serving young people — the Girl Scouts , Campfire , Boys and Girls Clubs , and probably a host of others — have seen the light . )
What I do n’t understand is the desire to celebrate and applaud discrimination , unless of course you approve of those views yourself .
Unfortunately , the Boy Scouts have lots of company when it comes to discrimination against atheists .
During the past six months , I have had occasion to attend four meetings of public bodies .
Three of them began with a sectarian , Christian prayer .
Since I was there representing my employer , it would have been inappropriate for me to state openly what I felt — namely , I felt unwelcome .
More recently , the City Council in Ontario has voted to add “ Under God ” to the display of the City Seal in the Council chambers .
[ Note : Council meetings are presided over by a Mayor who has openly admitted to adultery . ]
I wonder whether they also plan to hang signs on all the roadways leading into town , announcing that “ Atheists Are Not Welcome . ”
Some people claim that gays and lesbians should not be discriminated against because sexual orientation is not a choice .
Personally , I ’ve never been real happy with people who do ( or believe ) the right thing for the wrong reason .
Gays and lesbians should not be discriminated against regardless of whether it ’s a choice or not .
But this misguided line of reasoning , albeit somewhat helpful in a crooked way with regard to the sexual orientation issue , is clearly not helpful to atheists , who are making a deliberate choice .
I feel confident in predicting that , at least in the United States ( “ the land of the free … with justice for all ” ) , atheists will continue to experience discrimination for many generations — long after gays and lesbians have been received into conventional society by everyone except members of the Flat Earth Society .
Will the Boy Scouts be accepting either type of person when it celebrates its 200th birthday ?
Only time will tell .

Google has won its court case against Viacom , where it was facing a $ 1 billion claim for allowing users to upload copyrighted clips to YouTube .
The landmark case is expected to have a major impact on future cases dealing with the responsibilities of the operators of user - generated media libraries , including BitTorrent sites .
Over the past years Google has been battling in court with Viacom over the question of whether YouTube is protected against copyright infringement claims under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
Yesterday , U.S. District Court Judge Louis Stanton granted Google ’s motion for summary judgment , ruling that Google is protected by the DMCA ’s safe harbor provision .
Effectively , this means that YouTube does n’t have to remove any clips unless they are asked to do so by copyright holders .
“ If a service provider knows of specific instances of infringement , the provider must promptly remove the infringing material .
If not , the burden is on the owner to identify the infringement .
General knowledge that infringement is ‘ ubiquitous ’ does not impose a duty on the service provider to monitor or search its service for infringements , ” Judge Stanton wrote .
In a response , Google claimed the judgment to be a victory for all the people who ‘ share ’ on the Internet .
“ This is an important victory not just for us , but also for the billions of people around the world who use the web to communicate and share experiences with each other , ” the company wrote on its blog .
This judgment is obviously a huge win for YouTube and other video hosting services , but it also sets an important precedent for BitTorrent sites .
Google ’s
YouTube shows striking similarities to torrent sites as it allows users to submit content .
The only difference is that YouTube actually hosts the uploaded files , whereas torrent sites only link to content indirectly through . torrent files .
The Pirate Bay aside , nearly all torrent sites work closely together with copyright holders to ensure that their rights are respected .
Like YouTube , IsoHunt and others have strict notice and takedown policies and swiftly remove . torrent files pointing to infringing material when they are notified by copyright holders .
Despite the similarities , BitTorrent sites have n’t been very successful in court thus far .
Using the same arguments as Google did in its case against Viacom , Mininova and isoHunt have both argued in court that they were protected by a DMCA ( - like ) safe harbor , but both eventually lost their case .
The good news is that both is oHunt and Mininova have still options to appeal , and with yesterday ’s landmark victory in hand their chances of winning may have increased .
If anything , BitTorrent sites should be seen as less infringing than video hosting sites because they only link to copyright infringing content indirectly through . torrent files .
If Judge Stanton ’s decision is translated to BitTorrent sites , it means that under safe harbor protection sites like isoHunt and Mininova would operate legally and would n’t have to use filtering mechanisms to prevent users from uploading ‘ infringing ’ torrents .
Viacom , meanwhile , is n’t done with Google and Youtube just yet .
“ We believe that this ruling by the lower court is fundamentally flawed and contrary to the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , the intent of Congress , and the views of the Supreme Court , ” the company said in a statement .
If you get a chance , read Meghan O'Rourke 's tribute to her mother on Slate : it 's beautiful , and an interesting counterpoint for those people who do n't have mothers but still , like the rest of us , are unavoidably inundated with Mother 's Day .
Advertisement
In the past few weeks , we — like , I 'm sure , most of the wired world — have been inundated with Mother 's Day - related emails : cocktails and lubes and waxes and burlesque brunches ( yes , really ) as well as the more traditional flowers or less thematically - tenuous spa treatments .
Mom , TV and radio tells us , craves all - she - can - scarf shrimp and trips to the casino and and free movie tickets and shots at the lottery and jewelry made of old dominoes .
For most of us , these are a passing irritation , or at best a laugh or a fleeting reminder to make that call come Sunday or get in a brunch reservation if there 's still time .
For those who've lost a mother , as O'Rourke points out , it 's a hundred reminders a day of an absence .
Even when , like her mother , the absent mother disdained the holiday itself .
We got a moving email from a reader yesterday who was struck by how difficult he found the first Mother 's Day after his mother 's death - despite the fact that , intellectually , he dismissed it as a Hallmark holiday .
" I spent the day alone but did go for an awesome steak dinner with a picture of Mom at the table , tears streaming down my face throughout the meal , " he wrote .
Ironically , when the holiday loses its ability to generate revenue from Mom , it achieves its stated purpose of making us appreciate and celebrate her .

For those of us with the luxury of taking our mothers for granted and pushing away the inevitability of that loss , these stories are an important reminder .
Whether this equates to more steaks and flowers sold is an open question , but I 'm guessing it will result in a few phone - calls .
This same reader told us that he'd like to hear how others celebrate a motherless mother 's day .
He 'll doubtless gain comfort from O'Rourke 's meditation and the heartfelt discussion it prompted , but I hope we can do our part to help expand the phenomenon .
For all our sakes .
Unmothered , On Mother 's Day [ Slate ]
An Associated Press story reads in part : ‘ An obscure part of the law allows states to restrict abortion coverage by private plans operating in new insurance markets .
Capitalizing on that language , abortion foes have succeeded in passing bans that , in some cases , go beyond federal statutes …..
” We do n’t consider elective abortion to be health care , so we do n’t think it ’s a bad thing for fewer private insurance companies to cover it , ” said Mary Harned , attorney for Americans United for Life , a national organization that wrote a model law for the states . ’
The Health Care Freedom
Act is considered in states as either a bill or a state constitutional amendment – effectively prohibiting the enactment of any new government - run healthcare programs within the state .
At least 29 states are enacting such a law or a close facsimile of .
As well , there 20 states on board with the newly adopted ultrasound law (s ) with many more states to follow .
States are also considering legislation of ‘ personhood ’ which will give the unborn child ‘ life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ’ instead of impending death .
The Tenth Amendment provides that ‘ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ’
It ’s about time our votes count .
With all the recent brouhaha regarding the new Arizona immigration law , we see how a single state can pick up the ball and run with getting done what needs to be done , and not in ‘ DC time ’ … .
” We in Arizona have been more than patient waiting for Washington to act , ” Gov. Jan Brewer said after signing the law .
“ But decades of inaction and misguided policy have created a dangerous and unacceptable situation . ”
One voter at a time … one state at a time .
We are trying to ‘ form a more perfect union ’ , not secede from it .
However , in order to keep utter chaos from erupting from what seems to be a socialistic plan from the progressive left , we as Americans have to take a moment and study our Constitution and make a concerted effort to keep our country and our states FREE as it was intended by our founding fathers .
We can change the face of abortion ‘ one baby at a time , one mom at a time , one heart at a time ’

Peter B Kyne ; ASM Hutchinson ; Gertrude Atherton ; Edna Ferber .
The names mean anything to you ?
Me neither .
All four featured on the end of year US fiction top 10 bestseller lists in the 1920s .
These are just four random authors ; I could have chosen almost any others .
There were only three names I recognised for the whole decade : Edith Wharton , Thornton Wilder and Erich Maria von Remarque .
It 's a fair bet that literary critics were shaking their heads at the amount of dross in the bestseller lists and lamenting the state of the novel back in the 1920s .
It 's the kind of thing critics like to do .
These days we often think of the 1920s as one of the highpoints of the novel , with practitioners such as DH Lawrence , Franz Kafka , Marcel Proust , Virginia Woolf , F Scott Fitzgerald and Herman Hesse .
So you can put money on some critics saying the first decade of the new millennium was the heyday of the novel in 90 years ' time .
The really interesting question is what books and authors they will be citing in evidence .
First things first : the novel is here to stay .
Whether we 're downloading books on to a Kindle or turning pages of a book is an entirely different argument : the hunger for good storytelling has lasted for centuries and shows no signs of going away .
The issue is quality .
And I would argue the quality is still there ; it 's just not always that easy to find it .
Here 's why .
The sheer number of books published these days makes it impossible for any reader to keep track of what 's being written ; couple this with bookshops dying on their feet and their reluctance to stock anything but the most popular titles and it's a no - brainer to assume that a few very good reads never leave the publisher 's warehouse , let alone pick up a review .
Which brings us to hype .
No publisher – or writer , for that matter – can bring themselves to admit that writers are human .
They have their off years and they have their on years .
Instead , each new book comes with a blurb – frequently reinforced in the media by endless column inches – that brands it as both " the most important work yet " and a " guaranteed bestseller " .
And the reader buys it and wonders what all the fuss was about .
You can't really blame publishers .
They are in the business of selling books , not preserving the state of the novel .
And hype does sell .
Or at least it stops other books that have n't been hyped from selling .
So while the public appears to have unlimited choice , it actually has very little .
Take the last three months .
Are Martin Amis and Ian McEwan really two of the most important writers of the decade ?
You would certainly think so to judge by the hyperbole their new books have generated , yet Amis has n't written anything particularly good or different since the 1980s .
The Pregnant Widow may be better than Yellow Dog , but then it could hardly have been worse .
You can make more of a case for McEwan .
He is a good writer .
But one of the best ?
I 'm not so sure .
Creative writing courses also have n't helped .
They may be big business for universities and wonderful therapy for graduates – though I can't help feeling if you want therapy you'd be better off seeing a therapist – but they have had a negative effect on the reading public .
All they have done is to make many more mediocre writers just competent enough to get published .
I can usually sniff out a book that 's been written by a creative writing student within a few pages ; there will be no plot to speak of and each sentence will have been polished so many times it will be dead .
Some critics like to moan about the proliferation of ghosted novels by celebs crowding out the market .
Get over yourselves .
These books are what they are ; no one pretends they are literature and if serious writers want to reach a bigger audience then they should make more effort to write books people want to read .
This is n't dumbing down ; it 's a simple matter of having something to say and saying it well .
I 'm often amazed at the number of novels that substitute style for substance .
Books that seem to have no discernible plotline or arc ; books that resolve themselves in an unconvincing catharsis ; books that have been written just because the writer is able to string a few sentences together .
Here 's my creed .
A good novel should be readable .
And yes , I will risk heresy by saying Ulysses is massively over - fetishised .
Why would an author not want to be understood ?
It should also have a good storyline ; a whole load of generalised thirtysomething angst is n't enough to sustain a reader 's interest .
The dialogue should be accurate : people should talk as they do in real life .
You would n't believe the number of writers who make their characters say the most ridiculously convoluted things .
Actually , you would .
The book should be edited ; this used to be a given , but now some writers ' egos wo n't allow it .
And above all , the book should have a big idea ; something to say about the world beyond the basics of the story .
These books do exist .
It 's just a matter of knowing where to look .
Critics often get very sniffy about genre writing , but I believe that 's where many of the best novels are to be found .
One day , John Le Carré 's thrillers of the late 60s and 70s will be recognised as 20th - century classics .
But there are good writers around .
Interestingly , William Boyd got far more attention from the media when he was more obviously writing literary fiction ; his most recent book , Ordinary Thunderstorms , was largely overlooked because it read too much like a thriller but , in my opinion , it was easily one of the best books of the year .
Then there 's Stieg Larsson .
A man who wrote gripping stories against a background of political corruption and violence against women .
And sold millions .
The great novel is very much alive and well .
It 's just not always where you 're told it is .

Tea Party Rallies Remain a Cauldron for Conspiracy Theories ( FOXNews ) ... But while organizers have held the tour as a way to stay front - and - center as a political force , the rallies have also attracted the kinds of mistruths , exaggerations and conspiracy theories that make Tea Party leaders cringe .
Though the movement is still trying to shore up its credentials as a grassroots power that 's here to stay , the so - called " fringe " and its accompanying antics continue to give critics fodder .
Finally , a little fair and balanced reporting .
But where on earth would people get such half - baked conspiracy theories ?
Some suggest Obama wants to keep Americans unemployed so that they become dependent on government - run programs .
Lenin and Stalin have become catchwords to describe Obama in the speeches denouncing his policies .
Going further , swastikas , as well as pictures of Obama 's face next to Adolf Hitler 's , have appeared on signs at dozens of rallies blasting the president and the Democrat - controlled Congress .
Other Tea Party members continue to question the president 's citizenship -- a sign reading " Show Us Your Birth Certificate " popped up at a recent rally in Traverse City , Mich .
" What 's more disturbing is that he's not answering them , " Tea Party member and conservative blogger Andrea Shay King said of the questions over Obama 's birthplace .
The Hawaiian government twice confirmed during the 2008 presidential election that a copy of Obama 's birth certificate was authentic .
Factcheck.org tracked down the birth certificate and posted copies of it online .
Oh , where to begin ?
Fox hosts like O'Reilly , Beck , and Hannity have unleased the unhinged , and it is making their astroturf Tea Party movement look like whisky - jug tossing , trailer park , conspiracy theorists .
Fox is now trying to push the toothpaste they created , back into the tube .
Good luck with that .
P.S. Let the history books note that the Tea Baggers organized a campaign to disrupt and shout down legislators at Town Hall meetings throughout the Summer of 2009 .
Their antics were not just irrational and offensive , they were an attack on civil democracy and the rights of constituents to have rational discussions with their legislators .
For that , they should never be forgiven .
The State Department confirmed that nearly every offer of equipment or expertise from a foreign government since the April 20 oil rig explosion would require the U.S. to reimburse that country .
The offers reveal a hard truth about the United States ' international friendships :
With the U.S. widely regarded as the world 's wealthiest nation , there is a double standard regarding foreign aid after a crisis , especially with offers from relatively poor countries .
U.S. disaster aid is almost always free of charge ; other nations expect the U.S. to pay for help .
" These offers are not typically offers of aid , " said Lt. Erik Halvorson , a Coast Guard spokesman .
" Normally , they are offers to sell resources to BP or the U.S. government . "
Only Mexico , with wide swaths of poverty among its population , offered the U.S. anything for free .
It said it would give the U.S. government some containment boom .
BP separately purchased 13,780 feet of boom and two skimmers from Mexico in early May , according to the State Department .
The stingier countries include :
Golf went out of favour after the Cuban revolution in 1959
Cuba has announced plans to allow foreigners to develop golf courses , marinas and related land projects to boost the nation 's tourism industry .
Tourism Minister Manuel Marrero said Havana was in advanced talks with " several potential foreign partners " .
The Communist government is reportedly considering granting foreigners medium - to long - term leases of real estate , as Cuba prohibits foreign ownership .
Havana hopes the measures will attract more affluent tourists to the island .
Last year , some 2.4 million tourists visited Cuba , but many of them came for short stays and spent less money .
' Golf is key '
" A policy was approved that permits real estate development associated with tourism , fundamentally golf courses , marinas and other complementary tourist investments , " Mr Marrero said at Cuba 's annual International Tourism Fair on Tuesday .
He said the move aimed at " developing regions that today are virgin " .
The cash - strapped Caribbean island now wants to attract a more affluent , bigger - spending class of tourist and golf is seen as the key , the BBC's Michael Voss in Havana says .
Currently there is only one 18 - hole golf course in the whole of Cuba .
However , there are plans for 10 new courses , several of which are in an advanced stage of planning .
A number of European and Canadian investment firms have proposed building golf courses coupled with luxury sea front apartments and villas .
But in a country with no real estate market , where Cubans are not allowed to buy or sell their homes , the government has long been wary of allowing foreigners to own property , our correspondent says .
So under the new deal medium - to long - term leases may be allowed if linked to golf courses .

Here ’s something I want to run by you on behavioural economics and the way economic issues are being debated in the blogosphere .
We are witnessing an implosion of long - held belief structures that go the core of how we believed our economic system functioned .
You heard Alan Greenspan admit this after the financial system collapsed in his testimony in October 2008 before Congress :
“ Yes , I found a flaw , ” Greenspan said in response to grilling from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
“ That is precisely the reason I was shocked because I ’d been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well . ”
Greenspan said he was “ partially ” wrong in opposing regulation of derivatives and acknowledged that financial institutions did n’t protect shareholders and investments as well as he expected .
– Greenspan Concedes to ` Flaw ’ in His Market Ideology , Bloomberg , 23 Oct 2008
The implosion of this neo-classical laissez - faire belief system of economics is a death about which we now grieve .
Disbelief
However , the grief is getting in the way of rational conversation .
It goes to suspension of disbelief , cherished values , strongly - held beliefs and fear .
I believe these are major issues in how accepting we are of new ideas — and consequently for why this particular financial crisis is so devastating .
I have run into this problem on two specific occasions recently .
Despite my Austrian economics sympathies , I recently posted some articles inspired by Modern Monetary Theory ( MMT ) .
Now , I do n’t buy into some of what Modern Monetary
Theory says about source of money ’s value and the role of the state in monetary affairs .
But I do very much appreciate MMT ’s understanding of the mechanics of the fiat currency monetary system ( a system I do n’t fully support , by the way ) .
So I have presented some MMT - based ideas from a neutral frame in order to demonstrate their applicability to the present financial crisis .
Invariably , I run into a lot of spurious arguments by people who sound like they do n’t understand the accounting .
Or maybe they just feel threatened on some strange existential level – as if what I am writing threatens their core belief system .
I think that is a lot of what is going on .
So I am writing this post to explain how the human brain processes information .
And then I will make a few remarks about how this applies to the present day situation .
Suspension of disbelief
The core of my argument will come from James Montier , now at the fund manager GMO .
As a strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in 2005 , he wrote a timeless piece on the debate between two 17th century philosophers René Descartes of France and Baruch de Spinoza of the Netherlands .
Descartes was of the view that people process information for accuracy before filing it away in memory .
Spinoza made the opposite claim , that people must suspend disbelief in order to process information .
The two competing ideas were put to the test ; and it appears that Spinoza was right about the need for naïve belief , something that has grave implications for investing , the subject of Montier ’s essay .
Here is a long excerpt of what Montier wrote .
The article is available online via John Mauldin ( the link is at the bottom ) .
This is a fantastic look into how people process information .
Sometime ago a client asked us to compile a list of myths that the markets seemed to hold dear .
We came up with twelve potential myths ranging from stocks for the long run to dividends do n’t matter via such topics as commodities for the future and bond supply matters .
However , this exercise also made me wonder why it was that supposedly smart people ended up believing such strange things .
This pondering sent me ( as is usually the case ) to the annals of psychology .
To some extent these errant beliefs seem to stem from bounded awareness / inattentional blindness and framing .
We have explored such elements before .
However , there may well be another factor at work .
We seem to be hard wired to ‘ believe ’ .
Daniel Gilbert , a professor of psychology at Harvard , has explored how we go about believing and understanding information .
In a series of truly insightful papers Gilbert and co-authors have explored the belief process using two alternative philosophical viewpoints .
Cartesian systems
The first view is associated with the work of Rene Descartes .
When it came to belief , Descartes suggested the mind performs two separate mental acts .
First it understands the idea .
Secondly , the mind assesses the validity of the idea that has been presented .
This two stage process seems intuitively correct .
After all , we can all imagine being presented with some novel idea , holding it in our minds and then pondering the truth or otherwise associated with the idea .
The Cartesian approach fits well with folk psychology .
Descartes was educated by Jesuits and like many 17th century philosophers generally deployed psychology and philosophy in the aid of theology .
Like anyone of any sense Descartes was well aware that people were capable of believing things that were n’t true .
In order to protect the Church , Descartes argued that God had given man the power to assess ideas .
So it clearly was n’t God ’s fault when people believed things that were n’t true .
As Gilbert ( 1993 , op cit ) notes , Descartes approach consisted of two axioms .
Firstly , the mental separation and sequencing of understanding and believing and secondly , that people have no control over how or what they understand , but are totally free to believe or disbelieve ideas as they please .
Spinozan systems
Spinoza ’s background and thinking could not be much more different than Descartes .
Born a Jew , Barauch de Espinoza ( later to become Benedict Spinoza ) outraged his community and synagogue .
The tensions finally resulted in Spinoza being excommunicated , accused of abominable heresies and monstrous deeds .
The order of excommunication prohibited other members of the synagogue from having any contact with Spinoza .
Freed of the need to conform to his past , Spinoza was able to explore anything he chose .
One of the areas he turned his considerable mental prowess to was the faults contained in the Cartesian approach .
Spinoza argued that all ideas were first represented as true and only later ( with effort ) evaluated for veracity .
Effectively Spinoza denied the parsing that Descartes put at the heart of his two step approach .
Spinoza argued that comprehension and belief were a single step .
That is to say , in order for somebody to understand something , belief is a necessary precondition .
Effectively all information or ideas are first accepted as true , and then only sometimes evaluated as to their truth , once this process is completed a ‘ corrected belief ’ is constructed if necessary .
Libraries
Gilbert et al ( 1990 , op cit ) use the example of a library to draw out the differences between these two approaches .
Imagine a library with several million volumes , of which only a few are works of fiction .
The Cartesian approach to filing books would be to put a red tag on each volume of fiction and blue tag on each volume of non-fiction .
Any new book that appeared in the library would be read , and then tagged as either fiction or nonfiction .
Any book that is unread is simply present in the library until it is read .
In contrast , a Spinozan library would work in a very different fashion .
Under this approach a tag would be added to each volume of fiction but the non-fiction would be left unmarked .
The ease of this system should be clear ; it requires a lot less effort to run this system than the Cartesian approach .
However , the risk is that if a new book arrives it will be seen as non-fiction .
Gilbert et al note that under ideal conditions both systems produce the same outcome if allowed to run to conclusion .
So if you pick up a copy of Darwin ’s ‘ The expression of emotions in man and animals ’ and asked the Cartesian librarian what he knew about the book , he would glance at the tag and say non-fiction .
The Spinozan librarian would do pretty much the same thing , concluding the book was non-fiction because of the absence of a tag .
However , imagine sneaking a new book into the library , say the latest Patricia Cornwell thriller .
If you took the book to the librarian and asked them what they knew about the book , their response would reveal a lot about the underlying process governing the library ’s approach to filing .
For instance , the Cartesian librarian would say “ I do n’t know what sort of book that is .
Come back later when it has been read and tagged appropriately ” .
The Spinozan librarian would glance up and see the absence of a tag and say “ it does n’t have a tag so it must be non-fiction ” – an obviously incorrect assessment .
A testing structure
The picture below taken from Gilbert ( 1993 ) shows the essential differences between the two approaches , and also suggests a clever way of testing which of the two approaches has more empirical support .
Say an idea is presented to the brain , and then the person considering the idea is interrupted in some fashion .
Under a Cartesian system , the person is left merely with an understanding of a false idea , but no belief in it .
However , if people are better described by a Spinozan approach then interrupting the process should lead to a belief in the false idea .
So giving people ideas or propositions and then interrupting them with another task should help to reveal whether people are Cartesian or Spinozan systems when it comes to beliefs .
The empirical evidence
It has long been known that distracting people can impact the belief they attach to arguments .
For instance , in their 1994 review Petty et al report an experiment from 1976 which clearly demonstrated the impact of distraction techniques .
To test the impact of distraction , students were exposed to a message arguing that tuition at their university should be cut in half .
Students listened to the ideas which were presented over headphones .
Some heard strong arguments , others heard relatively weak arguments .
At the same time , the students were subjected to a distraction task which consisted of tracking the positions of Xs that were flashed on a screen in front of them .
In the high distraction version of the task , the Xs flashed up at a fast pace , in the low distraction task the rate was reduced heavily .
The results Petty et al found are shown in the chart below .
When the message was weak , people who were highly distracted showed much more agreement with the message than did the people who only suffered mild distraction .
When the message was strong and distraction was high , the students showed less agreement than when the message was strong and the distraction was low .
Distraction did exactly what it was meant to do … prevented people from concentrating on the important issue .
Petty et al conclude “ Distraction , then , is an especially useful technique when a person ’s arguments are poor because even though people might be aware that some arguments were presented , they might be unaware that the arguments were not very compelling . ”
Something to bear in mind at your next meeting with brokers perhaps ?
The next time an analyst comes around and starts showing you pictures of the next generation of mobile phones , just stop and think about the quality of their investment arguments .
Is there more direct evidence of our minds housing a Spinozan system when it comes to belief ?
Gilbert et al ( 1990 , op cit ) decided to investigate .
They asked people to help them with an experiment concerning language acquisition in a natural environment .
Participants were shown ostensibly Hopi words with an explanation ( such as a monishna is a bat ) .
They had to wait until the experimenter told them whether the word they had been given was actually the correct word in Hopi or whether it was a false statement .
Subjects also had to listen out for a specific sound which if they heard required them to press a button .
The tone sounded very shortly after the participant had been told whether the statement was true or false .
This was aimed at interrupting the natural processing of information .
Once they responded to the tone , the next Hopi word appeared preventing them from going back and reconsidering the previous item .
When subjects were later asked about their beliefs , if they worked in a Spinozan way then people should recall false propositions as true more often after an interrupt than the rest of the time .
As the chart below shows , this is exactly what Gilbert et al uncovered .
Interruption had no effect on the correction identification of a true proposition ( 55 % when uninterrupted vs. 58 % when interrupted ) .
However , interruption did significantly reduce the correct identification of false propositions ( 55 % when uninterrupted vs. 35 % when interrupted ) .
Similarly one could look at the number of true - false reversals ( the right side of the chart above )
When false propositions were uninterrupted , they were misidentified as true 21 % of the time , which was roughly the same rate as true propositions were identified as false .
However , when interrupted the situation changes , false propositions were identified as true some 33 % , significantly higher than the number of true propositions were identified as false ( 17 % ) .
In another test Gilbert et al ( 1993 , op cit ) showed that this habit of needing to believe in order to understand could have some disturbing consequences .
They set up a study in which participants read crime reports with the goal of sentencing the perpetrators to prison .
The subjects were told some of the statements they would read would be false and would appear on screen as red text , the true statements would be in black text .
By design , the false statements in one case happened to exacerbate the crime in question ; in the other case they attenuated the crimes .
The statements were also shown crawling across the screen – much like the tickers and prices on bubble vision .
Below the text was a second row of crawling numbers .
Some of the subjects were asked to scan the second row for the number ( 5 ) and when they saw it , they were asked to press a button .
At the end of experiment , subjects were asked to state what they thought represented a fair sentence for the crimes they had read about .
The chart below shows that just like the previous example , interruption significantly reduced the recognition of false statements ( 69 % vs. 34 % ) , and increased the recognition of false statements as being true ( 23 % vs. 44 % ) .
The chart below shows the average recommended sentence depending on the degree of interruption .
When the false statements were attenuating and processing was interrupted there was n’t a huge difference in the recommended jail term .
The interrupted sentences were around 4 % lower than the uninterrupted ones .
However , when the false statements were exacerbating and interruption occurred the recommended jail term was on average nearly 60 % higher than in the uninterrupted case !
The reptilian response
Edward Here .
What Gilbert , Petty , and Montier have demonstrated is that human beings have to suspend disbelief to process information and make judgments based on that information .
Unfortunately , distractions ( think bread and circuses ) can lead people to believe something is true when in fact it is not – with grave implications for investing .
However , that ’s not what happens with strongly - held beliefs at all .
I remember talking to my mother about the Montier post , asking her about her own strongly held views on religion .
Her answers were interesting because it demonstrated to me an unwillingness to even process information that ran counter to her most cherished and strongly - held beliefs .
She admitted this interpretation was correct when we discussed it afterward .
Remember what Montier said “ in order for somebody to understand something , belief is a necessary precondition . ”
The point was that she did n’t even process the information – such an existential threat it was to her .
Human beings have a very clear view of self and this is strongly intertwined with a belief system which generates what we describe as core values .
So , if you attack those core values , you are likely to get an irrational and reptilian response .
There is no processing of information as I described in “ Through a glass darkly : the economy and confirmation bias in the econoblogosphere ” going on ; the cognitive dissonance is too great .
Instead what you get is fear and an irrational defence .
This is what my mother described .
The resolution of cognitive dissonance
So the world view widely held in Anglo - Saxon economies that markets are self - regulating and self - equilibrating is under threat because of the dislocations of the last two years .
However , this view is deeply entrenched , having built up over nearly three decades of history .
It is now adhered to with almost religious fervour ( see my thoughts on this in The year in review at Credit Writedowns – Kleptocracy ) .
People are not going to relinquish the self - equilibrating / regulating view overnight and not without overwhelming evidence to the contrary ; the cognitive dissonance would be too great .
What this effectively means for me is that financial calamity and economic collapse are really the only way to dislodge this thinking .
Maybe I ’m wrong – and , in fact , the markets are self - regulating and self - equilibrating .
Recent events suggest otherwise as does the frequency of what were viewed as similarly improbable market disturbances .
And maybe I ’m wrong about suspension of disbelief .
Perhaps , humans are resilient and can process information despite the existential threat it poses to their sense of self .
I sure hope I am wrong for the sake of the economy .

India 's Coal Tax Would Generate $ 650 Million Annually for the Clean Energy Fund
June 27th , 2010 by Mridul Chadha
The Indian government has decided to levy the Clean Energy Cess , or coal tax , on all the coal mined in the country or imported from July 1 , 2010 .
The energy cess was announced by the finance minister Mr. Pranab Mukherjee in this year ’s union budget which presented in February .
[ social_buttons ]
The Indian government announced the coal tax in order to generate funding for the research , development and deployment of cleaner and renewable energy technologies .
A tax of Rs. 50 would be levied on every tonne of coal mined in the country as well as that imported from abroad .
As of April 1 2009 , India ’s coal reserves stood at 267 billion tonnes .
There has been a steady increase in the coal production over the years .
The government has a target of mining 461 million tonnes in 2007 - 08 as against the actual production of 430 million tonnes in 2006 - 07 .
Thus the domestic coal mining sector would contribute about $ 500 million annually while the rest $ 150 million would be contributed through the import of coal in order to fulfill the demand of 600 million tonnes .
Coal is the primary source of power generation in India with more than 7o percent of the total electricity generated coming from coal - fired power plants .
It is also among the cheapest sources of energy as there are vast reserves of this resource in the country and the dependence on foreign suppliers is far less compared to other resources like oil , natural gas and nuclear fuel .
Many analysts , and the Indian government itself , sees coal as a major driving force for the electrification of rural areas as it seems highly cost effective .
However , with India already committed to reducing its carbon intensity by 20 to 25 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels , the strategy of using coal for large - scale rural electrification could hamper its efforts to achieve the carbon intensity reduction targets .
In order to meet its clean up targets , offset the carbon emissions , it is necessary that the government invests heavily in the renewable energy technologies .
Therefore , the need of a National Clean Energy Fund .
Now instead of complicating the process by introducing a cap - and - trade mechanism for coal mining companies or coal - fired power plants , the government took the smart and easier way of generating funds for financing its clean energy projects .
A coal tax presents the simplest of solutions given the lack of infrastructure required for carbon trading in India .
Coal mining and production is strictly under the control of the Coal Ministry and hence a close eye can be kept on the total production and , in turn , the prospective revenue generation .
This is a wise move on part of the Indian government ; the tax would create a substantial amount of financing for clean energy projects like the National Solar Mission without significantly increasing the consumer utilities . ﻿

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
A controversial law passed in Arizona giving state and local police the right to arrest anyone reasonably suspected of being an illegal immigrant is catching on nationwide , with lawmakers and others in several states considering similar legislation .
Concerned about the federal government ’s failure to secure the nation ’s borders , legislators and political candidates from Georgia to Colorado have introduced bills to beef up local immigration enforcement , have promised to do so or said they would support such legislation if offered .
“ With the federal government currently AWOL in fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities to protect American lives , property and jobs against the clear and present dangers of illegal - alien invaders , state lawmakers … are left with no choice but to take individual action to address this critical economic and national security epidemic , ” said Pennsylvania state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe .
Mr. Metcalfe , a Republican who introduced legislation last week modeled on the Arizona law , said his bill would give “ every illegal alien residing in Pennsylvania two options : Leave immediately or go to jail . ”
His bill would , among other things , give state and local law enforcement officials full authority to apprehend Pennsylvania ’s estimated 140,000 illegal immigrants and require law enforcement officers to attempt to verify the immigration status of suspected illegal immigrants .
It also would make it a criminal offense for illegal immigrants to fail to register as foreigners or to have proof that they did .
South Carolina state Rep. Eric Bedingfield , a Republican , has sponsored a bill in that state allowing the verification of a person ’s immigration status and providing for the “ warrantless arrest of persons suspected of being present in the United States unlawfully . ”
Mr. Bedingfield ’s bill also would target illegal immigrants who fail to complete or carry legal registration documents and would criminalize “ hiring and picking up workers at different locations while impeding traffic . ”
He said his constituents are concerned about illegal immigration and that he had received numerous communications from constituents asking when South Carolina would take the additional step as lawmakers did in Arizona .
The bill , he said , has 20 to 30 co-sponsors and is pending in the House , but it might be difficult to get it to the Senate floor before the end of the session June 1 .
In Oklahoma , state Rep. Randy Terrill said he and some other lawmakers still hope to pass a bill similar to Arizona ’s new law this session and “ go beyond it . ”
Mr. Terrill , a longtime advocate for tougher immigration laws , said his group also would like the legislation to include tougher penalties for illegal immigrants caught with firearms .
Mr. Terrill , a Republican , said Oklahoma used to have the toughest laws against illegal immigrants but that Arizona is now No. 1 .
“ We are runner - up , ” he said .
“ The states have to act because the federal government has refused to enforce our nation ’s borders and turned every state into a border state . ”
Similar efforts are under way in Minnesota , Maryland , North Carolina , Texas , Missouri , Nebraska and Idaho .
Several political leaders , immigrant advocacy rights groups and others have said they will challenge the Arizona law as unconstitutional .
Sen. Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat , also asked Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer , a Republican , to delay the legislation while Washington works on comprehensive immigration reform .
Mrs. Brewer declined , saying her state had no choice but to act in the absence of federal reform .
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. on Sunday said the Justice Department is considering a federal lawsuit against Arizona ’s new immigration law .
He told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” that the lawsuit could challenge whether the law would lead to civil rights violations .
The Arizona law is set to take effect in midsummer and authorizes state and local law enforcement officers to determine during lawful stops the immigration status of people for whom there is “ reasonable suspicion ” that they are in the country illegally .
Known as Senate Bill 1070 , it was enacted in response to a dramatic rise in violence along the Arizona - Mexico border .
Reasonable suspicion is a legal standard requiring that before someone is arrested or detained there must be reasonable belief that the person has been , is or is about to be engaged in criminal activity .
A recent Rasmussen Reports poll found that 70 percent of likely Arizona voters approve of the legislation , while 23 percent oppose it .
Ann Morse , who monitors immigration legislation for the National Conference of State Legislatures , said most attempts to pass legislation modeled on the Arizona statute probably will have to wait till next year .
She said it is too late for most state legislatures to consider such a measure , since most are already out of session or winding down .
She said many states will be watching what happens in Arizona regarding pending and threatened lawsuits and a ballot initiative .
She said she was not ruling out a similar stand from other states “ to push the federal government to take responsibility . ”
Utah House Speaker David Clark said he expects an Arizona - type bill to be introduced next year when that state ’s legislature returns to session .
Mr. Clark , a Republican , said Utah residents are “ concerned ” and “ frustrated ” about immigration and that Congress needs to act .
“ In Utah , we do n’t have the right to deport anyone , ” he said .
“ I think that Arizona gave a size 13 boot to the federal government to try to spur it into action . ”
In Georgia , Republican gubernatorial candidate Nathan Deal said he would support as governor legislation that mirrors Arizona ’s new immigration policies .
“ I agree with the Arizona governor and Legislature that the federal government has failed miserably at protecting our borders and enacting sensible solutions that would protect our states , counties and cities from bearing the enormous costs associated with illegal immigration , from emergency - room visits to public schools to the criminal justice system , ” Mr. Deal said .
Mr. Deal was active in the fight against illegal immigration while a member of Congress .
He was elected in 1992 to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat , switched to the Republican Party in 1995 , and resigned in March to run for governor .
Brian Robinson , Mr. Deal ’s campaign press secretary , said the veteran lawmaker , if elected , would “ seriously push ” for an Arizona - type law if the federal government continues the “ status quo ” of failing to secure the border .
“ We do n’t see we have a lot of choice , Mr. Robinson said .
“ This action has to be taken . ”
Scott McInnis , a candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in Colorado , also pledged to sign a bill like the Arizona legislation , “ given the failure of the federal government to deal with illegal immigration , ” said spokesman Sean Duffy .
During a recent KHOW radio interview in Denver , Mr. McInnis said , “ We are stopping the retreat .
No more retreat .
Federal government , if you are not going to do it , we are going to do it . ”

Shane Bond has announced his retirement from all forms of the game , less than a year after making his international comeback from the ICL wilderness .
Bond ended his Test career in December , when he felt that his body could not handle the rigours of the five - day game , and he has now decided to step away from the shorter formats as well .
After returning home from the ICC World Twenty20 in the Caribbean , where he collected five wickets at an average of 29 , Bond said he was unwilling to compromise his own standards for the sake of prolonging his career .
Bond turns 35 next month and he will leave the game nearly nine years after his international debut , with 259 victims across all formats for his country , and he is not planning to continue in the IPL .
" I know the time is right for me to step down , " Bond said .
" I have given it everything when playing for the Black Caps .
I will miss the camaraderie because it has been a privilege to play along such a great bunch of guys who are so committed to do their best for New Zealand .
Playing with pride for the Black Caps over the years has meant so much to me .
" I dreamed of playing for New Zealand when I was six .
The reality of what has unfolded was more than I could ever hope for and I have been extremely proud to represent New Zealand .
I am going to miss a lot of this but I know now is the time to bow out .
I am very keen at some stage to put something back into the game in New Zealand . "
Persistent injuries meant Bond played far fewer internationals than he or New Zealand would have liked , and he departs with 87 wickets at 22.09 in 18 Tests , 147 at 20.88 in 82 ODIs , and 25 at 21.72 in 20 Twenty20 internationals .
His absence from late 2007 until 2009 due to his ICL contract also deprived New Zealand of their best fast bowler .
Despite his impressive record in a small number of Tests , Bond 's impact was felt as much in one - day cricket , where for a time he was the No. 1 ranked bowler in the world .
His highlights included 6 for 23 in a World Cup game against Australia in 2003 , when Ricky Ponting 's men went through the tournament undefeated .
A genuinely quick bowler , Bond took a one - day international hat - trick , also against the Australians , and helped New Zealand to a World Cup semi-final in 2007 .
In an interview with Cricinfo this week , Bond said when he quit Tests he was unwilling to slow his pace and reduce the wear and tear on his body in an effort to extend his career , and he has now added 20 - and 50 - over cricket to that list .
" I find it difficult to hold back , " Bond said earlier this week .
" I just go hard .
It hurt me .
But I wanted to keep playing .
I have had enough injuries .
I am sick and tired of being in rehab , and if I did that one more time I would 've been probably finished .
I wanted to finish playing [ Tests ] rather than get injured and fall by the side .
I 'd rather have a shorter career and be successful than stretch it out and let my performance drop . "
Daniel Vettori , the New Zealand captain , has felt more than most the regular absences of Bond over the years , as the other main weapon in the attack .
Vettori said it was disappointing to lose Bond so soon after his comeback .
" For me personally it is a big loss , " Vettori said .
" I think he could still be a really good player for us for some time to come .
But I know how much effort he puts in to stay on the park .
He knows his body and he knows what he needs to do to prepare for international cricket .
Sadly for us he has decided his time has come to an end . "
Justin Vaughan , the chief executive of New Zealand Cricket , played against Bond in his final year for Auckland , when Bond was enjoying his first season for Canterbury in 1996 - 97 .
Vaughan said Bond would be a big loss for New Zealand .
" We shall all miss Shane in the international arena , " Vaughan said .
" His speed and ability struck fear into batsmen from every team in world cricket .
He has been a real match - winner .
Shane has had an inspirational presence about him and has been a great role model for younger team - mates .
Shane will leave a huge gap that will be almost impossible to replace .
We are saddened by his decision , but we support him and wish him all the best in his future . "
As you can imagine , we have received thousands of pictures on the photo - wire services relating to the election over the past month .
Among them are many photographs taken in everyday situations as the potential members of Parliament go about campaigning .
Most aim to illustrate a moment , to show who was where and what they were doing .
Despite the media scrum surrounding the three main party leaders as they make their way around the country , some photographers have managed to catch the would - be PMs looking isolated or disconnected from their surroundings , often as though they are extras on the scene .
When these pictures are removed from context , they have an element of the surreal .
It 's not just the party leaders .
From former prime ministers to potential chancellors , all can appear in ways that can surprise .
Below are some little visual treats that I thought I 'd share .
Protester Benjamin Easton has been banned from Manners Mall .
The self - styled " political busker " , was seen taking a sledgehammer to the road in Victoria St at the end of Manners Mall yesterday .
He was arrested by police , some in riot gear .
The 50 - year - old has previously publicly claimed to be voluntarily on a benefit and that he " sacrificed " a career to take up public causes .
He has campaigned against the reintroduction of buses into Manners Mall since it was first proposed in 2008 .
This morning he appeared in Wellington District Court before Judge Anthony Walsh , who bailed him till Friday , when Easton intends to challenge a bail condition that he not go to Manners Mall .
Easton had said the mall was where he worked .
He faces charges of disorderly behaviour , intentional damage and possession of an offensive weapon .
He has not pleaded .
Yesterday Easton brought central Wellington to a standstill .
He talked through a loudhailer as he poured blue paint along Victoria St and later laid into the bitumen with a sledgehammer , stalling cars and buses .
As Wellington City Council infrastructure performance manager Jon Visser tried to wrest the sledgehammer away , Easton responded : " It 's not your right . . .
I 'm going to show you the damage you 're doing to the public 's roads . "
Hundreds of people gathered to watch , some cheering Easton on , and others telling him to " Get a life " .
Several carloads of police arrived about 15 minutes after the commotion began , and ordered Easton to drop his sledgehammer .
Easton refused to do so , insisting police read a copy of section 330 of the Resource Management Act , which Easton had invoked as legal protection for his action .
He eventually dropped the sledgehammer when a policewoman armed with a Taser ordered him to .
Police with riot gear then tackled him to the ground , to cheers from the watching crowd .
Traffic was diverted at the intersection of Victoria and Manners streets for a short time , while police questioned by - standers .
Council spokesman Richard MacLean said traffic was snarled up for about half an hour .
" A lot of motorists were n't prepared to drive past a person swinging a sledgehammer . "
The damage caused was not significant .
" It did n't exactly wreck our infrastructure . "
There was a mixed reaction to Easton 's actions from the crowd .
Sky Lim said Easton had his sympathies and he was simply trying to get attention for the cause .
" He 's been working so hard for us . "
But Hugo Dewar said the protester had lost his support as a result .
" The sledgehammer is a foolish way of going about [ getting attention ] .
He 's just destroyed public property , it just seems like a stupid way to get attention for the cause . "
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
American gun owners might not feel besieged , but they should .
This week , the Obama administration announced its support for the United Nations Small Arms Treaty .
This international agreement poses real risks for freedom both in the United States and around the world by making it more difficult - if not outright illegal - for law - abiding citizens to keep and bear arms .
The U.N. claims that guns used in armed conflicts cause 300,000 deaths worldwide every year , an inordinate number of which are the result of internal civil strife within individual nations .
The solution proposed by transnationalists to keep rebels from getting guns is to make the global pool of weapons smaller through government action .
According to recent deliberations regarding the treaty , signatory countries would be required to “ prevent , combat and eradicate ” various classes of guns to undermine “ the illicit trade in small arms . ”
Such a plan would necessarily lead to confiscation of personal firearms .
This may seem like a reasonable solution to governments that do n’t trust their citizens , but it represents a dangerous disregard for the safety and freedom of everybody .
First of all , not all insurgencies are bad .
As U.S. history shows , one way to get rid of a despotic regime is to rise up against it .
That threat is why authoritarian regimes such as Syria , Cuba , Rwanda , Vietnam , Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone endorse gun control .
Political scientist Rudy Rummel estimates that the 15 worst regimes during the 20th century killed 151 million of their own citizens , which works out to 1.5 million victims per year .
Even if all 300,000 annual deaths from armed conflicts can be blamed on the small - arms trade ( which they cannot ) , governments are a bigger threat to most people than their neighbors .
This U.N. treaty will lead to more gun control in America .
“ After the treaty is approved and it comes into force , you will find out that it has this implication or that implication and it requires the Congress to adopt some measure that restricts ownership of firearms , ” former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John R. Bolton warns .
“ The [ Obama ] administration knows it cannot obtain this kind of legislation purely in a domestic context . …
They will use an international agreement as an excuse to get domestically what they could n’t otherwise . ”
The U.N. Small Arms Treaty opens a back door for the Obama administration to force through gun control regulations .
Threats to the Second Amendment are as real today as ever .

BBC News , Gabala , Azerbaijan
Tony Adams , the former England and Arsenal defender , has accepted an offer to manage a little known football club in Azerbaijan , the BBC can reveal .
Tony Adams is not a name you would readily associate with the town of Gabala .
It is not exactly world famous for its football .
Gabala FC is sixth - out of 12 - in the Azeri national league in a country better known for oilfields than football pitches .
Club bosses have been trying to keep Adams ' appointment a closely - guarded secret .
But now the towering 6ft 3in ( 190 cm ) ex-England defender has put the town on the map .
They 've given me a clean plate here to build a football club and you do n't get that opportunity in the UK
Tony Adams " I was looking for a project .
I am too young to retire , " he tells the BBC during an exclusive tour of the Gabala training ground - the first by journalists since his appointment .
Young players in fluorescent bibs dart left and right during warm -ups , their occasional shouts reverberating around the ground .
" This one was very rare .
I just thought it was a magnificent project to get my teeth into .
They 've given me a clean plate here to build a football club and you do n't get that opportunity in the UK , " he says .
' Evolution , not revolution ' Adams , 43 , has just signed a three - year contract , taking the managerial reins of its club , nurturing a squad from the grass roots and overseeing a football academy .
Supported by assistant coach , Gary Stevens , the former Spurs player who recently coached at Charlton Athletic , the two men aim to turn the ailing club into a national icon .
The club 's infrastructure is basic , consisting of one all - weather synthetic pitch and two grass pitches .
But Adams is realistic .
" First things first , " he says .
" Realistically to win the league in three years is achievable .
It 's evolution not revolution .
I 'm not going to throw the baby out with the bath - water here .
I 'm building a club , " he said .
We welcome the great Tony Adams ; we can now be very proud to have such a great footballer as our coach
Tarzen Jahangirov
Gabala midfielder
There is a mix of Azeri and foreign players at the club at the moment .
According to law , at least three Azeri nationals must be on the pitch during any official match .
With a wink , he tells me of his idea to help a Georgian player change his nationality to get him into the squad .
There is no doubt that he is relishing the challenge .
Adams seems confident and comfortable in his new role , standing on the sidelines during a training session on a warm , humid afternoon , joking with some of the players .
" I want this to be the ' Tony Adams club ' .
" I 've been to Europe .
I 've coached in Holland .
This is different .
This club does n't have history .
We hopefully will be able to build the history here . "
Finances unclear Adams is not the first big name to be lured to a footballing backwater by a club aiming for great things in an oil - rich state .
Last year the World Cup - winning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari took charge of Uzbekistan 's top team .
Adams is currently staying in a luxury five - star hotel , but has been provided with a modern holiday home in the resort and an apartment in Baku .
He says he will soon be joined by his wife and youngest children .
Other contract specifics are sketchy .
Tony Adams is a legend in the English game
In a country criticised by the West for high - level corruption , financial details are often kept behind tightly - sealed doors .
Adams ' salary has not been disclosed ( though we are told it is around the level of a " normal premiership manager " ) , and the club is owned by a large holding company called Gilan , about which few details are known .
The club president is Tale Heydarov , the son of the influential emergencies minister , Kamaladdin Heydarov .
The family is rumoured to have close ties to the Azeri President , Ilham Aliyev .
And it has been claimed that Gilan is owned by Mr Heydarov senior - though this is denied by those close to him .
It is unclear how much Tale Heydarov has personally invested in the club .
At the last minute , he declines to give an interview .
Frittered money ?
However , in March this year , he told me from his mansion in Baku that " the wealth of Azerbaijan has helped football , because it means there are sufficient funds to at least financially support it in Azerbaijan " .
" The federation in Azerbaijan is supported by [ the state oil company ] Socar .
In that sense it has helped to build the necessary infrastructure and to create more incentives for young [ Azeris ] , " he adds .
Poorer Azeris complain that the state is frittering oil money away , and using it to line the pockets of a closely guarded elite .
This has done little to dissuade the club 's chief executive , Alastair Saverimutto , also an Englishman .
" Those sorts of words do appear from time to time .
But you choose to do what you choose to do .
I 'm running a football club based on reality .
Often that reality does overlap with corruption , but nothing to do with Gabala FC . "
All I can do is make guarantees that money is not a problem
Alastair Saverimutto
Gabala FC chief executive Mr Saverimutto says a $ 75 m ( £ 50 m ) stadium complex will be built by the end of August 2011 , though again , final details of the costs are under wraps .
" All I can do is make guarantees that money is not a problem , " he says , smiling .
The local town centre contains a few basic shops , fruit stalls and traditional tea rooms - mainly full of middle - aged men .
" I know Tony Adams .
He 's English , " says one local bus driver .
" It 's good for our town that he 's here .
Soon everyone will know .
It will bring tourists here . "
It is unclear how much the revamped , multi-million dollar club will change their lives .
Either way , no - one here disputes that the club has a long way to go to achieve success .
And Adams must overcome his critics .
He has limited managerial experience .
" I 've not yet got going .
I was with [ Inter Milan manager Jose ] Mourinho in Milan before Christmas .
He said you 've got to forget all your playing stuff and concentrate on your coaching .
He said ' It 's a completely different job ' . "
But Adams says he is in for the long haul .
" I think I 'm going to do five , 10 [ years ] here , " he says .
But the remote location of Gabala is a reminder of how much Adams has distanced himself from the English Premiership , where he used to manage Portsmouth FC .
He has not only done so in football terms .
He is also a long way from home .

While StarCraft II is a a traditional RTS at its core , the included modding tools allow for a great deal of creative freedom .
Take YouTube user SkriK ’s latest creation for instance , a complete recreation of the staple turn - based Final Fantasy battle system utilizing the engine that powers Blizzard ’s upcoming sci- fi sequel .
As shown in the brief video clip embedded past the break , all the trimmings are there — from a interactive menu system to fully - functional ATB gauges that indicate a character ’s turn to strike .
Mind you , this is a work - in - progress , but it ’s still pretty impressive stuff if you ask us .
Quite a testament to the scalability of Blizzard ’s engine .
It ’ll be exciting to see what else the mod community comes up with .
StarCraft II is slated for a July 27 release worldwide on PC .

Catalyst Game Labs going Bye - Bye
Quote : OK , as you may well have been able to surmise from release schedules , Catalyst Game Labs is in a bit of a financial pickle , and it is somewhat unlikely that they will retain the license to make Shadowrun products .
This is not because Shadowrun has n't been selling enough to cover expenses , but merely because a significant quantity of money is missing outright .
Reliable sources put this figure at roughly $ 850,000 .
Which sounds like a lot , and it is .
It is roughly 40 % of Catalyst 's entire sales for last year , missing over a three year period .
There will of course be lawsuits , and there are already people drawing up legal documents accusing Loren Coleman of having hired people to construct an extension on his house through the company as " freelance writers " and somehow reporting an estimated $ 100,000 of convention sales as $ 6,000 .
Whether that is actually true or not is - of course - a matter for the courts to decide .
And decide they presumably will .
But what that means for Catalyst as a company is pretty bad .
It costs several dollars to print a book even when the pdfs are finished and ready for publication .
A print run of say , 50,000 books ( like the print run of Runner Havens ) would cost somewhere between $ 150,000 and $ 250,000 to print and ship to distributors .
And while it eventually sold to distributors at ~ $ 15 a book ( a total take home of $ 750,000 ) , it did so over a period of three years , during which time they were paying interest on loans and paying for storage , and advertisement and so on and so forth .
A book like that is n't actually taking home half a million in profits .
Which is a bad thing , because it means that even if there was a complete book printed and ready to sell , even a total and rapid sell through would not pull the company out of the financial hole it is in - and the shortfall means that it does not have the cash on hand to start the ball rolling with a new major printing .
The tiny amount of drachmas that are left in the coffers are being used to print up tiny print runs of books that have sold through - another 3,000 books of Runner 's Companion for example ( ~$ 15,000 to start up , maybe $ 30 - 40 k towards paying creditors if it sells out ) .
There simply is not the startup cash to bring upcoming books like the SR4 sixth world almanac or corporate guide forward .
The writing is there , but the printing costs are not .
Beyond that , the freelancers have not been paid , and some of them are withholding copyright until they are - meaning that even a tiny print run of these new materials is simply not possible .
Many SR writers are quitting , have already quit , or have handed in notices contingent on demands which - word on the street - will not be met .
And CGL does not even own Shadowrun , it leases the intellectual property from Topps .
It seems unlikely that they will be able to make their licensing payment when the contract comes up for renewal - in a couple of months .
At that time , CGL will cease being able to print Shadowrun or Battletech materials ( they would presumably keep the license to Cthulhutech and Eclipse Phase for at least a little while longer , because those are separate contracts ) .
So what does this mean for the future of Shadowrun ?
It probably means that someone else will create a company and start making Shadowrun again .
After all , freelancers work for very little , and a well selling book can bring in tens of thousands of dollars in profits .
$ 850,000 of embezzlement is seemingly enough to sink the company ( whoever ended up with the credsticks ) , but I must point out that there was indeed eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars to steal , so Shadowrun is not - as a concept - insoluble .
And I also point out that something similar happened to Shadowrun before .
Indeed , twice before , as both FanPro and FASA before it collapsed under the weight of people not paying debts and having bags with dollar bill signs vanish mysteriously in the middle of the night .
It 's somewhat ... poetic considering the subject matter of the game itself .
It is entirely probable indeed that when a new company comes to take the licence , many familiar faces will appear in the new company as if they had never left .
Certainly back when FanPro collapsed back when I was working for the company , I simply started working for the new company as if nothing had changed .
This happened back when FASA collapsed as well - those members of the team that were not extracted by Microsoft simply started turning in writing assignments to the new boss .
And yeah , I regularly go on shadowruns against Catalyst to find out what new releases are in store .
Do n't you ?
- Frank
I just hope someone qualified picks up the liscence and does something good with it .
Would SJGames be interested , perhaps ?

That 's a damn shame .
I was just starting to collect the books of Shadowrun Fourth Edition , and now I find out it 's highly unlikely the line is going to continue .
I just hope someone qualified picks up the liscence and does something good with it .

Using two of the world ’s largest telescopes , an international team of astronomers have found evidence of a collision between galaxies driving intense activity in a highly luminous quasar .
The scientists , led by Montserrat Villar Martin of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucía - CSIC in Spain , used the Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) in Chile and the Gran Telescopio Canarias ( GTC ) on La Palma in the Canary Islands , to study activity from the quasar SDSS J0123+00 .
They publish their work in a paper in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
Several types of galaxies , known as active galaxies , emit enormous amounts of energy from their central region or nucleus , with the most luminous objects known as quasars .
Most scientists argue that quasars contain a central black hole , with a mass of at least several million Suns .
The intense gravitational field created by the black hole drags material inexorably inwards .
Before falling in , this material settles in an accretion disk where it becomes very hot and emits large amounts of energy responsible for most of the brightness of the quasar .
Around the central quasar ‘ engine ’ is a torus ( thick ring ) opaque to the visible light emitted by the accretion disk .
From a terrestrial perspective , if the torus is face - on then the radiation from the disk can be seen and the system is designated type 1 , whereas in type 2 quasars the torus is edge - on and the radiation is concealed .
“ Type 2 quasars are a family of still rather unknown galaxies ” , explains Montserrat Villar - Martin , who led the research team , “ which so far have been investigated mostly from a statistical point of view .
“ The goal of our work is to study their individual characteristics in detail .
In our study we have obtained some surprising results .
For example , we have observed a giant nebula of ionized gas associated with SDSS J0123+00 , and signs of an interaction with a nearby galaxy .
“ This strengthens the idea that activity in galaxies is partly driven by the exchange of material between the active galaxies ( or quasars ) and their neighbours ” .
Although type 2 quasars are more difficult to detect , they are unique laboratories that let astronomers study the quasar environment in great detail , thanks to the dimming of the central radiation by the surrounding torus .
In the case of SDSS J0123+00 , one of the most important results is the discovery of an extended , faint nebula of ionized gas around the entire galaxy .
The nebula is about six times larger than our own Milky Way Galaxy and , according to the authors , is probably made of the debris of the interaction between SDSS J0123+00 and its neighbour .
Part of the giant nebula is a bridge of material that connects the two galaxies .
This strengthens the hypothesis that the quasar activity is triggered by the interaction between them , producing the accumulation of gas in the galactic central regions and providing material to feed the black hole .
This process can also trigger the rapid formation of new stars .
The new results are the first based on images obtained with the tuneable filter of the Optical System for Imaging and low Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy ( OSIRIS ) , the instrument installed on the GTC .
The OSIRIS tuneable filter allows astronomers to observe objects in narrow windows across the spectrum of visible light from red to blue , something that with older systems would need more than five thousand narrow band filters .

ARCHIVED : Maggie Gallagher and Robert George on AFA Radio
by Jeremy Hooper
The two top NOMmers , Maggie Gallagher and Robert George , appeared this afternoon on the American Family Association 's " SoundRezn " radio show .
And you know , it 's no surprise that the hosts and producers would spell " sound reason " incorrectly , because from what we heard , they have no interest in achieving anything close to it .
At least not when it comes to gays and their desire for CIVIL equality .
Here now , the archived audio , along with some bullet points :
Segment 1 :
( click to play )
Things to listen for :
- Robert George saying they do n't want to be against marriage .
Well of course they do n't .
Because they know and admit that this truthful language makes them drop in the polls .
It 's just too bad for them that being against same - sex marriage is EXACTLY what it says on the promotional flyer for tonight 's gig .
- Maggie referencing a Maine radio appearance where the host supposedly " turned on a dime " and accused her of bigotry for saying nothing more than that marriage is not discrimination .
Her take , which she and Brian Brown literally started using on the ay the appearance was made , is a complete and utter crock !
In actuality , the left - leaning cohost sat patiently and listened to Maggie say all kinds of things about all of the supposed harms that gays are doing to religious people , about why marriage is good for some but not for all , etc , etc .
He made his feelings clear throughout the piece in an intensely respectful way , even when Maggie tried to reduce the conversation to " two dudes " who " do n't really want to get married . "
And then when he did finally chime in and push back , he came back , in the most good - natured of ways , and said , through Maggie 's constant crosstalk : " Maggie , how do you just let these things roll off your tongue ?
I 'm sitting here biting my tongue as you say such remarkable things , I can't even fathom that you actually believe them -- maybe they 're poll tested -- but I sit here Maggie and I say to myself , Maggie , I mean , are you kidding ?
What world do you live in that 's so different ?
Let me just try to come back to one point that you said , because I would like to understand the difference .
If you are talking about , this is not bigotry , which you 've said over and over agin , how is this different ?
because the language you are using is very , very similar to the language that was used -- hold on , let me finish -- very similar to the questions that were raised when we were trying to make it clear that blacks and whites could marry .
The same language was being used to stop that from happening that you are using today . "
Listen to the full thing here .
- Maggie saying marriage is one thing all around the world .
Ya know , except for Canada , the Netherlands , Connecticut , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , D.C. , Belgium , Norway , South Africa , Sweden , etc .
Time is still marching forward :
And it 's marching forward with marriage equality .
That is a non-negotiable .
- Maggie quite literally sounding like a machine at times , repeating minutes - long chunks of talking points that she has used a million times already .
It 's just bizarre , both her ability and desire to do so .
- From all of the panel , the complete elimination of the idea that religious ceremony and civil marriage are actually different things .
Segment 2 :
( click to play )
Things to listen for :
- Maggie saying that a Gallup poll shows that 48 % think same - sex marriage will have a negative affect on society , which she says is a " 4 to 1 " margin against the 13 % who said it would be a positive .
Well , yes , a 2009 poll did show that 48 % number that she mentions .
But what she does n't tell you ?
That 13 % said it would be positive , 2 % had no opinion , and 36 % said it would have no effect !
" No effect " is the answer that even many pro-equality people would give , so you have to combine the 13 and the 36 to get an accurate number .
That would give you 49 % in the no effect or better camp , 48 % in the negative camp .
That is not 4 to 1 on your side , Magster !
- Maggie once again comparing herself to Vaclav Havel , which is just a - b - s - u - r-d .
- Maggie 's bold insinuation that her side has a monopoly on both God and the " common sense of humanity . "
- Robert 's admission that this current anti-gay work is " a very small part of a much larger project . "
In case you heterosexual allies need more reason to join with your LGBT brothers and sisters !
- Robert proving that the support for domestic partnerships that the Maine " Yes on One " campaign ( financed largely by NOM ) offered up in the final days was a complete and utter lie , when he says that companies that offer up DP benefits cross a line and " erode the marriage culture . "

CCTV footage from a nearby nightclub appears to show one of the brothers being repeatedly kicked and kneed by members of the Operational Support Group while a group of other officers pin him to the concrete .
'' When you look at this footage , it is deeply concerning that it could be suggested that grave issues of law and order have been abused , '' said barrister Winston Terracini , SC , having been instructed by solicitor Nick Boyden .
'' We will raise these issues in any tribunal if the police conduct is to be denied . ''
Police tape had been strung across Oxford Street and the footpath after a uniformed officer was run over .
Constable Sarah Maxwell , 27 , suffered serious head injuries when hit by a vehicle during a routine licensing operation on Monday , October 5 .
She had run across the road to break up a fight about 2.40 am .
But it was another melee about 20 minutes later - involving David Bunker and about six police - that is the subject of a court case that will thrust the actions of the black - clad officers from the Operational Support Group into the limelight .
Police statements tendered in court allege David Bunker assaulted a policewoman after crossing beneath the blue - and - white crime - scene tape that she was guarding .
Both brothers have been charged with assault and resisting arrest .
Contesting the charges , they and their legal representatives claim police were not only brutal but wrong to take them into custody .
The brothers claim they were trying to get back to their apartment in nearby Brisbane Street .
What the police involved did not realise was that the whole sequence of events was caught on film .
Stills from that CCTV footage - shot by a camera outside a licensed premises - are displayed above ( with the whole sequence of events able to be watched on smh.com.au ) .
The case is due to be heard in the Downing Centre next month .
Mr Boyden , a solicitor from the Australian Criminal Law Specialists , said the footage would prove embarrassing to the force : '' At least 10 officers were involved in the arrest of my clients .
Police are supposed to protect the community … the behaviour of some of these officers needs to be explained .
Police have alleged in statements that my client disobeyed a direction to move on and that he lifted up the tape and stepped through striking a policewoman but we claim the video images show it was the other way around . ''
The alleged assault occurred in the same street police twice fired a Taser at a 28 - year - old man in March 2009 .
The man involved in the Taser incident - also caught on CCTV - is being represented in civil action against the police by the same law firm .
Jury ’s still out for us , but Bob Lefsetz , he of the famous Lefsetz Letter , has found a bunch of links suggesting that we might all be looking at the next viral campaign concocted by a major record label .
Granted , there ’s not much to go on , but then , there was n’t much for the 9/11 Truthers or the Birthers to go on , either , and it took years for them to finally shut up .
The top ( potentially ) damning pieces of evidence :
YouTube play count :
We ’ve seen things go viral before , and the definition of the phrase is constantly changing as more and more people start flocking to the “ Internet sensations ” that clog up our culture , but 18 million plays ?
Already ?
Very , very fishy .
The girls .
In the video that shows Chance performing at what ’s supposed to be some kind of talent show , where are all the dudes ?
There are nothing but girls in that auditorium , which suggests either a ) that Chance goes to an all - girls school , and is therefore some kind of hermaphrodite ( which we are NOT discounting as a possibility ) , or b ) all those girls were somehow herded in there , possibly with the promise of locks of Justin Bieber ’s hair , and were turned into some kind of test - marketing audience .
The sound quality .
As explained by the Random British Guy ( supposedly a social media expert ) in one of the videos Lefsetz links to , the sound is very well - balanced for a talent show .
As anybody who ’s worked in an A/ V club before knows , getting audio from your auditorium to sound anything close to that good is really freaking hard , and it ’s exceedingly unlikely that they have someone that smart working at the public high school in Oklahoma that Chance attends .
Of course , we could be totally wrong about this ( and if we are , Greyson , we ’re sorry we called you a hermie ) , but given that the two biggest success stories to happen to the record industry in the last decade have been Susan Boyle and Justin Bieber , does n’t it make at least a little bit of sense that some executive at Interscope would think to combine the two ?
Because after all , if you could mash Susan Boyle ’s non-celebrity status together with Justin Bieber ’s haircut , that combination would look like a million bucks , right ?
At least .
Once upon a time , the United Nations was about protecting human rights and Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of its premier human rights agency , the Human Rights Commission .
This week , the U.N. ’s top human rights body , renamed the Human Rights Council , is poised to add Libya to its membership .
Libya will be elected by the U.N. General Assembly through a secret ballot in a process that champions geographic and religious loyalties over anything remotely resembling the actual protection of human rights .
The Obama administration is making no moves to call for the defeat of Libya or any of the other soon - to - be human rights specialists now running for a seat .
And yet , the 2009 State Department Human Rights Report says that in Libya there is routine torture and abuse of detainees , legally - sanctioned amputations and flogging , sentencing of political opposition members without trial , indefinite detention of women and girls “ suspected of violating moral codes , ” homosexuality is criminalized , and their president claims that “ the Christian Bible and the Jewish Torah are forgeries . ”
Libya will not be lonesome .
Other candidates include Malaysia , Mauritania , Uganda , Angola and Qatar .
The 2009 reports from the state department on all these Council shoe - ins tell us the following : in Uganda there are politically - motivated killings by the government , and law enforcement officials view wife - beating as a husband ’s prerogative .
In Angola there is government torture , widespread rape of inmates , and Internet chat rooms are monitored .
In Malaysia , religious authorities arrest “ deviants ” in order to return them to the " true path of Islam . ”
In Qatar the law calls for 10 year sentences for individuals proselytizing anything but Islam , conversion away from Islam is a capital offense , and the legal system treats with leniency men who murder women where there has been “ immodesty ” on the part of the victim .
The Obama administration ’s “ speak no evil ” approach when it comes to choosing U.N. human rights authorities marks the second time in less than a month that the administration has kept silent about handing a global platform to human rights offenders .
Once ensconced on these human rights bodies , such states are given the legal and political tools to avoid democracy , champion moral relativism , criticize free speech , demonize Israel , and exonerate Muslim extremists .
On April 28 , 2010 , the U.N. elected Iran a member of its main women ’s rights agency , the Commission on the Status of Women ( CSW ) .
After EYEontheUN found the outcome buried in U.N. documents and Fox News brought the result to national attention , prominent women ’s rights activists around the country began gathering signatures urging Secretary of State Clinton , at a minimum , to denounce the move after the fact .
They will remind her of the famous 1995 declaration she delivered at the U.N. World Conference on Women in Beijing : “ If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference , let it be that human rights are women ’s rights and women ’s rights are human rights , once and for all . ”
Fifteen years later , Democratic priorities have changed .
Evidently , there was a backroom deal on Iran , which until recently was on the ballot for the Human Rights Council elections .
The United States would look the other way when it came to an Iranian seat on the Women ’s Rights Commission , if Iran withdrew its candidacy for the Human Rights Council .
While the Obama administration , European Union members , and even some U.N. officials , worried Iran ’s election to the Council would be a potential embarrassment , they had no such sensitivities about a women ’s rights agency .
On the contrary , senior State Department officials balked at any criticism of the U.S. over the CSW result , telling Fox News " there is no opportunity " to object .
" That is not how the procedure works … because Iran faced no competition . "
But the “ our - hands - are - tied ” claim was as untrue for CSW as it is now for the Human Rights Council elections set to bring in a host of human rights abusers .
Elections to the Council are held within the framework of the U.N. ’s five regional - group system , with each group entitled to a fixed number of seats .
In theory , even if a regional group put forward only the same number of candidates as it has seats , General Assembly members could object to a state ’s candidature and refuse to vote yes .
The rules require each state to get a majority of the members of the General Assembly , or 97 , in order to be elected .
If any state fails to accumulate 97 votes , the group would be forced to proffer a new candidate or another could step forward .
The U.N. Human Rights Council was created in 2006 on the grounds that the 60 - year - old Commission had a “ credibility deficit , ” as former Secretary - General Kofi Annan finally admitted .
One of the main pieces of evidence contributing to the demise of the Commission ’s moral authority was the 2003 election of Libya as its chairperson .
It took the Council – said to be Annan ’s crowning reform achievement – only four years to reach the Libyan credibility deficit .
The Obama administration made joining the Council one of its very first foreign policy priorities , and the United States was duly elected in May 2009 .
The Bush administration had decided not to seek a seat on the Council on the grounds that the reform had been a sham .
President Obama and his advisors were fully aware of the Council ’s record of non-stop denunciation of Israel coupled with white - washing of human rights violations around the world .
The statistics speak for themselves .
There have been more resolutions and decisions condemning Israel than all other 191 U.N. member states combined .
In fact , only nine other states have been criticized by the Council at all .
There have been 13 regular sessions of the Council on human rights anywhere in the world , and six special sessions devoted to Israel - bashing alone .
The Council has a standing agenda of ten permanent items , one of which is devoted solely to criticism of Israel and one which is devoted to everybody else if and when the Council decides there are “ human rights situations that require the Council ’s attention . ”
Among its most telling omissions is the case of Iran .
Iranian leaders openly advocate genocide and actively transform their ideology into lethal practice .
Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism and is hell - bent on acquiring nuclear weapons .
Nevertheless , the Council has never had a single special session on Iran or even adopted a single resolution condemning Iran .
But the Obama administration did n’t care that the Human Rights Council does n’t do human rights .
They wanted to be part of the showmanship of human rights , where the pretense of concern is the highest aspiration of the assembled dignitaries .
Such dignitaries include current Council members like Saudi Arabia , China , Cuba , Russia , Egypt , and Kyrgyzstan .
The General Assembly resolution that created the Council made promises about the election process .
It says that when electing Council members , the General Assembly “ shall take into account the contribution of candidates to the promotion and protection of human rights and their voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . ”
In 2006 and 2007 all states – knaves included – made voluntary pledges .
In each of 2008 and 2009 , one state did n’t bother to make a promise to protect human rights .
This year , five states so far have n’t said a word about their interest in human rights protection .
Almost every one of these countries has something in common – six out of seven are members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference .
The OIC states have a reason to believe they are untouchable by the U.N. , by its human rights system , and by the Obama administration .
States which are members of the African and Asian regional groups hold the majority of the Council ’s 47 seats , and the majority of members of each of the African and Asian groups are from the OIC , which gives them the balance of power .
After Thursday ’s election they will hold 70 % of the seats of each of these two regional groups , handing them a greater chokehold on the Council than ever before .
The pledges made by states standing in Thursday ’s election make a mockery of the process of becoming a UN human rights authority figure .
Mauritania pledged :
“ The right to not be detained arbitrarily , to not be subjected to torture and to be granted a fair trial ... represent the most important guarantees …
The right to equality between individuals and the right to non-discrimination in all its forms ... has been guaranteed … ”
But as the 2009 State Department report points out , in Mauritania torture in prisons is common practice , slavery is openly practiced in parts of the country and almost every baby girl is subject to female genital mutilation before six months of age .
Come Thursday , the majority of members of the U.N. ’s lead human rights body will still not be fully free democracies according to Freedom House rankings and the numbers of non-democracies on the Council will actually increase .
The balance of power will be held by Islamic states .
States will be elected to the Council without bothering to make any undertakings about protecting human rights , and several of the states that do make pledges will lie about their intentions .
Members will include states with some of the worst human rights records on the planet .
And the Obama administration , having made no move to defeat a single human rights abuser now poised to jump on board , will be a part of it all – an active member lending the Council ’s dangerous anti-human rights activities the cover of legitimacy .

Calculating Your Frame Size
Following is the method the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company used to calculate frame size :
Extend your arm in front of your body bending your elbow at a ninety degree angle to your body so that your forearm is parallel to your body .
Keep your fingers straight and turn the inside of your wrist towards your body .
Place your thumb and index finger on the two prominent bones on either side of your elbow , then measure the distance between the bones with a tape measure or calipers .
Compare to the chart below .
The chart lists elbow measurements for a medium frame - if your elbow measurement for that particular height is less than the number of inches listed , you are a small frame - if your elbow measurement for that particular height is more than the number of inches listed , your are a large frame .
Elbow Measurements for Medium Frame Men Elbow Measurement Women Elbow Measurement 5 ' 2 " - 5 ' 3 " 2 - 1/2 " to 2 - 7/8 " 4'10 " - 4'11 " 2 - 1/4 " to 2 - 1/2 " 5 ' 4 " - 5 ' 7 " 2 - 5/8 " to 2 - 7/8 " 5 ' 0 " - 5 ' 3 " 2 - 1/4 " to 2 - 1/2 " 5 ' 8 " - 5 ' 11 " 2 - 3/4 " to 3 " 5 ' 4 " - 5 ' 7 " 2 - 3/8 " to 2 - 5/8 " 6 ' 0 " - 6 '3 " 2 - 3/4 " to 3 - 1/8 " 5/8 " - 5 ' 11 " 2 - 3/8 " to 2 - 5/8 " 6 ' 4 " 2 - 7/8 " to 3 - 1/4 " 6 '0 " 2 - 1/2 " to 2 - 3/4 "

Demolish blocks to bring each structure below the specified height .

I wrote yesterday about where utility - only cap - and - trade might go wrong .
There is , however , a potential upside .
If the United States ever gets serious about reducing its use of oil , utility - only cap - and - trade could actually lead to deeper emissions cuts than an economy - wide system .
Here ’s how .
Assume that we have an economy - wide cap - and - trade system in place .
Any other policies ( like efficiency standards , renewable electricity requirements , or biofuels incentives ) will not lead to further emissions reductions .
Instead , they ’ll just shift the source of emissions reductions within the economy ( that is , under the cap ) .
Imagine , for example , that we were to pass a cap on emissions tomorrow .
Then , in 2015 , we adopt a serious gasoline tax ( maybe for fiscal reasons ) .
Oil consumption goes down .
But emissions do n’t : instead , the carbon price drops a bit , emissions from the power sector go up from where they otherwise would have been , and the total remains the same .
After all , the cap is unchanged .
Now imagine , instead , that we only have a utility - only cap - and - trade system in place .
Policies that target oil consumption – which is outside the cap – are now a bonus from an emissions - reduction perspective .
Imagine , again , that in 2015 we were to adopt that serious gasoline tax .
Oil consumption again goes down .
But there is no effect on the cap , since emissions from oil consumption were never part of it in the first place .
( We do n’t really use oil to generate electricity . )
Emissions from utilities continue to drop as planned .
Total U.S. emissions are reduced below what they otherwise would have been .
Does this mean that we ’re better off on net ?
That depends on how aggressive the utility - only cap is in the first place and on whether we actually get our act together on oil .
Cap - and - trade does n’t do a huge amount for oil consumption .
A solid utility - only system together with serious oil measures could thus come out ahead of economy - wide cap - and - trade .
A weak utility - only cap together with continued complacency on oil would lose .
Oceanographic stations were visited four times a year to monitor the temperature , salinity and biochemical variables , and check changes in the Mediterranean .
The Western Mediterranean Sea is heating up and getting saltier , a new study finds .
Each year the temperature of the deep layer of the Western Mediterranean increases by 0.0036 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.002 degrees Celsius ) , and its salt levels increase by 0.001 units of salinity , researchers monitoring the sea found .
The change is consistent with the expected effects of global warming .
These changes may sound like small beans , but they have been building up at a faster pace since the 1990s , the study , detailed in the April 1 edition of the Journal of Geophysical Research , suggests .
The results show a consistent trend , " but to confirm this accelerating trend , we need to monitor it over the years to come , " said study author Manuel Vargas - Yáñez of the Spanish Institute of Oceanography .
The researchers analyzed the temperature and salt levels of the three layers of the Mediterranean Sea : the upper layer ( from the surface to 656 feet , or 200 meters , deep with water that enters from the Atlantic ) ; the middle layer ( from 656 to 1,968 feet , or 200 to 600 meters , deep with water from the eastern Mediterranean that enters the western basin via the Strait of Sicily ) ; and the deep layer ( from 1,968 to the sea bed , or 600 meters and deeper , with water from the western Mediterranean ) .
" These layers , especially the deep one , take up a huge volume , and raising its temperature each year by one - thousandth of a degree requires an enormous amount of heat , " Vargas - Yáñez said .
The team has also observed an increase in the salt level and the temperature of the middle layer of the sea .
This has not been clearly observed in the upper layer , " but it can be deduced from the heating of the deep water and from studies done by other teams and our current research projects , " Vargas - Yáñez said .
An increase in ocean salinity suggests an increase in the net evaporation of the water — the difference between evaporation and precipitation .
When evaporated water leaving the ocean is greater than water entering the ocean as precipitation that means overall less water staying in the sea with the same amount of salt .
So the sea gets saltier .
A greater evaporation rate can be due to a warmer ocean , but other factors can come into play , such as the humidity and temperature of the atmosphere , said oceanographer Ruth Curry of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts .
Also , the Mediterranean is a closed space , so certain land - use issues such as damming rivers could change how much freshwater is flowing into the ocean and diluting the saltwater .
Scientists are seeing a change in the evaporation - precipitation patterns of the ocean , which is consistent with what 's expected under greenhouse gas - driven warming , Curry told LiveScience .
The top layer of the entire ocean has warmed significantly over the past 16 years , according to another study detailed in the May 20 issue of the journal Nature .
From 1993 to 2008 , the top 2,300 feet ( 700 meters ) of the world 's oceans warmed 0.64 watts per square meter .
That 's equal to adding the energy from 100 million atomic bombs to the ocean each year during the 16 - year period , said John Lyman of the University of Hawaii .
There ’s something wonderful about Italian cuisine ; simple , healthy and delicious .
It ’s a pity that many pasta dishes ( I ’m pointing to those served in small eateries and cafes ) are being misrepresented .
Often , they are bland and unexciting like frozen tv dinners and if you think about it , they can be pricey too !
To be clear , I ’m neither a food snob nor believe in making everything from scratch and organic ( though , that ’d be nice ) .
But when it comes to Italian food , I think we should at least try making our own pesto for it ’s easy cooking process as compared to pasta & pizza dough making .
Oh wait , the basic basil pesto does n’t even require any cooking !
Sure , you need to cook the pasta to toss with the pesto but it ’s no harder than salad making right ?
While basil pesto does n’t need further introduction , I like to share with you my favourite pesto recipe to date – roast squash with coriander pesto .
It is a concoction of two of my favourite ingredients – squash ( of any kind ) and coriander with a touch of the Middle East ( because of cumin ) .
So look no further , this is a recipe worthy to be a keeper !
Roast Squash With Coriander Pesto
( adapted from Jill Dupleix )

2. Scrub the squash but do not peel .
Cut each squash into 6 or 8 thick half - moon wedges , coat in olive oil and place “ sitting up ” on an oiled baking tray .
Bake for 40 to 50 min until tender and lightly scorched on the tips .
3 . Pound the coriander , garlic , toasted pine nuts , sea salt , cumin seeds , cumin , lemon juice and a little of the olive oil in a mortar with a pestle , or in a food processor , until you have a mushy paste , then slowly pour in the remaining olive oil , stirring well .
4 . To serve , drizzle the squash with the pesto and scatter with the extra coriander leaves and pine nuts .
To serve as a meall , toss in cooked pasta if you like .
A video released by BP this week has underscored questions about the rate at which oil is spewing from a broken pipe on the Gulf of Mexico seabed .
BP and government officials have pegged the leak resulting from the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster at 5,000 barrels a day , or about 200,000 gallons .
But a scientist who analyzed the video of the gushing pipe said Thursday the oil flow appeared to be much greater .
“ I spent a couple of hours this afternoon analyzing the video , and the number I get is 70,000 barrels a day coming out of that pipe , ” said Steve Wereley , a Purdue University mechanical engineering professor .
Wereley , who has written a book on flow measurement , said his figure was an estimate that could be off by plus or minus 20 % .
“ BP has said you ca n’t measure this .
I agree you ca n’t measure [ the flow ] to a very high degree of precision , ” he added .
“ But that does n’t mean you ca n’t get a good estimate .
This estimate , I think , is much better than the 5,000 barrels a day they have previously been floating . ”
In response to Wereley ’s estimate , Rep. Edward J. Markey ( D - Mass . ) said late Thursday that he would launch a formal inquiry into the matter .
“ I am concerned that an underestimation of the oil spill ’s flow may be impeding the ability to solve the leak and handle the management of the disaster , ” said Markey , a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
Wereley arrived at the number by comparing individual frames of the video and tracking how fast a swirl of spewing oil moved from one frame to another .
He then calculated the flow based on the size of the pipe .
He conducted the exercise after National Public Radio called him and asked whether the flow could be measured .
The network reported Wereley ’s results Thursday .
BP spokeswoman Rebecca Bernhard said the company is standing by the 5,000 - barrel figure .
“ We look at the fact that it ’s coming out of the riser [ pipe ] in several ways .
We look at it from satellite imagery , overflight observations and on - the - water observations . ”
She said none of the methods were exact .
“ We said that from the beginning . ”
Last week BP officials told members of Congress in closed - door briefings that the spill could amount to 60,000 barrels a day in a worst - case scenario .

Blood - spinning is a method of providing therapeutic ( and , some claim , performance ) benefits to the human body through the removal , modification and reintroduction of the body 's own blood .
Introduced at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine in 1998 , it involves removing a quantity of a subject 's blood and then subjecting it to centrifuge ( hence ' spinning ' ) .
The centrifuging process concentrates the platelets found in blood into a plasma which has a thicker constituency than normal blood .
The red blood cells are usually discarded during the process .
Once the platelets have been concentrated ( to a minimum of five times their normal concentration ) , calcium and thrombin ( an enzyme ) are added .
This mimicks conditions that would be found in a wound , and the platelets are stimulated into coagulating into a gel .
Once they do so , they begin to produce NGFs ( Natural Growth Factor hormones ) just as they would within the body .
These NGFs are the point of the process .
Once back within the body , they will serve to quickly heal injuries or accelerate the process of muscle tissue repairing itself during training .
It is this latter case that causes the practice to fall afoul of WADA , the World Anti-Doping Agency based in Montreal .
The practice has caused a bit of a stir .
As of June 30 , 2006 , several high - profile cyclists have been withdrawn from the 2006 Tour de France on the eve of the race due to their implication in a ' doping scandal ' which involves blood - spinning .
Although legal in other sports ( FIFA allows it , for one ) the Tour follows WADA rulings on the subject , and it is a no -no .
Blood - spinning should not be confused with blood doping - the practice of freezing and storing the athlete 's own red blood cells for retransfusion for a simple hemoglobin and hence oxygenation boost .
Although that is also illegal in some cases , there are obviously more simple medical reasons that might be done - preparation in case of injury , for example - which make that a more complex issue .
The anti-doping aspect is more clear - cut in blood - spinning , as substances are in fact added to the spun blood - the calcium and thrombin .
Even if those substances are found naturally in the body , the fact that they are added outside the body makes the practice more difficult to defend .
It should be pointed out that WADA does have provisions for blood - spinning to be used as a strictly medicinal procedure - waivers can be granted for athletes who have been injured and who are utilizing the procedure for restorative purposes .
It has been shown in some cases to heal tissue faster and more smoothly than mechanical aids ( stitching , etc. ) and as such is highly useful for contact sports such as football .
The resultant gel can be injected into deep tissue injuries such as tendon and ligament tears with less problem than artificial aids , since it is composed of the body 's own substance , and accelerates healing .
The WADA first ran up against blood - spinning due to the UK football team Chelsea 's physician Bryan English utilizing the technique beginning in 2003 for rehab purposes , which resulted in the waiver process being set up .
The problem is that the gel can presumably be injected back into the athlete after being rediluted , perhaps in more of the athlete 's own blood .
This would give a boost in NGF levels , which would offer an advantage in training by ( I am assuming , as I am not a doctor ) boosting muscle mass .

NEW YORK -- NBA referee Joe DeRosa was suspended without pay Thursday for throwing a ball at a fan who appeared to be heckling him during halftime of Tuesday 's playoff game in Orlando .
DeRosa , 53 , will miss the next game he would have been scheduled to work .
At halftime of Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals between the Magic and Boston Celtics , DeRosa was walking to the scorer 's table to collect the warm - up jackets for his crew .
A fan behind the table approached DeRosa , gesturing with his arms and appearing to be shouting at the veteran official .
DeRosa flipped the game ball to the fan -- identified by the Orlando Sentinel as Franz Hanning -- who tossed it back .
DeRosa motioned for Hanning to be ejected by Amway Arena security .
Hanning was not ejected , the NBA said in a statement .
According to the Sentinel , Hanning was relocated to another seat in the capacity crowd of 17,461 .
The Sentinel said Hanning did not return calls for comment .
According to the newspaper , he released a statement Wednesday that read , " As many people in Orlando know , I am a huge fan of NBA basketball and especially my home team the Orlando Magic .
I think the NBA officials do a great job .
I 'm looking forward to the Magic going to Boston and evening up the series . "
Hanning is the president and CEO of Wyndham Vacation Ownership , the newspaper said .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
On today 's JJ , a musician was suing another musician for killing her cat by throwing three of her televisions on it .
His defense : " I was pretty wasted , but I do n't think I ever killed a cat . "
Both the defendant , Jonathan Coward , and the plaintiff , Kate Levitt are musicians .
( You can check out Jonathan 's Twitter , as well as his music on MySpace . )
Levitt is part of Baltimore 's Wham City , and also plays in other experimental -y bands , one of which is ( ironically ? ) named Kitty P0rn.
JJ was annoyed with both litigants , as well as their witnesses , but awarded the plaintiff $ 1000 on her claim .
The litigants ' commentary at the end of the episode is the best part .
Levitt says that Coward frequently tortures animals , saying , " The guy 's crazy , but he 's not a bad friend… usually . "
Meanwhile Coward says , " Pfft …we 're tough .
We hate those people . "
Extra vitamin D : more muscle , less fat If you fatten rats using a high - fat or a high - sucrose diet , of course they 'll get fatter .
If you give them extra vitamin D and calcium in their food then something happens that bodybuilders might find quite interesting .
The animals do n’t get fat so quickly but they do build up more muscles .
In the US , as in all other rich countries , the population is getting fatter and fatter .
For this reason nutritionists at Purdue University are studying whether it 's possible to do something about the problem by making simple changes in people 's eating habits .
And because some epidemiological studies claim that dairy consumption inhibits obesity , the researchers were curious to know whether their lab animals would get fatter less quickly if they were given extra vitamin D and calcium in their food .
The researchers fattened up rats in two ways : with food to which they added soya oil [ high fat ] and food to which they added sugar [ high sucrose ] .
Half of the rats in each group got food containing a ' suboptimal ' amount of calcium and vitamin D [ LD ] .
One kg of food in the LD group contained 400 IE vitamin D and consisted of 0.25 percent calcium .
The other half of both groups got food containing 10,000 IE vitamin D [ HD ] .
The HD group 's food consisted of 1.5 percent calcium .
When vitamin D and calcium were added to the food , the animals started to eat more .
But they did n't get fatter .
In fact the researchers noticed that the HD rats became thinner in the 13 weeks that the experiment lasted .
And a tiny bit more muscular .
On top of that , the vitamin D and the calcium made the HD rats burn more fat .
When they examined the rats ' muscle cells the researchers discovered the mechanism they think is involved .
The HD rats ' cells made more of the molecular linking protein PGC - 1 - alpha .
PGC - 1 - alpha works in combination with the fat sensor PPAR - gamma and steers the making of mitochondria .
Put simply : the better PGC - 1 - alpha works , the more easily muscle cells burn fat .
In the rats in the high - fat group , the mix also increased the manufacture of insulin receptors .
Now the calcium intake in rich countries is already on the high side .
So extra calcium wo n't help most strength athletes who are bulking to build a better body .
When it comes to vitamin D it 's a different story .
It seems that vitamin D supplements can help power athletes to develop a better body composition .
It 's the vitamin D intake in the rich countries of the northern hemisphere that is too low .

In their continued quest to plumb the mysterious depths of human interactions , some sociologists have stopped watching people — and started watching their avatars .
And the US government is paying them to do it .
While playing World of Warcraft and traipsing through Second Life might not sound like traditional academic disciplines , they are increasingly important for research into virtual communities .
This burgeoning subdiscipline even has its own publication , the Journal of Virtual Worlds Research , edited by Jeremiah Spence .
What gets studied ?
Gold farming , " goon culture , " griefing , entrepreneurial activity , intimacy , even " The Visual Language of Virtual BDSM Photographs in Second Life , " which appeared in the most recent issue of the journal .
That last piece , by Professor Shaowen Bardzell of Indiana University , relied on " two years of ethnographic observation , interviews , and artifact analysis " to suggest that " BDSM fantasy in Second Life is far more than a sexual pastime ...
I am more than ever convinced that all subcultures have the capacity to incubate innovation in a user - created content , and BDSM is successful particularly because of its combination of a potent visual language and the intense personal desires it stirs . "
Bardzell spent many hours analyzing " hundreds of virtual photos taken from the public profiles of Second Life 's BDSM practitioners " to learn more about how people presented themselves publicly .
In a paper presented last month at an Association of Computing Machinery conference , a team from Indiana University that included Bardzell conducted in - game World of Warcraft interviews to learn more about how real intimacy develops in virtual worlds — and how that world blends with the physical world .
The result was " The Rogue in the Lovely Black Dress : Intimacy in World of Warcraft . "
The paper found that many real - world patterns of intimacy formation are recreated on the virtual stage .
One interviewee recounted , " I and a guy I liked spent a lot of time flirting in game .
One evening we discovered an abandoned hut near Ironforge [ a major city in WoW ] and spent the whole evening with our avatars cuddling on the bed just touching .
I really felt close to him and did n't notice time passing . "
But virtual worlds also create novel situations .
" Originally , the guy ... was talking to me a lot , " wrote one man , " but I did n't realize that he was a guy , cause his avatar was a girl ...
It 's a big joke with us really , because his girlfriend / fiancée thought I was hitting on him , and the whole time I thought he was a girl .
Anyway , we all reconciled the situation , and we are still , what I like to call , friends to this day . "
Observing the wang ba
This is the new face of sociology and anthropology , and it 's more mainstream than you might think .
In 2008 , for instance , the University of California 's Bonnie Nardi received a $ 100,000 National Science Foundation grant to study American WoW players and their use of game mods , after having already performed similar research in China ( PDF ) .
Bonnie Nardi
In 2007 , Nardi and several other professors went to China to study virtual worlds ( Intel was a sponsor ) , and " for six weeks we interviewed and observed gamers in their favorite play locations including Internet cafés , student dormitories , and homes . "
They found that even virtual worlds had a strong real - world component ; many Chinese WoW players prefer to play the game in Internet cafes where they might see friends or guild members , rather than at home , even when they have ample computing equipment .
" Gaming in the wang ba [ Internet café ] was experienced in a hybrid ecology in which the digital space of the game blended with the physical space of the café , " wrote the team .
" Players commented on important aspects of the physicality of the wang ba , remarking that they enjoyed the provision of food , soft drinks , cigarettes , and air conditioning which afforded relief from the summer heat .
Sometimes odd or humorous juxtapositions of the physical and virtual occurred as at one Internet café at the train station in Hanghzou , which offered foot massage and Internet access right next to each other . "
Such research also aimed to get at the different ways that Chinese and American users played the game .
For instance , a Chinese player named Chenguang told the team , " My guild members and I play combat and then we rest and look at the area together .
We explore the graphics and wander through different areas .
To get equipment is a lot of work .
It is very tiring .
Looking at the scenery is recreational . "
When you realize that WoW has twice as many worldwide subscribers as Scotland has people , it suddenly makes more sense to spend resources trying to understand a group this large — and the federal government has been doing exactly that .
Do n't tell Tom Coburn
The National Science Foundation has been riding the virtual worlds train for years .
Since 2007 , it has passed out $ 378,644 to a Carnegie Mellon University prof who wanted to look at why virtual communities so often fail — and why big successes like Wikipedia and WoW persist .
" Because online groups have high failure rates , " said the grant proposal , " knowledge about the factors that underlie their effectiveness is critical for designers and managers . "
The NSF gave a University of Nevada - Reno professor $ 90,000 to develop a prototype Second Life client accessible to the blind ( yes , really ) .
According to the pitch , " The prototype client will initially allow blind players to navigate the environment using voice commands alone ; it will then be enhanced and extended , as time and resources allow , so as to enable these players to interact in meaningful ways with other players . "
The project was designed to have implications for not only WoW , but also for games in general .
" Voice navigation can make first person shooters or 3D adventure games accessible to physically disabled players , " says the grant .
" The PI [ Primary Investigator ] will take advantage of his experiences in this project to contribute to the formulation of accessibility guidelines for games , similar in spirit to those developed by the W3C for websites , which will enable future games to be developed in an inclusive way for the benefit of all members of society . "
And a University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee team picked up $ 350,000 ( courtesy of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ) to investigate " research ethics for Internet based studies . "
Most academic research work involving human subjects has to pass muster by an Institutional Review Board at each school to make sure people are not being mistreated , but how do existing standards for research translate into " participant observation of virtual worlds , " in - game chat interviews , and the use of " profiles from social networking sites to analyze behavior and communication patterns " ?
( An explanation of the Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) reference : Coburn has been pushing to strip " wasteful " funding from the NSF grant process , and last year he went after the entire field of political science [ PDF ] .
If he did n't like $ 50,000 going to a conference on how YouTube affected the 2008 Presidential campaign , he sure wo n't be pleased to see an anthropology of WoW .
His amendment to strip the funding was defeated . )
Plenty to say
The results of all this work can be seen in more than academic papers and conferences ; increasingly , they are turning into books from top academic publishers .
2008 brought us Coming of Age in Second Life : An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human ( Princeton University Press ) .
That same year , MIT Press put out Digital Culture , Play , and Identity : A World of Warcraft Reader .
According to the book 's description , " The contributors have immersed themselves in the World of Warcraft universe , spending hundreds of hours as players ( leading guilds and raids , exploring moneymaking possibilities in the in - game auction house , playing different factions , races , and classes ) , conducting interviews , and studying the game design ...
" The contributors examine the ways that gameworlds reflect the real world — exploring such topics as World of Warcraft as a ' capitalist fairytale ' and the game 's construction of gender ; the cohesiveness of the gameworld in terms of geography , mythology , narrative , and the treatment of death as a temporary state ; [ and ] aspects of play , including ' deviant strategies ' perhaps not in line with the intentions of the designers . "
Contributors come from fields like " game studies , textual analysis , gender studies , and postcolonial studies . "
2009 gave us World of Warcraft and Philosophy , a book that asks questions like , " Does the Corrupted Blood epidemic warn us of future public health catastrophes ?
What are the dangers when real life is invaded by events in the game ?
What can our own world learn from Azeroth ’s blend of primitivism and high - tech ? "
In March of this year , MIT published The Warcraft Civilization : Social Science in a Virtual World , a book in which sociologist William Sims Bainbridge argues that " WoW can be seen not only as an allegory of today but also as a virtual prototype of tomorrow , of a real human future in which tribe - like groups will engage in combat over declining natural resources , build temporary alliances on the basis of mutual self - interest , and seek a set of values that transcend the need for war . "
Who knew that the world of tomorrow would look so much like Azeroth ?
And coming in June , Bonnie Nardi will distill her WoW work into a book from the University of Michigan Press called My Life as a Night Elf Priest : An Anthropological Account of World of Warcraft .
So if you 're one of those WoW veterans who has put entirely too much time into Blizzard 's virtual world , take heart — enter a grad program and you can chalk all that time up to " dissertation research . "

World 's Largest Photo : Record - Breaking Photo Taken With GigaPan EPIC
Pro
Dubai Tops Paris for Gigapixel Supremacy
PORTLAND , Ore. , May 10 / PRNewswire / --
First , it was a breathtaking image of Paris that set the record as the world 's largest digital panorama at 26 gigapixels .
But that record was broken as GigaPan announced today that an image taken of Dubai has taken the top spot as the world 's largest digital photo .
The gigapixel image that can be viewed at photo sharing site GigaPan.org , topped out at 45 gigapixels .
If printed , this photo would be the size of nearly 1200 billboards .
Recently , photographer Gerald Donovan took a majestic image of a landscape in Dubai using the GigaPan EPIC Pro robotic camera mount based on technology employed by NASA 's Mars Rover .
He shot the photo using a Canon 7D camera coupled with GigaPan 's EPIC Pro robotic mount , which took nearly 4,250 pictures over a three - and half - hour time frame .
With the help of GigaPan Engineers Randy Sargent and Paul Heckbert , they stitched together the thousands of photos into one very large image using Autopano stitching software and uploaded it to the GigaPan.org site .
" This was intended as a technical test , " said Gerald Donovan .
" It was about exploring the limits of the hardware and software out there . "
Of course , if anyone thought of visiting Dubai without leaving their living room , this is an excellent opportunity to do so because the level of detail is so intense .
The tallest building in the world is at the center of the image , a perfect complement to the largest panorama in the world .
To view the record - breaking image and other famous images like Barack Obama 's Presidential Inaugural Address , go to GigaPan.org .
No special downloads or programs are required .
All photographers can upload their gigapixel images to the site , no matter what hardware or software is used , record breaking or not .
Richard Dawkins suggested that the first measure of an intelligent species , should two chance to meet , would be whether they understood how they came to be .
I imagine such a remarkable exchange of cosmic existentialism set on a hovering space dongle , lit only by the faint glow of distant ringed planets :
“ Hey , you know about evolution ?
” “ Yep ” And with these words , the warmth of science would triumph over the cold curve of the ever widening Universe , at least for a moment .
Will such an exchange ever take place ?
Why have n’t we met an aliens yet ?
Are we likely to ?
I did some reading , and found these three perspectives interesting : (1 ) Nick Bostrom If conditions are right , intelligent life will develop eventually .
So why have n’t we encountered any aliens ?
Bostrom describes the Great Filter ( attributed to Robin Hanson , who is really responsible for most of these ideas ) :
Either the right conditions are so extraordinarily rare that we are basically alone , or plenty of intelligent life has evolved but it destroyed itself before it had a chance to contact us .
There seems like a lot of room in between these two extremes -- extraterrestrials that are hiding , undetected in a distant galaxy -- but Bostrom argues that a vast time scale makes this intermediate possibility much less likely .
That is , once you have intelligent life , time is short before it begins broadcasting its presence , colonizing via self - replicating robots .
Does this seem far off for our own civilization ?
Well what about in a million years ?
Perhaps the Great Filter is behind us : the conditions required for the evolution of intelligent life are so rare that of 125 billion galaxies and 6x10 stars with orbiting planets , none besides us managed it in the last 13 billion years .
There is considerable speculation about how this could be , but less focus on the other possibility : the Filter is ahead of us .
Somehow , all intelligent life finds its way down one dramatically destructive dead end .
Nuclear annihilation ?
Induced black hole ?
Destructive artificial intelligence ?
Bostrom avoids taking sides .
Rather , he points out that the longer we go without bumping into any aliens , the more reason to be optimistic that the Filter is behind us .
So while most people would be excited about the discovery of life on Mars , Bostrom would be upset : life is not so rare after all ; it just destroys itself quickly , and there ’s no reason to think we will avoid this fate .
(2) Francis CrickFrancis
Crick suggested that life may have originated on Earth through “ Directed Panspermia ” .
That is , seeds of life were spread to various planets by an advanced civilization that faced catastrophic destruction , or perhaps as part of a farming experiment .
The seeds -- particularly robust microbes , for example -- might be attached to meteors or set afloat on solar sails aimed at newly forming stars .
Directed Panspermia bypasses the Great Filter : we do n’t need to explain the probability of life evolving on Earth relative to other planets because it did n’t happen organically .
Geoffrey MillerRecent data suggests that the Great Filter is not behind us .
Many scientists think there ’s a good chance the Universe has plenty of intelligent life .
And exponential colonization seems reasonable given enough time .
So where is everybody ?
This perspective is known as Fermi ’s Paradox ( after Enrico Fermi ) .
Miller suggests that the radio silence is not the result of anything so dramatic as nuclear annihilation .
Rather , the culprit is a gradual but inexorable addiction to video games as engineering of artificial stimuli surpasses natural pleasures .
In deference to religious fundamentalists the world over , Miller calls this the Great Temptation .----- I ’ve summarized these three perspectives very succinctly .
The original articles are excellent ( see references below )

1. Polls taken of different groups of people may reflect broadly similar
opinions but should not show any detailed connections between minor random details .
Let 's look at a little sample of R2 K 's recent results for men ( M ) and women ( F ) .

A combination of random sampling error and systematic difference should make the M results differ a bit from the F results , and in almost every case they do differ .
In one respect , however , the numbers for M and F do not differ : if one is even , so is the other , and likewise for odd .
Given that the M and F results usually differ , knowing that say 43 % of M were favorable ( Fav ) to Obama gives essentially no clue as to whether say 59 % or say 60 % of F would be .
Thus knowing whether M Fav is even or odd tells us essentially nothing about whether F Fav would be even or odd .
Thus the even - odd property should match about half the time , just like the odds of getting both heads or both tails if you tossed a penny and nickel .
If you were to toss the penny and the nickel 18 times ( like the 18 entries in the first two columns of the table ) you would expect them to show about the same number of heads , but would rightly be shocked if they each showed exactly the same random - looking pattern of heads and tails .
Were the results in our little table a fluke ?
The R2 K weekly polls report 778 M - F pairs .
For their favorable ratings ( Fav ) , the even - odd property matched 776 times .
For unfavorable ( Unf ) there were 777 matches .
Common sense says that that result is highly unlikely , but it helps to do a more precise calculation .
Since the odds of getting a match each time are essentially 50 % , the odds of getting 776/778 matches are just like those of getting 776 heads on 778 tosses of a fair coin .
Results that extreme happen less than one time in 10228 .
That ’s one followed by 228 zeros .
( The number of atoms within our cosmic horizon is something like 1 followed by 80 zeros . )
For the Unf , the odds are less than one in 10231 .
( Having some Undecideds makes Fav and Unf nearly independent , so these are two separate wildly unlikely events . )
There is no remotely realistic way that a simple tabulation and subsequent rounding of the results for M's and F's could possibly show that detailed similarity .
Therefore the numbers on these two separate groups were not generated just by independently polling them .
This does not tell us whether there was a minor " adjustment " to real data or something more major .
For that we turn to the issue of whether the reports show the sort of random weekly variations expected to arise from sampling statistics .
2 . Polls taken by sampling a small set of N respondents from a larger population show sampling error due to the randomness of who happens to be reached .
( The famous " margin of error " ( MOE ) describes this sampling error . )
If you flip a fair coin 100 times , it should give about 50 heads , but if it gives exactly 50 heads each time you try , something is wrong .
In fact , if it is always in the range 49 - 51 , something is wrong .
Although unusual poll reproducibility can itself occur by accident , just as exactly 50 heads can happen occasionally , extreme reproducibility becomes extremely unlikely to happen by chance .
To see whether the results showed enough statistical variation , we use several techniques to isolate the random sampling fluctuations from changes of opinion over time .
First , we focus on small demographic subsets , since smaller samples show more random variation .
Second , we consider the differences between categories whose actual time course should approximately match to remove those shared changes , making it easier to see if there is enough statistical noise .
Finally , we make use of the different time courses of opinion change and random statistical noise .
The former tends to show up as slow , smooth , cumulative changes , while the latter appears as abrupt movement in poll numbers up or down that are n't sustained in subsequent polls .
An easy way to separate the fast from the slow is to look only at the differences from week to week , in which the fast changes are undiminished but the slow changes hardly show up .
At one point R2 K changed its target population , sample size ( N ) , and the categories used for crosstabs .
For the first 60 weeks , R2 K reported N=2400 , and the set of questions changed occasionally ; during the final 14 weeks , N=1200 and the same 11 three - answer questions were used each week .
We analyzed the two sets of results separately since most simple statistical tests are not designed for that sort of hybrid .
We took advantage of the small numbers with reported political party affiliations of " independent " ( about 600 per week ) and " other " ( about 120 per week ) in the first 60 weeks .
We tracked the difference between Obama 's margin ( Fav - Unf , the percent favorable minus the percent unfavorable ) among independents and " others " .
This quantity should have a large helping of statistical noise , not obscured by much systematic change .
We quantify the fluctuations of the difference between those margins via its variance , i.e. the average of the square of how far those margins differ from their own average .
( The units for variance here are squared - percent , which may take some getting used to . )
The expected random variance in either margin is known from standard statistical methods :
{variance} =( 100 *( Fav + Unf ) -( Fav - Unf ) 2 ) / N. ( 1 )
( Essentially the same calculation is used all the time to report an MOE for polls , although the MOE is reported in plain percents , not squared . )
The expected variance of the sum or difference of two independent random variables is just the sum of their expected variances .
( That simple property is the reason why statisticians use variance rather than say , standard deviation , as a measure of variation . )
For the Obama approval rating ( the first and only one we checked ) the average expected variance in this difference of margins over the first 60 weeks was 80.5 , i.e. a range of +/- 9 % around the average value .
With that mind , consider what R2 K reported , in their first 8 weekly polls :
Attitude toward Obama among " Independents " and " Other "
Week ended Independents Other Diff
Fav Unfav Marg Fav Unfav Marg
1/ 8/09 68 - 25 = 43 69 - 23 = 46 - 3
1/15/09 69 - 24 = 45 70 - 22 = 48 - 3
1/22/09 82 - 15 = 67 84 - 13 = 71 - 4
1/29/09 80 - 16 = 64 82 - 16 = 66 - 2
2/ 5/09 73 - 21 = 52 72 - 23 = 49 +3
2/12/09 72 - 20 = 52 71 - 22 = 49 +3
2/19/09 71 - 21 = 53 72 - 22 = 50 +3
2/26/09 70 - 20 = 57 75 - 21 = 54 +3
There 's far less noise than the minimum predicted from polling statistics alone .
Looking over the full 60 - week set , the variance in the reports was only 9.947 .
To calculate how unlikely that is , we need to use a standard tool , a chi-squared distribution , in this case one with 59 degrees - of - freedom .
The probability of getting such a low variance via regular polling is less than one in 1016 , i.e. one in ten million billion .
What little variation there was in the difference of those cross - tab margins seemed to happen slowly over many weeks , not like the week - to - week random jitter expected for real statistics .
Since the weekly random error in each result should be independent of the previous week , the squared random weekly changes should average twice the variance .
( Remember , for independent variables the variance of the sum or difference is just the sum of the variances . )
That 's 2*80.5= 161 in this case .
The actual average of the square of the weekly change in the difference between these reported margins was 1.475 .
It is hardly necessary even to do statistical analysis to see that something is drastically wrong there , much worse even than in the reported variances , which were already essentially impossible .
So far we have described extreme anomalies in the cross-tabs .
We have not yet directly described the top- lines , the main results representing the overall population averages .
Could these have been obtained by standard methods , regardless of how the cross-tabs for sub-populations were generated ?
The top - line statistics require more care , because they are expected to have less statistical jitter and because there is no matching subset to use to approximately cancel the non-random changes over time .
For the data from the first 60 weeks , before the change in N , we found no obvious lack of jitter in the top - lines .
For the next 14 weeks , the top - line margins give the immediate impression that they do n't change as much in single week steps as would be expected just from random statistics .
A detailed analysis does show very suspiciously low weekly changes in those margins , but the analysis is too complex for this short note .
3 . We now turn instead to another oddity in the week - to - week changes in the top - lines .
For background , let ’s look at the changes in the Obama Fav from Gallup 's tracking poll , with 162 changes from one independent 3 - day sample of N=1500 to the next .
There is a smooth distribution of changes around zero , with no particular structure .
That ’s just as expected .
Now let ’s look at the same for the weekly changes in R2 K 's first 60 weeks .
There are many changes of 1 % or - 1 % , but very few of 0 % .
It 's as if some coin seemed to want to change on each flip , rarely giving heads or tails twice in a row .
That looks very peculiar , but with only 59 numbers it 's not so extremely far outside the range of what could happen by accident , especially since any accidental change in week 2 shows up in both the change from week 1 and the change to week 3 , complicating the statistics .
If we now look at all the top - line changes in favorability ( or other first - answer of three answers ) for the last 14 weeks , we see a similar pattern .
A very similar missing - zeros pattern also appears in the complete first 60 - week collection , as we see here for the 9 3 - answer questions given each of those weeks .
( Here , just to be extra cautious , we only show every other weekly change , so each weekly result shows up in only one change . )
How do we know that the real data could n't possibly have many changes of +1 % or - 1 % but few changes of 0 % ?
Let 's make an imaginative leap and say that , for some inexplicable reason , the actual changes in the population 's opinion were always exactly +1 % or - 1 % , equally likely .
Since real polls would have substantial sampling error ( about +/- 2 % in the week - to - week numbers even in the first 60 weeks , more later ) the distribution of weekly changes in the poll results would be smeared out , with slightly more ending up rounding to 0 % than to - 1 % or +1 % .
No real results could show a sharp hole at 0 % , barring yet another wildly unlikely accident .
By " unlikely " we mean that , just looking at the last 14 weeks alone , and counting only differences between non-overlapping pairs of weeks just to make sure all the random changes are independent , the chances are about one in a million that so few would be 0 % out of just the results that came out +1 % , 0 % , or - 1 % .
When those first 60 weeks of data are also included , the chances become less than 1 in 1016 .
( There are some minor approximations used here , but not ones of practical import . )
The missing zeros anomaly helps us guess how the results were generated .
Some fancy ways to estimate population percentages based on polling results and prior knowledge give more stable results than do simple polls .
So far as we are aware , no such algorithm shows too few changes of zero , i.e. none has an aversion to outputting the same whole number percent in two successive weeks .
On the other hand , it has long been known that when people write down imagined random sequences they typically avoid repetition , i.e. show too few changes of zero .

People who have been trusting the R2 K reports should know about these extreme anomalies .
We do not know exactly how the weekly R2 K results were created , but we are confident they could not accurately describe random polls .
We thank J. M. Robins and J. I. Marden for expert advice on some technical issues and Markos Moulitsas for his gracious assistance under very trying circumstances .
Calculations were done in Matlab , except for calculations of very low probabilities , which used an online tool .
Postscript : Del Ali , the head of R2 K , was contacted by Markos concerning some of these anomalies on 6/14/2010 .
Ali responded promptly but at the time of this writing has not yet provided either any explanations or any raw data .
We sent a draft of this paper to him very early on 6/28/2010 , with an urgent request for explanations or factual corrections .
Ali sent a prompt response but , as yet , no information .

I made a map of the various parts of Reddit , which I ’m posting here in case anyone ’s interested .
The code was written in hacky Python using BeautifulSoup ; the graph was created with graphviz and rendered with Inkscape .
When producing the graph , I filtered out all of the subreddits that did n’t link to anyone else , and also I filtered out some other subreddits I did n’t like that were messing up the structure of the graph .
There seems to be one main group that includes all the big subreddits , and also some smaller , higher - quality ones ; a cluster of Linux / open - source subreddits ; and a cluster of music subreddits .
More than that I ca n’t say ; it ’s likely that there exist other clusters isolated from the rest of reddit .
Two men sit shoulder - to - shoulder against a bright white wall .
They are young and cheerful , at ease in each other 's company .
They clown around , try a hat on for size and direct dopey grins at the camera .
The prevailing mood is one of jollity , and yet what we are witnessing are the rushes from a martyrdom video , shot at Osama bin Laden 's farmhouse in January 2000 .
The man on the right is Mohamed Atta , ringleader of the 11 September hijackers .
His buddy on the left is Ziad Jarrah , who piloted the United 93 flight that came down in a Pennsylvania cornfield , killing everyone on board .
Fast - forward a decade .
Chris Morris and I are sitting shoulder - to - shoulder in a London production office , staring at the screen of a scuffed white laptop .
" It does n't conform to type , does it ? " Morris says .
" These are n't cold , reptilian killers .
They 're dicking about with a hat ; they 're pissing themselves laughing .
What 's interesting is to look at this footage and think , ' But they still did it . '
They acted like this , and then they still went and did it .
And if you keep going with that line of thought , you might get somewhere and come out the other side . "
He shrugs .
" Or maybe you just get lost and go completely mad . "
Morris has spent the past five years researching , scripting , shooting and editing a comedy about suicide bombers .
He has gone with it , got through it and come out the other side , and if he 's gone mad in the process , it is sometimes hard to tell .
In the course of a chaotic three - day spell , I run into the director on several occasions and he 's different every time ; by turns bouncy and ebullient , caustic and contemptuous , professional and forthright .
At each turn in the conversation , I think I catch glimmers of the myriad media ghouls he once channelled on the likes of Brass Eye and The Day Today .
Then again , maybe not .
Morris suggests that his days of deconstructing the antics of the fourth estate are now behind him .
He has grown up , moved on .
Right now , he has other fish to fry .
Four Lions is a bumbling picaresque about a quartet of would - be jihadis who hatch a plot to bomb the London Marathon .
It introduces us to jittery Omar ( played by Riz Ahmed ) , dozy Faisal ( Adeel Akhtar ) , foursquare Waj ( Kayvan Novak ) and belligerent Barry ( Nigel Lindsay ) , while an inept rapper named Hassan ( Arsher Ali ) jogs on the sidelines , awaiting his big chance .
The film 's early scenes set up the jihadis as a bunch of Dad's Army - style buffoons – hapless , misguided , even faintly lovable .
Then , about midway through , one of them runs through a field , stumbles over a wall and blows himself up ( Asian Man 's Head Falls Out Of Tree , proclaims the headline in the next day 's paper ) .
After that , we twig that this gentle , domestic excursion is actually tilting towards oblivion .
And this , surely , is the point of Four Lions .
It is a film on a knife edge , one that pits the inherent humour of its situation against the inherent horror of its subject matter .
" Big thinking in small places , " agrees its director .
" It 's a fairly standard comic position . "
In person , Morris is lithe and limber , with a corkscrew bouffant and a birthmark on his cheek that the tabloids have chosen to read as the mark of Cain , physical proof of an evil nature .
If so , it seems to agree with him .
Morris is now in his late 40s , though he seems preternaturally boyish – more youthful , somehow , than the Paxman - esque news anchor he first road - tested on the BBC back in 1994 .
He explains that he was first drawn to the idea of suicide bombers after completing work on his infamous Brass Eye paedophile special from 2001 .
The research , he says , predated the London bombings of 7 July 2005 .
" It was an attempt to figure it out , to ask , ' What 's going on with this ? '
This [ the " War on Terror " ] is something that 's commanding so much of our lives , shaping so much of our culture , turning this massive political wheel .
I was wondering what this new game was all about .
But then 7/7 hit that with a fairly large impact , in that we were suddenly seeing all these guys with a Hovis accent .
Suddenly you 're not dealing with an amorphous Arab world so much as with British people who have been here quite a long time and who make curry and are a part of the landscape .
So you 've got a double excavation going on . "
And what conclusions did he draw ?
It strikes me that modern jihad ( or at least the version that we see in Four Lions ) says as much about the west as it does about the east .
It 's an unholy hybrid , is n't it ?
Fundamentalist zeal by way of Fame Academy .
" Well , it could be , " Morris says , though he is not wholly convinced .
" There are a lot of theories , all partly right .
You could argue that this is a version of celebrity culture gone wrong .
There 's certainly a Live Aid element to it . "
He smiles .
" I 'm not saying that Diana was the perfect suicide bomber .
But there are some parallels , I think . "
I first spoke to Morris about seven years ago , when he granted a brief phone interview to promote his Bafta - winning short film My Wrongs 8245 - 8249 & 117 .
At the time , I presumptuously suggested that the ongoing War on Terror seemed tailor - made for a Brass Eye special .
Except he was having none of it .
There was no mileage in the idea , he sniffed .
He did n't know what could be done with it .
Today , he qualifies that position .
OK , he was interested , even back then .
It 's just that the Brass Eye approach had begun to bore him .
" You can only maintain your interest if you 're travelling more in ignorance than knowledge .
I did formalise some ideas , but the jokes were all concerned with media coverage and perception , rather than the issue itself .
And when you 've already had a crack at media language , you can only do it a few times before you know how it works . "
He thinks it through .
" It 's an age thing as well .
You see young people , or kids , and they 're fascinated by the way people talk .
And that 's great .
But eventually you get to the point where you think , ' You know what ?
I do n't care how you talk , I 'm just listening to what you 're saying . ' "
All of which makes Brass Eye sound like an inspired piece of juvenilia .
" Well , maybe , " he says .
" And , of course , there 's a place for looking at the language .
How can you wage a war on terror ?
How can you declare war on an abstract noun ?
But the danger is that then you 're ignoring the most interesting thing about it .
This is such a life - or - death issue that just looking at the language would be a cop-out .
You want to find out what 's behind the rhetoric .
You need to look at the engine . "
So Morris pushed his satire in a fresh direction and plunged himself into years of detailed research .
He sifted through court transcripts , interviewed experts ( and idiots ) in the field , and came away with a stash of anecdotes that sound at least halfway as hilarious as anything that appears in the finished film .
He tells me about the BNP hard man who " accidentally converted himself " after reading the Qur'an ; about the fundamentalist who demanded that the world be run under a caliphate , yet freely admitted that he was unable to apply Sharia law in his own home because his wife would n't let him .
Some of his subjects , he adds , were really rather funny .
" The thing about a sense of humour is that it 's not bestowed on the good .
It 's just randomly dished out .
People say that Abu Hamza is very good at jokes .
Admittedly , Bin Laden does n't really do jokes .
Maybe that 's because his writers are no good , or his sense of humour is too dry for western tastes . "
He sighs .
" Certainly he 's no worse than Gordon Brown . "
The homework has paid handsome dividends .
Four Lions is a good film , both audacious and insightful .
But it is also – and there 's no easy way to gloss this – a potentially hazardous one .
I ask if Morris is concerned about possible reprisals , and he umms and ahhs .
Yes , he was nervous about previewing it at the Sundance film festival , and then again in Bradford , but so far the response has been positive .
If anything , he is more concerned with upsetting those who were caught up in 7/7 , except that he has spoken to someone who was on one of the tube trains and they claimed to be OK with the idea , " so long as it 's funny " .
Besides , he adds , there is no way of making a film that 's 100 % fatwa - proof .
During his early days as a radio DJ , he once bungled a request , played Tony Bennett instead of Frank Sinatra , and went on to receive lurid death threats from a listener in King 's Lynn .
Who can tell what people will react to ?
To his detractors , Morris remains a malign and shadowy hoaxer ; a hit - and - run media terrorist whose dislike of the limelight is taken as cowardice .
Away from the cameras , he lives quietly with his wife , literary agent Jo Unwin , and their two young sons .
He rarely attends public events and almost never gives interviews which , inevitably , only fuels the mystique .
When embarking on Four Lions , he corralled the services of two co-writers , Peep Show creators Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain .
For them , part of the appeal was the chance to meet Morris in the flesh .
" We wanted to check he really existed , " Bain tells me .
" He has this reputation as the dark lord of comedy , this godlike presence .
It was a surprise to find that he 's actually human . "
Morris has insisted that he never deliberately courts controversy ; that there 's no purpose in tackling a subject if your sole aim is to shock .
That said , it seems clear that his compass is naturally pointed towards the thorny and the taboo .
I keep coming back to that paedophile special , in which a series of duped celebrities lined up to talk " Nonce Sense " and earnestly explain that you can tell when your child had been abused because they " smell like hammers " .
Of course , what Morris was lampooning was the media 's collective hysteria about paedophilia , as opposed to paedophilia itself .
But no matter .
The show sparked a perfect storm of tabloid outrage .
The Daily Mail dubbed Morris " the most loathed man on TV " , while 2,000 viewers ( or possibly non-viewers ) rang up to lodge a complaint with Channel 4 .
And what was Morris 's reaction to all of this ?
Was there , perhaps , a part of him that relished the attention ?
" I did n't relish it , " he says quietly .
" What happened was that I 'd gone on holiday .
I 'd gone on holiday by mistake , in relation to the transmission time .
Channel 4 had bumped [ Brass Eye ] by three weeks because there was a girl who had gone missing on a school trip in France , so it coincided with my holiday and I flew right back into the storm . "
Another shrug .
" It sounds dismissive , but it was actually pretty boring .
It was n't particularly novel . "
It was n't novel , being the subject of a witch - hunt ?
" But it was n't a witch - hunt .
It all seemed to happen in a fictional world .
I mean , if I 'd gone on the tube and been menaced by a lot of angry people , then it would n't have been boring and it would n't have been pleasant .
But stuff that 's going on in the papers when you 've just done a show about stuff that 's going on in the papers is just " – he grins – " stuff that 's going on in the papers . "
Interview over , Morris reboots his laptop , guides me past various folders ( " Asian Girls Names " ) and shows off some exclusive Four Lions off - cuts .
En route , he name - checks the films he used as touchstones .
He thought of The Ladykillers , The Guns Of Navarone and a thriller by Gillo Pontecorvo called Operation Ogro , about a true - life band of Basque separatists ( " Like this , but without the jokes " ) .
Now look , here 's some behind - the - scenes footage , interspersed with multiple takes of key sequences .
His work is now over , but he seems loth to let it go .
" Did you know that Terrence Malick is still working on The Thin Red Line ?
Ten years after it was released in the cinema . "
How typical of Morris , to set his stall beside another famous recluse , another man who prefers to toil in the shadows and let his work speak for itself .
On screen , Omar is squabbling with Barry .
This , Morris explains , is an exchange that failed to make the final cut because it was seen as being too obvious , too explicit ; too much thought and not enough joke .
" Sometimes you got to do the wrong thing in order to do the right thing ! "
Omar is screaming .
" Sometimes the wrong thing 's more right than the right thing ! "
I leave with the suspicion that I 've just witnessed the moment that best sums up the comedic intent behind Four Lions .
Perhaps it says something about the man who made it , too .
• Four Lions is released on Friday .
The Dream Robbers
In this uncomfortable position , the rat is able to rest and eventually fall asleep .
But as soon as the animal hits REM sleep , the muscular paralysis that accompanies this stage of vivid dreaming causes its body to slacken .
The rat slips through the hole and gets dunked in the water .
The surprised rat is then free to crawl back onto the pot , lick the drops off its paws , and go back to sleep — but it wo n't get any REM sleep .
Step 2 : After several mostly dreamless nights , the creature is subjected to a virtual decathlon of physical ordeals designed to test its survival behaviors .
Every rat is born with a set of instinctive reactions to threatening situations .
These behaviors do n't have to be learned ; they 're natural defenses — useful responses accrued over millennia of rat society .
The dream - deprived rats flubbed each of the tasks .
When plopped down in a wide - open field , they did not scurry to the safety of a more sheltered area ; instead , they recklessly wandered around exposed areas .
When shocked , they paused briefly and then went about their business , rather than freezing in their tracks the way normal rats do .
When confronted with a foreign object in their burrow , they did not bury it ; instead , they groomed themselves .
Had the animals been out in the wild , they would have made easy prey .
The surprise came during Step 3 .
Each rat was given and tested again ; nothing changed .
If failure to be an effective rat were due to mere sleep deprivation , amphetamines would have reversed the effect .
But that did n't happen .
These rats were n't floundering because they were .
Something else was going on - but what ?
What Dreams Are Made Of
Dreaming is so basic to human existence , it 's astonishing we do n't understand it better .
It consumes years of our lives , and no other single activity exerts such a powerful pull on our imaginations .
Yet central as dreaming is , we still have no idea why we dream .
saw dreams as convoluted pathways toward fulfilling forbidden aggressive and sexual wishes ; frightening dreams were wishes in disguise — wishes so scary , he believed , they had to transmute themselves into and masquerade as .
Later came the idea that dreams are the cognitive echoes of our efforts to work out conflicting emotions .
More recently , dreams have been viewed as mere " epiphenomena " — excrescences of the brain with no function at all , the mind 's attempt to make sense of random firing while the body restores itself during sleep .
As Harvard sleep researcher Allan Hobson puts it , dreams are " the noise the brain makes while it 's doing its homework . "
" There 's nothing closer to a consensus on the purpose and function of dreaming than there 's ever been , " says Deirdre Barrett , a Harvard psychologist and editor of the forthcoming The New Science of Dreaming .
Indeed , no theory has been able to reconcile the findings of various subdisciplines of dream science .
Until now .
Finnish psychologist Antti Revonsuo believes the marooned rats lost their ability to defend themselves not because they were exhausted but because they were robbed of their dreams .
Dreams , he contends , are a training ground in which animals and people alike go over the behaviors that are key to their survival .
Prevented from dreaming , the rats were unable to rehearse their survival behaviors .
In other words , they were defenseless because they were out of practice .
A Theater of Threats
Say you 're in a fight and somebody wraps his arms around you from the front , pinning your arms to your sides — a bear hug .
Most people reflexively stiffen their body .
But this is actually the worst thing to do ; making your body rigid makes you easier to lift — and lets your assailant pick you up and drop you on your head , or worse , haul you off somewhere .
Better to bend your knees and lower your center of gravity so you 're harder to lift .
You 're then free to punch your aggressor 's testicles , claw the skin on his back , kick out his knee , stomp his foot , even bite his neck — unappetizing options , but effective against even the biggest thug .
The difference between the typical and optimal response could save your life .
But making such a reaction swift and automatic takes practice .
It 's the reason martial arts students drill their movements over and over .
Frequent rehearsal prepares them for that one decisive moment , ensuring that their response in an actual life - or - death situation is the one they practiced .
Dreams may do the same thing .
A dream researcher at the University of Turku , in Finland , Revonsuo believes that dreams are a sort of nighttime theater in which our brains screen realistic scenarios .
This virtual reality simulates emergency situations and provides an arena for safe training .
As Revonsuo puts it , " The primary function of negative dreams is rehearsal for similar real events , so that threat recognition and avoidance happens faster and more automatically in comparable real situations . "
Faced with actual life - or - death situations — traffic accidents , terrorist attacks , street assaults — some people report entering a mode of calm , rapid response , reacting automatically , almost without thinking .
Afterward , they often say the episode felt unreal , as if it were all a dream .
Threat simulation , Revonsuo believes , is why .
A Season in Hell
As a grad student in psychology in the early 1990s , Revonsuo often had bad dreams .
What struck him the most was how lifelike they were .
" I would say to myself , in my dream , ' Oh shit !
I 've dreamt of this before , but now this is really happening ! ' " he recalls .
" Credible world analogs " are what cognitive psychologist David Foulkes calls dreams .
Although we tend to dwell on the bizarreness of dreams , most dreams are quite mundane , Foulkes notes .
You move around , talk , run , interact with others , experience emotions , and feel the passage of time , just as in everyday life .
When Revonsuo began studying dreams , he asked his students to start keeping logs of their own nocturnal escapades .
He noticed something striking .
The dreams were filled with dangerous events , negative emotions , monsters , chases , escapes , fights , and near - death experiences .
The dream world was a hellscape of danger , teeming with threatening events far more sinister than in waking life .
These were n't the misfirings of diseased brains .
Threat dreams were the norm , accounting for a staggering two - thirds of all dreams .
Revonsuo discovered that we grossly underestimate the number of nightmares we have .
As it turns out , we have 300 to 1,000 threat dreams per year — one to four per night .
Just under half are aggressive encounters : physical such as fistfights , and nonphysical aggression such as verbal arguments .
The rest are about car crashes , falling and drowning , missing a meeting or a test , being lost or trapped , and being naked in public .
The whole dream world seemed to have a negative : more negative emotions than positive ones , more misfortune than good fortune , more nightmares than fantasy .
A Theory Is Born
In the ancestral environment , Revonsuo reasoned , our dreams served to protect us , teaching us how to respond when a wild animal was chasing us or when we got lost in the forest .
That was why the dream world was so filled with peril : to simulate the potential threats and prepare us to react quickly .
But how could dreams help us select the optimal response , given that dream recall is so fragile ?
After all , we remember only a few of our dreams , and even those fade fast in the tumult of the day .
Revonsuo believes that by providing rehearsal , dreaming helps us recognize dangers more quickly and respond more efficiently .
We do n't need to be aware of this rehearsal , just as you do n't have to recall exactly where you practiced your tennis serve in order to reap the rewards .
The idea that dreams are a dojo for perfecting waking activities fits well with what is already known about practice .
Mental rehearsal through improves skills , enhances learning , and changes the brain , polishing performance in almost any domain , from sports to piano playing .
The single most pervasive theme in dreaming is that of being chased or attacked .
Just as athletes in training repeat parts of their performance , we may , in our nightmares , be attacked and chased over and over again , not to solve a particular problem but to actually practice efficient escape behavior .
Saber - toothed tigers no longer our villages , but Stone Age themes still rule our dreams .
" Nowadays , the evolutionary footprint is clearest in the dreams of children , who often dream about being chased by monsters , much the same way we were once chased by predators , " says Revonsuo .
As life has evolved , so have the threats we rehearse .
" You insert a modern danger into that ancestral key and get a bizarre combination , " says Revonsuo .
" We dream of being chased , shot , or robbed , getting into traffic accidents , a burglar in our house , or perhaps smaller mishaps such as losing our wallets — and that prepares us for our waking life . "
The dreaming brain , explains Revonsuo , scans emotional memories .
When it detects a trace with a strong negative emotion , it constructs a nightmare around that theme .
The more the event , the more intense the nightmare .
The brain 's system for detecting threats is sensitive and flexible :
Anything the brain tags with a strong negative charge gets thrown into the threat bin and dredged up at night .
Sometimes this system works well : Dreaming about a boy running in front of our car better prepares us should that danger crop up in real life .
But sometimes the modern world throws the threat - detection mechanism out of whack :
Watching horror movies can trigger nightmares about vampires , ghosts , aliens , or zombies .
Such " nonsense nightmares " do n't rehearse any useful threats ; they 're like an allergic reaction , says Revonsuo .
Just as our immune system can mistake pollen for a pathogen and mount a defensive campaign , the threat - detection system misperceives horror movies and deploys its defenses by generating a nightmare .
Heroes of Our Own Dreams
In the jungles of the Amazon lives a tribe called the Mehinaku .
The Mehinaku lead the traditional life of hunter - gatherers .
They spend their days fishing and gathering roots .
Since they believe that dreams predict the future , they are scrupulous about remembering them and sharing them with others .
That makes them perfect for an ethnographic study of dreams .
In 1981 , anthropologist Thomas Gregor surveyed their dreams and analyzed the content .
As it turns out , the Mehinaku dream profusely about the dangers in their everyday lives : being attacked by wild pigs ; chased by jaguars ; bitten by snakes ; stung by wasps , ants , or bees — all potentially lethal .
" Their dreams simulate over and over again what to do and how to do it quickly when they spot these animals in the wild , " reports Revonsuo .
Across a tribesman 's lifespan , a single failure to react efficiently could be fatal .
If threat simulation even marginally increases the likelihood that such fatal failures wo n't occur , it would prove adaptive .
If the threat - simulation theory is correct , dreams should focus on the self , and when confronted with a threat , the dream self should react realistically to ensure its own survival and that of its loved ones .
And so it is .
We are the heroes of our own dreams .
We do n't dream about other people 's adventures or about fictional superheroes battling monsters .
We dream about ourselves .
If dreams evolved to simulate the threats in our environment , then being exposed to more dangers in real life should activate the nightmare function , overstuffing our dreams with threats .
This is precisely what happens .
Even a single exposure to a life - threatening situation can plunge a person into an inferno of post - traumatic nightmares , dreams in which the threatening event — the attack , the rape , the war — is repeated over and over in every possible variation .
Studies of traumatized Iraqi and Palestinian children who grew up in extremely violent environments , some of whom witnessed their parents ' deaths , show that their dreams are phantasmagoric carnivals of threatening events .
People who watched more television on September 11 , 2001 , and saw threatening images were more likely to dream about the events of that day ; people who merely talked about it with others were less likely to dream about it .
Traumatic dreams do seem to rehearse relevant threats .
Just four weeks into the first Gulf War , as Scud missiles were raining down on Tel Aviv and Haifa , the war was already encroaching on the dreams of Israeli college students , according to a study .
The most prominent topic : gas masks .
But not all our dreams contain threats .
That 's not surprising , says Revonuso .
There 's no reason a biological system has to express its function at all times .
Many bodily systems spring into action only in critical situations .
Take sperm cells .
The average man ejaculates over 100 million sperm at a time , yet over the course of his life , only a few will ever accomplish their biological mission of fertilizing an egg .
Every day , millions of sperm are wasted — and while this may , as Monty Python sings , make God quite irate , it does n't mean that sperm cells have some function other than fertilizing eggs and competing with other sperm .
The Nighttime Edge
Intriguing as Revonsuo's theory is , not everyone is sold on the idea that dreams are primarily a theater of threat rehearsal .
Dream researchers have known for centuries that dreaming helps problem solving , for example — but they still do not know why .
Some researchers argue that dreams are designed specifically to help us come up with creative solutions .
But if that 's the case , it 's infuriatingly inconsistent — and complicated by the fact that we rarely remember our dreams .
Those who awake with brilliant solutions to scientific or artistic problems are the exception .
German chemist Friedrich August Kekule struggled to find the molecular structure of benzene until he dreamed about a snake devouring its own tail and realized benzene was a closed circle — a ring .
The self - taught Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan came up with every one of his proofs in dreams .
Paul McCartney dreamed " Yesterday , " woke up , and wrote it down .
Problem solving may be a side effect of the simulation system .
The mere fact of running scenarios over and over may inevitably generate new solutions .
That 's why when we have an important decision to make , we like to " sleep on it " first , why , according to a study by University of Maryland psychologist Clara Hill , couples who dream about their relationship are more likely to resolve their conflicts than couples who do n't .
It 's also known that we get better at tasks just by dreaming about them .
Robert Stickgold , a sleep researcher at Harvard Medical School , found that if you time people as they tap out the sequence 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 - 4 with their fingers , then ask them to do it again later that day , they are no better .
But let them sleep in between and their performance improves — literally overnight .
The implication seems obvious : Sleep provides practice .
People given brainteasers before bed dream about the answers .
Math students are all too familiar with dreams about algebra problems .
Anyone who 's ever played too much Tetris knows you can start having Tetris dreams .
Stickgold holds that dreaming is much more complex than rehearsal .
He points , for example , to the ability of sleep to allow us to integrate and consolidate knowledge .
During sleep , our brains are making sense of the world , discovering new associations among existing memories , looking for patterns , formulating rules .
" That 's how we create meaning , " says Stickgold .
" Our brain puts things together . "
Dreams do have a certain edge over conscious thought .
Neuroimaging work has shown a distinct pattern of activation and inhibition in the dreaming brain .
Visual and emotional centers are abnormally activated , while censoring mechanisms are deactivated .
When we try to visualize during the day , imagery is thin and insubstantial , less real than the real world .
But studies suggest that vivid during dreaming rival the clarity and detail of vision itself .
" Dreaming is a sensitive system that tries to pay much to the threatening cues in our environment , " Revonsuo concludes .
" Their function is to protect and prepare us . "
" Yes , " says Harvard 's Barrett , " dreams are worrying about disasters .
But they 're also planning for nice things and they 're fantasizing and they 're problem solving . "
She contends that the purpose of dreaming is " as broad as all waking thought .
That 's why I say dreams are really just thinking in a different biochemical state . "
What is the sound of one molecule clapping ?
Researchers have demonstrated a device that can pick up single quanta of mechanical vibration similar to those that shake molecules during chemical reactions and have shown that the device itself , which is the width of a hair , acts as if it exists in two places at once .
This type of “ quantum weirdness ” feat so far had only been observed at the scale of molecules .
“ This is a milestone , ” says Wojciech Zurek , a theoretical physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory .
“ It confirms what many of us believe , but some continue to resist — that our universe is quantum to the core . ”
Aaron O’Connell , a graduate student at the University of California , Santa Barbara , used computer - chip manufacturing techniques to create a mechanical resonator — akin to a small tuning fork .
It was one micron thick and 40 microns long , just big enough to be visible with the naked eye .
He and his collaborators then attached the resonator to a superconducting circuit and cooled everything to within 0.025 of a degree above absolute zero .
At those temperatures , the resonator would either be completely still or possess a quantum of vibrational energy , called a phonon .
Vibrations could be detected using the superconducting circuit — in which case the device acted as a “ quantum microphone . ”
Alternatively , running currents in the circuit would force the resonator to vibrate in sync .
Thus , when the team put the circuit into a superposition of two states , one with a current and the other without , the resonator was in a superposition of vibrating and not vibrating .
In a vibrating state each atom in the resonator moved only by an extremely small distance — less than the size of the atom itself .
Thus , in the superposition of states the resonator was never really in two totally distinct places .
But still , the experiment showed that a large object ( made of about 10 trillion atoms ) can display just as much quantum weirdness as single atoms do .
O’Connell presented the results in March at a meeting of the American Physical Society , and the findings appeared in the April 1 Nature .

I think it is time for a new photo walk .
This time I will show you some impressions from Munich .
Munich is one of the most beautiful cities in Germany .
I ’m happy that I was privileged to live there once for a while .

The B.C. Ministry of Transportation would like $ 98,603 to provide you with the number of cellphones used by its civil servants and how much they cost .
And if you want the details of secret deals universities have struck with their food and beverage suppliers , you ’re largely out of luck .
These are among the findings of an annual audit of Canadians ’ access to government - held information conducted by the Canadian Newspaper Association ( CNA ) .
“ All democracies are built on the basis of openness and transparency , ” said John Hinds , president and CEO of the CNA .
“ This year ’s audit shows us that the system in Canada continues to be under strain , especially at the federal level .
The concept of freedom of information has been eroded . ”
Nearly half of the 314 formal requests to municipal , provincial and federal governments seeking records such as pandemic flu plans , trip expenses for senior officials and public land transactions were met with denials , fees and time delays reaching as long as half a year .
The feds were at the top of the secrecy scale , often failing to respond to requests within the legislated 30 - day deadline and , in some cases , demanding dramatic fees to release records .
“ At the federal , what we ’re seeing is ( government ) performances declining year over year , not getting better , ” said Suzanne Legault , interim federal information commissioner , whose recent report to Parliament warned that Canadians ’ right of access is “ at risk of being totally obliterated because delays threaten to render the entire access regime irrelevant . ”
“ We need leadership at the political and the institutional level , adequate resources and . . . legislative reform . ”
Journalists , citizens and academic researchers have long expressed frustration over access to information of vital public interest — from spending of taxpayer dollars to public policy decisions to health threats and public safety issues — getting buried in bureaucratic intransigence .
“ It ’s a joke , ” says Jeff Green , a Torontonian who fought a three - year battle under provincial freedom of information laws to obtain records he says never materialized .
After filing a misconduct complaint against a Toronto police officer , Green made a request in 2006 for records detailing what he believed to be improper use of police computers to search his personal information .
Green says his conflict with the officer began while they were living in the same condo building .
The matter is now the subject of an ongoing police disciplinary hearing .
After a series of lengthy negotiations and a formal appeal , the provincial information commissioner ordered police to release the records to Green last year .
But the documents , featuring long lists of computer printout data , amount to “ a pile of gibberish , ” says Green .
“ Whatever information they provided would be the same as providing nothing .
It ’s an illusion of access to calm the masses . ”
Bob Spence , a spokesperson for the Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner , said the average time for handling appeals is seven months .
“ Obviously , we would like to see all appeals wrapped us as soon as possible , but sometimes it ’s beyond our control . ”
The CNA ’s audit researchers had their own encounters with plodding and protective bureaucracies .
Universities , included in the audit for the first time , threw up perhaps the highest walls to public access .
Nine of 10 universities surveyed across Canada refused to release their full food and beverage contracts — generally exclusive deals with large food - service firms and soft drink companies .
( Only the University of Toronto agreed to release its full contract for a fee of $ 22.20 , the audit found . )
Confidentiality was the reason generally cited for denial of the records .
“ We could not provide the actual contracts themselves ( because ) they were set up as confidential legal documents and contain competitive information , ” said University of New Brunswick spokesperson Cynthia Goodwin .

Last year , the Ontario Information Commissioner rejected a similar argument by Hamilton ’s McMaster University and ordered the university to release contract records to the Toronto Star , stating McMaster “ has not provided detailed and convincing evidence of harm . ”
The typical government rationale for high fee assessments — reaching into tens of thousands of dollars — was the work required to compile the records .
“ The nature of the request was very broad given the fact that CBC / Radio - Canada has an annual budget of $ 1.7 billion with operations across the country and abroad , ” said CBC spokesperson Marco Dubé in response to the Crown Corporation ’s $ 20,825 fee for a listing of contracts under $ 10,000 .
An identical request to Canada Post produced a fee estimate of $ 20 , the audit reported .
“ Somehow there has to be a shift in the minds of citizens and their representatives that the civil servants work for us , not the other way around , ” says Sharon Polsky , national chair of the Canadian Association of Professional Access and Privacy Administrators .
“ If there ’s no awareness among the public to generate even a grassroots objection to how our governments are becoming increasingly secretive , it ’s deemed as acceptance .
That is dangerous . ”
Federal ministries logged the lowest overall performance grades assigned in the audit .
The 11 federal departments ranged from a B+ ( Public Works ) down to a D- for the Department of National Defence .
DND spokesperson Elana Aptowitzer says the department has been working to improve its compliance with the federal information law by increasing staff , providing training and expediting requests .
Twelve of the 18 extensions beyond the one - month time frame were claimed by federal institutions , the audit found .
One of those extensions rang in at six months .
“ You can hardly call it an access ( to information ) regime when it takes six months or a year to obtain what you need , ” said the report ’s author , Halifax - based journalism professor Fred Vallance - Jones .
“ There ’s still a feeling that for many bureaucrats it ’s more about processing paperwork than being there to encourage and promote access . ”
Saskatchewan scored best among the provinces with a B+ grade .
Ontario and B.C. shared the basement with D+ rankings .
Municipalities proved to be the most transparent level of government with some cities ( Banff , Nelson , B.C. , Brandon , Cornwall and Windsor ) scoring A+ grades .
Robert Cribb is a reporter with the Toronto Star
Interview Blighty 's top general - hotly tipped as the next head of the armed forces - has hinted strongly that the British defence industry can no longer expect to rely on sweetheart deals from the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) .
He adds that modern warfare has now left the tank behind as surely as it has the horse .
General Sir David Richards is the current head of the British Army , and we here on the Reg defence desk were speaking to him earlier this month as part of a round table event at MoD headquarters organised by Prospect magazine .
As all the world that cares knows , the MoD is now passing through a Strategic Defence Review under the new government , in which its procurement plans ( and thus in many cases the organisation of the Forces ) will be brought into line with the future budget .
At present , the stated equipment - buying programme is many billions more costly than the available money - and indeed it appears that that budget will now be cut substantially .
One major reason why the MoD 's spending plans are so out of control - and have been since well before 9/11 - is the long - standing policy of buying kit in such a way as to place as much industrial work as possible here in Blighty , pretty well regardless of cost .
Thus it is that we find ourselves buying Nimrod MRA4 subhunters for the same price as a fleet of space shuttles , A400 M transports for triple what it costs to buy much bigger C - 17s , waiting years for overpriced Lynx helicopters when we could have had bigger , better , cheaper Blackhawks - sooner .
And all the things we buy are still full of US or other foreign kit , so we wind up dependent on other nations for tech support anyway .
What does Richards , front runner to replace Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup as head of the combined armed forces this year , think of this ?
" I would love to see a very prosperous British defence sector but I do n’t think it ’s the job of the military to prop up ailing industries , " he told us , before going on to liken UK defence contractors to the former nationalised coal - mining industry - famously dubbed by Mrs Thatcher a system of " outdoor relief " .
" If British industry can deliver , then fine , " Richards told us .
" But if they ’re too expensive versus the competition then I do n’t think it ’s our job to spend money simply to keep those industries alive .
" Ultimately , it ’s why Margaret Thatcher did what she did in the 1980s .
You can love her or hate her , but she transformed the British economy at a time when it was going down the tube .
We ’ve got to be similarly robust in our approach to the British defence sector .
And I ’m pretty certain that that is the view of the new ministerial team in defence .
" There may be certain things we must keep — shipyards are one example .
But tanks , vehicles , these can be produced very cheaply under mass production .
If you ’re only producing 300 for the British army they are going to be too expensive to export to anybody else .
And probably too expensive for us . "
That sounds uncompromising enough , but in fact the serious British tank industry is pretty much already gone * .
Meanwhile a few shipyards are still fighting hard to stay alive and keep selling things to the Royal Navy , their only possible customer given their sky - high costs .
So these comments by the general are n't terribly controversial in detail .
Even so , the overall thrust of his remarks - and the suggestion that " the new ministerial team " are also against propping up subsidy - guzzling British arms firms - may send something of a chill down spines at BAE Systems .
Image caption The Hellas basin is the largest impact structure on Mars
US scientists have found further evidence that huge seas existed long ago on Mars .
A geological mapping project found sedimentary deposits in a region called Hellas Planitia which suggest a large sea once stood there .
The 2,000 km - wide , 8 km - deep Hellas basin is a giant impact crater - the largest such structure on Mars .
The researchers say their data support a lake between 4.5 and 3.5 billion years ago .
Some scientists believe that conditions on Mars were more favourable for the evolution of life at this time than they were on Earth .
" This mapping makes geologic interpretations consistent with previous studies , and constrains the timing of these putative lakes to the early - middle Noachian period on Mars , " said Dr Leslie Bleamaster , research scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson .
The researchers say that fine - layered outcrops around the eastern rim of Hellas are likely to be sedimentary deposits .
They were formed through the erosion and transport of rock and soil from the Martian highlands into a standing body of water .
The results support earlier studies of the western part of the Hellas basin .
Further study of the region could provide clues about where this water went and to how the Martian climate changed over geological history .
The mapping effort used data from a number of instruments aboard Nasa spacecraft , including the Viking orbiter , Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey .

Last November , rumors surfaced that there was a vegan vitamin D3 .
I ’m still occasionally getting questions about it , so I decided to write up what I know .
It appears that these claims have originated with two different brands : MegaFoods and LifeGive .
MegaFoods
I could not find anywhere in which MegaFoods is currently claiming that their vitamin D3 is vegan , but it appears that at one time , someone was claiming that it was .
Click here for a write - up about how it is not vegan :
Excerpt :
They say that their vitamin d3 is from S. cerevisiae , and technically it is - however , they actually take regular old vitamin d made from sheep lanolin that anyone can buy in stores , and they ‘ feed ’ this vitamin d3 to the yeast in order to ‘ Biotransform ’ the vitamin d3 into what they claim is an effective and bioavailable form of vitamin d3 that is easily ‘ utilized ’ by the human body .
If you go to their website , Mega Foods does n’t claim that their vitamin D3 is vegan .
A page at Amazon.com claims that MegaFoods ’ vitamin D3 does not come from fish and that it is suitable for vegetarians , which I suppose is technically true if they mean lacto - ovo vegetarians who are willing to use sheep ’s lanolin .
This site , Whole Foods Vitamins , sells MegaFood ’s Vitamin D3 and explains a bit about it :
Vitamin D - 3 DailyFoods is formulated with 100 % Cold Fusion FoodState nutrients , developed by Durham Research , Inc .
I ’m not sure if that ’s important to know , but now we do .
Moving on …
LifeGive Sun D
LifeGive Sun D is being advertised by two companies , UpayaNaturals and Alive Raw , as being vegan vitamin D3 .
They both say :
LifeGive Sun -D offers a superior , naturally occurring vegan source of vitamin D3 with vitamin D precursors from Shiitake mushrooms and rice germ ex-tracts .
Sun -D offers supplies [ sic ] pure and powerful plant source of living and life - supporting vitamin D for preventing nutrient deficiencies , supporting good health and preventing the development of threatening health conditions .
On November 18 , 2009 , I wrote UpayaNaturals to inquire about their product and never got a response .
However , a JackNorrisRD.com reader , who also wrote them last November , got a response from the company saying , “ All the information comes directly from our supplier ’s web page . ”
I could not find any more information about LifeGive – the company or their Sun D product .
At this time , no one else knows of any way to create vegan D3 and I would say that this casts doubt on whether LifeGive ’s Sun D is truly vegan .
In large , single doses , vitamin D3 may be more effective than D2 ; but in smaller , sustained doses , D2 appears to be as effective .
It might take some time to build up your stores of vitamin D by taking D2 .
Here are my recommendations .
Nature ’s Plus Source of Life Garden Vitamin D3
See below in the comments for a discussion of Nature ’s Plus D3 .
A quick summary is that I was not able to verify whether the lab that tested their D3 distinguished between D2 and D3 .
Last month we introduced you to The ( Potential ) Intern From Hell , a young gent with some very tough words for a company at which he applied to intern .
Well , he saw the piece on Gawker .
And was not amused .
Our hero recently sent this follow - up to the same company where he 'd originally applied :
And to reward his pluck and persistence , they decided to give him that internship .

Sound can reach the inner ear by way of two separate paths , and those paths in turn affect what we perceive .
Air - conducted sound is transmitted from the surrounding environment through the external auditory canal , eardrum and middle ear to the cochlea , the fluid - filled spiral in the inner ear .
Bone - conducted sound reaches the cochlea directly through the tissues of the head .
When you speak , sound energy spreads in the air around you and reaches your cochlea through your external ear by air conduction .
Sound also travels from your vocal cords and other structures directly to the cochlea , but the mechanical properties of your head enhance its deeper , lower - frequency vibrations .
The voice you hear when you speak is the combination of sound carried along both paths .
When you listen to a recording of yourself speaking , the bone - conducted pathway that you consider part of your “ normal ” voice is eliminated , and you hear only the air - conducted component in unfamiliar isolation .
You can experience the reverse effect by putting in earplugs so you hear only bone - conducted vibrations .
Some people have abnormalities of the inner ear that enhance their sensitivity to this component so much that the sound of their own breathing becomes overwhelming , and they may even hear their eyeballs moving in their sockets .

Bill Marriott & Mormon Elders Cook , Ballard and Wickman recently threw a party for NOM ’s Robert P. George .
Be sure to hit this link and check out the VIPs at the Annual Canterbury Medal Dinner .
Im sure plenty of folks here will recognize the various faces from NOM , the LDS church , and The Becket Fund among the photos at the above link .
The first group got Prop 8 on the ballot , the second made sure it passed , and the third paid for that full - page NY Times No Mob Veto ad that ran as a show of support for the LDS church following Prop 8s passage .
Kinda nifty how that all worked out and how these folks later found themselves all together at a Georgetown party handing out medals to each other .
Jeremy filed the first report on this soire and has all the details .
I just have one question left to ask :
When do Bill Marriott and the LDS leadership intend to stop attending award ceremonies for anti-gay figures such as Orson Scott Card and Robert P. George ?
And for your viewing pleasure , here ’s an excerpt from NOM Chairman Robby George ’s talk at BYU , titled “ Utah will be whipped into line . ”
Enjoy :
October 28 , 2008 : Just as the nation could not endure half slave and half free but eventually had to go all one way or all the other , we will not be able to get by with a situation in which some couples are married in one state , not married when they move to or travel through the next , and married again when they reach a third .
If same - sex marriage is legally recognized in a small number of states , it will spread throughout the nation , either through judicial action under the Constitution ’s Full Faith and Credit Clause or by the working of informal cultural pressures .
Some states – Utah would be one – may try to hold out , but sooner or later they will be whipped into line .
On the eve of the November 2008 ballot , the Mormon leadership filled an auditorium and broadcast Prof. Robert George of Princeton comparing the Prop 8 contest to the Civil War ( ! ) .
One week later , the same Mormon leadership would begin issuing hypocritical , self - righteous , self - serving calls for Civil Discourse (! ) :
November 5 , 2008 : We hope that now and in the future all parties involved in this issue will be well informed and act in a spirit of mutual respect and civility toward those with a different position .
No one on any side of the question should be vilified , intimidated , harassed or subject to erroneous information .
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints
And now , nearly two years later , that same Mormon leadership makes sure to thank Robby George for his uncivil Prop 8 help and hyperbole .
( Note to self : Keep this 2009 interview with George close to hand )
Not nice .
Especially you , Bill Marriott , after all your assurances that you had nothing to do with Prop 8 .
It ’s only been two months since you went to that dinner honoring Orson Scott Card , you know , your fellow Mormon and NOM board member who said this :
“ Laws against homosexual behavior should remain on the books … to be used when necessary to send a clear message that those who flagrantly violate societys regulation of sexual behavior cannot be permitted to remain as acceptable , equal citizens . ”
Fool me once , Bill .
As it turns out , the brother of one of the Mormon men photographed at this Georgetown party has written a letter to the LDS leaders deploring the treatment of his gay son at the hands of the Mormon church and its members , in which he decries the “ community of ‘ Saints ’ we live in [ that ] is so steeped in ignorance , fear , loathing , judgment … ”
For shame , Brethren .
Why are Republicans so consistently morally bereft ?
( And why do so many Democrats take their cue from them ? )
Thank heavens for senators like Sheldon Whitehouse , who speak so powerfully about the plight of the unemployed :
A trio of Senate Democrats took the floor Tuesday evening to denounce the Republican party for its unwillingness to add the cost of extended unemployment benefits to the deficit .
Extended unemployment benefits put in place by the stimulus bill expired on June 1 , interrupting checks for some 903,000 people so far .
" I understand the point about the debt and the deficit and the spending , " said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - R.I. ) .
" But to me , that does n't have an enormous amount of credibility , because when President Clinton left office , he left an annual surplus ...
At the end of [ George W. Bush 's ] term , we had $ 9 trillion in debt . "
" We would have none of this if it had n't been for the Republican debt orgy that they went through , " Whitehouse said .
There are currently five jobseekers for every available opening , but a major obstacle to reauthorizing currently - expired extended benefits has been deficit concerns supplemented by the suspicion that the benefits discourage people from looking for work .
Rep. John Linder ( R - Ga. ) called the benefits , which average $ 320 per week , " too much of an allure . "
Democrats in both the House and Senate , too , have said business owners tell them they 're having trouble hiring because of extended benefits .
Whitehouse confronted that argument .
" The notion that you 're going to cut off somebody 's unemployment insurance and have them go out and find a job is just plain nuts , " said Whitehouse .
" There are n't a lot of people lying around enjoying the luxury of unemployment insurance payments .
They want to be getting to work . "
In normal times , states provide six months of benefits to people laid off through no fault of their own , but to fight the stimulus bill and subsequent measures to fight the recession provided the unemployed 99 weeks of benefits in some states .
The House passed a bill to reauthorize the benefits , along with several other now - expired domestic aid programs , but the bill is stalled in the Senate , as unified Republicans and Nebraska Democrat Ben Nelson withhold their support .
If midgets ( of which I am one ) would need great techno weapons to take over the world because the average sized military serviceman could overcome midgets easily when it came to man for man ability .
They would n't bother anyway .
The state 's top school official is touting a bill that he says will end ethnic - studies classes , which he claims segregate students by race .
The measure , House Bill 2281 , passed the House of Representatives in the final hours of the legislative session with one vote to spare .
It 's one of dozens of bills on Gov. Jan Brewer 's desk that she must act on by May 11 .
Coming on the heels of the state 's new immigration - enforcement law , the bill could further fuel the controversy over Arizona 's treatment of people of Hispanic descent .
But Tom Horne , the state superintendent of public instruction , said he thinks it would do just the opposite because it seeks to treat all elementary and high - school students as individuals , rather than teaching students to see people through racial and ethnic lenses .
Horne , who is running for the Republican nomination for state attorney general , wrote the bill and championed it as it moved through the Legislature .
The bill applies to all public and charter schools , from kindergarten through high school .
It would ban classes that :
� �Promote the overthrow of the U.S. government .
� �Promote resentment toward a race or class of people .
��Are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group .
� �Advocate ethnic solidarity instead of treating pupils as individuals .
If the state Board of Education or the state school superintendent determines that a school district or charter school violates the bill 's provisions , the school or district would lose a share of its state education dollars .
Horne said his target is an ethnic - studies curriculum in the Tucson Unified School District .
" It would ban La Raza studies because it 's a course that 's aimed primarily at members of one race , and we have testimony that this has promoted resentment toward one race , " Horne said Friday .
" Raza " means " race . "
But the bill would go beyond Tucson 's Mexican - American offerings and would end other ethnic - centric courses , Horne said .
Students would still be exposed to other cultures and traditions .
" You do it in the regular social - studies class , " he said .
" And you do it within the ( state ) standards . "
Tucson school officials say there 's nothing in their curriculum that would run afoul of the bill 's provisions .
" In no way do we teach the resentment of any particular group of people , " said Sean Arce , director of the Mexican - American studies department in the Tucson district .
The district integrates Mexican - American studies into its offerings , from kindergarten through high school .
Arce said that , contrary to Horne 's assertions , the courses are open to all students , and they draw a mixed crowd .
Brewer has not indicated her view on the bill , her spokesman said Friday .
But Horne said he is confident Brewer will sign it .
" She and I have been at a lot of Republican meetings , and she agreed with me that this is outrageous , " he said .
But this means that parts of responsibility are assigned to several different contractors , and parts of responsibility are assigned to company employees .
And regulators play a role as well , approving many of the major steps in the process .
It is a strategy as old as civilization .
Assign each person to do a part of the entire job , and the job will get done faster and better as each member of the work team hones skills and learns tricks to improve his or her performance with each repetition of the task .
It 's called the division of labor , and as it spreads and intensifies , it leads to greater and greater complexity in society .
Kurt Cobb in a recent post raises what is to me a good point :
Was complexity a major factor in the Deepwater Horizon blowout and oil spill ?
According to Cobb , the approach is simple :
Within a company like BP , there is also a division of labor .
One division of labor relates to different job functions .
But there is also a division of labor related to level of experience .
An oil company will have quite a few inexperienced employees , plus a relative handful of employees with 30 years of more experience .
To try to make up for this lack of experience , the more experienced employees are typically located in a central location , like Houston , and can be consulted in the case of difficult situations .
But this takes time , and the step may be overlooked , especially if there seem to be many others involved who also have responsibility and seem to know what they are doing .
When there are many employees and contractors with partial responsibility , it is all too easy for things to slip through the cracks .
Part of the problem is that not very many people know the complete story -- it is just too complicated .
Hopefully , each person knows enough about the situation to make the decisions he or she is supposed to make -- but there can be slip - ups .
And if there are a lot of different people who have somewhat shared responsibility , there can be the assumption that others will be looking out for problems , so a person does n't have to be quite as vigilant .
And this division of labor seems to be an issue .
Notice that Art Berman 's post yesterday indicates that one of the issues was the well plan BP was working from :
What can be addressed now is the larger issue that a flawed , risky well plan for the MC 252 well was approved by the MMS , and BP , Anadarko and Mitsui management .
As long as everyone else seemed to be looking at what needs to be done , there might have been less concern about really looking at the plan closely , to make certain it is complete enough to detect all problems .
Also , today 's Wall Street Journal has an article BP Tries to Shift Blame to Transocean
The two BP executives read from a part of Transocean 's Emergency Response Manual for the rig , emphasizing sections that stated that Transocean 's offshore installation manager was " fully responsible " for activities onboard the rig , and BP 's representative was there to " assist . "
" For obvious reasons , " the manual said , " only one person can be in charge at any one time . "
The manual also said it was the responsibility of Transocean 's driller to shut in the well upon detecting an intrusion of oil or natural gas .
In response to BP 's claims , Transocean provided The Wall Street Journal with a complete copy of the manual 's well - control section .
The document suggested the responsibility for decision - making was less clear - cut than what BP highlighted .
The well - control section stated that top managers on the rig for both BP and Transocean were supposed to jointly decide whether the situation was deteriorating to a point where they might lose control of the well .
Moreover , while Transocean 's top official was atop the chain of command , BP 's senior representative was supposed to consult with shore - based management in Houston to " decide appropriate well control procedures " if rig crews had trouble handling a serious problem .
According to Cobb ,
The broader question is how such a system of oil exploration became subject to such a catastrophic failure .
One answer is that offshore drilling , specifically deepwater drilling , is an exceedingly complex enterprise .
And , the more complex an operation is , the greater the chances of a breakdown .
Counterintuitively , the safer we try the make such operations , the more the operators of such rigs will likely push the limits of what those rigs are capable of doing and thereby invite additional disasters .
( We already know that automobile drivers take more risks as cars and roadways are made safer , something known as the rebound effect . )
Cobb goes on to talk about Joseph Tainter 's theory of collapse :
Joseph Tainter , author of The Collapse of Complex Societies , the seminal work on the fall of entire civilizations , explains that increases in complexity in a society are natural responses to challenges to survival .
For a time , sometimes a long time , increased complexity succeeds in aiding the expansion and success of a society .
The primary manifestations are the ever greater division of labor ( often in the form of additional layers of managers , technical experts and government regulators ) and the ever greater technical complexity of the methods and devices deployed .
. . .
But there comes a time , Tainter cautions , when the returns from additional complexity begin to diminish and ultimately turn negative -- that is , additional complexity can result in a reduction of resources , safety , security and other measures of societal well - being .
When he wrote his book in 1988 , Tainter already believed that our global society was experiencing diminishing returns on additional complexity .
Might we now be reaching the point where additional complexity brings negative returns ?
This additional complexity can bring breakdowns , like the blowout and oil spill .
The easiest fixes , like more regulation , are likely counterproductive , if the result is that decision - makers take more risks , assuming someone else is now protecting them from risk .
According to Tainter 's theory , it takes additional energy to keep an increasingly complex system going .
Let 's think about how additional energy might be used in this case to make the system safer :
• Regulators are normally not very high paid individuals .
Pay scales could be raised , so that experienced workers from the oil industry can be hired as regulators .
• More experienced people can be hired in the oil field ( not certain where they would come from , however ) or additional training can be given to company employees , so that company employees know the jobs of independent contractors , and can act as a double check on them .
• Less experienced company people can be tied even more closely with experienced employees .
( But even this does n't help , if the inexperienced person does n't realize the possibility of a problem , so does n't check . )
• Company incentives can be changed to reward accident free operation , rather than speed of drilling and completing wells .
All of these changes would be more expensive -- that is use more energy , in one way or another , if only to pay employees more .
But no one will ever approve approaches that will support the higher - cost system needed to support an increasing complex system .
Instead , the lessons from the auto industry will be ignored , and new regulations adopted , which only seem to make the industry safer .
The oil industry is n't alone in its complexity .
One can think of a lot of other complex industries .
For example , the electrical industry is terribly complex , especially after deregulation , and the breaking apart of electric utilities into smaller competing parts .
Many people assume that the electrical industry is one that people can fall back on , if oil supply is inadequate .
Given at least equivalent complexity in the electrical industry , and the unwillingness of governments / regulators to throw lots of energy ( $ $ ) at offsetting the problems that arise with increasing complexity , it seems to me that the electrical industry is at least as likely as the oil industry to be reaching the limits of complexity .
We just have n't been following the electrical industry as closely , so do n't understand the situation as well .
Perhaps I can run some updated versions of electrical posts that were run earlier , one of these days .
Britain ’s five days of post-election limbo are over as David Cameron , Conservative Party leader and now Prime Minister , announced Britain ’s first peacetime coalition government since the 1930s .
Ushering in an era of cross - bench unity , Cameron ’s Conservatives will join forces with Nick Clegg ’s Liberal Democratic Party .
Cameron has appointed six Liberal Democrats to the cabinet , including Clegg as his Deputy Prime Minister .
In a press conference held today , Cameron said : “ We are not just announcing a new government and new ministers .
We are announcing a new politics .
A new politics where the national interest is more important than party interest , where co-operation wins out over confrontation , where compromise , give and take , reasonable , civilized , grown - up behaviour is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength . ”
Clegg added , “ Until today , we have been rivals : now we are colleagues .
That says a lot about the scale of the new politics which is now beginning to unfold . ”
If reading this makes you wonder , as I did , what it would take to see a similar spirit of cooperation sweep Canada ’s house of commons , it ’s for a good reason .
Canadian minority governments — i.e. , the last three consecutive ones — are strangely reluctant to form coalitions .
Instead of creating solid coalition governments in which the parties are forced to negotiate — in Cameron ’s words , creating “ a shared agenda and a shared resolve ” — Canadian parties tend only to reach across the aisle on a case - by - case basis , leading to constant brinksmanship and partisan sniping .
The exception , of course , came just six weeks after the 2008 elections when an attempted coalition between Liberals and New Democrats , with support from the Bloc Quebecois , would have ousted Stephen Harper ’s conservative minority government from power , creating a majority coalition on the Hill .
Harper , in response , prorogued parliament to allow the Liberal Party to consume itself with infighting and ultimately scuttle the coalition .
While Canadian politics has been defined by six years of minority government — six years during which the NDP has not meaningfully advanced the cause of proportional representation , by the way — British politicians have realized the power of broad support , and look set to overhaul their electoral system , too .
It ’s enough to give a Canadian a serious case of coalition envy .
In a new study , researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health ( HSPH ) have found that eating five or more servings of white rice per week was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes .
In contrast , eating two or more servings of brown rice per week was associated with a lower risk of the disease .
The researchers estimated that replacing 50 grams of white rice ( just one third of a typical daily serving ) with the same amount of brown rice would lower risk of type 2 diabetes by 16 % .
The same replacement with other whole grains , such as whole wheat and barley , was associated with a 36 % reduced risk .
The study is the first to specifically examine white rice and brown rice in relation to diabetes risk among Americans , said Qi Sun , who did the research while at HSPH and is now an instructor of medicine at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston .
" Rice consumption in the U.S. has dramatically increased in recent decades .
We believe replacing white rice and other refined grains with whole grains , including brown rice , would help lower the risk of type 2 diabetes , " said Sun .
The study appears online June 14 , 2010 , on the website of the journal Archives of Internal Medicine .
Brown rice is superior to white rice when it comes to fiber content , minerals , vitamins , and phytochemicals , and it often does not generate as large an increase in blood sugar levels after a meal .
Milling and polishing brown rice removes most vitamins and minerals .
In addition , milling strips away most of its fiber , which helps deter diabetes by slowing the rush of sugar ( glucose ) into the bloodstream .
The researchers , led by Sun , and senior author Frank Hu , professor of nutrition and epidemiology at HSPH , examined white and brown rice consumption in relation to type 2 diabetes risk in 157,463 women and 39,765 men participating in the Brigham and Women 's Hospital - based Nurses ' Health Study I and II and the Health Professionals Follow - up Study .
The researchers analyzed responses to questionnaires about diet , lifestyle , and health conditions which participants completed every four years .
They documented 5,500 cases of type 2 diabetes during 22 years of follow - up in NHS 1 participants , 2,359 cases over 14 years in NHS II participants , and 2,648 cases over 20 years in HPFS participants .
Sun and his colleagues found that the biggest consumers of white rice were less likely to have European ancestry or to smoke and more likely to have a family history of diabetes .
Eating brown rice was not associated with ethnicity but with a more health - conscious diet and lifestyle .
In the analysis , researchers adjusted for a variety of factors that could influence the results , including age , body mass index , smoking status , alcohol intake , family history of diabetes , and other dietary habits , and found that the trend of increased risk associated with high white rice consumption remained .
Because ethnicity was associated with both white rice consumption and diabetes risk , the researchers conducted a secondary analysis of white participants only and found similar results .
Because brown rice consumption was low in the study population , the researchers could not determine whether brown rice intake at much higher levels was associated with a further reduction in diabetes risk .
Substitution of other whole grains for white rice was more strongly associated with lowering diabetes risk .
This observation , said the researchers , may result from more reliable estimates based on participants ' higher consumption of whole grains other than brown rice .
The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans , released by the U.S. government , identifies grains , including rice , as one of the primary sources of carbohydrates and recommends that at least half come from whole grains .
Americans are eating more rice -- but it 's mostly white .
" From a public health point of view , whole grains , rather than refined carbohydrates , such as white rice , should be recommended as the primary source of carbohydrates for the U.S. population , " said Hu , " These findings could have even greater implications for Asian and other populations in which rice is a staple food . "
Other HSPH authors included Walter Willett , professor of epidemiology and nutrition , Donna Spiegelman , professor of epidemiologic methods , Rob van Dam , adjunct assistant professor of nutrition , Michelle Holmes , associate professor in the department of epidemiology , and Vasanti Malik , teaching fellow in the department of nutrition .
This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health .
Sun was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from Unilever Corporate Research .

Are You Unemployed Because You Are Lazy ?
Are you still unemployed ?
Obviously it is because you are lazy .
At least , many members of Congress think so , anyway .
And besides , cutting the deficit -- caused by tax cuts for the rich and massive military spending increases -- is much more important than paychecks for Americans .
The solution to the deficit -- caused by tax cuts for the rich and massive military spending increases -- is to cut back on things that help the American public .
Here is Senator Gregg on CNBC ( salary $ 174,000 ** ) , saying that unemployment checks mean people are " encouraged not to go look for work " and " do n't want to go look for work " :
And this in the news today , In Congress , spending measures meet bipartisan resistance ,
" It 's time to start paying for things , " said Rep. Kathy Dahlkemper ( D - Pa. ) , a freshman who voted for last year 's economic stimulus bill but said she is likely to oppose the next spending package , scheduled to hit the House floor Tuesday .
" We 've done some good things , but one of the best things we could do right now is get control of our fiscal house . " . . .
Dahlkemper , facing a well - funded Republican car dealer in the blue - collar district she seized from the GOP in 2008 , said businesses back home complain that they want to start hiring but are getting few applicants because Congress has repeatedly extended unemployment benefits .
and
" At some point we have to pivot " away from saving the economy and start reducing the deficit , said Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. ( D - Pa . ) .
So remember , the deficit -- caused by tax cuts for the rich and massive military spending increases -- has to be brought down and the way to bring down the deficit -- caused by tax cuts for the rich and massive military spending increases -- is to cut back on things that help the American public , and cut back on the investments in infrastructure ( the seed corn ) that bring future economic growth .
But not to do anything about the tax cuts for the rich and massive military spending increases that caused the deficit .
So if you are unemployed , just remember , in Washington the people who put $ 13.89 trillion at risk to bail out the big Wall Street firms , $ 4.71 trillion disbursed with $ 2.01 trillion still outstanding , think this is because you are lazy .

Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
Art Linkletter , the easygoing , smooth - voiced emcee famed for his long - running hosting gigs of the radio and television shows " House Party " and " People Are Funny , " and author of " Kids Say the Darndest Things , " has died , according to his spokeswoman .
Linkletter " died peacefully at home with his family on Wednesday , " a statement from the family said .
He was 97 .
" Just one month earlier , while being honored at an event , he was asked what he considered his greatest life accomplishment , " the statement said .
" He responded ' Family . ' "
Linkletter rose to fame as a radio announcer in San Diego , later becoming a program director .
In 1944 , he launched " Art Linkletter 's House Party , " a daytime CBS radio show that moved to television in 1952 and ran until 1969 .
" Kids say the darndest things , " was Linkletter 's often - repeated phrase because of his humorous interviews with children .
It became the title of his best - selling book , a country music hit and was reprised by Bill Cosby as a 1998 TV show .
The phrase began as a segment on " House Party . "
Linkletter would ask several children their thoughts on various topics ; their responses were often hilariously absurd .
" I was Oprah before there was Oprah , " he once told The Wall Street Journal .
Flowers were placed on Linkletter 's star on Hollywood 's Walk of Fame Wednesday afternoon .
His nighttime show , " People Are Funny , " started on radio in 1942 and ran on NBC television from 1954 to 1961 .
According to Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh 's " The Complete Directory to Primetime Network and Cable Shows , 1946 - Present , " the show featured everyday guests who would be interviewed by Linkletter and then asked to do a stunt .
The result for those who failed at the stunt was often a pie in the face or being splashed by water .
Linkletter also hosted a short - lived quiz show , " The Art Linkletter Show , " in 1963 .
At its height , Linkletter 's fame was notable enough to make him part of Milton Bradley 's " Game of Life , " which featured Linkletter 's endorsement and his photo on the game 's $ 100,000 bill .
His 1960 biography was called " Confessions of a Happy Man . "
But the host 's own life was touched by a famous tragedy .
In 1969 , his daughter Diane -- just 20 at the time -- jumped to her death from a sixth - floor apartment in Hollywood .
Linkletter blamed the death on LSD , though the drug use was never confirmed .
Linkletter became an ardent anti-drug crusader , releasing a hit record , " We Love You , Call Collect , " which won a Grammy Award .
Of his five children , two others also predeceased Linkletter : son Robert died in a 1980 auto accident , and another son , Jack , died of lymphoma in 2007 .
Linkletter is survived by his wife of 75 years , Lois , and two daughters , Dawn Griffin and Sharon Linkletter .
Linkletter was born Gordon Arthur Kelly in Moose Jaw , Saskatchewan , on July 17 , 1912 .
Orphaned as an infant , he was adopted by traveling evangelist John Linkletter and his wife , Mary .
After a short stint on Wall Street -- he was a typist at an investment bank at the time of the 1929 Crash , he told the WSJ -- he eventually moved to San Diego and attended college at San Diego State University .
While in college , he took a job as a staff announcer at CBS affiliate KGB - AM .
Linkletter was an astute businessman .
The owner of Linkletter Enterprises , he owned millions of acres in Australia and was a sheep and cattle rancher .
He also owned oil wells and was a spokesman for several products .
CNN 's Todd Leopold and Jack Hannah contributed to this report .

FNC contributor John Stossel was on Fox News ’ America Live today where he voiced his agreement with Kentucky GOP Senate candidate Rand Paul that part of the civil rights ought to be repealed so that businesses can discriminate based on race .
Stossel said , “ It ’s time now to repeal that part of the law because private businesses ought to get to discriminate … it should be their right to be racist . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

When FNC ’s Megyn Kelly asked Stossel if he agreed with Paul ’s comments on the Civil Rights Act , he answered , “ Totally .
I ’m in total agreement with Rand Paul .
You can call it public accommodation , and it is , but it ’s a private business .
And if a private business wants to say , “ We do n’t want any blond anchorwomen or mustached guys , ” it ought to be their right .
Are we going to say to the black students ’ association they have to take white people , or the gay softball association they have to take straight people ?
We should have freedom of association in America . ”
Stossel also claimed that government was behind Jim Crow laws , “ Absolutely .
But those — Jim Crow — those were government rules .
Government was saying we have white and black drinking fountains .
That ’s very different from saying private people ca n’t discriminate . ”
Stossel also made this long disproven argument that the free market will not tolerate discrimination , “ Because eventually they would have lost business .
The free market competition would have cleaned the clocks of the people who did n’t serve most customers . ”
When asked if he knew this for certain Stossel admitted that he did n’t know .
The Stossel dropped the bombshell that he believes that people have the right to be racist , “ And I would go further than he was willing to go , as he just issued the statement , and say it ’s time now to repeal that part of the law because private businesses ought to get to discriminate .
And I wo n’t wo n’t ever go to a place that ’s racist and I will tell everybody else not to and I ’ll speak against them .
But it should be their right to be racist . ”
Only the Republican Party could blow and election by arguing against the 46 year old Civil Rights Act .
I think Rand Paul is an ideologically pure complete political novice who got caught in a trap of his own construction , but the rest of the GOP including Fox News should know better than to touch this radio active issue with a 1,000 foot pole .
This is what happens when a political party starts picking their candidates on the basis of ideological purity .
The problem is that this should not even be a discussion within the GOP .
When freaking Jim DeMint says he needs to have a talk with Rand Paul about his position on Civil Rights , this is a real problem .
Ladies and Gents , welcome to the issue that is going to haunt the Republicans all through the 2010 campaign .
Remember , when Democrats actually feared the GOP ?
Now , this is a Party that is being offered victory on a silver platter , and they ca n’t get out of their own way to take advantage of it .
I would like to ask our Republican friends , how ’s that Tea Party working out for you now ?

Klunk Garden is a bizarre art installation createt by the Austrian art collective known as Gelitin .
It ’s basically a Zen rock garden with various human parts coming out of it .
You ’ve probably seen some photos of the Klunk Garden before ( I know I have ) , but they never came with some info about what exactly you were looking at .
Gelitin is made up of four Austrian artists who like to shock the art world as often as they can .
Their Klunk Garden was unveilled last year , in Tokyo , and combined the traditional Zen Buddhist garden , with some human parts coming out of it .
The most disturbing thing about it was that those were the behinds , heads , and hands of real people standing below the art installation .
The Klunk Garden was widely interpreted as a bodily attack on Zen Buddhism , as the naked body parts interrupt the fluid perfection of the raked lines of rocks .

Investigators have arrested a Pakistani army major linked to the prime suspect in the botched attempt to bomb New York City ’s Times Square early this month , Pakistani law enforcement sources said Tuesday .
The major ’s involvement with suspect Faisal Shahzad , who was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport as he attempted to fly to Dubai , United Arab Emirates , remains unclear .
Law enforcement sources said the major had met Shahzad , a naturalized U.S. citizen of Pakistani descent , in Islamabad , the capital , and was in cellphone contact with him .
The major ’s arrest marks the first time someone in Pakistan ’s military establishment has been directly linked to the case .
The sources would not say when the alleged meeting and phone calls between Shahzad and the major took place , or what was discussed .
They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the investigation .
The twist in the case comes as Pakistani authorities have learned more about the 30 - year - old Shahzad ’s links with the Pakistani Taliban , the militant group suspected of helping him carry out the attempted bombing .

Another suspect being held by Pakistani authorities is a Pakistani Taliban member who appeared to play the role of liaison between Shahzad and the militant group .
The Taliban member has told Pakistani intelligence agents that he met Shahzad three times last summer , Pakistani law enforcement sources said .
At one of those meetings , the Taliban member gave Shahzad an undisclosed amount of money because Shahzad had said he was running out of cash , according to the sources .
U.S. officials familiar with the case have said that the Taliban gave Shahzad roughly $ 15,000 to pay for the attempted bombing .
The Taliban member ’s account appears to corroborate assertions by U.S. investigators that the Pakistani Taliban played a significant role in the events that led up to Shahzad ’s attempt to detonate an SUV loaded with propane tanks and fertilizer in Times Square on May 1 .
Pakistani authorities at first had been skeptical of Shahzad ’s claims of Taliban assistance , saying their investigators had uncovered no link between the militant group and Shahzad , now in custody in the United States .
And although U.S. officials have thought the idea for the attack was probably Shahzad ’s , evidence is mounting that the Taliban was deeply involved in the plot .

The Taliban initially claimed responsibility for the attack , though later the group backed away from that claim and disavowed even knowing Shahzad .
Taliban involvement in the failed bombing would mark the first time that the militant group has carried out an attack outside its homelands in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
In a video released this month , Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mahsud expressed a clear desire to strike targets in the United States in retaliation for the drone strike last year that killed his predecessor , Baitullah Mahsud .
Pakistani investigators are also looking into a trip that Shahzad and the suspected Taliban liaison took from Islamabad to the town of Hasan Abdal in August , Pakistani law enforcement sources said .
The pair stayed at the house of a friend of Shahzad ’s father , Bahar ul - Haq , a retired vice air marshal in the air force .
The trip is one of several journeys Shahzad made in 2009 during his last stay in Pakistan , a time when investigators believe the Pakistani American crafted his plan to attack Times Square .

Shahzad , who appeared Tuesday in court in New York , has told U.S. investigators that he went to North Waziristan , where he met with Taliban leaders and got training in bombmaking .
Pakistani investigators and U.S. officials say they believe Shahzad went to Mohmand , another region within Pakistan ’s tribal belt along the Afghan border .
Although Mohmand is also regarded as sanctuary for Taliban militants , it is North Waziristan that has become extremist groups ’ hub in the tribal areas .
Pakistani Taliban leaders and militants escaping military offensives elsewhere have sought refuge in North Waziristan , as have extremists from Al Qaeda , the Afghan Taliban and an array of Punjabi militant organizations .
Pakistani law enforcement sources say Shahzad got three to five days of training in Mohmand from the Taliban , though they do not say what that training entailed .
U.S. officials said White House national security advisor James L. Jones and CIA Director Leon E. Panetta were in Pakistan to emphasize an Obama administration message of unity with local allies who oppose terrorism .

Welcome to the world of Feed .
It 's perfect summer apocalypse reading .

Though Seanan McGuire has already written a number of books , Feed is her first novel under the pen name Mira Grant .
This fast - paced undead thriller will be great for people who enjoy their zombie slaughtering with a hearty slice of social commentary .
Here 's the book jacket setup :
It is 2034 , twenty years after the Rise .
Bioengineering has finally found cures to the common cold and cancer , in the form of tweaked viruses .
Unfortunately , mixing the two cures led to an unexpected side effect : reanimation of the dead .
Advertisement
In a slight twist on the usual zombie trope , everyone is already infected with a dormant form of the Kellis - Amberlee zombification virus , due to a pre-Rise world - wide aerosolization effort .
" Amplification " occurs either when someone dies the first time , or is bitten by any mammal over forty pounds possessing the activated virus , which means zombie raccoons are out there .
And giraffes .
Oh gods the giraffes .
The story begins with our heroes , bloggers Georgia and Shaun Mason , suffering a zombie attack in Santa Cruz .
Here 's where we learn that these zombies are n't just stupid shambling husks of rotting flesh .
Individually they indeed are your typical undead walker , but their hunting instincts grow exponentially with each zombie nearby .
There 's a kind of collective zombie consciousness that 's forming .

Feed is packed with incredible worldbuilding .
You can tell much research was put into making the Kellis - Amberlee virus feel very real , which is great from a science dork standpoint , but Grant also fleshes out the extreme changes in society that occurred post - Rise .
Animal legislation , inspired by Georgia and Shaun 's adoptive parents , plays a vital role in the story .
Hazard zones ( Level 1 through 10 ! ) and blood tests are a way of life .
Social gatherings practically do n't exist , as any large gathering of humans is a tempting target for roving packs of the dead .
Political rallies are conducted almost exclusively via television and live webcasts .
Journalism has completely changed : Faith in traditional media outlets almost completely died when CNN and the like dismissed the zombie uprising as " pranks and teenagers in bad makeup " , bloggers were the only ones people could count on to provide live on - scene coverage by those risking their lives to make sure the truth was delivered .
Blogging is an almost legitimate form of journalism in Feed .

You might notice that I have been talking about the background of the story a lot more than the story itself .
I 'm estimating that about 60 % of the book is pure background , with 20 % dialogue and 20 % actual plot .
The real meat of the plot starts when the bloggers are invited to go on the campaign trail with presidential candidate Senator Ryman .
There 's a conspiracy plot that reveals itself slowly over next 600 pages as they cover Senator Ryman 's campaign , but honestly , it was n't all that surprising .
The action scenes ( crossbows ! ) and setting were what kept me going all the way to its very emotional end , which I think is a testament to how well - written the characters and setting are .
The first in the proposed Newsflesh trilogy , Feed is a thought - provoking and entertaining read that makes me eager to see what Grant will serve in her next novel , Blackout .
Supposedly , it will feature epileptic teacup bulldogs .
Ca n't wait .
Last week , Cumberland 's David Kotok made headlines with his piece on Oil Slickonomics , which predicted that in the ugliest case scenario , the Gulf oil spill could destroy the economy of the gulf for a generation and push us into another recession .
Well , we 're not there yet says Kotok , but we have gone from bad to worse .
He writes :
Within days we will have reached the second level of damages in the Gulf of Mexico .
Under our “ worse ” scenario the total will be in the many tens of billions before this is all over .
There are now early reports of “ tar balls ” washing up on beaches .
Damage is now witnessed in Alabama , Louisiana , and Mississippi .
NOAA has expanded the no-fishing zone to about “ 4.5 percent of Gulf of Mexico federal waters . ”
The original closure boundaries , which took effect Sunday , May 2 , encompassed “ less than three percent . ”
Readers please note that this event is still mostly confined to United States “ federal waters , ” which are under NOAA jurisdiction .
International claims are a more complex financial liability for BP and its partners .
So far , BP has offered US - based fishermen a one - month - pay settlement package .
This is being routinely rejected , according to the professional fishermen we have been able to reach .
If this spillage continues , as we project under our second and “ worse ” scenario , and IF it can be limited to that scenario and does n’t worsen to “ ugliest , ” the ultimate loss of income to fisherman will continue over many , many months or even years .
According to NOAA , “ There are 3.2 million recreational fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico region who took 24 million fishing trips in 2008 .
Commercial fishermen in the Gulf harvested more than 1 billion pounds of finfish and shellfish in 2008 . ”
BP ’s offer of one month ’s pay is a pittance when compared with the ultimate damages that will be suffered by the fishing industry .
Some readers have asked about the federal fund that is designed to pay for cleanups of oil spills .
It is funded by an eight - cent - per - barrel tax and is wholly inadequate for this type of catastrophic event .
In the wake of the BP explosion , three Senators have offered a bill to broaden the scope of the fund and raise the tax .
Here 's what Kotok wrote May 2 in the original piece on the " worse " scenario :
The containment attempts fail and oil spews for months , until a new well can successfully be drilled to a depth of 13000 feet below the 5000 - foot - deep ocean floor , and then concrete and mud are injected into the existing ruptured well until it is successfully closed and sealed .
Work on this approach is already commencing .
Timeframe for success is at least three months .
Note the new well will have to come within about 20 feet of the existing point where the original well enters the reservoir at a distance of 3.5 miles from the surface drilling rig .
Damages by this time may be measured in the hundreds of billions .
Cleanup will take many , many years .
Tourism , fishing , all related industries may be fundamentally changed for as much as a generation .
Spread to Mexico and other Gulf geography is possible .

Kratom : A Medicinal and Recreational AllyBackground : I have been working with leaves of the tree Mitragyna speciosa ( kratom ) for a couple years now , and wish to share what I have learned of this wonderful plant .
I am a 24 year old male weighing 128 pounds .
I take no medications , but usually smoke marijuana and drink yerba mate on a daily basis .
I have been using psychoactive substances since the age of 14 , starting with marijuana and alcohol ( and caffeine even earlier , around age 3 ) .
My main area of interest drug - wise is the psychedelics , and I have used the commonly available tryptamines ( mushrooms , LSD , DMT and 5 - MeO - DMT ) as well as some phenethylamines ( MDMA , MDA , 2C - I , 2C - E , 2C - B and DO- x compounds ) and some dissociatives ( Salvia divinorum , nitrous oxide , ketamine and DXM ) .
I tend to avoid the more addictive and damaging drugs such as tobacco , cocaine , amphetamines and synthetic opiates or pharmaceuticals .
I have some experience with opium and poppy tea , as well as codeine ( tylenol 3s ) .
The first time I tried kratom , I can honestly say I did not notice the effects much .
I threw a small handful of leaves in with a bunch of other plants ( passionflower , damiana , catnip and a few others ) .
I got a general relaxed , calm feeling , but it was hard for me to separate what effect the kratom had amongst all those other plants .
I tried smoking some of the leaves also , and got a very mild spaced - out feeling , not that exciting .
So initially , I wrote kratom off as weak and ineffective .
Sometime later I got another bag of leaves and started experimenting with the plant in tea form , on its own .
I soon realized there was a noticeable psychoactive effect , which can be summed up as feeling simultaneously stimulated and relaxed .
Kratom tea makes me feel talkative , social and energized , but at the same time mellow and chilled out .
The effect of this herb for me was subtle but noticeable .
As with many peoples first few times using marijuana , one has to have a feeling of what it is like to be high on kratom in order to recognize the effects .
Over the last two years , kratom has become one of my favourite plant allies .
In terms of frequency of consumption , I now use kratom on two to four days out of the week .
This puts it third , behind yerba mate and marijuana , for how often I consume the plant .
These days I generally take kratom for one or two days , and then take a break of a day or two to let my tolerance die down .
Occasionally I take longer breaks .
Although I enjoy the effects of kratom , I do not find it particularly addictive .
It is an easy plant to leave behind , when the bag has run out and I dont order another for three weeks , or if I just want to take a break I do not feel a compulsion or desire for the plant .
Methods of preparation : I have worked with kratom leaves in two forms : dry , crushed leaf and a micro grind  where the dry leaves are ground to a very fine powder .
The dry crushed leaf and the powdered micro grind leaf are both nice , but I use different methods of ingestion for them .
Making tea with powdered micro-grind leaf :
This is my favourite way of enjoying kratom .
I take a large mason jar , and put my desired amount of powdered kratom in the bottom ( usually a heaping teaspoon to a rounded tablespoon , I will discuss this more in the dosage section below ) .
I like to add a few sprigs of mint , for flavour and to help settle the stomach as kratom can cause nausea at higher doses ( more on this below ) .
I add boiling water to the jar , seal it and let it sit for about 20 minutes until the jar and tea are cool enough to drink comfortably .
Sometimes I top the jar up with freshly brewed yerba mate ( more on this in the combinations section below ) .
When I drink the tea , I swirl the liquid in the jar before each sip , thus suspending the powdered plant material .
In this way , as I drink the tea I am also consuming all the plant material .
This is nice , because I get an initial effect from the liquid tea , and the alkaloids remaining in the powdered leaf come on a little slower as the leaf digests in my stomach .
This method provides a long - lasting buzz with a slow onset and slow drop off .
It takes about an hour and a half for the tea to finish coming up from the time I am done drinking it , and the effects last for five or six hours .
Dry , crushed leaf can either be made into tea or chewed .
When making tea , I usually would boil the leaves three times for ten to fifteen minutes , and then combine and drink the three liquid extracts .
It is good to triple boil the leaves this way , because the alkaloids in kratom do not extract very well with just a simple steeping .
A triple boiled tea of the leaves is much stronger ( and more bitter tasting ! ) than simply steeping the leaves .
If simply steeping in hot water , I would usually re-steep the leaves two or three times to ensure getting all of the actives .
Since the alkaloids are all in liquid solution , a tea made this way comes on pretty fast , and drops off faster than making a tea with powdered leaf .
The main thing here for me is not to drink the tea too fast , otherwise I will get nauseous ( more on this below ) .
The tea finishes coming up around an hour after I finish drinking it , and the effects last about five hours .
Chewing the dry , crushed leaf is quite a bit different from making either of the tea methods discussed above .
Traditionally the leaves are chewed ( usually fresh leaves ) to allow workers to do hard , physical labour .
I find that compared to either of the tea methods , chewing the leaves has a more stimulating but shorter lasting effect .
I take a small to medium sized pinch and place the leaves in my mouth , letting my saliva moistening them and then slowing chewing for five to ten minutes , gradually swallowing the chewed up leaves .
Kratom has a drying effect , after a few minutes of chewing my mouth can become very dry and so I drink a little hot water or tea to moisten my mouth , and also to activate the leaves in my stomach .
The effects of chewing are noticeable within five minutes of starting to chew the leaves , and peak around an hour into the experience .
Chewing the leaves can make me feel very high , very spaced out .
I would say this is the most noticeably psychoactive way of using the leaves .
I usually have lots of energy for an hour and a half , and then the effects drop off and become more sedative and relaxing .
Usually after an hour or an hour and a half , when the effects are declining , I feel a desire to chew some more leaves and get that rising , stimulant feeling again .
When chewing the leaves , each mouthful uses only a gram or two of leaf material .
However , with multiple chewing sessions over the course of a day I may end up using more leaf than with a tea method .
Nausea :
One of the most important things I have learned about kratom , is that if I take too much , too fast , I will get nauseous .
I have heard and read a lot of negative reports of kratom use , and almost all of these people took too much , too fast .
The effects are pleasant at a high dose , but not overwhelming or all - involving , so the temptation to take more is there hoping for a further increase in effect .
If I go over my limits with kratom , I will start to feel dizzy .
This is my warning sign , to stop right away .
Any dizzyness means I am in danger of getting nauseous .
The effects of kratom ( particularly in powdered leaf tea form ) will continue to creep up on me for a while after I have finished consumption .
So , a mild dizzyness can quickly turn into feeling very dizzy and nauseous , as well as having hot and cold flashes , and sweating .
Lying down and not moving much can sometimes help me ride out the nausea .
More often , if I have taken too much too fast , the nausea will provoke vomitting .
The need to vomit from kratom comes quickly and without much warning , and when it comes there is no resisting .
I have to say , though , that getting sick from kratom is not that bad .
If I get nauseous , I will quickly and relatively painlessly void my stomach contents .
Usually I only vomit once , and the dizzyness and hot - cold flashes dont last too much longer after getting sick .
Within a half hour or an hour , I have ridden out the nausea and the effects become pleasant again .
The key to not getting nauseous on kratom is to ingest my dose slowly .
When drinking the tea , I usually drink it over the course of two to four hours , the slower the better .
If I take my normal dose all at once , I am very likely to get sick from it .
When chewing the leaves , it is a good idea for me to wait at least a half hour before chewing more .
Like I said , a slight feeling of dizzyness can become severe nausea with little or no warning .
As recommended with most opiate - type substances or alcohol , it helps to have some food in my stomach prior to ingestion .
Having food in my stomach slows the rate of absorption , whereas taking the kratom on an empty stomach comes on too fast sometimes .
Eating after taking some kratom may have the opposite effect , by getting my digestion going I may become nauseous , particularly if I eat a heavy meal after a strong dose of kratom .
Drinking any kind of hot liquid , after taking a tea of powdered leaf or chewing the leaves , will activate the alkaloids present in the leaf material in my stomach and provide a second wave of effects .
One time in particular I remember , I had chewed only three medium pinches of kratom leaf a couple hours previously .
I was not really feeling much anymore , and considered myself more - or - less baseline .
When I ate a large meal and drank a couple glasses of hot tea , the kratom kicked in again , very hard .
I suddenly became nauseous and threw up most of my lovely dinner , and then spent the next couple hours being really , really spaced out .
I would not have wanted to operate a motor vehicle , or even walk around during this period .
That s how strong the effects came back , and totally unexpectedly !
So watch out , for that second wave , if eating and drinking hot liquids after taking kratom .
Dosage : I should say that the dosage guidelines outlined here are by no means an exact science .
Each batch of kratom has varying potency , in terms of the alkaloid content and also the ratio of the different alkaloids in the leaf .
Some varieties of kratom are more potent than others , and may have a differing balance of stimulating and relaxing effects .
Also , individual sensitivity to kratom varies dramatically .
I know one man who gets nauseous off as little as one level teaspoon ( 2 - 3 grams ) of kratom powder , whereas another man I know commonly takes 30 - 40 grams of kratom in a matter of minutes , and at his most ridiculous chewed around 90 grams ( yes , 90 grams ! ) over the course of a day .
Finally , tolerance to kratom builds rapidly if the plant is used on consecutive days , and even my one or two days on , one or two days off level of use means I have a degree of tolerance to the effects .
So , the dosage guidelines below are for myself , using the powdered micro-grind leaf made into tea , of an average strength batch of Indonesian leaf .
I like Indo leaf because it has a nice balance of the stimulating and relaxing effects , whereas some other strains for me are too stimulating , or too sedative / narcotic feeling .
Threshold dose , 2 - 3 grams or roughly one level teaspoon :
This is the dose at which I will begin to feel the effects of kratom .
At this low dose , I mostly notice a sense of energy and stimulation .
There is a slight change in headspace , I will feel a little bit elevated  akin to drinking a STRONG brew of yerba mate .
There is some mild euphoria and I am generally in a good mood .
I also notice an increase in my desire to communicate , words flow smoothly and easily .
Without prior experience at this dose level , some individuals may not notice the effects because they are quite subtle .
For me , this dose does not in any way interfere with my normal , everyday activities .
There is no sense of being intoxicated or incapable .
Mild dose , 5 grams or roughly one heaping teaspoon :
This is a dose at which the effects of kratom are quite noticeable , but will not get me into any trouble .
There is a pronounced elevation of mood , whatever I am doing I just feel mellow and happy to be doing it .
I often use kratom at work , because the moderate stimulation allows me to focus and work productively .
I am able to do routine lab work for several hours without getting bored or tired , instead I find myself content to be working .
This dose level is good for any kind of work , from hard physical labour to reading or writing papers ( or this report ! ) .
It is also a good dose for sitting calmly and meditating .
Primarily it serves to focus my mind .
Towards the latter stages of the experience the stimulation fades away but the calm , relaxed feeling persists .
When introducing other people to kratom , I find this is a good dose to start with , although it will still be too much for some individuals .
Aches and pains , or nasal congestion are eased .
This is a good medicinal dose because it is active but not too strongly psychoactive .
Moderate dose , 10 grams or roughly one rounded tablespoon :
This is my normal dose of kratom , when I have no tolerance .
As long as I take this amount slowly , I will not get nauseous ( unless I have a new batch of untested and higher than average potency ) .
Any dose over ten grams becomes sticky territory for me , with the potential for nausea .
At ten grams , there is a very nice balance of stimulating and relaxing qualities .
The elevation of mood noticed at five grams becomes stronger and more euphoric .
I feel somewhat high and spaced out , almost like the initial alert sensations of mushrooms or LSD .
There is a definate change in my headspace .
I would also compare it to a threshold dose of MDMA , in that I feel energized and very positive .
There is a warm feeling throughout my body , which feels relaxed and comfortable .
Any aches and pains or fatigue is taken away , and if my nasal passages are stuffy from allergies or sickness , they will clear up completely .
I usually use this amount for working , because I can drink the tea slowly over three or four hours and the effects will last for the whole work day .
Towards the latter stages of the experience , there is a more pronounced sedative / narcotic effect compared to a five gram dose .
The effects are somewhat hypnotic , I may find myself five hours into the experience just wanting to lie down and drift gently .
I could compare this effect to drinking a reasonable amount of poppy tea , except without the feeling of heaviness and lack of caring that for me accompanies the use of opium poppies .
I would also compare it to around the fifth hour of psilocybin containing mushrooms , when I have dropped down from the plateau but am still altered .
Somewhat psychedelic , but not strong enough to be considered tripping .
It is dreamier and more relaxed feeling than mushrooms at five hours .
There are some mild visual effects , mostly heightened colours .
Strong dose , 15 grams or roughly one heaping tablespoon :
If I want to get really kratomified , or if it is my second day in a row using kratom and I need a higher dose to offset the tolerance , then fifteen grams is where its at .
This is also where the tea starts getting pretty bitter , even by my standards ( I like the taste of kratom and dont use any sweetener in it ) .
If I take this dose too fast , nausea is very likely .
At this higher dose , the euphoria and mood elevation becomes somewhat more pronounced than at ten grams .
During the initial stages of the experience I still feel talkative and social , and somewhat energized , comparable to a low dose or the initial come - up of MDMA .
The main difference between a ten gram dose and a fifteen gram dose is that the opiate - like effect becomes more pronounced .
The stimulation quickly fades and is replaced by a hypnotic , trance - like state known as  the land of nod by opiate users .
There is a dream - like feeling , and I find myself wanting to lie quietly in bed , just drifting .
The effect is somewhat dissociative , comparable to a low dose of magic mushrooms if one lies down and directs the experience inward .
Heavy dose , 20 to 30 grams :
This is as high as I have taken the dosage of kratom .
A heavy dose for me , would be making two jars of kratom , each containing ten or fifteen grams , over the course of a day .
I would still drink each jar slowly to avoid nausea , but no matter how slowly I drink it , I still often get nauseous at this dose level .
I only take the dosage this high if I have used kratom the day before , and thus have a level of tolerance to its effect .
If someone who is unfamiliar with the effects of kratom and having no tolerance to opiate - type drugs took this dose , they are almost guaranteed to become nauseous and likely to vomit .
I would say that a heavy dose of kratom does not take me much deeper than a fifteen gram dose .
The euphoria does not become more pronounced , although the nodding out sensation may be a little stronger .
Mainly drinking the second jar of kratom serves to extend the duration of effects .
I can drink one jar in the morning , and another in the evening and be kratomified all day .
The effects are quite sedative towards the later stages of the experience , making the transition to sleep easily .
My one friend who loves kratom even more than me has taken the dosage range a little higher , often taking 30 to 40 grams in the course of a day .
Sometimes taking 20 to 30 grams all at once , by adding just a little water to the powder and swilling the thick stuff down .
He told me it was possible to ride out  the nausea , and that this high of a dose for him was extremely euphoric after the nausea passed .
Personally , I feel no need to push the dosage any higher than 30 grams , simply because I dont like getting the nauseous feeling .
His highest reported dose over the course of a day was 90 grams , via the chewing dry crushed leaf method .
In a work environment , he outcompeted all the other employees doing heavy , physical labour over an eight hour period .
I guess I can understand why this plant is traditionally chewed to faciliate hard manual labour for long hours .
Tolerance :
There is a fast buildup of tolerance to the effects of kratom .
If I take a normal dose on the first day , I usually have to increase my dose by 50 % the next day to get a similar level of effect .
On the third day , increasing the dose does not seem to offset the tolerance very much .
I would usually just use the same dose as on the second day , but knowing that the quality and duration of the effects received will be diminished significantly .
I have occasionally used kratom four days in a row , but by the fourth day I might as well not have bothered .
There is very little of the normal enjoyable effects by the fourth day , and sometimes I actually found the opposite effect .
On the fourth day I would sometimes feel disphoria and irritability after drinking kratom .
Aftereffects : Kratom is a pretty innocuous substance , but is not totally without aftereffects .
Unlike traditional opiate drugs , there is no significant withdrawal effect from kratom even after using for four days in a row .
I definitely noticed a physical addiction and withdrawal effect to opium poppies when I used them more than once a week , but I have never found this with kratom and can simply stop using the plant whenever I want .
Usually tolerance becomes so high after four days that I would simply stop using kratom , because the quality of effects diminishes rapidly .
After a strong or heavy dose of kratom ( 15 grams or more ) I usually feel a little lethargic the next day , preferring to sleep in and finding rising from bed a little harder than normal .
Some days after a strong or heavy dose I would feel very energized and in a really positive mood , but other times I feel a little tired and irritable .
Kratom is an excellent decongestant , but I often notice a rebound effect , where my nasal congestion will be worse for a day or two after using kratom .
Medicinal properties : To this point I have discussed mainly the psychoactive properties of kratom , but now I would like to turn my attention to some of the many medicinal properties that this plant has .
It is a wonderful ally to use in many situations .
For coughs and colds , kratom is better than any cough and cold medicine I could buy at a pharmacy .
Kratom is an excellent decongestant , providing a more effective and longer lasting relief of stuffy noses and sinus congestion than pseudoephedrine , phenylephrine and their ilk .
Kratom also takes all the little aches and pains away from my body , and provides a beautiful soothing sensation .
It is easy to fall asleep and get the rest I need to get better .
Kratom makes a cough and cold so much easier for me to deal with .
For allergies , again the decongestant effects of kratom come into play .
I believe kratom may actually have an anti-histamine effect .
I am somewhat allergic to cats as well as heavy pollen loads , and on days that are particularly bad kratom clears my sinuses and relieves my red , itchy eyes also .
It seems to actually block that itching response .
Unlike normal opiates , even heavy doses of kratom do not make me itchy .
Since the itching response to opiates is histamine - mediated , I theorize that kratom is an anti-histamine .
Kratom is a good analgesic , and I have used or administered it to others for such diverse complaints as general soreness in the body , sprained ankles , dislocated shoulders , blown knees , wasp stings and menstrual cramps .
In every case it has provided fast and effective relief .
My partner and I have begun exploring kratom as an antidepressant .
We have been encapsulating kratom powder mixed with maca flour and holy basil leaf , which both have mood stabilizing properties .
The goal with this mixture is to have capsules that can be taken on days when someone is feeling down or depressed .
The amounts of kratom used are around the threshold level .
The combination of these three herbs gives an immediate elevation of mood and helps stabilize mood at this new positive vibration .
Due to the tolerance factor and potential rebound effect , we would not take these capsules more than two days in a row .
Combinations :
There are a few substances which I really enjoy combining with kratom , and a few others that are in my opinion to be avoided , which I would like to discuss .
Towards the eighth hour of an LSD trip , it is nice to take a moderate dose of kratom .
This soothes some of the reintegration jitters , allowing me to gentle down from the LSD high nicely , while at the same time spicing up those last four hours which can drag a little sometimes .
As the kratom wears off the LSD is almost done too , and it is easier for me to go to sleep .
There is a special synergy between kratom and MDMA .
Taking some kratom before taking the MDMA will increase the effect of the MDMA , allowing me to take a lower dose than normal .
I have abused MDMA in the past and thus anything that helps me get a better effect from a lower ( and therefore less harmful ) dose is of value to me .
Taking kratom towards the tail end of the MDMA experience soothes all the rough edges beautifully , and brings back a bit of the warm , fuzzy rolling feeling .
Even drinking kratom the day after taking MDMA will make me feel that warm , empathogenic feeling a bit .
Alcohol is a substance I am cautious about using with kratom .
Drinking before or after taking kratom makes nausea much more likely , even if using low doses of either substance .
I have learned to never have more than one or two drinks , before or after using kratom .
In general I avoid hard alcohol or beer with kratom , but there is a special quality to having a glass of red wine after a low to moderate dose of kratom .
The red wine seems to act as fuel for the kratom , increasing the euphoric properties and paradoxically also increasing the stimulating qualities of the kratom .
Normally red wine makes me pretty sleepy , but after kratom is makes me feel much more bubbly and social .
Kratom is also a good hangover cure , not that I usually drink so much as to get a hangover .
For me , drinking kratom usually kills any desire for alcohol that I may have , and vice versa having a beer after two days of kratom kills any desire I may have to try for that less - than - exciting third day on kratom .
Tobacco is a substance I avoid like the plague , and this is doubly true after drinking kratom .
Tobacco on its own makes me dizzy , head - spins and a bit nauseous .
Kratom amplifies this effect significantly .
Once at a party I got passed a joint which had tobacco in it , unfortunately not disclosed to me prior to smoking .
I got so dizzy and nauseous off just one toke that I had to lie down , and eventually went home .
The dizzyness and nausea lasted three or four hours , and for me the party was ruined .
I have heard from others who more regularly smoke tobacco that they get a similar effect .
In general , combining kratom with any kind of stimulant will bring out the stimulating qualities of the kratom , and combining it with any kind of sedative will bring out the sedating qualities of the kratom .
Ahh , kratom .
Bitter green drink of the gods .

Insurgents have attacked Nato forces in eastern Afghanistan .
Several attackers were killed in the Taliban attack on a base at an airfield outside Jalalabad , near the border with Pakistan .
Gunmen set off a car bomb and fired rocket - propelled grenades , wounding two soldiers , Nato said .
The US Senate has confirmed US Gen David Petraeus as the new commander of the campaign in Afghanistan .
The general earlier warned of an " industrial - strength insurgency " in the country , saying that fighting might " get more intense in the next few months " .
His appointment follows the dramatic departure of Gen Stanley McChrystal last week .
In another development , UK Defence Secretary Liam Fox warned of further coalition casualties to come while stressing the dangers of withdrawing troops prematurely .
Commando - style raid
The attack began at 0730 local time ( 0300 GMT ) , with insurgents attacking the airport from different directions .
Analysis
The attack on the military base near Jalalabad airport was planned and co-ordinated , a sign that after nine years of fighting in Afghanistan , the Taliban still have plenty of fight in them , and are growing more sophisticated as the war goes on .
But the International Security and Assistance Force ( Isaf ) takes a different view .
This attack was successfully repelled , and only the insurgents died .
Civilian and Isaf injuries were minor .
The base is shared by Afghan and international troops , and Afghans , say Isaf , are increasingly taking lead in protecting the area , and attacking insurgents .
A Nato spokesman said the perimeter of the base had not been breached .
An Afghan soldier and one international service member were wounded .
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said six suicide attackers had taken part in the assault .
Eight insurgents died in the ensuing gun battles , the Associated Press news agency reports .
The attack is yet another example of the increasingly sophisticated assaults favoured by the Taliban , says the BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Kabul .
These commando - style operations are increasing in numbers , and often result in higher civilian and military casualties .
A total of 100 Nato troops serving in Afghanistan were killed in June , making it the deadliest month for the alliance since the US - led invasion of 2001 .
An Afghan army - led operation is taking place in nearby Kunar , where 600 troops are attempting to rout about 250 insurgents thought to have links to al - Qaeda .
' Trans- national terror ' threat
Jalalabad is one of Nato 's largest bases in Afghanistan , after Kandahar in the south and Bagram near Kabul .
[ Premature withdrawal ] would be a shot in the arm to jihadists everywhere Liam Fox , UK defence secretary
Both of those bases have been attacked by insurgents in recent months .
Speaking in London , Mr Fox said the coalition must be prepared for increased insurgent violence .
" We are bound to meet resistance and increased violence until the Afghans believe that we are gaining the upper hand and we are willing to see this through , " he said .
" That is why we are likely to see an increase in the number of coalition casualties over this summer . "
" We must hold our nerve , maintain our resolve , and have the resilience to see the job through , " he added .
Mr Fox argued that were coalition forces to leave now , the world would see " the return of the destructive forces of trans - national terror " .
He identified the risk of civil war in Afghanistan creating a security vacuum and the " destabilisation of Pakistan with potentially unthinkable regional , and possibly nuclear , consequences " .
To withdraw prematurely would mean giving " a shot in the arm to jihadists everywhere , re-energising violent radical and extreme Islamism " , Mr Fox said .
Wallace ’s two - sided attitude toward mass culture makes him determined , as Lipsky puts it , “ not to enjoy the process of being celebritified . ”
He ’s concerned about the effects of fame on his work .
“ To have written a book about how seductive image is , and how very many ways there are to get seduced off any kind of meaningful path , because of the way the culture is now .
But what if , you know , what if I become this grotesque parody of just what the book is about ?
And of course , this stuff drives me nuts . ”
Lipsky ’s aware that he ’s an avatar of the star - making pop culture about which Wallace is so ambivalent .
He ’s ambivalent too , sincere in his regard for Wallace , yet also a compliant chip in the mass media ’s vacuous , reductionist , gossip - mongering , nonliterary , anti-literary machine .
A novelist himself , he loves literature yet appears to believe that a writer ’s dominant response to a great book can be only envy .
Self - conscious about his contradictions , suspicious of his subject while wanting his approval , Lipsky is a character nearly worthy of Wallace ’s fiction .
While the author is in the shower , Lipsky surreptitiously phones Rolling Stone from the guest room .
His notes , unfortunately , are too sketchy to provide real drama , but the conversation centers on how to chase down rumors that Wallace once had an alcohol or drug problem .
Lipsky and his colleagues discuss how to pump Wallace ’s former editor , Gerry Howard , who “ would be more than forthcoming with a little bit of massaging to give you whatever you needed .
Bury it in other questions .
. . .
For example , ‘ How was editing him ; what do you think of his success ; hey , what about the dope ? ’ ”
Lipsky returns to drugs time and again , perhaps unavoidably since so much of “ Infinite Jest ” is about addiction .
Wallace denies ever having been a heroin addict , but he does cop to a frightening amount of occasional drug use : acid , cocaine and black tar heroin , plus heavy drinking and marijuana consumption .
He emphatically disconnects his drug use from any sort of glamour or creative imperative .
“ I was n’t an interesting or Falstaffian or larger - than - life type of addictive figure , ” he says .
Some of the most accomplished , emotional and hair - raising passages in “ Infinite Jest , ” and in American fiction of the past 20 years , are set in a Boston - area halfway house for recovering addicts .
Wallace insists that his close familiarity with halfway houses , as well as with 12 - step programs , is the product of journalistic research .
In the course of writing “ Infinite Jest , ” he dropped in on several local facilities , finding himself warmly welcomed by their residents : “ Nobody is as gregarious as somebody who has recently stopped using drugs . ”
He tells Lipsky , “ I did what you ’re doing now , ” and then , annoyed with the line of questioning , adds , “ except over a much longer period of time and much more subtly . ”
In a New Yorker article about Wallace after his death , D. T. Max asserted that Wallace did suffer an addiction and did spend time in a halfway house , though Max does n’t specify Wallace ’s dependency .
What is certain is that , living in the closing years of the American century , struggling with his own impulses and appetites , Wallace developed a vision of a society whose pursuit of pleasure was shutting itself off from true feeling and experience .
In “ Infinite Jest , ” he tells Lipsky , “ drugs are kind of a metaphor for the sort of addictive continuum that I think has to do with how we as a culture relate to things that are alive . ”
A striking feature of Lipsky ’s book is the delicate dance between the earnest celebrity reporter and the savvy celebrity - ­shy subject , each aware that their encounter serves an exterior purpose , yet each also sensitive to the possibility of a real human connection , even friendship .
“ It ’s kind of intense , ” Wallace observes .
But on the last leg of the journey , after the two seem to have become close , Lipsky ventures that there ’s something false in Wallace ’s persona .
The reporter suggests that Wallace believes he ’s really smarter than other people , and that his amiability is a species of condescension .
Disappointed , Wallace shoots back : “ You ’re a tough room . ”
Lipsky is hurt in turn after they reach the house , when Wallace tells someone calling on the phone that he ’s still with “ this guy . ”
Lipsky wishes that he would have referred to him at least as the “ Rolling Stone reporter . ”
Then , four pages later , Wallace says , shyly , “ It ’ll be very interesting before you leave , I really would like , if we could trade address data . ”
Yet the writers never meet again , nor even correspond to commiserate about the killed article .
The life of David Foster Wallace and the writing that came out of it deserve vigorous scholarship , to which Lipsky ’s book makes a useful contribution .
Readers will soon have further opportunities to get inside Wallace ’s creative mind .
Max is preparing a comprehensive biography of the writer .
Wallace ’s unfinished last novel , “ The Pale King , ” is to be published in April of next year .
Meanwhile , those who were put off by the heft , complexities and gruesomeness of “ Infinite Jest , ” not to mention the endnotes , should at least give it another shot .
The military warns the crowd to disperse or risk " decisive measures " and “ chaos . "
The anti-government protesters have erected barricades to defend the occupied area in the commercial heart of the capital .
They also want a UN peacekeeping force .
The country is poised between a political agreement and civil war .
Bangkok ( AsiaNews / Agencies ) -
The Thai army has ordered anti-government demonstrators to leave the garrison erected in Ratchaprasong , the shopping area in downtown Bangkok .
Otherwise , warn the military , we will proceed with the forced evacuation .
The " red shirts " - have barricaded the area - remaining firm on their positions : the immediate dissolution of Parliament and elections .
Protest leaders have also delivered a letter to the UN office in the capital , where seeking a UN peacekeeping force .
This morning , the military warned leaders of the " red shirts " - close to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in exile and supported by the opposition party United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship ( UDD ) - warning that " not much time is left " before force will be used .
Army spokesman Colonel Sunsern Kaewkumnerd , said that " in order to disperse the crowd " the authorities will take " decisive measures " and " there will be chaos . "
Also this morning , the leaders of the protest reached the representation of the United Nations in Thailand and delivered a letter addressed to the Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon .
The protesters call for the dispatch of a UN peacekeeping force to monitor the occupied area in the commercial heart of the capital .
The demonstrators have erected walls with tires and bamboo fences to protect themselves in case of a military attack .
However , there is the increasing danger of a new bloodbath after the violence between police and opposition supporters on 10 April that caused 25 deaths and over 800 wounded .
Yesterday , the Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said that the protesters posses " weapons of war " allegations rejected by the leaders of the revolt , who reaffirmed the call for the immediate dissolution of Parliament and early elections .
The Prime Minister also blamed what he called " terrorists " for the recent violence and added that the movement " wants to change the political system of the nation . "
One of the leaders of the " red shirts " responded to the serious accusation - the crime of treason warrants the death penalty - emphasizing that it is " a pretext " used by the government to suppress protests with force .
The political crisis has reached stalemate and the risk of further street violence looms on the horizon .
However , some
Thai policy experts warn that it could be the " right time " to reach an agreement .
Otherwise , fractures on the political front and divisions within the army could lead Thailand to the brink of civil war .
Paul Krugman continues to make a persuasive case that cutting stimulus spending now to reduce future debt levels will not only be ineffective , but stupid .
As we 've noted , we still do n't think Krugman has adequately explained how we 're going to get out from under our long - term debt mountain without a decade or two of pain -- and we'd like to hear him address that in detail .
But his case on the ineffectiveness of cutting the stimulus now is compelling :
Rereading my post on the folly of the G20 , it seems to me that I did n’t fully convey just how crazy the demand for fiscal austerity now now now really is .
The key thing you need to realize is that eliminating stimulus spending , while it would inflict severe economic harm , would do almost nothing to reduce future debt problems .
Here ’s the IMF ’s estimate of sources of the growth in debt over the next few years :
IMF
And even this figure conveys a misleading impression of the importance of stimulus spending ...

New York 's first " birth tourism " hotel is now catering to pregnant foreign nationals seeking to deliver their babies in the U.S. to obtain " birthright citizenship " for their children , Jerome Corsi 's Red Alert reports .
The Marmara Manhattan , a high - rise suites hotel located in New York 's Upper East Side , is offering a one - bedroom suite accommodation for $ 5,100 a month with airport transfer , baby cradle and a gift set for the mother , according to BreakingTravelNews.com .
TRENDING : The Bidens avoided paying more than $ 500,000 in payroll taxes by exploiting S corporations
Medical fees , at a cost of around $ 30,000 , are arranged by the hotel separately .
The Marmara Manhattan hotel is part of a Turkish hospitality chain .
Foreign nationals expecting babies make travel plans through a " birth tourism " agency to travel to the United States at the right time to give birth .
Flourishing in countries like Turkey , companies in the birth tourism business are able to arrange trips to U.S. cities like New York , Los Angeles and Chicago at prices ranging from $ 25,000 to $ 40,000 , all for packages that include the flight , city tours , living accommodations for several months and hospital expenses .
" Birth tourism relies on a lax interpretation of the 14th Amendment that Hispanic immigrants entering the United States through Mexico have used to argue Hispanic children born in the United States to illegal immigrants are ' birthright citizens , ' " Corsi wrote .
He added , " Still , since hospitals typically issue birth certificates for every baby born in the hospital , and because birth certificates are the key documentation needed to get other official documentation including driver 's licenses and passports , being born in the United States has been the backdoor for noncitizens to get their children rights as U.S. citizens .

If you ’ve been patiently waiting for the Nexus One to hit Sprint as promised , you ’re in for some bad news because the nation ’s third - largest carrier wo n’t be getting Google ’s “ superphone . ”
“ We are not bringing in Nexus One as EVO 4G is more robust in 3G markets and amazing in the growing number of 4G areas , ” Sprint spokesperson Michelle Leff told PhoneScoop in an e-mail .
This is n’t that crazy of a move , as the EVO 4G does outclass the Nexus One in many ways : it has a larger screen , a boosted camera and potential access to faster wireless networks via WiMax .
More importantly for Sprint , it has more control over the branding and labeling of HTC ’s EVO 4G , as Google planned to sell the Nexus One through its own online portal .
Verizon Wireless was also a prominent name at the N1 unveiling but it also decided not to offer Google ’s superphone in favor of the carrier - branded Droid Incredible .
So , it ’s way too early to call Google ’s phone business a failure because it has said the Nexus One division has already been profitable .
But it ’s also clear that Google ’s grand vision of disrupting the way cell phones are purchased is going to take a lot longer than it had hoped .
I think the main problem is that the Nexus One had no retail presence or television advertising .
Mainstream users want to touch and play with a phone before buying and there ’s a reason AT&T and Verizon are consistently among the top television ad buyers .
Maybe that new marketing position can give
Google the juice it needs to get its devices in the hands of the masses .
Nexus
One fans can still purchase a version for T - Mobile and AT&T and , while it ’s good , the EVO 4G and Droid Incredible should satisfy your high - end Android needs .

Editor 's note : Temp Nation is a four - part series on the structural changes taking place in Japan , the world 's second - largest economy .
With the demise of Japan , Inc.'s lifetime employment policies , more than a third of the country 's workforce is now underworked and underpaid .
This series examines how some temps are starting to fight back .
It also investigates the impact on foreign workers , and the political response to this growing social and economic problem .
NAGOYA , Japan —
For decades , Japan 's big firms were famous for their deal with employees :
The corporation was a big family that looked after its workers for life .
In return it expected total dedication .
That was the Japanese way , and part of the popular 1980s American media narrative on the rise of Japan , Inc .
It 's no longer true .
Instead , more than 17 million people in the world 's second largest economy are now " irregular " workers , or temps , according to government statistics .
That 's nearly 34 percent of the workforce , up from 25 percent in 1999 and just 15 percent in 1984 .
Such workers give Japanese firms a more flexible workforce , helping them keep down costs and cope with globalization .
But temps are paid less than full - timers , have fewer benefits and are cast off when times are tough .
The global downturn of 2008 made that painfully clear .
From the last quarter of 2008 to the autumn of 2009 , Japan shed 440,000 " dispatch " worker jobs , according to government numbers ( some have since been re-hired , or shifted to other categories of temp work . )
Temps living in company - provided housing lost not only their jobs but their homes , too .
Now , fed - up temps — as well as small , independent unions — are beginning to push back .
They say big Japanese firms are exploiting loopholes and weak enforcement of labor laws to maintain a low - cost workforce of " permatemps " with little or no job security .
And increasingly , they 're taking their cases to labor bureaus and courts .
Many such workers are surprisingly sympathetic to the need for Japanese firms to stay competitive .
They just think things have gone too far .
" It 's necessary to limit workers ' rights to some extent so that companies can stay in business , " said one 45 - year - old former dispatch worker at Panasonic Ecosystems outside Nagoya .
" The problem is , companies are ignoring the law and using dispatch workers indefinitely . "
The worker did not want his name used because he is suing Panasonic for compensation after being let go in 2009 , but still lives and works in a community of loyal Panasonic full - timers .
In interviews here in central Japan 's manufacturing heartland , he and other former dispatch workers and union leaders described factories where hiring schemes have created something akin to a caste system .
At the top are permanent employees — two - thirds of the workforce — who still have the old , stereotypical deal of mutual loyalty with their companies .
The other third are temps , of bewildering variety .
There are part - timers , hired directly by the firm but typically working other odd jobs to get by .
There are " dispatch " workers , who make as little as half the salary of permanent employees for the same work and hours .
There are " subcontract " workers , who can only take instructions from the subcontract firm , not from bosses or colleagues at their actual workplace .
There are Brazilian and Peruvian workers of Japanese descent , who get paid even less .
And , at the bottom , there are Chinese , Vietnamese and other foreign " trainees , " who can make as little as 300 yen ( about $ 3.25 ) an hour .
They pay huge sums to labor brokers to work in Japan , are n't covered by labor laws in their first year of work , and suffer harsh financial penalties if they quit before their contracts are up .
The temp trend even affects foreign English teachers , who have watched firms slash salaries and benefits in the name of cost - cutting .
Broad effects
The implications of a rising temp workforce go far beyond Japan 's factory floors .
The trend has contributed to lower consumption , sharper inequality , falling wages and a resulting " working poor " problem .
Average wages in Japan fell nearly 4 percent in 2009 , the third straight year of losses , with real wages ( accounting for deflation ) falling nearly 3 percent .
The temp trend is also a factor in lower marriage and childbirth rates , since temps with no job security are unattractive mates .
The marriage rate was 5.8 per 1,000 people in 2008 , down from more than 10 per 1,000 people in the early 1970s .
And the trend has increased pressure on full time , permanent workers , who have to take up the slack in workplaces filled with low - morale temps who have little incentive to work hard .
" Increased use of non-regular workers often creates heavier workloads for the remaining workers , who are expected to make up any shortfalls without concern for time , " wrote Osaka - based sociologists Charles Weathers and Scott North in a recent article .
The 2007 Japanese Lifestyle White Paper survey found that 67 percent of regular workers believed their job burdens and responsibilities were much greater than five years before .
How Japan got here
Japan 's stratified labor market did n't happen overnight , or by accident .
Until the 1980s " indirect " employment , or employment through a third party such as a dispatch firm , was illegal .
In response to business pressure , the government began relaxing hiring rules .
Deregulation continued after Japan 's economy went into a tailspin and entered its " lost decade , " then accelerated under pro-business prime minister Junichiro Koizumi .
The " dispatch law " was passed in the mid-'80s .
In 1999 the law was relaxed to allow dispatch labor in 26 specialized industries , according to Yasushi Iguchi , a labor economist at Kwansei Gakuin University , and in 2004 it was further relaxed to allow short - term dispatch labor in the manufacturing sector .
Large auto and electronics manufacturing firms led the way in a temp - hiring surge , driven by cost - cutting plans , Iguchi said .
" Automakers hired a temporary work force because that was a better fit with the ' just - in - time ' delivery system , " he said .
" These workers are very flexible .
They 're ' just - in - time ' laborers . "
Toyota is typical .
In 2000 , the company began a program of aggressive cost- cutting , according to Saichi Kurematsu , chairman of the Aichi Prefectural Federation of Trade Unions , whose members include 10 Toyota employees .
Toyota targeted 30 - percent cuts in the first three years , and 15 percent more cuts in the next three .
Last December it announced planned cuts of an additional 30 percent , Kurematsu said .
To get leaner , Toyota boosted its hiring of temps , he said , some of whom then saw their salaries slashed .
Dispatch workers assigned to Toyota earned 1,800 yen per hour in 2004 but made just 1,150 yen per hour by 2007 , said Kurematsu .
( Toyota declined comment on those numbers but noted that such salaries were determined by the dispatch company . )
According to emails from Toyota spokesman Paul Nolasco , the firm used a peak of 1,350 dispatch workers on its assembly lines in 2004 , but no longer uses such labor on the lines .
He said Toyota employs roughly 70,000 full - timers and about 4,000 dispatch office workers .
On its assembly lines , its workforce includes 2,300 temps on fixed - term contracts of three months to three years — down from about 10,000 such contract workers on assembly lines in mid-2008 , prior to the downturn .
Temps on fixed - term contracts make less than 60 percent what permanent workers make on average , according to a report from the National Labor Committee .
( Toyota said it does not comment on employees ' salaries .
But it noted that more than 2,000 fixed - term contract workers have been bumped up to full - time employee status since 2007 . )
Where are the unions ?
Ironically , Japan has some of the most worker - friendly labor laws in the world .
For example , there 's no limit on the number of unions allowed at one company , and as few as a single worker are legally allowed to form a union .
The U.S. is responsible for that .
Left - leaning American advisers drafted Japan 's current constitution and related labor regulations during the post - World War II occupation .
But these days , Japan is dominated by large " company " unions that typically represent only permanent workers .
Most come under the umbrella of Rengo , Japan 's largest trade confederation with some 7 million members .
Rengo looks out for the wages of full - timers , but provides scant help for Japan 's growing ranks of temps , most of who are non-unionized .
" These big trade unions have the same opinion as employers about everything , " said Yamahara Katsuji , Osaka - based chair of General Union , a small independent union .
" So they agree on the need for disposable workers in their factories . "
Some top officials even rotate between union and management posts at the same company , he and others said .
" Nearly all major unions have close ties to management , inhibiting them from demanding improved work conditions , " wrote sociologists Weathers and North .

Martin Ford points us to an ongoing concern as our economy changes :
Structural Unemployment and Technology
Previously , I ’ve argued here that job automation technology might someday advance to the point where most routine or repetitive jobs will be performed by machines or software , and that , as a result , we may end up with severe structural unemployment .
The latest weekly report shows anincrease of 25,000 in new unemployment claims–instead of the decrease expected by economists .
Clearly , the economy continues to struggle with job creation , and I think that automation is playing a significant role .
Catherine Rampell recently wrote an article in the New York Times that delves into the impact this issue is having in the lives of typical workers .
As the article points out :
For the last two years , the weak economy has provided an opportunity for employers to do what they would have done anyway : dismiss millions of people — like file clerks , ticket agents and autoworkers — who were displaced by technological advances and international trade .
Rampell ’s piece does an especially good job of capturing the denial that is likely to continue to be associated with this issue :
Ms. Norton is reluctant to believe that her three decades of experience and her typing talents , up to 120 words a minute , are now obsolete .
So she looks for other explanations … .
The problem cannot be that the occupation she has devoted her life to has been largely computerized , she says .
“ You ca n’t replace the human thought process , ” she says .
“ I can anticipate people ’s needs .
Usually , I give them what they want before they even know they need it .
There will never be a machine that can do that . ”
The fact is that there will very soon be machines and software algorithms that can very effectively anticipate needs and perform increasingly complex ( and high - paying ) jobs that require higher and higher skill levels .
The unwillingness to acknowledge this reality and confront its implications extends not just to impacted workers , but also to economists and policy makers — virtually all of whom are either in denial or oblivious to this issue .
Many mainstream economists are projecting that unemployment will remain high for years to come — but there is a near universal expectation that eventually , the problem will correct itself and we will gravitate back to something close to full employment .
The problem with this assumption is that technology is not going to stop advancing while we are all waiting for the job market to recover .
In my book , The Lights in the Tunnel : Automation , Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future ( now available as a free PDF eBook ) , I argue that automation technology is likely to continue advancing relentlessly and result in significant and continuously increasing structural unemployment within the next 10 to 20 years .
Most economists are likely to dismiss this prediction .
Many will suggest that new technology will result in the creation of new industries and new employment sectors .
The problem with that assumption is that the new industries created tend to nearly always be very capital - intensive and employ relatively few workers — while at the same time making available technologies that are highly disruptive to more traditional labor intensive sectors that employ millions of people .
The worker that Rampell interviewed for her article has ended up taking what is often the job of last resort : a part - time position at Wal - Mart .
But what will happen when Wal - Mart begins to employ significant automation ?
Is that really unthinkable ?
In fact , Wal - mart management was already starting to think about it back in 2005 .
To see the difference in employment between a traditional industry and a new technology industry , compare Wal - Mart ( over 2 million employees and revenue of about $ 180,000 per worker ) with Google ( 20 thousand employees and over a million dollars per worker ) .
In time , Wal - Mart will begin to look more like Google and new industries that spring up will employ fewer and fewer workers .
A similar story can be seen by in the DVD rental industry .
How many workers are ( or have been ) employed by Blockbuster in its thousands of retail locations , as compared with Netflix in a few highly automated distribution centers ?
The inevitable migration from delivering DVDs though the mail toward to instantly available streaming video can only accelerate that trend .
The fact is that structural unemployment is here to stay .
It will very likely get worse , and it will increasingly impact workers with college educations and high skill levels .
Those with few skills and little education have been the first to feel the brunt , but machines are getting better and smarter .
The rest of us are next .
Martin Ford is the author of The Lights in the Tunnel : Automation , Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future ( available from Amazon or as a free PDF download ) and has a blog at econfuture.wordpress.com .
In an interview aimed at cementing his reputation as a “ friend of Israel , ” incoming British Foreign Secretary William Hague vowed to see British law changed so as to hold Israeli officials immune from war crimes charges , and promised to take a tough line against Iran ’s civilian nuclear program , calling it the “ most urgent thing ” for him to tackle .
William Hague
In fact , Hague seems to be taking a considerably more hawkish position on Iran than the Labour government had , and says that it would be a mistake to ever rule out military action against Iran , though his first preference seemed to be for “ tough sanctions ” against the nation .
Officials in the Labour government had repeatedly referred to the prospect of a US attack on Iran as a disaster .
The news is likely to be welcome in Israel , where the media has been having a field day portraying Liberal Democratic leader Nick Clegg as anti-Israel and has warned his inclusion in the government poses a danger to Israel ’s policy .
Hague himself has a mixed history with Israel , calling the 2006 invasion of Lebanon “ disproportionate ” while praising the 2009 invasion of the Gaza Strip .
Despite his unconditional support for the Gaza attack , Hague has not openly condemned the Goldstone Report as so many others have .
DAMASCUS ( Reuters ) - Russia may help build a nuclear power plant in Syria , Russia ’s energy minister said on Tuesday , a step that could upset the West due to unresolved allegations Damascus tried to construct a potential nuclear weapons facility in secret .
In 2007 , Israel bombed to rubble what Washington said was a nascent , plutonium - producing nuclear reactor in Syria ’s desert and a U.N. nuclear watchdog probe to determine what the target was has stalled due to Syrian non-cooperation , diplomats say .
On the first state visit to Syria by a Kremlin chief since the Bolshevik Revolution , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev played up prospects for nuclear power cooperation and said Washington should work harder for peace in the Middle East .
“ Cooperation on atomic energy could get a second wind , ” Medvedev said at a news conference with Syrian President Bashar al - Assad after their talks .
Assad said he and Medvedev “ talked about oil and gas cooperation , as well as constructing conventional or nuclear powered electricity stations . ”
Asked whether Russia would build an atomic power plant in Syria , Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko told Reuters : “ We are studying this question . ”
The International Atomic Energy Agency has been investigating Syria for two years over what it says was a complex that resembled a nuclear reactor before it was bombed to rubble by Israeli warplanes in September 2007 .
Syria has strongly denied U.S. intelligence that the complex was a North Korean - designed reactor geared to making plutonium for atomic bombs , saying it was merely a conventional military building .
But an IAEA report in March said uranium traces found in a 2008 visit to the area by U.N. inspectors pointed to nuclear - related activity on the ground , but Damascus was denying further IAEA access needed to draw conclusions .
SYRIAN NUCLEAR TRANSPARENCY SOUGHT
The United States , Israel ’s chief ally , and several European countries have demanded that Syria cooperate fully with the IAEA inquiry , saying the issue will not go away even as Damascus improves its relations with the West .
The Arab nation has been plagued for years with electricity shortages , with power generation falling one - third short of demand and the population expanding at 2.5 percent a year .
Shmatko said that cooperation with Russia on a possible nuclear plant would require Damascus to abide by the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty , which prohibits signatories including Syria without nuclear weaponry from trying to acquire them .
He also suggested Russia might build more nuclear power reactors in Iran beyond the one it plans to switch on this year near the city of Bushehr despite likely U.S. disapproval .
Tehran is under U.N. sanctions for refusing to rein in a secretive uranium enrichment programme .
“ We are in favor of continuing cooperation with Iran in the energy sphere to the full extent , including in building light - water reactors , ” Shmatko told journalists .
Russia says all nations have the right to peaceful nuclear power programmes and is aggressively seeking contracts abroad to build atomic power plants .
But Medvedev , who has indicated Russia could support new U.N. Security Council sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme , called for “ constructive cooperation with the international community on Iran ’s part . ”
The United States and some European countries believe Iran ’s professed civilian nuclear energy programme is a front for an effort to develop atomic weapons .
Iran denies it .
Moscow backed Syria through the Arab - Israeli conflict , and the Kremlin is seeking to reinvigorate ties in the Middle East nations .
It forgave most of Syria ’s multi-billion dollar debt .
Israel has also opposed Russian arms sales to Syria , which was the fourth largest purchaser of Russian weaponry last year .
Russia has also improved ties with Israel and tried to increase its clout to advance the Middle East peace process .
Israel is widely believed to be the only state in the Middle East to have nuclear weapons , although it has long neither confirmed nor denied such ability .
Medvedev repeated Russia ’s proposal for a Middle East peace conference in Moscow , but he suggested the United States would have to do more if peace efforts are to make headway .
“ I agree with my colleague that the American side could take a more active position , ” Medvedev said .

Raising Godly Children : Key # 6 - Motivation ( Punishments / Rewards )
This is part of a series about Bible principles for raising children .
This article should be studied in context of the whole series of articles .
To start at the beginning of the series , please click here : Raising_Godly Children
Parents would prefer that their children simply obey them without chastisement .
But in practice this does not always happen .
Often the child 's will conflicts with that of the parent .
Then , if the child is to learn respect for authority and do what we believe to be best for him , we must still get them to obey us .
How can we lead a child to obey when he would rather not ?
The answer is that parents must motivate the child to obey .
Whatever reasons they have for not obeying , we must give them stronger reasons to obey !
This is done by rewards and punishments .
When the child obeys , we make him glad by giving him a pleasant experience .
When he disobeys , we make him sorry by giving an unpleasant experience .
He eventually learns it is to his advantage to obey .
Psychologists call this " reinforcement . "
It is used in training animals .
Obedience leads to a pleasant result ; disobedience leads to an unpleasant result .
We are dealing , not with animals , but with children who have intelligence and emotional needs .
Above all they have a spirit in the image of God and will eventually receive an eternal destiny based on their conduct before God .
This is why we already emphasized love and instruction .
Nevertheless , the principles of rewards and punishments are useful and Scriptural .
Consider how these principles can be used in training children .
I. Spanking
Many child - rearing " authorities " oppose the use of spanking .
Psychologist Linda Budd wrote that , if you spank your child , you should , " Apologize .
Own up to your mistake " ( via Greg Gwin , Good News , 5/28/95 ) .
A. Spanking Is Taught in the Bible .
God 's word commands parents to use spanking when needed .
Proverbs 22:15 - Foolishness is bound in a child 's heart , but the rod drives it from him .
Children naturally tend to do bad things at times .
Parents must exercise authority and give their children rules .
But all children , at times , will test those limits .
Then punishment is needed to " restrain " them .
Proverbs 19:18 - Chasten the son while there is still hope .
This is for his good .
Children must be taught obedience while they are young , even before their reasoning ability matures .
If you wait till later , they may be past " hope . "
[ See also Prov. 29:15 ; 23:13 . ]
Proverbs 13:24 - One who does not spank his son , when it is needed , hates his son .
One who loves his son will chasten him .
God says spanking is not an act of hatred .
On the contrary , properly done , spanking is an act of love , and those who deny the value of spanking are the ones who God says hate children .
The issue of spanking boils down to an issue of the authority of God and the inspiration of the Bible .
A psychologist may question my intelligence .
But when he challenges spanking , he is disagreeing , not with me , but with God .
And God is smarter than all the psychologists put together !
Spanking is compared to God 's punishment of his people - Hebrews 12:5 - 11 .
God Himself compares
His chastisement of people to earthly fathers who chasten their sons .
God says that all fathers will chasten their children ; otherwise it indicates that the child is illegitimate ( vv 6 - 8 ) !
Further , this chastening is an act of love , not hatred ( v6 ) , because it results in good for the child ( vv 10,11 ) .
Some claim that punishing children produces resentment and misunderstanding , causing them to hate and disrespect their parents .
But God says that discipline leads the child to respect the father ( v9 ) .
It follows that , if parents should not punish children , then God should not punish evil men .
But
He does punish evil men , and no one is wiser than He is .
He is our perfect example of a good Father .
Finally , note that this is a New Testament Scripture .
Some people question our use of Old Testament Scripture on this subject ; but here is a New Testament Scripture that teaches the same thing .
In fact , vv 5,6 quote Proverbs 3:11 f .
God 's teaching on this matter is the same today as it was in the Old Testament !
People who deny the value of spanking , therefore , are denying the wisdom and authority of God Himself .
Some do n't know this ; others do it knowingly .
But regardless , to oppose spanking is to directly attack the inspiration of the Bible and the infallibility of God .
Parents must understand and appreciate the value of spanking , regardless of what any human " authority " may claim .
[ Cf. Rev. 3:19 ; Deut .
8:5 ; 28:15 ; Ex. 7 - 12 ; 2 Thess .
1:8-10 ; etc. ]
B. Spanking Works Where Other Methods Fail .
People who deny the value of spanking , offer no workable alternatives .
Some authorities say to " reason " with the child till he agrees .
" Intelligent parents rarely resort to corporal punishment ...
An intelligent disciplinary method is the use of reasoning at the child 's level of understanding ... " - Growing Superior Children , pp. 452 ( via Plain Truth about Child Rearing , p. 26 ) .
My translation : " Spanking proves you lack intelligence .
If you were smart enough , you could talk them into obeying ! "
This statement flatly denies Bible teaching .
Reasoning with children is important and should not be neglected , but it has limits .
Often immediate obedience is needed , as when a child is playing in the street and a car is coming !
Some children are too young and inexperienced to understand the wisdom of the parents ' reasons .
And often the child is just too stubborn and self - willed to listen .
In such cases , no amount of reasoning will change him .
Dr. Dobson ( DTD , pp. 18 ff ) tells of a young mother who had been taught to reason her child into obedience .
When she put her three - year - old son in his crib , he spat in her face .
When she tried to reason with him , he repeated it .
She finally fled the room as he spat on the back of the door !
She said she could never control him after that ; as a teenager he rebelled against every request she made .
We need to reason with our children as part of our instruction .
But there are times when every child determines to have his own way , and no amount of reasoning will convince him .
The result becomes a war of attrition , in which the child will continue arguing till he wears you down .
He must be taught that " crime does not pay . "
Pain works wonders .
Again , some suggest that we just " control the child 's environment . "
We are told to not make demands and children wo n't rebel .
Just remove all temptation and give the children recreation and interesting toys ; then they will never want to do bad things .
My translation : " Just let the kid have his own way , and there will be no conflicts . "
Again , there is value in keeping temptation out of the child 's way .
But to deny the value of spanking simply contradicts the Bible , and experience shows that it simply does not work .
Matthew 16:24 - To be a follower of Jesus we must learn to deny and control ourselves .
The child who is given everything he wants never learns self - sacrifice and self - denial .
He becomes self - centered and thinks the world must always adapt to him and give him what he wants .
As he grows up , his demands become bigger and bigger , till finally his parents cannot satisfy his demands .
His environment cannot always be controlled , so sooner or later he must face temptation and learn to control himself .
Otherwise , he is destined for major trouble in life , because he thinks the world owes him a living ; but the world will not always give him what he wants .
The result is unhappy , miserable delinquents , rebels , and criminals such as flood our land .
Dr. Dobson ( DTD , pp. 14f ) tells of another family where the parents always gave their daughter whatever she wanted , never crossed her , and never made demands .
She became a selfish and disrespectful teenager , throwing terrible tantrums if she did not get her way .
They tried to give a party to please her , but she brought in disrespectful , rebellious friends who proceeded to tear things up .
When the mother said something that angered her , the daughter " struck her down and left her helpless " lying in a pool of blood on the floor .
The daughter then went out unconcerned to dance with her friends in the backyard .
This is an extreme example .
But the point is that without spanking and physical punishment child rearing is doomed to failure .
Spanking inflicts a relatively mild and temporary pain by means of which the child learns lessons that will teach him to avoid much greater hardships and trouble later in life and in eternity .
In this way , spanking benefits the child and is therefore an act of love .
C. Objections to Spanking Are Not Valid .
Some say spanking leads to child abuse or even constitutes child abuse .
The high - school parenting text Child Growth and Development , p315 , says physical punishment is " unsatisfactory " because , " All physical punishment has the danger of turning into child abuse or causing injury when the adult is really angry .
For this reason alone , it should be avoided . "
Sweden has outlawed spanking on the grounds that it is child abuse .
In this country , schoolteachers are generally forbidden to spank , and some people have tried to pass laws forbidding parents to spank their own children .
Often overly zealous social workers harass parents and call them into court , simply because parents exercise Scriptural discipline .
We do not deny that child abuse exists .
We deplore it as much or more than others do .
But we affirm that scriptural spanking , rather than constituting child abuse , in fact helps to prevent it .
We have shown by the Scriptures that exercise of Scriptural discipline is an expression of love for children .
It is done for the child 's wellbeing .
In contrast , the child abuser loses sight of the child 's wellbeing and acts from selfishness and anger .
Such conduct flatly contradicts the Bible and is not what we are defending .
Actually , proper spanking helps avoids child abuse .
People abuse children because they do not know how to properly control them .
As we have illustrated , the children 's conduct frustrates and angers the parent , till finally he loses control and , in a fit of anger and frustration , does lasting harm to the child .
If parents would instead learn to discipline their children when the need first becomes evident , the matter would never get so out of hand .
Others say spanking makes the child feel guilty and destroys his self - esteem .
" The chief danger of punishment is that it makes the child feel guilty - that he is bad , naughty " - The Complete Book of Mothercraft , p391 ( via Plain Truth about Child Rearing , p21 ) .
But wait !
What if the child has been bad and naughty ?
What if he is guilty , but does n't feel guilty ?
What if he has been disrespectful or has done what could lead him into sin ?
It sounds like punishment is just what he needs !
A fundamental error of modern psychology is that it often denies evil and guilt .
It fails to hold people accountable for their misdeeds .
It teaches them to have a high self - image by whitewashing and denying their guilt .
But people remain unhappy and maladjusted , because sub - consciously they still know something is wrong .
Worse yet , this approach leaves people with no real solution for their problem .
The truth often is they are guilty ; but by leading them to deny guilt , psychology leaves them with no way to remedy it .
The Bible teaches us to recognize that , when people do wrong , they are guilty and should be told so .
If they stubbornly refuse to admit guilt , they should be punished so they suffer for their wrong till they admit it .
This is true of children and adults .
Proverbs 20:30 - Blows and stripes cleanse away guilt and reach the inner depths of the heart .
Spanking is not just an external act .
It reaches the heart and teaches the child to become an upright , righteous person .
It molds godly character .
But the Bible also has a solution for the guilt .
When one is sorry , repents , apologizes , and corrects his conduct , he receives forgiveness from God and others who follow the Bible ( Matt. 6:12 - 15 ; Luke 17:3,4 ) .
One reason many people do not appreciate the value of spanking , is that they do not understand God 's concept of guilt and forgiveness .
Others say spanking teaches children to use violence .
Sociology Professor Murray Strauss wrote : " Spanking teaches kids that when someone is doing something you do n't like and they wo n't stop doing it , you hit them " ( via Greg Gwin , Good News , 5/28/95 ) .
So supposedly spanking teaches children that " might makes right , " and if we are bigger and stronger than others we can get our way by violence .
That may sound reasonable on the surface , but the truth is just the opposite .
An undisciplined child is the one who tends to use violence .
He throws fits in rebellion against his parents ' authority , but he never suffers for such conduct .
As he gets older , he learns to throw bigger fits , including physical violence against those who do n't let him have his way , just as in the examples we have mentioned .
But if instead , when he is small , he is punished for his fits and is not allowed to get his way by such conduct , then he learns that violence does not pay .
Spanking , coupled with love and instruction , teaches children the vital principle that only people in positions of proper authority have the right to punish others .
Parents spank , not just to " get their own way , " but because they have the God - given authority to train a child for the child 's good .
Children have no right to punish others , because they do not have authority .
Children can learn to see the difference .
This demonstrates other authority roles , such as God Himself , civil rulers , etc. ( Rom. 12:19 ; 13:1 - 7 ) .
Those who say that spanking teaches children to be violent are , perhaps unknowingly , denying the right of God , civil rulers , and all authority figures to require a penalty of those who flaunt authority .
Others say spanking simply does not work .
" The best that can be said for spanking is that it sometimes clears the air .
But it is n't worth the price , and it usually does n't work " - The Complete Book of Mothercraft , p. 367 ( via Plain Truth about Child Rearing , p. 26 . )
Parents often make similar statements : " I tried spanking my child , but it just did n't make any difference . "
Spanking sometimes does fail , but only when it has been misused .
You are not guaranteed success just because you occasionally spank your child .
Spanking must be administered properly ( see notes below ) .
And it must be used in connection with love , instruction , and rewards , as we discuss elsewhere .
And spanking must be used diligently and consistently .
You cannot overcome months of improper training with just a few spankings .
You will not succeed if you get discouraged and quit trying after a few attempts , nor if you occasionally spank a child for some offenses but then just ignore other times when he is naughty .
Proper training must also begin early .
It is possible to wait till a child is so mature that his bad habits are thoroughly ingrained .
You still should attempt to use right methods , but it may be too late to change his conduct ( Prov. 19:18 ) .
Those who object to spanking fall into one or more of the following categories : ( 1 ) they are ignorant of the Bible , or ( 2 ) they simply reject the Bible teaching , or ( 3 ) they have observed parents who misuse the Biblical concept of discipline .
Anything good can be misused ; Satan consistently leads people to pervert what is good .
Like fire , electricity , atomic energy , and other powerful forces , spanking can be misused and cause great damage .
But the fact there are dangers in these areas does not keep us from using them for the good they can accomplish .
II .
Rewards as a Form of Control
Some parents act as though controlling children is entirely a matter of punishment .
They never give rewards and sometimes speak as though they think it is wrong to do so .
But consider a Biblical defense of using rewards in raising children .
A. Rewards for Our Service Are Part of Life .
Luke 10:7 - The laborer is worthy of his wage , but lazy , negligent workers do not deserve to be rewarded .
( See also Matt .
25:14-30 ; 20:1-15 ; James 5:4 ; 1 Cor. 9:6-14 ; 1 Tim. 5:17,18 ; Eph. 4:28 ; 2 Thess . 3:10 ) .
Men do not work on a job simply for the fun of it .
We rightly expect to be paid , and we rightly hope that the people who benefit from our labors will express appreciation .
Parents ought to prepare children to live on their own in the " real world , " but when they are on their own they will expect rewards for their labor .
Why should we not teach them this by rewarding them as they grow up ?
Proverbs 27:2 - Let another man praise you and not your own lips .
Children who are not praised may grow up bragging and showing off to get attention .
When parents give proper praise , their children learn not to brag on themselves .
B. God Rewards People for Their Service .
Hebrews 11:6 - God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him .
He often rewarded Israel for their faithfulness ( Deut. 28:1,2ff ) .
The New Testament promises those who are faithful will receive all spiritual blessings in this life ( Eph. 1:3 ) and eternal life at the Judgment ( Rom. 8:14,17 ; 2:6-11 ) .
God does not just punish evil , but He also rewards good .
This has always been a fundamental part of the Divine nature .
If we use the fact that God chastises us as proof we should chastise our children , then should n't we also imitate His example of rewarding good ?
Remember that God is our perfect example of a father .
By using rewards as well as punishments , we help children understand the true nature of their Heavenly Father .
C. A Bible Example of Parental Rewards
Luke 15:20 - 24 - When the prodigal son repented and returned from sin , the father kissed him , rejoiced , and gave a feast in his honor .
One way to reward a child is by letting him work for physical things he wants : money or some item he wants .
But this does not mean the child should be paid for everything he does .
His parents are already providing him with food , clothes , shelter , etc .
If the laborer is worthy of his reward , then the child already owes it to the parents to work in return for all that the parents do for the child !
And especially in spiritual matters , children need to learn the value of deferring their reward till judgment day , not necessarily expecting immediate rewards for serving God .
Romans 13:7 - Give honor to whom honor is due .
Another form of reward parents ought to emphasize is expressing appreciation and giving praise .
This is simply a matter of showing gratitude .
( Matt. 25:21 )
The nature of the rewards should be a matter of the parents ' good judgment .
Use your ingenuity .
Learn to watch for things your children want .
When they ask , " May we do this or go there ... , " try responding , " If you 'll do this work first , then you may . "
You may promise to read a book to the child after he picks up his toys .
As children grow older , perhaps you can pay an allowance for special jobs he does .
The point is to give pleasant results to reward the child for doing good as well as giving unpleasant consequences for failing to do good .
III .
Other Useful Methods of Control
I cannot give a complete list of good methods parents can use to motivate children , but I can suggest some possibilities as illustrations .
Parents should use their ingenuity .
A. Acceptable Substitutes
If a child has been corrected for some wrong or has been forbidden to do something unacceptable , you may offer him an acceptable alternative rather than leave him disappointed or tempted to do wrong despite your instructions .
If he cannot ride his tricycle because it is raining , suggest some inside game or activity .
If you teach him not to go to the prom , offer him some alternative : a night out with the family or a banquet with other Christian friends .
God uses this method with us .
He does not just forbid sin , but tells us the good we should replace it with ( Eph. 4:22 -32 ) .
This approach leaves the child with much less temptation to do wrong , and also teaches him to have a positive outlook and be content even when he can not get his way .
B. Withholding Privileges
Rewards are given only to those who deserve them .
When a child misbehaves , withholding a privilege or reward may be an appropriate punishment .
Usually such punishments are most effective if the connection between the punishment and the crime is fairly obvious .
If he does n't finish his homework ( or other job ) , he can't go out to play but has to finish the homework .
If he misbehaves with his friends , then he cannot visit with them for a period of time .
If he does not come when he was supposed to , he is " grounded " and can't go anywhere for pleasure for a while .
An older teen who uses the car improperly ( as by not caring for the car responsibly ) may have use of the car withdrawn for a period of time .
C. Apology
Matt .
5:23,24 ; Luke 17:3,4 - When we wrong other people , the Bible teaches us to go to those people and apologize .
Parents should teach children to practice this principle .
When the child wrongs another child , an adult , or the parents themselves , the child should be made to apologize .
This also constitutes a good form of discipline because it is not easy to face one we have wronged and admit we were wrong .
The child is not likely to soon repeat the act that led to this consequence .
D. Natural Consequences
Some acts naturally lead to unpleasant consequences that teach the child a lesson without the parents ' having to punish them .
If a child torments a cat and the parent warns him to quit , he may continue till the cat scratches him .
If the consequences are very severe and if the child would learn the lesson from a lesser punishment , we should prefer a lesser punishment ( for example , spank the child instead of letting him burn himself on a hot stove ) .
But sometimes a child simply wo n't learn from the parents ' teaching .
Luke 15:14 - 17 -
The father of the Prodigal Son allowed his son to suffer the consequences of doing wrong .
The boy reached the bottom , but nobody bailed him out ( including his father ) .
The result is he " came to himself " and repented .
Modern parents need to learn this lesson .
[ Cf. also 1 Sam. 8:9ff . ]
Sometimes this method is the only one children will listen to .
They may have to learn some lessons the hard way .
If they wo n't listen to us , we should not protect them from the consequences of their wrong .
If a child makes a foolish debt , make him pay it off .
If he misbehaves at school , do n't take his part against the teacher or school authorities .
Let them punish him .
If he misbehaves toward a neighbor ( as by damaging their property ) , make him go face the angry neighbor and fix what he broke .
If he breaks a law and the judge fines him , make him work to pay of the fine .
Many parents " bail out " their children when they get in trouble , and the children never learn to be responsible and avoid the foolish conduct .
Sometimes the best punishment is to let the child suffer for his error and do n't protect him from the consequences .
E. Logical Consequences
Sometimes we can think of a punishment that is logically associated with the wrong deed .
It " fits the crime . "
When a child accidentally spills or breaks something , spanking usually is not appropriate .
Instead , have him clean up what he spilled or pay for a new one to replace what he broke .
If he misbehaves in how he uses a toy or equipment ( bicycle ) , put the toy away where he can't use it for a specified time .
If he mistreats other family members , then he may be isolated from the family as by sitting on a chair in the corner .
If children squabble and can't get along , they may be separated from one another so they can't play together .
F. Divine Corrections for Sin
When the child 's conduct is sinful , we should use the same methods for correcting him that we should with others .
This includes :
Use God 's
Word to instruct and rebuke them .
2 Timothy 3:16,17 [ 4:2-4 ] -
Use the Bible to show them where they are wrong and warn them of the eternal consequences of such conduct .
Make clear that you are acting for the child 's good .
Do n't lead the child to think the Bible is a weapon God provided for parents to get their own way .
Show them that this is God 's will and they must obey God .
Cooperate with other Christians and the church , when they rebuke the child .
Galatians 6:1 - Sometimes Christians know our children has sinned , so they try to talk to them about it .
Parents in such cases may become defensive and try to protect their children .
Instead we should realize that this is good for the children , and we should appreciate people who care enough to help .
Remember the father of the prodigal , who allowed his son to suffer the consequences of his sin till the son repented .
2 Thessalonians 3:6,14,15 -
If the child is a Christian who sins and the church exercises Scriptural discipline , we cooperate with the church and respect its decision .
The Old Law taught parents to actively participate in congregational punishment of erring children ( Deut .
21:18-21 ; 13:6-11 ; Zech. 13:3 ) .
New Testament discipline takes a different form , but the principle is the same .
If the child sins , and we defend them in opposition to those who Scripturally reprove him , we become a partaker of his evil deed - 2 John 10,11 .
Pray for the child to do right .
James 5:16 - Confess your faults to one another and pray for one another .
When the child acknowledges he has done wrong , pray to God and ask God to help him do right .
If he is old enough to be a Christian , then his disobedience to you was also a sin against God .
Have him confess the sin to God and pray for forgiveness .
( Acts 8:22 ; Matthew 6:12 ; 21:28 -32 ; 2 Corinthians 7:10 ; 1 John 1:8-10 ; Proverbs 28:13 )
Parents may find other means of motivating children , in addition to those mentioned here .
But the principle always is : give pleasant consequences for good behavior , unpleasant consequences for bad behavior .
IV .
Guidelines for Proper Use of Punishments and Rewards
To be effective and Scriptural , punishments and rewards must be administered according to certain rules .
The mere fact you use spanking ( or other punishments ) and rewards , does not of itself guarantee parental success .
A. Never Inflict Lasting Damage to a Child .
Remember that your purpose is to punish the child for his good , not for his harm .
We seek only temporary pain to change the child 's conduct .
To inflict lasting harm is not an act of love , does not accomplish the purpose of punishment , and violates the principle that we are not to discourage our children ( Eph. 6:4 ; Col. 3:21 ) .
Yet many parents do harm their children .
Child abuse is a very definite problem in our society .
Literally thousands of children every year are beaten to death by their parents , left abandoned , or otherwise inflicted with lasting harm .
All such conduct neglects parental responsibility and violates Scripture .
B. Control Children by Prompt Action , Not by Words .
Some parents try to control children by words .
Dr. Dobson ( DTD , pp 9,10 ) gives an example of a woman whose children would run completely unrestrained throughout the neighborhood .
Her form of " discipline " was to run out her door from time to time and scream , " I have had it with you ; I have had it with you children ! "
Then she would turn and go back into the house , while her children continued to terrorize the neighborhood !
All of us know such methods are ineffective .
But many make the same mistake in other ways .
They may nag and harp , threaten and scold : " What 's the matter with you , Son .
You never do what I say .
What am I going to do with you ?
It seems like you 're always getting into something .
Why can't you do what you 're told ?
Other children obey their parents , why can't you ?
Etc. , etc. , etc . "
" This is the last time I 'm going to tell you that this is the last time I 'm going to tell you ! "
Others try to control children by getting loud or by long lectures .
We made mistakes in this area .
One of us would get loud and gruff with the kids ; the other would repeatedly give long lectures .
This may not be sinful , but the point is that it is not effective .
In church meetings we see children misbehave , so parents repeatedly whisper to them , tug at them , shake them , grab them and sit them down .
But the problem continues .
The problem is that the child gets used to talk and simply turns it off .
It may work at first , but then he learns to gauge how loud , how angry , how long you threaten and scold before you do anything .
Then he will push you to the limit .
He will pay no attention until you reach the fever pitch where he thinks you are about to take action .
The parent gets louder and angrier until finally he ends up having to punish the child anyway .
Further , the parent 's verbal barrage often results in a return barrage .
We scold ; he argues and fusses .
We scold louder and longer ; he argues and fusses louder and longer .
Other family members overhear .
The result is that everyone becomes angry , frustrated , and upset .
Proverbs 13:24 - He who spares his rod hates his son ,
But he who loves him disciplines him promptly ( NKJV ; cf. Heb. 12:5-11 ) .
We think we are showing love for the child by not punishing him , but we would show more love and have a better relationship if we would just punish and get it over with .
The solution is to use action to motivate .
We should talk to the child once enough to make sure he understands what is expected .
If he is old enough to understand and if circumstances are appropriate , we should explain our reasons .
If he disobeys , we may explain a second time to be sure he understands .
But if he understands what we want and he just does not want to obey , then it is time for action , not words .
If you discipline " promptly , " soon you wo n't have to argue with him .
He will obey " promptly , " because he now knows that you will back up your words with action .
The result of disciplining " promptly " is that eventually you end up disciplining less , and meanwhile you have a much more peaceful home .
Arguing begets arguing ; action begets action .
C. Always Control Yourself When Disciplining .
Ephesians 4:26 - Be angry and do not sin .
Being angry with our children is not necessarily sinful , but if we are not careful it can lead to sin .
When we become extremely angry and agitated , there is danger that we may make decisions that are bad for the child .
We may even lose control and cause serious violence and harm .
So we really should keep ourselves under control , and administer discipline calmly .
But how do we accomplish this ?
Interestingly enough , the answer is the same as the last point :
Take action early , before the situation gets out of hand .
Obtain action from the child by taking action yourself .
He is not likely to do what you say until he thinks you will take action if he does not .
So do n't keep postponing the action .
When the child does something that you will eventually punish him for if he does not change , warn him calmly once or twice .
If he does not obey , calmly punish him .
Consistent application of this approach will lead to less arguing , less anger , less upset , and less threatening .
But the result will also be less punishment , in the long run .
Why ?
Because when the child learns that you mean what you say , he will act when you tell him to , instead of agitating till you have to punish him .
By punishing more promptly , you end up punishing less frequently .
Greater commitment to action leads to decreased need for action .
More is less .
Yes , you can and should learn to punish children calmly .
Remember it : Arguing begets arguing ; action begets action .
D. Measure the Effectiveness of Your Methods by the Child 's Obedience .
Ephesians 6:1 - Children obey your parents .
Obedience is the goal of our training !
Do n't judge your effectiveness by how much the child cries , fusses , or throws a fit .
Some parents spank hard enough to cause crying , but not hard enough to cause obedience !
They give little smacks that would n't hurt anybody .
The child fusses so the parents think they 've done the job and stop punishing .
And the child continues to do as he wants .
Once when my mother spanked me , I told my sister , " It did n't hurt .
I just cried so she 'd quit . "
My sister told Mother , and Mother did the job again to make sure it hurt !
The fact a child cries does not prove he is sorry for his wrong and wo n't do it any more .
Some crying is a form of rebellion , protest , or expression of anger .
Some children hope their crying will get on their parents ' nerves , make them feel guilty , or embarrass them if others hear it .
Or maybe the parents will just get tired of all the fuss and trouble , and decide to drop the matter .
But if the child is n't doing what you told him to do , your job is n't done yet , no matter how much he cries .
Punish him some more till he obeys you !
Determine the methods you use by what WORKS .
Do not automatically resort to spanking .
Maybe with a certain child in a certain situation , just a good discussion will solve the matter .
Or maybe you can give a lesser punishment or take away a privilege .
Different children react differently to different approaches .
Learn what works best with each child under various circumstances .
But use what produces the desired obedience .
Be sure your rewards are really something the child likes , and your punishments are something he dislikes .
In Uncle Remus ' tales , Br'er Fox caught Br'er Rabbit and wanted to make him suffer .
Br'er Rabbit convinced Br'er
Fox that he would suffer terribly , if Br'er Fox would fling him into the briar patch .
But when it happened , Br'er Rabbit was happy as could be , because the briar patch was his home !
Some punishments are simply inadequate .
Some parents spank on a diaper or on an older child 's blue jeans .
It makes a loud noise , but the child may feel little or nothing .
I always pulled my children 's clothing up or down and spanked on their bare thigh .
It 's a punishment .
Make sure it hurts !
Sometimes we may think we are punishing our children ; but if they do n't change their behavior , then apparently they do n't consider the punishment to be severe enough .
Continue working on the problem till the child acts as he should .
Never let the child win a battle of wills .
With many children there will come a time - perhaps several or even many times - when he will stubbornly set his will against yours and dare you to make him obey .
The Bible calls it " stiff - necked . "
When that happens , you cannot afford to lose that battle .
If you must spank the child a dozen times , he must learn that , when the parent " puts his foot down , " then the child is not going to win .
This is not a matter of stubbornness and egotism by the parent .
It is a principle of authority for everyone 's good .
If the child finds out that , if he is stubborn long enough , he can get his way , then he will be ten times more stubborn next time .
But if you can prove without question , while the child is a pre-schooler , that what you say is the way it will be , then there will be far fewer challenges to your authority in later years , including the rebellious teen years .
This is not to say we should refuse to listen to reason .
If the child can give good reasons for us to change our minds , that is one matter .
But we are discussing a conflict of wills in which the child just does n't want to do what we told him to do .
In that case , you must keep on punishing until the child submits .
You must not let him have his way !
The goal is obedience .
E. Consider the Reasons Why Your Child Acts as He Does .
How you respond to a child should be determined by why he is acting as he does .
Ephesians 6:4 - Do not provoke children to anger .
You might demand too much because a child is simply too young to understand or be able to do what you asked .
Maybe you did not explain clearly enough what you wanted .
Maybe he just honestly forgot due to time lapse , tiredness , excitement of circumstances , etc .
Maybe he has an unfilled emotional need , and acts as he does out of fear or insecurity or a desire for love and attention .
These situations should be handled differently from outright rebellion .
But when the child knows what you want ( or ought to know ) , but he is just rebellious , self - willed , stubborn , and does not want to do what you want , this child must be punished to motivate him to obey .
How can we determine the child 's motives ?
This is not always easy .
It requires thought , experience , and knowledge of the child .
Perhaps parents should discuss these matters together .
Here are some thoughts to help .
Put yourself in the child 's place .
When you were his age , how would you have acted and felt in his place ?
How should you have been handled to produce desired conduct ?
" Do unto others ... " ( Matt. 7:12 ) .
Consider how the child would act if he WANTED to do a thing .
Suppose you tell little Johnny to do something , but he fusses and squirms and cries and makes everybody miserable .
You may think maybe Johnny is too tired or maybe he 's sick .
But five minutes later he is doing something he likes , so now he is all smiles and happiness .
That proves little Johnny can be pleasant if he wants to - it 's your job to see to it that he wants to !
Maybe Johnny says he is too sick to go to school .
But then he wants to stay up and play with his toys or go outside and play .
When I said I was too sick to go to school , my mother made me stay in bed all day to get better !
So consider whether he is capable of understanding , remembering , and accomplishing the thing you asked of him if it were something he wanted to do .
If the answer is " yes , " then your job is to give him sufficient reason to want to !
F. Generally Children Should Be Disciplined in Private .
Sometimes a child misbehaves in public places , other people 's homes , or in the presence of company .
Disciplining him around other people may embarrass him , you , and the other people .
And in today 's society so - called child advocates may harass you .
But if you do n't discipline the child , he soon learns he can misbehave around other people without consequences .
One solution is to call the child to you and inform him as privately as possible what you want ( whisper , etc . ) .
If firmer measures are needed , find or ask for a private room .
( This could be a rest room , a bedroom , a car , etc. ) .
Take the child there and proceed to discipline as you would at home .
If he is old enough to understand , you may tell him you will discipline him when you get home .
Suppose a child is being noisy or otherwise disruptive during a church meeting .
Some people think , if they take the child out , it will be embarrassing or will disturb others .
But by not disciplining the child , they make matters worse because the child continues to disrupt other people .
When your child is distracting other people in worship assemblies , take him out and solve his problem .
Then bring him back when he is under control so he will not distract others .
G. Never Offer a Child a Reward to Stop Misbehaving .
If he is already doing wrong , and you offer a reward to quit , then you have really rewarded and reinforced his misbehavior .
Next time he wants that reward , he will misbehave hoping to receive the reward again .
Suppose you call Billy to come and he says , " No , I won't ! "
So you offer him candy if he 'll come .
What will happen next time you call him ?
He 'll remember that , if he says " No , " he may get some candy !
The time to offer a reward is before the child has done anything wrong , while you are asking him to do something good .
Or just give him the reward after he did the good deed , but do n't wait till he 's already doing something wrong and then offer him a reward to quit .
H. Talk to the Child Before and After You Punish Him .
Discuss the incident .
Explain why it was wrong and what the child should have done .
After the punishment , make sure the child is sorry : make him say he 's sorry and make him promise to do right next time .
If he has refused to do something you told him to do , take him back and make him do it .
Then be sure to tell the child you love him and you expect him to do better next time , etc .
There are many advantages to this .
(1) It helps you keep calm .
(2) It makes sure the child understands why he is being punished and what you expect in the future .
(3) It helps him remember the lesson .
You certainly have his attention , so it is an excellent time to instruct him .
(4) It enables you to assure him of your love and concern for what 's best for him .
You make sure he understands that you care about him , but you must not allow that kind of conduct .
(5) Often your talk will cause the child to feel bad just by the fact he knows he has disappointed you .
Gwendolyn Webb says to " make a spanking an event " ( TUAC , pp. 168-170 ) .
She means do n't just keep scolding a child and smacking him so the situation gets drug out repeatedly .
Take him out , talk to him , give him a spanking , make him apologize and do what you told him , etc .
Make it an event he will remember , so he is not likely to make the same error again .
Conclusion
Romans 11:22 - Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God : on those who fell , severity ; but toward you , goodness , if you continue in His goodness .
God is a God of both rewards and punishments .
He is our example of a good father .
We should consider the principles
He uses to motivate obedience and apply those principles in our homes according to the Scriptures .

Still have some questions you need answered ?
Ever wonder why I believe most of the people in this country are drooling , partially retarded meatsacks ?
See , e.g. , CNN :
President Obama ’s speech on the gulf oil disaster may have gone over the heads of many in his audience , according to an analysis of the 18 - minute talk released Wednesday .
Tuesday night ’s speech from the Oval Office of the White House was written to a 9.8 grade level , said Paul J.J. Payack , president of Global Language Monitor .
The Austin , Texas - based company analyzes and catalogues trends in word usage and word choice and their impact on culture .
Though the president used slightly less than four sentences per paragraph , his 19.8 words per sentence “ added some difficulty for his target audience , ” Payack said .
He singled out this sentence from Obama as unfortunate : “ That is why just after the rig sank , I assembled a team of our nation ’s best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge — a team led by Dr. Steven Chu , a Nobel Prize - winning physicist and our nation ’s secretary of energy . ”
“ A little less professorial , less academic and more ordinary , ” Payack recommended .
“ That ’s the type of phraseology that makes you ( appear ) aloof and out of touch . ”
As Bill Maher often says , we really are a stupid and unserious people .
Will someone please wake me up when civilization is about to end ?
Thanks .
Update : Steve Benen is nonplussed :
So , let me get this straight .
The lead CNN.com story this morning was a piece quoting an alleged expert , complaining that the president spoke to the country at nearly a 10th - grade level .
Obama , apparently , should have dumbed it down for us .
I realize the Oval Office address had more than its share of detractors , but this is really a question separate from the substantive content .
The complaint here is that our discourse has reached a point at which the president will be criticized for not talking down more to the public .
The expert CNN relied on said some of Obama ’s longer sentences used “ the type of phraseology that makes you ( appear ) aloof and out of touch . ”
He recommended that the president be “ more ordinary ” in his choice of words .
Sigh .
Update 2 : Interestingly enough , it looks like the language guy CNN had on is a big fraud :

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - BP
Plc said an ambitious deep - sea operation to choke off a gushing oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico was proceeding as planned on Wednesday , while President Barack Obama cautioned Americans there was no guarantee it would work .
BP is under intense pressure from Obama to bring a swift end to the five - week - old leak that threatens an environmental catastrophe and a blow to Obama ’s crisis - manager image .
Undersea robots were helping to inject heavy fluids and ultimately cement pumped down about a mile to the sea- bed well , while BP chief executive Tony Hayward and U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu monitored operations together in Houston .
“ The operation is proceeding as we planned it , ” Hayward said in a media briefing four hours after launching the “ top kill ” strategy to stanch the leak .
“ It will be another 24 hours before we know whether or not this has been successful , ” he added .
The embattled CEO stood by BP ’s 60 - 70 percent odds of success .
But top kill , a routine procedure on the surface , has never been attempted at such depths , prompting one industry expert to put the odds of success at less than 50 percent .
“ You have got some of the smartest guys in the business trying to figure this out , but it has never been done before , ” David Pursell , partner at Houston investment bank Tudor , Pickering , Holt & Co , told Reuters Insider .
“ I think the odds have to be 50 percent or less , ” he added .
Obama said that if successful , BP ’s plan to cap the well should greatly reduce or eliminate the flow of hundreds of thousands of gallons ( liters ) of crude billowing into the Gulf .
If it fails , “ there are other approaches that may be viable , ” he said on a trip to California .
Obama , who has told aides to “ plug the damn hole , ” will head to Louisiana on Friday for the second time since the April 20 rig blast that killed 11 and unleashed the oil .
BP says the next approach would be to install a containment device over the broken blowout preventer , a structure at the top of the well on the ocean floor , to try to stop the oil flow .
It would attempt this in the next three or four days .
It is still unclear how much oil is flowing from the well , but it is already shaping up to be the worst oil spill in U.S. history and a long - term threat to a rich ecosystem .
The oil ’s destruction of critical habitats continued to spread , with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal saying that more than 100 miles of the state ’s 400 - mile coastline were now affected .
A BP statement said the top kill action began at 1 p.m. CST after the U.S. Coast Guard approved the operation , the most ambitious effort to date to cap the well .
PIVOTAL DAYS FOR OBAMA , BP
These days may be critical for the London - based energy giant and Obama .

BP ’s reputation and its big presence in the United States is at stake and investors , who have wiped $ 50 billion off BP ’s market value since the start of the spill , will watch closely to see whether the latest attempt to seal the well works .
BP shares seesawed in London trading , with investors boosting the share price about 2.6 percent at one point before it closed up 1.4 percent .
BP ’s announcement that it had launched the new operation came after London markets had closed .
If the effort fails , Obama may have no choice but to take charge of the response .
He has so far deflected calls for the government to take a more direct role and said BP has legal responsibility for fixing the mess .
What he can do is unclear because the government does not have its own deepwater tools and technology and will have to rely on BP .
Slideshow ( 28 images )
But even with Obama applying constant pressure on the company , polls show that nearly half of Americans are unhappy with how he has handled it .
That sentiment could play into the November elections that are widely expected to erode his Democratic Party ’s control of the U.S. Congress .
Florida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson said if BP failed to plug the leak this week , Obama must seize personal control of the effort immediately .
“ If this thing does n’t work then the president ought to turn this over to the military .
It has the command structure to bring in all the civilian agencies , ” said Nelson .
LOST COASTLINE EXASPERATES LOCALS
Residents of the Gulf region are particularly concerned about the impact of spreading oil on wildlife and area shorelines , home to a lucrative fishing and tourism business .
Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , one of the worst affected Louisiana coastal districts so far , sharply criticized BP executives and Coast Guard leaders , saying they had no comprehensive plan to defend the coast from the oil .
“ We will lose more coastline from this catastrophe than from all four hurricanes -- Katrina , Rita , Gustav and Ike , ” said Nungesser .
Commercial fishing , shrimping and oyster harvests have been shut down for weeks along much of the Gulf coast , home to a $ 6.5 billion seafood industry .
BP said it had appointed an independent mediator to oversee damage claims .
More than 26,000 claims have been submitted so far , resulting in payments of more than $ 36 million .
BP has estimated that about 5,000 barrels ( 210,000 gallons / 795,000 liters ) have been leaking every day , although some scientists have given much higher numbers for the size of the leak -- up to 20 times more .
The head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , Jane Lubchenco , told a congressional hearing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would provide a new estimate within two weeks on the amount of oil leaking from the well .
“ It ’s only been in the last couple of days that we have gotten video that was high enough resolution , long enough length and fast enough shutter speed to really do credible calculations , ” Lubchenco said .
The Pentagon ’s spy unit has quietly begun to rebuild a database for tracking potential terrorist threats that was shut down after it emerged that it had been collecting information on American anti-war activists .
The Defense Intelligence Agency filed notice this week that it plans to create a new section called Foreign Intelligence and Counterintelligence Operation Records , whose purpose will be to “ document intelligence , counterintelligence , counterterrorism and counternarcotic operations relating to the protection of national security . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
But while the unit ’s name refers to “ foreign intelligence , ” civil liberties advocates and the Pentagon ’s own description of the program suggest that Americans will likely be included in the new database .
FICOR replaces a program called Talon , which the DIA created in 2002 under then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as part of the counterterrorism efforts following the 9/11 attacks .
It was disbanded in 2007 after it emerged that Talon had retained information on anti-war protesters , including Quakers , even after it was determined they posed no threat to national security .
DIA spokesman Donald Black told Newsweek that the new database would not include the more controversial elements of the old Talon program .
But Jeff Stein at the Washington Post reports that the new program will evidently inherit the old Talon database .
“ Why the new depository would want such records while its parent agency no longer has a law enforcement function could not be learned , ” Stein reports .
“ Nor could it be learned whether the repository will include intelligence reports on protest groups gathered by its predecessor . ”
The Pentagon ’s notice states that the database will collect “ identifying information such as name , Social Security Number ( SSN ) , address , citizenship documentation , biometric data , passport number , vehicle identification number and vehicle / vessel license data . ”
As only US residents have Social Security Numbers , it appears the program is being designed at least partly to contain domestic information .
ADVERTISEMENT
Newsweek cites two unnamed US officials as suggesting that the new program essentially echoes the old one .
When CIFA , the DIA division running Talon , was disbanded in 2008 , “ many of its personnel and some of its functions were transferred ” to the new DIA unit running the new database program .
The new program will be housed “ in the same office space that CIFA once occupied , in a complex near suburban WashingtonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Reagan National Airport . ”
Mike German , a former FBI agent now working with the ACLU , says “ Americans should be just as concerned ” about the new database as the previous one under the Bush administration .
“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a little hard to tell what this is exactly , but we do know that DIA took over ‘ offensive counterintelligence ’ for the DoD once CIFA was abandoned , ” he told the Post ‘s Stein .
“ It therefore makes sense that this new DIA database would be collecting the same types of information that CIFA collected improperly . ”

Over 14,000 tons of humanitarian aid were transferred from Israel into the Gaza Strip last week , the IDF announced on Tuesday in its weekly summary of COGAT operations .
" A total of 637 truckloads , consisting of 14,069 tons of humanitarian aid , were transferred into the Gaza Strip from Israel via the various crossings , " read a statement by the IDF Spokesperson .
According to the statement , the shipments consisted of hundreds of thousands of liters of fuel ; 21 truckloads of milk formula and baby food ; 897 tons of cooking gas , 66 truckloads of fruits and vegetables ; 51 truckloads of wheat , 27 truckloads of meat , poultry and fish ; 40 truckloads of dairy products ; 117 truckloads of animal food ; 37 truckloads of hygiene products ; 22 truckloads of sugar ; and 38 truckloads of clothing and shoes .
In addition , 781 medical patients the Gaza Strip crossed into Israel and the West Bank along with their chaperones for medical treatment .
Into Gaza , meanwhile , went four truckloads of medicine and medical equipment .
Aside from humanitarian and medical supplies , 191 staff members of international organizations crossed into the Gaza Strip , and 202 crossed from the Gaza Strip into Israel .
Graphic designers and photographers know the pain of translating RGB image information on screen into CMYK print on paper .
Even with the best understanding of the alchemy of color management , RGB displays and CMYK printing processes simply cannot recreate the same hues and intensities of every color .
Apple has filed for a patent on an idea to help those whose bread and butter still involves printing : make the display CMYK .
Most displays use the additive red - green - blue color model , which attempts to mimic how our eyes interpret color .
By mixing various intensities of red , green , and blue light in each pixel location , displays can reproduce some 16.7 million combinations of hue and intensity .
Even the best displays , however , can only reproduce a limited subset of the colors most humans can perceive .
Printing processes , on the other hand , use a subtractive cyan - magenta - yellow color model .
By increasing the amount of cyan , magenta , or yellow pigments or dyes , wavelengths are gradually subtracted from white light to produce a range of colors .
Photographic prints use CMY dyes , whereas many inkjets and most commercial printing processes add black ink ( ' B ' already stands for blue , so ' K ' stands for black , hence CMYK ) to reduce the amount of ink needed to make black .
This also accommodates for the fact that most CMY inks alone can't make a very deep , rich black .
This diagram compares the gamuts of sRGB , AdobeRGB , CMYK , and Hexachrome to the CIE color space .
Due to the differences between transmissive light and reflected light , as well as the fact that inks do n't necessarily match the theoretical cyan , magenta , and yellow colors needed to reproduce a wide range of colors , CMYK processes generally reproduce a much smaller subset of the colors of a typical RGB display .
Color management attempts to mitigate this discrepancy , but it is far from perfect .
Inkjet manufacturers and printing ink manufacturers have attempted to expand the gamut of possible colors by adding additional colors to the mix .
However , Apple 's senior scientist Gabriel Marcu and director of display engineering Wei Chen considered a different solution .
They propose building a display that uses CMY subtractive filters to generate colors instead of RGB subpixels .
Apple filed a patent application for their invention , " Subtractive Display , " in September 2009 , which was published by the USPTO late last week .
If the filters are formulated correctly , the display could more closely match the color gamut of traditional printing processes , making it easier for designers and photographers to better visualize the final product onscreen .
Such a display would have limited applications , since print production is generally on the decline as more media is consumed on computers , HDTVs , and mobile devices like the iPad or smartphones .
But for those that depend on reliable , accurate print output , such a display could be indispensable .
Back in April , we blogged about Ronnie Gardner , a death row inmate in Utah .
As we wrote , Gardner ( pictured ) is n't just any old death - row inmate .
Gardner has asked to be executed by firing squad .
Utah is only one of two remaining states that allow executions by firing squad ( Oklahoma also allows them , albeit under limited circumstances ) .
The AP on Tuesday updated the situation , which has n't changed all that much since late April , when a state judge signed Gardner 's execution warrant .
Barring a last - minute reprieve , Gardner will be strapped into a chair , hooded , brandished with a small white target , and shot to death on June 18 .
Like most other states , Utah lawmakers made lethal injection the default method of execution in 2004 , but inmates condemned before then can still choose the firing squad .
That 's what Gardner did in April , politely telling a judge , " I would like the firing squad , please . "
Neither he nor his attorneys have said why .

County pays $ 20,000 to replace medical marijuana
May 25 , 2010
By KAREN VELIE
In yet another black mark against the current sheriff ’s administration , San Luis Obispo County cut a $ 20,000 check on Monday to a medical marijuana user whose cannabis was wrongfully destroyed .
In what appears to be the first time a government body has reimbursed a medical marijuana user for destroying their cannabis , the county paid 46 - year - old Kimberly Marshall the equivalent of $ 3,333 per pound , the replacement value for this specially grown outdoor strain .
In a request for prosecution that was ultimately rejected by the county district attorney ’s office , Sheriff ’s Deputy David Walker noted that Marshall had in her possession a medical marijuana card and a physician ’s statement that allowed her to possess up to six pounds of dried marijuana buds .
The district attorney rejected the sheriff ’s request for prosecution based on Marshall ’s medical defense .
A few days later , the sheriff ’s department filed a request for an order to destroy the cannabis with assertions that there had been no claims that it was medical marijuana .
“ To the best of my knowledge , there has not been any request for return of medical marijuana for medical reasons … , each case of medical marijuana was reviewed and determined not to be for medical purposes , ” McDaniel said in his request .
In September , after sheriff ’s officials destroyed Marshall ’s medical marijuana , Deputy County Counsel Ann Duggan claimed sheriff deputies were unaware the buds were for medical use .
“ As far as I understand the factual background , the sheriff ’s department has no record of your client ’s possession of a physician ’s statement , ” Duggan said in a letter to Marshall ’s attorney .
In response , Louis Koory , Marshall ’s attorney , filed a civil claim asking the county to pay to replace Marshall ’s medical marijuana .
“ The sheriff and the county were aware that under California law the Sheriff was compelled to return the claimant ’s property in the absence of pending criminal action , ” Koory said in the civil claim he filed on Dec. 23 .
Following a liver cancer diagnosis , doctors informed Marshall she had less than a year to live .
Though currently in remission , daily nausea , a side effect of the cancer treatment , has caused her weight to drop to as low as 98 pounds .
In addition , a car accident left Marshall with two herniated discs , a fractured disc and a broken disc .
Marshall has endured two back surgeries , has constant pain and for days at a time is bedridden .
Doctors prescribed medical marijuana to ease her pain and nausea .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraqi security forces have arrested a Saudi al - Qaeda member who an official said on Monday was involved in a plot to attack next month ’s World Cup soccer tournament in South Africa .
South African soccer fans cheer their team during a game against Nigeria in the Cape Town International Challenge , April 10 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Mark Wessels
Baghdad security spokesman Major General Qassim al - Moussawi gave no details and offered no evidence for the claim and it was not possible to verify it .
The detention of the Saudi national comes at a time when already frosty relations between Sunni Muslim power Saudi Arabia and now Shi’ite Muslim - led Iraq are under additional strains .
Moussawi ’s allegation about a Saudi ’s involvement in a plot against the World Cup came after former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al - Faisal accused Iraq ’s prime minister of hijacking the country ’s March election .
Moussawi , who reports to the prime minister ’s office , said Abdullah Azzam al - Qahtani was a former Saudi army lieutenant .
“ He was planning to bomb the holy shrines in Najaf and Kerbala , ” Moussawi told a news conference in Baghdad .
“ And he was planning a terrorist act in South Africa during the World Cup based on plans issued by the central al Qaeda terrorist organization in coordination with Osama bin Laden ’s first assistant , Ayman al - Zawahri . ”
Calls to Moussawi seeking more details were not answered .
U.S. military officials in Iraq had no knowledge of the allegations , nor did U.S. intelligence officials in Washington .
In South Africa , police spokesman Colonel Vishnu Naidoo said the first that police heard about the claims was in media reports out of Iraq .
“ The police will investigate the allegations and we will check with the authorities that apprehended the suspect , ” Naidoo said .
South Africa is the first African country to host the World Cup , which takes place June 11 - July 11 .
South African officials have said in the past that no particular terrorist threat had been identified but that there could be risks to teams known to be a target of extremists .
Africa ’s biggest economy has one of the highest rates of murder and rape in the world and 41,000 police will focus on protecting foreign and local fans against criminals in one of the world ’s most violent countries outside a war zone .
ICEY RELATIONS
Moussawi did not say why it took more than two weeks to announce Qahtani ’s capture .
But it came two days after the Saudi criticism of his boss .
According to reports , Saudi Prince Faisal on Saturday reproached Iraq ’s Shi’ite Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki and warned in a speech of spiraling violence as U.S. troops prepare to leave by an end -2011 deadline .
“ Adding to the brutal mayhem taking place there , we are watching a deliberate effort on the part of the incumbent Prime Minister , Mr. Nuri al - Maliki , to hijack the results of the elections and deny the Iraqi people their legitimately elected government , ” he said , according to the online Wall Street Journal .
Relations between Saudi Arabia and Maliki ’s Shi’ite - led government have been difficult .
Saudi Arabia views Shi’ite Iran ’s growing influence in Iraq since Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein was ousted in the 2003 U.S. - led invasion with suspicion .
For his part , Maliki has often accused unnamed Gulf Arab countries of supporting Sunni Islamist insurgents who still kill hundreds of Iraqis every month .
The flow of foreign fighters into Iraq , many of whom were Saudis at the height of the sectarian bloodshed , has slowed dramatically , U.S. military officials say .
Moussawi said Qahtani was previously arrested by U.S. forces in 2007 and released in 2009 .
He said Qahtani participated in attacks against hotels in Baghdad in January and took part in a car bomb attack on a police forensics lab .

SOME priests do not view the molestation of boys as a breach of their celibacy vows , a retired Catholic bishop has claimed .
Geoffrey Robinson , the former auxiliary bishop of Sydney , blames the absence of women from church life as a catalyst for the sexual abuse crisis enveloping the faith .
In an interview with The Australian Women 's Weekly , Mr Robinson says boys suffered more than girls at the hands of paedophile priests partly because they were more available to them , with nuns tending to play a greater role in the religious education of young girls .
There was also a view among some offenders with whom he had worked that a priest 's celibacy vows were n't broken if a boy was involved .
" We 've met it often enough to see it as a factor , " he tells the magazine .
" That 's what the vow of celibacy refers to , being married .
If it 's not an adult woman , then somehow they 're not breaking their vow . "
Three years ago , Mr Robinson broke 50 years of silence about his own abuse at the hands of a stranger , who he said was n't a family member or a priest .
It goes some way to explaining his work with abuse victims and his commitment to change within the church .
He says getting women more involved in church life is a crucial step forward .
" If the feminine had been given greater importance and a much larger voice , the church would not have seen anything like the same level of abuse and would most certainly have responded far better , " he said .
He believes the issue will not be properly dealt with until the church holds a council , or a conference of all the bishops in the church , to revise the centuries - old doctrine on celibacy , women and sexuality .

Japan has hosted the world 's first wedding to be conducted by a robot .
The automated creature , known as the I - Fairy , oversaw the wedding of Tomohiro Shibata and Satoko Inoue in the capital , Tokyo .
The couple decided to use the robot as they are both connected with Japan 's thriving robotics industry .
Since robots had brought them together in the first place , they said , having one officiate at their wedding was a natural choice .
During the ceremony , I - Fairy - which has flashing eyes and plastic pigtails - instructed the groom to lift the bride 's veil for the kiss .
The wedding took part in a rooftop restaurant in the Japanese capital .
New CityCat ferry terminals have been announced for Teneriffe and the Northshore Hamilton complex near Brisbane Airport .
Brisbane City Council has been reviewing potential new stops for CityCats for more than 12 months , evaluating private sector involvement in the new stops .
An artist 's impression of the Northshore Hamilton CityCat terminal and ( inset ) the Teneriffe CityCat Terminal .
Lord Mayor Campbell Newman said the Northshore Hamilton CityCat stop would be running in two years " at no cost to ratepayers " .
brisbanetimes.com.au understands the $ 5 million Northshore Hamilton CityCat stop will be totally funded by the Urban Land Development Association .
The Chattanooga Police Department apologized Tuesday for arresting a man who ran two red lights while rushing his wife to the hospital .
The apology came after all seven charges filed against Eric Jesse Wright were dropped by the Hamilton County district attorney 's office .
" We deeply regret this incident has occurred and hope to meet with Mr. and Mrs. Wright at their earliest convenience to discuss the events of June 16 , " said Lt. Kim Noorbergen , spokeswoman for the department .
The Wrights plan to meet today at noon with interim police Chief Mark Rawlston , said the couple 's friend and spokeswoman Laura Goggans .
They will be bringing legal counsel , she said .
On June 16 , Mr. Wright said , he believed his wife , Aline , was suffering from a possible stroke and rushed her to Erlanger hospital , running two red lights on the way and catching the attention of Officer James Daves .
After arriving at the hospital , Officer Daves approached Mr. Wright and told him he was going to be arrested .
Mr. Wright , 27 , eventually was charged with seven crimes including assault on police , disorderly conduct , reckless endangerment , felony evading arrest , registration expired and two counts of traffic signals violations .
He was booked into the Hamilton County Jail and released on bond .
Under Tennessee 's Necessity Law , however , Mr. Wright 's need to reach the hospital overrode the laws he was charged with breaking , according to the motion filed by the DA 's office to drop the charges .
The police department agreed with that decision , Lt. Noorbergen said .
Mrs. Wright , 22 , stayed in the hospital for a few days after the incident , she said .
She is a cancer survivor whose left leg was amputated above the knee and who suffers from a heart condition as a result of previous chemotherapy .
Both Wrights work at Erlanger .
She is an emergency room nurse ; he is a nurse technician who served as a medic in Iraq with the U.S. Army .
Officer Daves was placed on paid administrative leave while the police department 's internal affairs division investigates the incident , officials have said .
The investigation will continue at the direction of interim Chief Rawlston , Lt. Noorbergen said .
Any further action by the Wrights is " going to depend on how the DA responds to Officer Daves , " Mrs. Goggans said .
" If they just give him a slap on the wrist , then the Wrights will file a complaint .
THE NECESSITY DEFENSE
Under Tennessee law , conduct that otherwise would be criminal is justified if it is immediately necessary to avoid imminent harm .
Moreover , the need to avoid harm must outweigh the harm to society or the interests of others brought about through the defendant 's act .
" The Wrights do n't wish Officer Daves any ill will and do n't want revenge on him , " she said .
" They just want others to be able to get the hospital care they need without fear of obstruction . "
While Mrs. Wright spoke about the incident last week , since then the couple has n't spoken in public .
Mrs. Goggans said the Wrights were shocked by what happened and want to be careful with any legal ramifications that might arise if they were to speak in public .
With the charges dropped , the Wrights plan to meet with their lawyers to " review everything to make sure it's all clear , " she said .
And Mrs. Wright still has medical problems , Mrs. Goggans said .
" Aline is not 100 percent better ; she still has numbness on the left side of her body , " she said .

The Deepwater Horizon disaster is not just an industrial accident – it is a violent wound inflicted on the Earth itself .
In this special report from the Gulf coast , a leading author and activist shows how it lays bare the hubris at the heart of capitalism
Everyone gathered for the town hall meeting had been repeatedly instructed to show civility to the gentlemen from BP and the federal government .
These fine folks had made time in their busy schedules to come to a high school gymnasium on a Tuesday night in Plaquemines Parish , Louisiana , one of many coastal communities where brown poison was slithering through the marshes , part of what has come to be described as the largest environmental disaster in US history .
" Speak to others the way you would want to be spoken to , " the chair of the meeting pleaded one last time before opening the floor for questions .
And for a while the crowd , mostly made up of fishing families , showed remarkable restraint .
They listened patiently to Larry Thomas , a genial BP public relations flack , as he told them that he was committed to " doing better " to process their claims for lost revenue – then passed all the details off to a markedly less friendly subcontractor .
They heard out the suit from the Environmental Protection Agency as he informed them that , contrary to what they have read about the lack of testing and the product being banned in Britain , the chemical dispersant being sprayed on the oil in massive quantities was really perfectly safe .
But patience started running out by the third time Ed Stanton , a coast guard captain , took to the podium to reassure them that " the coast guard intends to make sure that BP cleans it up " .
" Put it in writing ! " someone shouted out .
By now the air conditioning had shut itself off and the coolers of Budweiser were running low .
A shrimper named Matt O'Brien approached the mic .
" We do n't need to hear this anymore , " he declared , hands on hips .
It did n't matter what assurances they were offered because , he explained , " we just do n't trust you guys ! "
And with that , such a loud cheer rose up from the floor you'd have thought the Oilers ( the unfortunately named school football team ) had scored a touchdown .
The showdown was cathartic , if nothing else .
For weeks residents had been subjected to a barrage of pep talks and extravagant promises coming from Washington , Houston and London .
Every time they turned on their TVs , there was the BP boss , Tony Hayward , offering his solemn word that he would " make it right " .
Or else it was President Barack Obama expressing his absolute confidence that his administration would " leave the Gulf coast in better shape than it was before " , that he was " making sure " it " comes back even stronger than it was before this crisis " .
It all sounded great .
But for people whose livelihoods put them in intimate contact with the delicate chemistry of the wetlands , it also sounded completely ridiculous , painfully so .
Once the oil coats the base of the marsh grass , as it had already done just a few miles from here , no miracle machine or chemical concoction could safely get it out .
You can skim oil off the surface of open water , and you can rake it off a sandy beach , but an oiled marsh just sits there , slowly dying .
The larvae of countless species for which the marsh is a spawning ground – shrimp , crab , oysters and fin fish – will be poisoned .
It was already happening .
Earlier that day , I travelled through nearby marshes in a shallow water boat .
Fish were jumping in waters encircled by white boom , the strips of thick cotton and mesh BP is using to soak up the oil .
The circle of fouled material seemed to be tightening around the fish like a noose .
Nearby , a red - winged blackbird perched atop a 2 metre ( 7ft ) blade of oil - contaminated marsh grass .
Death was creeping up the cane ; the small bird may as well have been standing on a lit stick of dynamite .
And then there is the grass itself , or the Roseau cane , as the tall sharp blades are called .
If oil seeps deeply enough into the marsh , it will not only kill the grass above ground but also the roots .
Those roots are what hold the marsh together , keeping bright green land from collapsing into the Mississippi River delta and the Gulf of Mexico .
So not only do places like Plaquemines Parish stand to lose their fisheries , but also much of the physical barrier that lessens the intensity of fierce storms like hurricane Katrina .
Which could mean losing everything .
How long will it take for an ecosystem this ravaged to be " restored and made whole " as Obama 's interior secretary has pledged to do ?
It 's not at all clear that such a thing is remotely possible , at least not in a time frame we can easily wrap our heads around .
The Alaskan fisheries have yet to fully recover from the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill and some species of fish never returned .
Government scientists now estimate that as much as a Valdez - worth of oil may be entering the Gulf coastal waters every four days .
An even worse prognosis emerges from the 1991 Gulf war spill , when an estimated 11 m barrels of oil were dumped into the Persian Gulf – the largest spill ever .
That oil entered the marshland and stayed there , burrowing deeper and deeper thanks to holes dug by crabs .
It 's not a perfect comparison , since so little clean - up was done , but according to a study conducted 12 years after the disaster , nearly 90 % of the impacted muddy salt marshes and mangroves were still profoundly damaged .
We do know this .
Far from being " made whole , " the Gulf coast , more than likely , will be diminished .
Its rich waters and crowded skies will be less alive than they are today .
The physical space many communities occupy on the map will also shrink , thanks to erosion .
And the coast 's legendary culture will contract and wither .
The fishing families up and down the coast do not just gather food , after all .
They hold up an intricate network that includes family tradition , cuisine , music , art and endangered languages – much like the roots of grass holding up the land in the marsh .
Without fishing , these unique cultures lose their root system , the very ground on which they stand .
( BP , for its part , is well aware of the limits of recovery .
The company 's Gulf of Mexico regional oil spill response plan specifically instructs officials not to make " promises that property , ecology , or anything else will be restored to normal " .
Which is no doubt why its officials consistently favour folksy terms like " make it right " . )
If Katrina pulled back the curtain on the reality of racism in America , the BP disaster pulls back the curtain on something far more hidden : how little control even the most ingenious among us have over the awesome , intricately interconnected natural forces with which we so casually meddle .
BP can not plug the hole in the Earth that it made .
Obama cannot order fish species to survive , or brown pelicans not to go extinct ( no matter whose ass he kicks ) .
No amount of money – not BP 's recently pledged $ 20 bn ( £ 13.5 bn ) , not $ 100 bn – can replace a culture that has lost its roots .
And while our politicians and corporate leaders have yet to come to terms with these humbling truths , the people whose air , water and livelihoods have been contaminated are losing their illusions fast .
" Everything is dying , " a woman said as the town hall meeting was finally coming to a close .
" How can you honestly tell us that our Gulf is resilient and will bounce back ?
Because not one of you up here has a hint as to what is going to happen to our Gulf .
You sit up here with a straight face and act like you know when you do n't know . "
This Gulf coast crisis is about many things – corruption , deregulation , the addiction to fossil fuels .
But underneath it all , it 's about this : our culture 's excruciatingly dangerous claim to have such complete understanding and command over nature that we can radically manipulate and re-engineer it with minimal risk to the natural systems that sustain us .
But as the BP disaster has revealed , nature is always more unpredictable than the most sophisticated mathematical and geological models imagine .
During Thursday 's congressional testimony , Hayward said : " The best minds and the deepest expertise are being brought to bear " on the crisis , and that , " with the possible exception of the space programme in the 1960s , it is difficult to imagine the gathering of a larger , more technically proficient team in one place in peacetime . "
And yet , in the face of what the geologist Jill Schneiderman has described as " Pandora 's well " , they are like the men at the front of that gymnasium : they act like they know , but they do n't know .
BP 's mission statement
In the arc of human history , the notion that nature is a machine for us to re-engineer at will is a relatively recent conceit .
In her ground - breaking 1980 book The Death of Nature , the environmental historian Carolyn Merchant reminded readers that up until the 1600s , the Earth was alive , usually taking the form of a mother .
Europeans – like indigenous people the world over – believed the planet to be a living organism , full of life - giving powers but also wrathful tempers .
There were , for this reason , strong taboos against actions that would deform and desecrate " the mother " , including mining .
The metaphor changed with the unlocking of some ( but by no means all ) of nature 's mysteries during the scientific revolution of the 1600s .
With nature now cast as a machine , devoid of mystery or divinity , its component parts could be dammed , extracted and remade with impunity .
Nature still sometimes appeared as a woman , but one easily dominated and subdued .
Sir Francis
Bacon best encapsulated the new ethos when he wrote in the 1623
De dignitate et augmentis scientiarum that nature is to be " put in constraint , moulded , and made as it were new by art and the hand of man " .
Those words may as well have been BP 's corporate mission statement .
Boldly inhabiting what the company called " the energy frontier " , it dabbled in synthesising methane - producing microbes and announced that " a new area of investigation " would be geoengineering .
And of course it bragged that , at its Tiber prospect in the Gulf of Mexico , it now had " the deepest well ever drilled by the oil and gas industry " – as deep under the ocean floor as jets fly overhead .
Imagining and preparing for what would happen if these experiments in altering the building blocks of life and geology went wrong occupied precious little space in the corporate imagination .
As we have all discovered , after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April , the company had no systems in place to effectively respond to this scenario .
Explaining why it did not have even the ultimately unsuccessful containment dome waiting to be activated on shore , a BP spokesman , Steve Rinehart , said : " I do n't think anybody foresaw the circumstance that we 're faced with now . "
Apparently , it " seemed inconceivable " that the blowout preventer would ever fail – so why prepare ?
This refusal to contemplate failure clearly came straight from the top .
A year ago , Hayward told a group of graduate students at Stanford University that he has a plaque on his desk that reads : " If you knew you could not fail , what would you try ? "
Far from being a benign inspirational slogan , this was actually an accurate description of how BP and its competitors behaved in the real world .
In recent hearings on Capitol Hill , congressman Ed Markey of Massachusetts grilled representatives from the top oil and gas companies on the revealing ways in which they had allocated resources .
Over three years , they had spent " $ 39bn to explore for new oil and gas .
Yet , the average investment in research and development for safety , accident prevention and spill response was a paltry $ 20 m a year . "
These priorities go a long way towards explaining why the initial exploration plan that BP submitted to the federal government for the ill - fated Deepwater Horizon well reads like a Greek tragedy about human hubris .
The phrase " little risk " appears five times .
Even if there is a spill , BP confidently predicts that , thanks to " proven equipment and technology " , adverse affects will be minimal .
Presenting nature as a predictable and agreeable junior partner ( or perhaps subcontractor ) , the report cheerfully explains that should a spill occur , " Currents and microbial degradation would remove the oil from the water column or dilute the constituents to background levels " .
The effects on fish , meanwhile , " would likely be sublethal " because of " the capability of adult fish and shellfish to avoid a spill [ and ] to metabolise hydrocarbons " .
( In BP 's telling , rather than a dire threat , a spill emerges as an all - you - can - eat buffet for aquatic life . )
Best of all , should a major spill occur , there is , apparently , " little risk of contact or impact to the coastline " because of the company 's projected speedy response (! ) and " due to the distance [ of the rig ] to shore " – about 48 miles ( 77 km ) .
This is the most astonishing claim of all .
In a gulf that often sees winds of more than 70 km an hour , not to mention hurricanes , BP had so little respect for the ocean 's capacity to ebb and flow , surge and heave , that it did not think oil could make a paltry 77 km trip .
( Last week , a shard of the exploded Deepwater Horizon showed up on a beach in Florida , 306 km away . )
None of this sloppiness would have been possible , however , had BP not been making its predictions to a political class eager to believe that nature had indeed been mastered .
Some , like Republican Lisa Murkowski , were more eager than others .
The Alaskan senator was so awe - struck by the industry 's four - dimensional seismic imaging that she proclaimed deep - sea drilling to have reached the very height of controlled artificiality .
" It 's better than Disneyland in terms of how you can take technologies and go after a resource that is thousands of years old and do so in an environmentally sound way , " she told the Senate energy committee just seven months ago .
Drilling without thinking has of course been Republican party policy since May 2008 .
With gas prices soaring to unprecedented heights , that 's when the conservative leader Newt Gingrich unveiled the slogan " Drill Here , Drill Now , Pay Less " – with an emphasis on the now .
The wildly popular campaign was a cry against caution , against study , against measured action .
In Gingrich 's telling , drilling at home wherever the oil and gas might be – locked in Rocky Mountain shale , in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , and deep offshore – was a surefire way to lower the price at the pump , create jobs , and kick Arab ass all at once .
In the face of this triple win , caring about the environment was for sissies : as senator Mitch McConnell put it , " in Alabama and Mississippi and Louisiana and Texas , they think oil rigs are pretty " .
By the time the infamous " Drill Baby Drill " Republican national convention rolled around , the party base was in such a frenzy for US - made fossil fuels , they would have bored under the convention floor if someone had brought a big enough drill .
Obama , eventually , gave in , as he invariably does .
With cosmic bad timing , just three weeks before the Deepwater Horizon blew up , the president announced he would open up previously protected parts of the country to offshore drilling .
The practice was not as risky as he had thought , he explained .
" Oil rigs today generally do n't cause spills .
They are technologically very advanced . "
That was n't enough for Sarah Palin , however , who sneered at the Obama administration 's plans to conduct more studies before drilling in some areas .
" My goodness , folks , these areas have been studied to death , " she told the Southern Republican leadership conference in New Orleans , now just 11 days before the blowout .
" Let 's drill , baby , drill , not stall , baby , stall ! "
And there was much rejoicing .
In his congressional testimony , Hayward said : " We and the entire industry will learn from this terrible event . "
And one might well imagine that a catastrophe of this magnitude would indeed instil BP executives and the " Drill Now " crowd with a new sense of humility .
There are , however , no signs that this is the case .
The response to the disaster – at the corporate and governmental levels – has been rife with the precise brand of arrogance and overly sunny predictions that created the disaster in the first place .
The ocean is big , she can take it , we heard from Hayward in the early days .
While spokesman John Curry insisted that hungry microbes would consume whatever oil was in the water system , because " nature has a way of helping the situation " .
But nature has not been playing along .
The deep - sea gusher has bust out of all BP 's top hats , containment domes , and junk shots .
The ocean 's winds and currents have made a mockery of the lightweight booms BP has laid out to absorb the oil .
" We told them , " said Byron Encalade , the president of the Louisiana Oysters Association .
" The oil 's gonna go over the booms or underneath the bottom . "
Indeed it did .
The marine biologist Rick Steiner , who has been following the clean up closely , estimates that " 70 % or 80 % of the booms are doing absolutely nothing at all " .
And then there are the controversial chemical dispersants : more than 1.3 m gallons dumped with the company 's trademark " what could go wrong ? " attitude .
As the angry residents at the Plaquemines Parish town hall rightly point out , few tests had been conducted , and there is scant research about what this unprecedented amount of dispersed oil will do to marine life .
Nor is there a way to clean up the toxic mixture of oil and chemicals below the surface .
Yes , fast multiplying microbes do devour underwater oil – but in the process they also absorb the water 's oxygen , creating a whole new threat to marine life .
BP had even dared to imagine that it could prevent unflattering images of oil - covered beaches and birds from escaping the disaster zone .
When I was on the water with a TV crew , for instance , we were approached by another boat whose captain asked , " " Y'all work for BP ? "
When we said no , the response – in the open ocean – was " You ca n't be here then " .
But of course these heavy - handed tactics , like all the others , have failed .
There is simply too much oil in too many places .
" You cannot tell God 's air where to flow and go , and you can't tell water where to flow and go , " I was told by Debra Ramirez .
It was a lesson she had learned from living in Mossville , Louisiana , surrounded by 14 emission - spewing petrochemical plants , and watching illness spread from neighbour to neighbour .
Human limitation has been the one constant of this catastrophe .
After two months , we still have no idea how much oil is flowing , nor when it will stop .
The company 's claim that it will complete relief wells by the end of August – repeated by Obama in his Oval Office address – is seen by many scientists as a bluff .
The procedure is risky and could fail , and there is a real possibility that the oil could continue to leak for years .
The flow of denial shows no sign of abating either .
Louisiana politicians indignantly oppose Obama 's temporary freeze on deepwater drilling , accusing him of killing the one big industry left standing now that fishing and tourism are in crisis .
Palin mused on Facebook that " no human endeavour is ever without risk " , while Texas Republican congressman John Culberson described the disaster as a " statistical anomaly " .
By far the most sociopathic reaction , however , comes from veteran Washington commentator Llewellyn King : rather than turning away from big engineering risks , we should pause in " wonder that we can build machines so remarkable that they can lift the lid off the underworld " .
Make the bleeding stop
Thankfully , many are taking a very different lesson from the disaster , standing not in wonder at humanity 's power to reshape nature , but at our powerlessness to cope with the fierce natural forces we unleash .
There is something else too .
It is the feeling that the hole at the bottom of the ocean is more than an engineering accident or a broken machine .
It is a violent wound in a living organism ; that it is part of us .
And thanks to BP 's live camera feed , we can all watch the Earth 's guts gush forth , in real time , 24 hours a day .
John Wathen , a conservationist with the Waterkeeper Alliance , was one of the few independent observers to fly over the spill in the early days of the disaster .
After filming the thick red streaks of oil that the coast guard politely refers to as " rainbow sheen " , he observed what many had felt : " The Gulf seems to be bleeding . "
This imagery comes up again and again in conversations and interviews .
Monique Harden , an environmental rights lawyer in New Orleans , refuses to call the disaster an " oil spill " and instead says , " we are haemorrhaging " .
Others speak of the need to " make the bleeding stop " .
And I was personally struck , flying over the stretch of ocean where the Deepwater Horizon sank with the US Coast Guard , that the swirling shapes the oil made in the ocean waves looked remarkably like cave drawings : a feathery lung gasping for air , eyes staring upwards , a prehistoric bird .
Messages from the deep .
And this is surely the strangest twist in the Gulf coast saga : it seems to be waking us up to the reality that the Earth never was a machine .
After 400 years of being declared dead , and in the middle of so much death , the Earth is coming alive .
The experience of following the oil 's progress through the ecosystem is a kind of crash course in deep ecology .
Every day we learn more about how what seems to be a terrible problem in one isolated part of the world actually radiates out in ways most of us could never have imagined .
One day we learn that the oil could reach Cuba – then Europe .
Next we hear that fishermen all the way up the Atlantic in Prince Edward Island , Canada , are worried because the Bluefin tuna they catch off their shores are born thousands of miles away in those oil - stained Gulf waters .
And we learn , too , that for birds , the Gulf coast wetlands are the equivalent of a busy airport hub – everyone seems to have a stopover : 110 species of migratory songbirds and 75 % of all migratory US waterfowl .
It 's one thing to be told by an incomprehensible chaos theorist that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can set off a tornado in Texas .
It 's another to watch chaos theory unfold before your eyes .
Carolyn Merchant puts the lesson like this :
" The problem as BP has tragically and belatedly discovered is that nature as an active force cannot be so confined . "
Predictable outcomes are unusual within ecological systems , while " unpredictable , chaotic events [ are ] usual " .
And just in case we still did n't get it , a few days ago , a bolt of lightning struck a BP ship like an exclamation mark , forcing it to suspend its containment efforts .
And do n't even mention what a hurricane would do to BP 's toxic soup .
There is , it must be stressed , something uniquely twisted about this particular path to enlightenment .
They say that Americans learn where foreign countries are by bombing them .
Now it seems we are all learning about nature 's circulatory systems by poisoning them .
In the late 90s , an isolated indigenous group in Colombia captured world headlines with an almost Avatar - esque conflict .
From their remote home in the Andean cloud forests , the U'wa let it be known that if Occidental Petroleum carried out plans to drill for oil on their territory , they would commit mass ritual suicide by jumping off a cliff .
Their elders explained that oil is part of ruiria , " the blood of Mother Earth " .
They believe that all life , including their own , flows from ruiria , so pulling out the oil would bring on their destruction .
( Oxy eventually withdrew from the region , saying there was n't as much oil as it had previously thought . )
Virtually all indigenous cultures have myths about gods and spirits living in the natural world – in rocks , mountains , glaciers , forests – as did European culture before the scientific revolution .
Katja Neves , an anthropologist at Concordia University , points out that the practice serves a practical purpose .
Calling the Earth " sacred " is another way of expressing humility in the face of forces we do not fully comprehend .
When something is sacred , it demands that we proceed with caution .
Even awe .
If we are absorbing this lesson at long last , the implications could be profound .
Public support for increased offshore drilling is dropping precipitously , down 22 % from the peak of the " Drill Now " frenzy .
The issue is not dead , however .
It is only a matter of time before the Obama administration announces that , thanks to ingenious new technology and tough new regulations , it is now perfectly safe to drill in the deep sea , even in the Arctic , where an under-ice clean up would be infinitely more complex than the one underway in the Gulf .
But perhaps this time we wo n't be so easily reassured , so quick to gamble with the few remaining protected havens .
Same goes for geoengineering .
As climate change negotiations wear on , we should be ready to hear more from Dr Steven Koonin , Obama 's undersecretary of energy for science .
He is one of the leading proponents of the idea that climate change can be combated with techno tricks like releasing sulphate and aluminium particles into the atmosphere – and of course it's all perfectly safe , just like Disneyland !
He also happens to be BP 's former chief scientist , the man who just 15 months ago was still overseeing the technology behind BP 's supposedly safe charge into deepwater drilling .
Maybe this time we will opt not to let the good doctor experiment with the physics and chemistry of the Earth , and choose instead to reduce our consumption and shift to renewable energies that have the virtue that , when they fail , they fail small .
As US comedian Bill Maher put it , " You know what happens when windmills collapse into the sea ?
A splash . "
The most positive possible outcome of this disaster would be not only an acceleration of renewable energy sources like wind , but a full embrace of the precautionary principle in science .
The mirror opposite of Hayward 's " If you knew you could not fail " credo , the precautionary principle holds that " when an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health " we tread carefully , as if failure were possible , even likely .
Perhaps we can even get Hayward a new desk plaque to contemplate as he signs compensation cheques .
" You act like you know , but you do n't know . "

Harper administration monitors online political discussion

Monday , May 24 , 2010
The next time you struggle to comprehend how someone could spend their time trolling the Internet in order to defend and downplay whatever government cover - up or abuse is in the news this week , consider the fact that they may be on a government payroll .
The Canadian government has been caught paying a media group to monitor online political discussion and respond to “ misinformation , ” in order words to spread state - sanctioned propaganda , in the latest scandal to hit the Harper administration .
“ Under the pilot program the Harper government paid a media company $ 75,000 to monitor and respond to online postings about the east coast seal hunt , ” reports News1130 .
“ The government has a lot of power , that it feels the need to monitor public bulletin boards , or places where people express views and then to respond to that , seems to me going beyond a reasonable action the government should be taking , ” said UBC Computer Science professor and President of the BC Freedom of Information and Privacy Association , Richard Rosenberg .
A poll carried on the News1130 website shows that the majority of respondents , 77 per cent , are not intimidated by the fact that the government is monitoring their online conversations , and would not regulate the information they post on the Internet .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Accusations that people who defend the seemingly indefensible in the aftermath of government atrocities , wars and scandals are in the pay of unscrupulous authorities , circulate on a regular basis .
But the fact is that governments and transnational corporations have made a habit of using the Internet to spread propaganda by using individuals who pose as neutral observers .
The innovator of these “ black propaganda ” techniques was undoubtedly Monsanto , who as far back the late 90’s were creating “ fake citizens ” via their PR front company Bivings to post messages on Internet bulletin boards lauding the virtues and scoffing at the dangers of genetically modified food .
In the 21st century , governments try to harness the power of manufacturing fake consensus in order to dictate reality and justify their actions .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Last year , the Israeli government announced that it would be setting up a network of bloggers to combat websites deemed “ problematic ” by the Zionist state following a massive online backlash to Israel ’s brutal bombing of Gaza .
Israel ’s goal was to flood Internet message boards in English , French , Spanish and German with their own PR agents who would attempt to manufacture a contrived consensus that the IDF ’s actions were justified .
Like Israel , the U.S. military industrial complex hires armies of trolls to spew propaganda in defense of the war on terror and in support of bombing whatever broken - backed third world country is being targeted next .
CENTCOM has programs underway to infiltrate blogs and message boards to ensure people , “ have the opportunity to read positive stories , ” presumably about how Iraq is a wonderful liberated democracy and the war on terror really is about protecting Americans from Al - CIAda .
In May 2008 , it was revealed that the Pentagon was expanding “ Information Operations ” on the Internet with purposefully set up foreign news websites , designed to look like independent media sources but in reality carrying direct military propaganda .
More recently the New York Times published an exposé on how privately hired operatives were appearing on major US news networks promoting the interests and operations of the Pentagon and generating favorable news coverage of the so - called war on terror while posing as independent military analysts .
This operation was formally announced
In 2006 when the Pentagon set up a unit to “ better promote its message across 24 - hour rolling news outlets , and particularly on the internet ” .
Again , the Pentagon said the move would boost its ability to counter “ inaccurate ” news stories and exploit new media .
Last year , the US Air Force announced a “ counter - blog ” response plan aimed at fielding and reacting to material from bloggers who have “ negative opinions about the US government and the Air Force . ”
The plan , created by the public affairs arm of the Air Force , includes a detailed twelve - point “ counter blogging ” flow - chart that dictates how officers should tackle what are described as “ trolls , ” “ ragers , ” and “ misguided ” online writers .

Comment on this article
This article was originally published in May 2010 , shortly after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Earlier this week , an oil pipeline off the coast of Santa Barbara ruptured , spilling more than 20,000 gallons of crude oil over a 4 - mile stretch of ocean .
The leak has been stopped , but the damage is likely to affect wildlife in the surrounding areas .
Initiatives to scrub the Gulf of oil are moving forward .
One method includes spraying chemicals to break up and sink globs of oil before the slick spreads to the shorelines — but using chemicals to clean up the ocean is controversial because the environmental consequences are unknown .
The sea has its own way of handling the problem , but researchers worry that the water 's processes wo n't act fast enough to save coastal shores from damage .
Of course , science informs the debate .
Here 's what happens on a molecular level when oil hits ocean water .
As soon as oil hits water , the ocean begins its deconstruction .
In fact , the marine environment handles oil much like a human body handles alcohol : destroying , metabolizing and depositing the excessive compounds — in oil 's case , hydrocarbons — then transforming the compounds into safer substances , says Stanislav Patin , chairman of the Aquatic Toxicology Committee under the Russian Academy of Sciences and international expert on marine pollution .
Not all oil lives and dies at the surface .
Here 's how it breaks down .
In a 10 - minute span after spilling into the sea , 300 gallons of oil can spread to a radius of 160 feet and create a slick a fourth of an inch deep .
After that , how far and fast the oil spreads depends upon the water 's surface tension — how much the molecules in the water are attracted to one another — and the oil 's thickness .
The day after it enters the water , chemicals in the oil begin to transform , both at the water 's surface and farther into the water column .
Trace elements lurking in water can speed or slow the process while the sun fuels the breakdown , decomposing even the most complex of oil 's components over time .
The warmer the water temperature and the more sun exposure , the faster the oil breaks down .
During the first few days after a spill , between 20 to 40 percent of oil 's mass turns into gases , and the slick loses most of its water - soluble hydrocarbons — what 's left are the more viscous compounds that slow down the oil 's spread across the water .
During the first few days after a spill , between 20 to 40 percent of oil 's mass turns into gases .
When components of crude oil evaporate and its lighter fractions dissolve or are chemically transformed , oil clumps form .
These sticky masses are found in all types of water environments , in open and coastal waters and on beaches .
They have an uneven shape and can measure tenths of inches to 4 inches in length .
The oily masses serve as a base for developing bacteria and one - celled algae , while invertebrates such as crustaceans , resistant to the impact of oil , use them as shelter .
These clumps can exist from months to years in enclosed seas and for years in the open ocean — eventually , they degrade .
But not all oil lives and dies at the surface .
Between 10 and 30 percent of the oil is absorbed by sediments and suspended materials and deposited on the bottom of the sea .
This generally occurs in coastal zones and shallow waters where water mixes readily and more particles float .
Usually , oil drifts in the same direction as the wind , though storms and water turbulence can speed up the spread of the oil .
This movement in turn can degrade parts of the oil into separate fragments that spread far away from the initial spill .
As these fragments move further offshore and into deeper areas , sediment absorption becomes a much slower process .
While sediments latch onto oil components , so do filter feeders and plankton .
Planktonic organisms absorb the oil / water mix and dump it at the bottom of the ocean when they excrete other metabolites .
Once at the bottom , though , the decomposition rate of the oil halts almost completely because of lack of oxygen , and heavy oil fragments can be preserved inside sediments for years .
In a 10 - minute span , 300 gallons of oil can spread to a radius of 160 feet .
From deep - sea sediment to bobbing clumps , oil quickly loses its original properties and breaks off into hydrocarbon components , with many different chemical compositions and existing in different forms .
These forms can prove toxic to marine life , but after a time — with weathering , feasting micro-organisms and solar decomposition — the water self - purifies , as intermediate compounds gradually disappear and water and carbon dioxide reform .
To speed the process , researchers use oil dispersants , specialized chemical agents , to change the physical and chemical composition of oil .
Basically , these chemicals work to mix oil and water better than normally possible so that the oil sinks deeper into the water column .
Burying the oil a little deeper means that surface slicks wo n't float toward shorelines as readily .
However , mixing these chemicals into water has long been a controversial process , as they have proved toxic to some marine organisms .

The amount of money the United States is spending on its war in Afghanistan has surpassed the cost of its war in Iraq for the first time .
US taxpayers shelled out $ 6.7 billion for the Afghan war in February , the most recent month for which statistics are available , as opposed to $ 5.5 billion for the war in Iraq .
The total cost for the two wars is now approaching $ 1 trillion .
ADVERTISEMENT
Maintaining the US presence in Afghanistan has grown in price since the US began redeploying some troops from Iraq .
Keeping US forces in Afghanistan is also more expensive because the country is landlocked and it is harder to transport supplies .
USA Today has more :
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â¢The number of U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan has risen to 87,000 , on top of 47,000 from 44 other countries .
At the same time , the number of U.S. servicemembers in Iraq has dropped to 94,000 .
By next year , Afghanistan is to have 102,000 U.S. servicemembers , Iraq 43,000 .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â¢Afghanistan will cost nearly $ 105 billion in the 2010 fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 , including most of $ 33 billion in additional spending requested by Obama and pending before Congress .
Iraq will cost about $ 66 billion .
In fiscal 2011 , Afghanistan is projected to cost $ 117 billion , Iraq $ 46 billion .
To date , Pentagon spending in Iraq has reached $ 620 billion , compared with $ 190 billion in Afghanistan .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â¢Costs per servicemember in Afghanistan have been roughly double what they are in Iraq since 2005 .
That is due to lower troop levels , Afghanistan ’s landlocked location , lack of infrastructure , high cost of fuel and less reliable security .
“ The cost just cascades , ” says Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments .
“ That ’s always been an issue in Afghanistan . ”
The amount spent for each US soldier now costs American taxpayers roughly $ 1,000,000 a year , according to a report published in October 2009 .
The cost is so high in part because fuel and other supplies must be transported in some cases by helicopter in special bladders .
In some areas it is difficult to supply troops without airlifts .
In 2006 , Congressional researchers estimated that the accumulated costs for each soldier in Afghanistan would be about $ 390,000 .
The sharp rise in costs reflects the increase in mine - resistant troop carriers and surveillance equipment , in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
The unique difficulties of transporting soldiers around the mountainous , isolated terrain in Afghanistan also burdens U.S. taxpayers , military analysts say .

President Obama warned Sunday that the vast oil spill nearing the Gulf coastline is a " potentially unprecedented " disaster , as he and other top administration officials defended the government 's response and pledged a " relentless " federal effort to clean up the slick .
The president visited Louisiana to survey the damage and hear from local officials , who told him the oil is about nine miles from the state 's coast .
Obama warned that the spill could " seriously damage " the local economy and environment .
" We 're dealing with a massive and potentially unprecedented environment disaster , " Obama said .
" It could extend for a long time .
It could jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who call this place home . "
But in the face of emerging criticism , Obama and other top officials said the federal government has brought all possible resources to bear , rejecting comparisons to the Bush administration 's handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
They said British Petroleum is ultimately responsible , but that the federal government will do its part to contain the damage and stop the leak .
The president cautioned Sunday that the effort could take " many days , " and said the federal government would spare no resource in attacking the problem , though BP will foot the bill in the end .
" From day one , we have prepared and planned for the worst , " Obama said .
" Your government will do whatever it takes , for as long as it takes , to stop this crisis . "
The federal response to the spill has fluctuated since the April 20 oil rig explosion that triggered the rupture .
Earlier in the week , officials drastically increased their estimate of the size of the spill , from 1,000 to 5,000 barrels a day .
The Department of Homeland Security then declared the spill an incident of " national significance " on Thursday , freeing up resources to tackle the spreading problem .
And after the White House initially insisted that Obama would not travel to the region , the president flew into New Orleans Sunday -- traveling in his motorcade to Venice , La. , two hours away , while meeting with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal .
The White House also announced Sunday that it was canceling the president 's scheduled visit Wednesday to New Jersey to discuss the economy .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Sunday that Obama " just believed it was important to get down there as soon as he could and the quickest we could get down was today . "
Speaking on " Fox News Sunday , " top security and environmental officials said the federal government has been doing all it can to try to contain the mess .
" The administration responded all hands on deck from day one , " Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said , explaining that the response " evolved " from a search - and - rescue mission for 11 oil rig workers who are now presumed dead to the cleanup effort under way .
She said any comparison to the federal response to Hurricane Katrina , in which hundreds of people were killed and the government had advance warning , is " a total mischaracterization . "
She said BP is " ultimately responsible " for the disaster , an assessment echoed by Adm .
Thad Allen , commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard .
Allen said the federal government should not completely take over the cleanup because , " by statute and by law , BP is the responsible party . "
He said the firm bears responsibility and costs in the aftermath of the spill .
He said , though , that the cleanup effort will continue to be a collaboration .
" It 's a combination of BP and the federal government , " he said .
" We both have to execute our responsibilities . "
The spill has already impacted the Gulf Coast economy .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Sunday announced that it was closing commercial and recreational fishing along the coastline from Louisiana to the Florida panhandle .
Tim Kant , mayor of Fairhope , Ala. , told Fox News that the federal government needs to step up its response , even if it means sending BP the bill later .
" This is too much for BP or any company to deal with , " he said .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told " Fox News Sunday " that the federal government is doing all it can to help keep the spill from spreading .
" Every effort is being made to stop the source right now , " he said .
" There has not been a minute of rest since this started . "
Salazar gave a dire warning about the potential size of the environmental and economic damage that the spill could cause .
He said BP 's plans to drill a relief well near the original source in order to relieve pressure -- something he called the " ultimate solution " -- could take up to three months .
" There are scenarios that it could be worse than the Exxon Valdez .
We 're not sugarcoating this thing , " he said .
I am sitting on Continental flight 1594 with nonstop service to Houston Intercontinental Airport .
I have no Internet .
Just my shiny new iPad and the haunting memories of last night branded into my head .
I woke up this morning and felt like I was living a scene from The Hangover .
But unlike the bachelor partiers from that hilarious movie , I did n’t have the gift of Roofies to spare my mind the painful recollections I will forever be forced to endure .
I went to the 2010 Second Annual Streamy Awards as a nominee .
When the Streamy Awards had their big announcement a couple months ago I was ecstatic .
The very last category they announced was mine .
Best original music in a web series .
I heard my name on the live announcement and I freaked out .
I rushed down the hall to a coworker and let him know that we were nominated for a Streamy !
I was instantly on the phone and on Twitter and Facebook .
For a whole week I bathed in congratulations and accolades .
Our movie was a fan - film .
It was our film school 101 .
We wanted to make movies so we found subject matter we all loved and made a movie based on last year ’s Streamy juggernaut , Dr. Horrible ’s Sing Along Blog .
We made it with no expectation of a nomination , but we certainly had hopes for the validation that comes along with a prestigious nod from the illuminati of the IAWTV .
And we got it …what a rush !
We ’re not worthy .
We ’re not worthy .
The first moment of awkwardness came with the knowledge that our category was a Craft Award .
For the uninitiated , the Craft Awards are like the Academy Awards Technical Awards .
You know how , when you watch the Oscars there is that short little vignette that always seems to start with , “ In a ceremony held earlier this week … ” ?
That was us .
Okay .
No biggie .
The honor was still massive .
The Craft Awards were conveniently held on Wednesday prior to the Sunday Streamys .
Damn .
I gotta take a week off of work ?
Crap .
But totally worth it .
$ 300 worth of airfare and I was good to go .
We ’re really not worthy .
We ’re really not worthy .
Once I was settled in and ready for the April trip I fired off an email to the Streamy folks .
I mentioned how honored I was and wanted to know what I , as a Craft nominee , needed to do to get my ticket to the Sunday event and the coveted after party where relationships are made .
The response came later that day .
“ Regrettably , seating is very limited so at best you can wait on standby . ”
Wow .
That ’s a bit of a slap in the face .
But , okay .
It ’s a big - time Hollywood production .
I get it .
I ’ll chill on standby and roll the dice .
Still honored , still publicizing , still good .
My roll of the dice came up with some good numbers when they changed the venue to the glorious Orpheum Theater .
I got an email saying there would be plenty of seating so I instantly notified some friends that wanted badly to go and take part in the affair .
More airplane tickets .
More nights at the beautiful Biltmore Hotel for more people .
It was gonna be AWESOME !
4 UR Consideration
Next I got the email where they wanted money for the IAWTV people to watch my Internet movie .
Say what ?
Yeah .
I got an email where they wanted us to pay up to over $ 1500 so that all of the members of the IAWTV could see our work .
Apparently the voting members did n’t have high - speed Internet and it would take forever to watch all of those web shows over dialup so they wanted the nominees to foot the bill for freight on DVDs .
We did n’t have to do it , but were encouraged to .
Um , jeez .
I shook that one off as well .
I could sorta understand maybe a tiny little bit why they would ask for this .
Sorta kinda not really but maybe a teensy bit .
It is a bit of a chore to ask the voters to see over 200 shows so if there was a way to make it easier then that ’s cool .
I guess .
And it is a fledgling ceremony , feverishly trying to get the credibility it already had without asking .
But hell , if they were trying to raise a couple of $ 10,000 ’s then more power to them .
Capitalism .
The American way !
Ca n’t begrudge a guy from trying to make a buck .
Right ?
Right !
We politely declined to participate in the For Your Consideration portion of the Streamy Awards .
And I kinda hid the fact that they stooped to doing that from all but my closest co-producers .
I was embarrassed for the Streamys .
But I kept the dirty little secret and continued telling anyone with ears about the Streamy Awards .
One Balloon at a Time
The awesome cats from mydamnchannel.com put out an APB on Streamy promos .
Keep it short .
A couple minutes , tops .
Make a video encouraging peopled to watch the Streamys .
So me and some of the Horrible Turn guys got our camera and spent a couple hours shooting a promo video .
We had a blast and sent it to the MDC folks and they liked it !
They put it on the site and the positive vibes were back in full effect .
We recorded a short song about the Streamys and people all over the Internet were tapping their feet to the dulcet tones of me , frank , and a didgeridoo .
I wonder who found the balloon ?
Here it is on My Damn Channel
The Craft Awards
I arrived at LAX , picked up my rental from Enterprise , and headed to the Streamy Craft Awards .
The pre-show meet and greet was awesome !
I met some stellar people and drank some stella beer .
Stella Artois - official cerveza of Los Streamys .
This was exactly what I dreamed about !
Trading business cards with like - minded professionals .
Taking pictures of and with the stars of the interwebs - Man , did I feel ‘ Hollywood ’ !
I was by myself but , after an hour of fellowship with my new friends , felt very much at home .
The award ceremony was short and well executed .
It was actually fun , funny , and awesome .
When it came time for my category I had butterflies .
Like giant mean mothers .
The announcement was made and Autotune The News beat us out .
Drats !
But I clapped - their stuff is completely awesome .
The show wrapped up in maybe 45 minutes and then it was back to the Terrace for more Stella .
I tossed my acceptance speech in the garbage and got my drink on .
The New Media Party
Thursday night , the first of my partners in crime showed up .
Frank .
He ’s sitting next to me on the plane right now and still has a WTF just happened look on his face .
I recapped Wednesday night and off to Broadway Bar we went .
We signed in downstairs , slapped on a name tag and went upstairs to meet our future collaborators .
And we .
Had. A. Blast .
Met the best people on earth .
At some point I switched my name tag from ' Chance - Horrible Turn ’ to simply ' SNAKE ’ .
Side note - I highly recommend ' Snake ’ as a name tag name .
Holy crap .
The look on peoples ’ faces sheen they think your name is Snake is priceless .
Like anybody named ' Snake ’ or even named something else but going by ' Snake ’ would be caught dead with a ' Hi my name is ’ sticker .
I digress .
Best night of the trip .
Ca n’t wait to land and start emailing folks from the meet ups .
Spelunking
Friday was chill .
We went exploring in the closed areas of the damned beautiful Biltmore .
I recommend the hotel .
Regal and fantastic .
Our buddy and fellow producer Eric Cartman showed up and we had a lovely time .
Saturday Night Live
The Biltmore has played host to a number of memorable events like The Oscars and George Burns birthday parties but Saturday night it was all about the Streamys as the official Streamys pre party took place in a massive ballroom lifted directly from another era .
Everyone who is anyone in Internet media was there and looking lovely .
I got to meet Felicia Day and there has never been a more charming lady .
It was a tad awkward for me seeing as how me and my team made a movie based on a show she starred in without little things like ' permission ’ or ' asking ’ but my Lord she was awesome .
She knew our movie and liked it .
I was beaming !
Still am .
At least about Felicia Day digging our stuff .
Not so much about the streaking but I ’ll get to that later .
Saturday also had more Houstonians flying in for the awards .
My posse was getting big and my posse getting bigger .
Positive mojo was flowing like F - bombs at an awards show !
Smiles were everywhere .
Coats and ties and gorgeous dresses on gorgeous people were the norm .
It was Streamy Award Eve and the party was jumpin’ !
Sunday , Bloody Sunday
My recently purchased tux was pressed and ready , hanging on the towel rack in my room ’s bathroom .
I was n’t even up for an award but I was nervous .
My trip was about to end and the crowning moment was just hours away .
My crew was ready and damn we looked good .
We got to the Orpheum half an hour before we were told to .
An email from the previous day let us know that demand for tickets was extraordinary so if we were not there by 4:30 our tickets … most of which we paid $ 50 a pop for …would be surrendered to a more prompt patron .
Fine .
We will be there on time .
And we were .
We were there in time to wait in line .
Check in .
Get back in line and wait another hour to get in to our general admission balcony seats .
About 40 minutes before we got in I was enthusiastically following the Tweets about the Awards .
I wanted to know when the brass was getting there .
As I was digging around the Twitterverse I started seeing pictures of the Red Carpet Show at the Orpheum .
Weird .
I was at the Orpheum along with hundreds of other folks and I did n’t see a red carpet .
Hmm .
Then I realized , along with a very charming lady and fellow nominee , that we were in the commoners line .
The minions were using this entrance while the beautiful people were given a more appropriate path to the theater .
And by minions and commoners i am referring of course to nominees , sponsors , celebs , and other people that got the wrong email .
Holy crap .
Could we be marginalized any more ?
It turns out we could .
A lot more .
I know I ’m whining and I am not doing so intentionally .
More like rambling my thoughts .
We were finally herded into the Orpheum .
God it was beautiful .
Despite all of the stresses and unrealized expectations I was highly impressed .
The bar was packed and my posse was fired up .
We said hello to the now very familiar faces , made more promises to stay in touch , and marched upstairs to sit with the rest of the disposables .
There was a cordoned off area for the damn this flight is bumpy Craft Award winners and the theater was filling up nicely .
I could n’t really complain … there we were at the illustrious Streamys !
As long as everything stayed on the stage we would see the whole show live and in person .
Note the foreshadowing .
It ’s a literary element often used in , um , literature .
The show started acceptably late .
They were still waiting for seats to fill up I s'pose , but it got underway with a broadway style opening number .
As a dude that runs a sports radio station and also sits on the board of a community theater I am not one to criticize mic issues .
Or feedback .
Or shabby levels .
No , I have been there many times before and I felt bad for the technicians with the tough job of running a show sit little to know rehearsals .
It was fine .
Could n’t hear it but it was fine .
Paul Scheer was hosting and was funny .
Opening bit was long and gave me my first of many …oh so many … uncomfortable moments .
Here we were amongst the people responsible for making a lot of the relevant Internet videos and the host decided to go with the ' there ’s no money in Internet video ’ card .
For chasers we were given doses of ' nobody watches this shit ’ and ' nobody knows who any of you are ’ jabs .
Whatever .
Just say your jokes funny man .
And then things took a Horrible Turn
I guess I should note here … I ca n’t seem to remember the sequence of events as we began our descent into the pits of hell .
All I know is that it was a nonstop barrage of insulting garbage that made me ashamed .
I ’m trying to decide if I should use the same coarse language and tone I witnessed at the #streamyfail or try , somehow , to dig deep within and talk about the show without working blue .
I mean , despite the anger and disgust I feel , am I capable of recapping the mess without summoning every four - letter word in existence ?
Because trust me when I say I would love to rip them a new … sphincter …and tell those sons of …biscuits how humiliated I was at the #streamyclustereff .
You see , some of the folks that travelled from Houston all the way to sunny LA to take part in this once in a lifetime event … were kids .
My 13 year old son was by my side as the naked men flopped their junk all over the stage , with no attempt to intervene by security .
Now , I ’ll giggle at a streaker with the best of 'em and hope my son will , too .
But something about these nude dudes just seemed … pornographic .
Where was I ?
Oh yes .
Adorable little Jelena was there .
She ’s 13 also .
She and her mom flew in to bask in the glory .
Jelena played one of my little outback sirens in my movie .
She also played the part of ' innocent victim ’ as some clown pimp and his two hoochie mamas went on for what felt like an hour about every imaginable phallic joke and reference .
They should call them the Streamy Awkwards .
I mouthed ' I ’m sorry a thousand times ’ waiting for an opportunity to escape .
I prayed for an earthquake .
Or a sniper .
Something to make the madness stop .
And it ’s not like the audience was laughing .
Everyone felt awkward .
That bit would ’ve probably played well at the Improv … you know .
One of those places where the audience has even a scant clue of what they are getting into .
But at the #streamyturds ?
Really ?
Natalie , 15 , was also fortunate enough to come along for the show .
I think her favorite part was the 9/11/01 humor .
Either that or the Mother Teresa smack ( apparently she was quite the lush ) always fresh at an event clawing for credibility .
No , I remember .
She liked when the guy talked about his six year old daughter that was in the hospital … getting a boob job so she could work in Internet porn one day .
It pisses me off as I type .
There was nothing , nothing that indicated this was going to be a vile show .
If I thought it was gonna be naughty … I probably would ’ve still attended .
I just would not have invited freaking children .
A lot has been said about how immature the humor was .
But it was not immature .
It was deliberate , crafted , written by pros , and terrible .
In a weird way , It felt like sabotage .
Now I am not one to go all conspiracy theorist on ya but it was almost like some brass from tv and movie land decided to pay off some local scrub actors .
“ Here ’s 10 grand .
What I need you to do is make the whole notion of web television into a joke .
They want credibility ?
We ’ll give them vulgarity !
Remind em that " the internet is for porn and amateurs ” .
I assure you , if that was the goal , bravo cuz it worked .
I sat there with my face in my hands for an hour , begging for an epidural .
Something had to make the pain stop .
We finally left .
I saw an opening between a joke about infanticide and necrophilia and we took our leave .
In the lobby I went to find my other adult friends , also in the midst of an escape , and had the absolute pleasure of meeting with Maurissa and Jed Whedon .
These are two more folks responsible for Dr. Horrible and their class and charm made my night .
I had been bothered for almost a year now about making a movie about characters and settings those people , along with Joss and Zack Whedon made and hearing that they liked Horrible Turn calmed my nerves .
We made a castle in their sandbox and are grateful they did n’t kick it over .
I did n’t get to see Felicia or a lot of other folks that tried to right the ship because I was at dinner with my friends from Houston long before that …thing…ended .
I did get to crash the post - party that I was n’t invited to and once again got to see my new friends from the web world .
I was pleased that the universal message was “ the Streamys sucked . ”
I spent the morning apologizing to all of the families
That I had foolishly asked to watch the event .
By day I am the program director of an awesome sports radio station , 1560 The Game .
I used my old media platform to promote the new media Streamys before traveling to LA .
Now I get the privilege of apologizing to my radio audience for asking them to watch that massacre .
I just landed .

PS - I just read this and I hope it does n’t sound like sour grapes .
I swear , it ’s not .
These are just the words from a dude that was super proud and excited and then crushed .
It was like the Hindenburg crashed into the Titanic and I ’m the dork that brought innocent kids along to watch .
I ’m still making more movies .
And more stuff for the Internet .
But I will be less concerned about getting attention and recognition from a body of people that are capable of such a colossal , complete and total , inarguably #epicfail .
Last year with Dr. Horrible there was class and dignity amongst the technical difficulties .
This year there were technical difficulties amongst the crass .
In a beautiful and regal theater were the movers and shakers of Internet entertainment and they were insulted time and time again with scripted anecdotes about the instability and lack of popularity of what they do passionately .
When me and my party of 7 evacuated the natural disaster we were not alone .
We had to wait in a cab line from people in tuxedos and gowns trying to escape the horror .

Image caption Mr Coke is wanted by the US on drugs and gun-running charges
At least 27 people , almost all civilians , have died in gun battles in Jamaica , police have said , as the hunt continues for a suspected drug lord .
Troops and police had stormed the stronghold of Christopher " Dudus " Coke in the Tivoli Gardens district of the capital Kingston .
A state of emergency has been in place in parts of Kingston since Friday , when several police stations were attacked .
A decision to extradite Mr Coke , 41 , to the US had angered his supporters .
Mr Coke , who insists he is a legitimate businessman , enjoys the support of many impoverished Kingston residents who see him as a benefactor and have vowed to protect him at any cost .
But the US justice department accuses him of being one of the world 's most dangerous drug barons .
Fierce fighting
On Tuesday , the third consecutive day of unrest , thousands of heavily - armed police and soldiers continued their assault into the capital 's most violent slums , battling masked gunmen loyal to Mr Coke .
AT THE SCENE
It does n't feel safe in downtown Kingston today .
Out on the streets , the police are watching for snipers .
The occasional bullet whizzed through the air and hit the palm trees .
This is a disaster for Jamaica 's reputation .
The main offensive is a mile away , but even in the commercial heart of the capital , people are being pinned back against the walls .
Normal life is on hold .
Dudus is seen by many here as a kind of Robin Hood figure , a protector of the poor .
And that 's why it 's hard to see what happens next - the authorities are intent on capturing Dudus ; those loyal to him intent on stopping that at whatever cost .
Gangs from slums just outside the capital also joined the fight , erecting barricades on roadways and shooting at troops , the AP news agency reported .
At least one member of the security forces and 26 civilians were killed in the two - day raid , a police statement said .
Another seven officers and 25 civilians were also injured .
A total of 211 others have been detained , including six women , but there was no confirmation that Mr Coke was among them .
Military helicopters hovered as the sound of gunfire could be heard across the city centre , the BBC's Nick Davis says in Kingston .
Soldiers and police have been going house to house looking for Mr Coke , who is wanted in the US on drugs and gun-running charges .
Minister of National Security Dwight Nelson said security forces had nearly retaken areas loyal to Mr Coke .
In recent days , 18 police stations across the capital have been attacked , Mr Nelson said .
Other gunmen were using the security forces ' focus on west Kingston to carry out other crimes , he added .
The fighting has intermittently blocked the road to Kingston 's airport and forced some flights to be cancelled .
The US State Department has issued a travel alert , warning citizens against travel to Kingston and the surrounding areas .
Britain " strongly advised " its nationals to avoid all " non-essential travel " to the Kingston area , and Australia urged its visitors to show a " high degree of caution " .
Shower Posse
The Jamaican High Commissioner in London , Anthony Smith Johnson , told the BBC that Jamaica was obliged to respond to the US request to apprehend Mr Coke .

" There is a bilateral treaty between the United States and Jamaica which determines how these matters are dealt with , " he said .
Mr Johnson said the violence was limited to one square mile of Kingston .
" It 's a small area , and they do have it surrounded , and the rest of the city is going on about its business , " he said .
The Jamaican government last week agreed to extradite Mr Coke to the US , reversing months of opposition to the move .
Mr Coke is said to lead a gang called the Shower Posse - owing to the volume of bullets used in shootings - and operate an international smuggling network .
The gang has also been blamed for numerous murders in Jamaica and the US .
Mr Coke faces a life sentence if convicted of the charges filed against him in New York .
The drugs trade is deeply entrenched in Jamaica , an island nation of 2.8 million people with one of the highest murder rates in the world .
Some 1,660 homicides were recorded there in 2009 , the AP news agency reports .
If you want to go way back , if you go… like 16 of my great - great - grandparents … in 1840 they all would have been in Germany , but by 1870 they all were in America .
So if , you know … consider all the different lines .
My mother … my father 's … the Knuth part of my ancestry was the most diverse , in a way .
He came from Schleswig - Holstein , rather near the border with Denmark , and … and he was the last to come over .
He… during the Schleswig - Holstein crisis in 1860s – I think it was 1864 , probably – he went AWOL from the army ; did n't want to fight against the Prussians , and he decided to come to America , and knocked on the window one night , and told his parents , ‘ I 'm out of here ’ , and … and wound up in Illinois .
And then worked … learned … learned to be a blacksmith at that … at that time .
So … so then his wife … and … was somebody he met in America .
She had come … her family had come over earlier from the… from the Hannover area , and … and she lived in Indiana , all … all very near Chicago area .
And … and so the… that part of the family is … is from a different part of Germany .
My mother 's side came … they all emigrated in 1840s , and they were farmers in the area of what is now Niedersachsen – it's a small town in Germany called Bad Essen – and they … her family came and were farmers in Ohio , near Cleveland , Ohio .
So … so they … yeah , the background then is , my father 's side round Chicago , where he… where he was born and grew up , and my mother 's side from Cleveland , Ohio , where … where she was born .
My dad 's first teaching assignment was in Cleveland , and that 's where he met my mom .
Then he… then he got a call to Milwaukee , which was way far from any of their , you know , anybody else in the family , because it was a job that opened up , and so he went and … and took this … this job at a school that needed a teacher .
Ten games ago Pat Quinn rearranged his line combinations , breaking up long - standing trios of Shawn Horcoff with Patrick O'Sullivan and mostly Jean - François Jacques , and Ethan Moreau with Andrew Cogliano and mostly Zack Stortini .
He united Moreau and Horcoff with fellow veteran Fernando Pisani of no fixed line , and tasked them with the assignment of hard - matching against the opponents ' top trio .
The three have lots in common :
all are vets of the 2006 Stanley Cup run with a history / reputation for playing tough minutes ;
all are members of the core leadership group -- Moreau wears the " C " , Horcoff and Pisani both an " A " ;
all are somewhat to very expensive , collectively accounting for a cap hit of $ 10 MM ( Horcoff $ 5.5 MM , Pisani $ 2.5 , Moreau $ 2.0 )
Ten million bucks seems like a lot for a checking line ; surely by putting all his veteran eggs in one basket Quinn could rely on a stabilizing defensive posture .
The trio had a promising start when they hard - matched against Vancouver 's red - hot Sedin - Sedin - Burrows trio on January 20 , holding them off the scoresheet at even strength .
Unfortunately , Vancouver 's powerplay was clicking on all cylinders , scoring three goals with the man advantage , including the game - winner in overtime .
The end result was yet another Oilers loss , but the performance of the new MPH line was considered a qualified success .
So , ten games later , how has that experiment been going anyway ?
The short answer is , not well .
But this is me , so you 're going to get the long answer anyway .
The MPH Line has actually played together in 8 of the last 10 games , with Pisani drawing the short straw during the brief 2 - game winning streak last week .
Since the Vancouver game , each time all three played they have collectively posted a net minus , and the Oilers have lost in regulation each and every time .
Here 's a summary of those games including the line they were assigned to shadow ( in order of most minutes as faced by Horcoff , courtesy timeonice.com ) , the net +/- of the three Oilers combined , and the game 's outcome .
OPP FWD FWD FWD +/- Score Remarks VAN Sedin Sedin Burrows EV 2 -3 OT DAL BRichards Neal Eriksson - 2 3 -4 CHI Toews Brouwer PKane - 1 2 - 4 STL Boyes Tkachuk McDonald - 3 1 - 2 CAL Nystrom Lundmark OJokinen - 4 1 -6 CAR EStaal Whitney JJokinen EV 4 - 2 Pisani PB PHI MRichards Hartnell Gagne EV 1- 0 Pisani PB MIN MKoivu Miettinen Brunette - 3 2 - 4 COL Galiardi Duchene Wolski - 2 0 - 3 PHX Lombardi Lang Doan - 10 1 - 6
Other than the Calgary game which was a lost cause early with Quinn just rolling the lines , the trio did indeed draw the toughest assignments .
Unfortunately , they have consistently failed to neutralize their opponents , and their young teammates have been unable to overcome the deficit , resulting in a string of losses .
An extreme case in point occurred Monday night in Phoenix , when the MPH Line lined up against Phoenix 's top trio of Shane Doan ( $ 4.55 MM ) Matthew Lombardi ( $ 1.82 MM ) , and Robert Lang ( $ 1.0 MM ) .
A $ 10 MM checking line against a $ 7.4 MM scoring line , should be a saw - off , eh ?
Not so fast !
Despite Doan 's early departure from the game , the Phoenix threesome combined for 10 points and +13 , while the Oiler vets were saddled with a collective - 10 .
It certainly did n't help that they could n't get a save behind them , but it was ugly nonetheless .
The MPH Line has contributed next to no offence , combining for a single goal against Chicago ( while down 4 - 0 ) , with Moreau an innocent bystander on another goal scored during a line change .
He therefore has the best on - ice Sh % over the 10 games , a measly 3.3 % ; the other two are even worse .
( The team as a whole is not much better , with an EV Sh % of just 4.4 % over the ten games . )
All three suffer from poor on - ice Sv % as well , ranging from .861 to .878 ; the team 's rate during this spell is .902 .
But underlying those bad numbers are poor shots and Corsi numbers as well ;
Oilers have been outshot 61 - 82 with Horcoff on the ice at evens ; 60 - 79 with Moreau ; 42 - 65 with Pisani .
Using Dennis 's scoring chance metric ( 9 games , MIN missing ) , those ratios are even more bleak , at 33 - 56 , 30 - 59 , and 23 - 42 respectively .
These guys are getting killed out there , and only so much of the blame can be apportioned to the young goalies or to bad luck .
Pisani 's situation is particularly bleak .
Saint Fernando has dressed for 19 games in 2009 - 10 , and the Oilers have won just a single one of those games ( 1 - 15 - 3 ) .
He is currently riding a personal 15 - game losing streak .
It 's interesting to look at the performance of the team as a whole across the last 10 games .

The small amount of good news is concentrated near the top , where the Class of '03 Line ( Pouliot - Jacques - Stortini ) has surprisingly emerged as the Oilers ' top even - strength scoring threat in recent games despite their limited ice time .
The bad news is that none of the top 3 lines is being very productive , with the veterans up front and the entire blueline corps struggling badly offensively .
The MPH line is again clustered at the bottom of the forwards , each having scored a single point on that same meaningless goal against Chicago .
Not just they but all of the Oilers ' veteran corps have been letting down the side during this recent stretch of futility .
Even Lubo Visnovsky , the one veteran Oiler who had been playing fairly well early in the season , has fallen on hard times of late .
I 'm left with the distinct impression that all of the vets realize how truly hopeless this situation is .
Unfortunately , their poor play is not going to make them attractive to other teams which might offer them a fresh opportunity at the trade deadline .
The new Cryptococcus gatti fungus strain , magnified .
Late last month , on April 24 , media outlets across the Northwest United States began reporting that a strange , previously unknown strain of virulent airborne fungi that has already killed at least 6 people in Oregon , Washington , and Idaho , is spreading throughout the region .
The fungus , according to expert microbiologists , who have expressed alarm about the strain ’s emergence , is a new genotype of Cryptococcus gatti fungi or C gatti .
Cryptococcus gatti is normally found in tropical and subtropical locations in India , South America , Africa , and Australia .
Microbiologists in the United States maintain that the strain found here , for reasons not yet fully understood , is far deadlier than any found overseas .
Physicians in the Pacific Northwest are reporting that an undetermined number of people in the region are ill from the effects of the strange strain .
Physicians also say that the virulent strain can infect domestic animals as well as humans , and symptoms do not appear until anywhere from two to four months after exposure .
Symptoms in humans include a lingering cough , sharp chest pains , fever , night - sweats , weight - loss , headaches , and shortness of breath .
The strain can be treated successfully , if detected early enough , with oral doses of antifungal medication , but it cannot be prevented , and there is no preventative vaccine .
Undiagnosed , the fungus works its way into the spinal fluid and central nervous system and causes fatal meningitis .
The estimated mortality rate is about 25 percent of 21 cases analyzed .
Several newspapers and media outlets in the U.S. and overseas quote a researcher at Duke University ’s Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology , Edmond Byrnes , as stating : “ This novel fungus is worrisome because it appears to be a threat to otherwise healthy people .
Typically , we see this fungal disease associated with transplant recipients and HIV - infected patients , but that is not what we are seeing . ”
Microbiologists and epidemiologists studying the strain say the mystery fungus came from an earlier fatal fungus that was first found on British Columbia ’s Vancouver Island in the fall of 2001 , and perhaps as early as 1999 .
There the fungus infected and killed dogs , cats , horses , sheep , porpoises , and at least 26 people .
The disease spreads through spores carried by breezes and wind and when people and animals encounter infected ground where the fungus is present .
A number of microbiologists say that the disease has “ the potential to essentially travel anywhere the wind or people can carry it . ”
Reads an alarming study authored in part by Duke University ’s Edmond Byrnes : “ The continued expansion of C. gatti in the United States is ongoing , and the diversity of hosts increasing . ”
Several researchers in California also note that the Cryptococcus gatti fungus has been researched for decades , extending back to the 1950s , at the U.S. Army ’s biological warfare center , Fort Detrick , in Frederick , Maryland .
One microbiologist at the University of California at Los Angeles recounted that the fungus was first brought to the attention of Fort Detrick researchers by British scientists experimenting with the bark of eucalyptus trees from Australia .
U.S. Army biological warfare reports obtained through the Freedom of Information Act reveal that beginning around 1952 the Army mounted a huge research program involving numerous plant and fungi products , and that well over three - hundred long - term contracts and sub-contracts were let with over 35 U.S. colleges and universities to carry out this multi-faceted research .
Examples of this early research in California included experiments and projects at Camp Cooke ; Port Huemene ; Harpers Lake ; Oceanside ; and extensive experimentation with wheat stem rust and “ various spores ” including “ several from tropical locations ” and cereal rust spores and dyed Lycopodium spores .
Several Army reports reveal that private sector corporations that participated or assisted in these projects were the American Institute of Crop Ecology ; the American Type Culture Collection , Inc. ; University of California research institutes ; Bioferm , Inc. ; and the Kulijian Corp .
The same microbiologist , who declined to speak on the record and who recounted extensive fungus work at Fort Detrick , also stated that researchers at Israel ’s Institute for Biological Research , located in Ness - Ziona about 20 km from Tel Aviv , have worked with the Cryptococcus gatti fungus .
He reports that mysterious Israeli - American scientist Joseph Moshe , 56 years old , may have conducted covert studies with the fungus while he was recently living in California .
This report concerning Moshe is especially interesting because Moshe was briefly in the international spotlight in 2009 when he was the subject of a spectacular chase and arrest by the LA police department and SWAT team , assisted by the FBI , Secret Service , CIA , U.S. Army and several unidentified federal officials .
That highly unusual arrest has never been fully explained to the media , and the whereabouts of Moshe has remained unknown since its occurrence .
Compounding the mystery surrounding the Moshe case is that there is another scientist named Moshe Bar - Joseph who works in Israel at that country ’s Agricultural Research Organization , whose area of expertise is plant pathology , and who looks remarkably like Joseph Moshe , except that he is about 20 years older .
Moshe Bar - Joseph ( L ) and Joseph Moshe ( R )
Why Moshe was pursued and apprehended by the police is a largely unanswered question .
According to the LA media , which recorded the entire incident by helicopter and ground cameras , Moshe claimed to be “ a former Mossad microbiologist ” who had telephoned a police dispatch number before his pursuit and had made “ threatening statements about the White House and the president . ”
Reportedly , Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan confirmed this when he spoke with several LA reporters .
Joseph Moshe allegedly withstood four rounds of chemical agents before FBI officers shot out the drivers ’ window .
On August 12 , 2009 , several LA police cruisers and an unmarked armored vehicle pursued Joseph Moshe driving his red VW automobile several miles through downtown LA before his car ’s engine was reportedly knocked out by an electromagnetic pulse .
Moshe refused to exit his car when ordered several times by the police , and after the driver ’s window of his VW was smashed out by a robotic arm and several rounds of tear gas and pepper gas were fired into the vehicle , he still remained behind the wheel refusing to move .
At the time , police officers on the scene were stunned that Moshe was able to withstand 3 tear gas shells and hosing with pepper spray without moving .
Later that day , an LA law enforcement official said : “ I ca n’t explain that , there ’s no way to explain that . ”
Later still , a number of reports surfaced claiming “ Mossad scientists are specifically trained to withstand assaults with large amounts of tear gas . ”
After his apprehension , Moshe was taken to the Patton State Mental Hospital and then to LA ’s Twin Towers Correctional Facility .
Sometime about 60 days later Moshe was quietly released and his current whereabouts are unknown .
Since his arrest became public , reports about Moshe ’s activities in the U.S. have spread like wildfire , especially across the Internet .
Many of these reports are unconfirmed but a few come from credible sources and have linked Moshe to the grossly underreported outbreak of flu in the Ukraine .
Other reliable sources , including two former Fort Detrick biochemists , have also linked Moshe to a mysterious disease that is becoming alarmingly common in Vermont and other states , including California .
The disease is known to have killed or incapacitated at least 10 - to - 20 rural dwellers and farmers .
This disease is said to be Morgellons disease or “ a rare , mutated form of Morgellons disease . ”
Former Fort Detrick scientists , speaking off the record , say that the disease is one that was “ experimented with intensely ” in the late 1960s at several “ test sites in New England ” and at “ a well known research facility in the Boston area . ”
Morgellons disease causes patients to suffer horrible skin problems as well as fatigue , confusion , and serious memory problems , as well as joint pain and the strange sensation that pins and needles are piercing the body or that something is crawling beneath one ’s flesh .
Some patients struck by the disease report that odd fiber - like materials force themselves through the skin .
Several researchers and physicians consulted for this article believe that Morgellons may be a psychiatric condition called “ delusional parasitosis . ”
Other physicians , who are familiar with treating the disease , say “ an airborne , unidentified spore ” may cause it , and that it was developed in the laboratory from an affliction that was first identified in the 1700s .
Regardless of its origin , many researchers claim Morgellons is becoming “ a very real medical problem in some parts of the country . ”
Report : EPA officials mull sanctions against BP ’s US operations
Amid increasing anger over a huge oil slick hitting US shores , BP officials Friday denied botching the month - long clean - up and deliberately hiding the true extent of the spill .
With a thick sludge now washing up in the Mississippi delta threatening disaster for a wealth of animal and plant life , the US administration has set the British energy giant tight deadlines to come clean about their operation .

Just how much oil is gushing from a pipe ruptured when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank a month ago has been a contentious issue , with BP initially putting the figure at 5,000 barrels — or 210,000 gallons — a day .
“ That was not just BP ’s estimate .
That was the estimate of the in - flight command , including NOAA and the Coast Guard .
That ’s the best estimate we have , ” BP ’s chief operating officer Doug Suttles said Friday .
But the company says it is now siphoning 5,000 barrels a day from the leak by a mile - long ( 1,600 meter ) insertion tube device , and live webcam television pictures show more oil continuing to spew into the Gulf from the ruptured well , meaning the figure must be higher .
Even at the lowest estimates , more than six million gallons of crude have flowed into the water since the disaster .
And independent experts have warned the flow could be at least 10 times higher than the current estimates .
Suttles sought to quell the growing anger among the US administration , residents and lawmakers that not enough is being done , with the spill flowing unchecked since April 20 just 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) off the Louisiana coast .

“ We ’ve thrown everything at that , ” he said on ABC television , saying the company had so far spent some 700 million dollars on the clean - up .
“ We ’ve mounted the largest response ever done in the world .
We put 20,000 people at this . ”
He confirmed BP had met a late Thursday deadline set by the US administration to answer concerns over the chemical dispersant used to break up the oil slick on the surface , but had failed to find a less toxic alternative .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Right now , we cannot identify another product that is available that is better than the Corexit product , ” he said , stressing the dispersant they were using was on a list approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
US officials have insisted that BP provide a wealth of technical information to the EPA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) to help them fight the slick .
ADVERTISEMENT
And Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson are demanding daily public updates on the leak .
“ The public and the United States government are entitled to nothing less than complete transparency , ” they told the oil firm in a letter .
Democratic US congressman Ed Markey voiced the frustrations of many , saying : “ We ’re beginning to understand that we cannot trust BP .
People do not trust the experts any longer .
BP has lost all credibility . ”

With thick patches of oil tarring coastal Louisiana marshes , a haven for migratory birds and rare wildlife that will be virtually impossible to clean up , local leaders have started to despair .
“ Twenty - four miles ( nearly 39 kilometers ) of Plaquemines Parish is destroyed .
Everything in it is dead , ” Billy Nungesser , head of the parish in southern Louisiana , told US cable news station MSNBC Thursday .
“ There is no life in that marsh .
You wo n’t clean it up , ” he said , adding the slick was “ destroying our marsh , inch by inch , ” and would keep on coming ashore for weeks and months .
The neighboring states of Alabama , Mississippi and Florida , including its famous tourist and coral reefs could be next as the slick is swept along by a powerful ocean conveyor belt known as the Loop Current .

An increasingly desperate BP says a “ top kill ” operation to try to cap the leak for good , by filling the well with heavy drilling fluids and then sealing it with cement , could begin as early as Sunday .
Suttles said Friday he understood people ’s concerns .
“ I share that frustration .
I understand the anger .
But I can tell you , I do n’t know of anything absolutely anything we could be doing that we ’re not doing , ” he said .
Report : EPA officials mull sanctions against BP ’s US operations

“ Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency are considering whether to bar BP from receiving government contracts , a move that would ultimately cost the company billions in revenue and could end its drilling in federally controlled oil fields , ” Abrahm Lustgarten reports for ProPublica .
Days ago , in an unannounced move , the EPA suspended negotiations with the petroleum giant over whether it would be barred from federal contracts because of the environmental crimes it committed before the spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Officials said they are putting the talks on hold until they learn more about the British company ’s responsibility for the plume of oil that is spreading across the Gulf .
The EPA said in a statement that , according to its regulations , it can consider banning BP from future contracts after weighing “ the frequency and pattern of the incidents , corporate attitude both before and after the incidents , changes in policies , procedures , and practices . ”
Several former senior EPA debarment attorneys and people close to the BP investigation told ProPublica that means the agency will re-evaluate BP and examine whether the latest incident in the Gulf is evidence of an institutional problem inside BP , a precursor to the action called debarment .
Federal law allows agencies to suspend or bar from government contracts companies that engage in fraudulent , reckless or criminal conduct .
The sanctions can be applied to a single facility or an entire corporation .
Government agencies have the power to forbid a company from collecting any benefit from the federal government in the forms of contracts , land leases , drilling rights , or loans .
The article adds , “ The EPA did not make its debarment officials available for comment or explain its intentions , but in an e-mailed response to questions submitted by ProPublica the agency confirmed that its Suspension and Debarment Office has “ temporarily suspended ” any further discussion with BP regarding its unresolved debarment cases in Alaska and Texas until an investigation into the unfolding Gulf disaster can be included . ”

THE OTHER REPUBLICAN IN NEVADA … .
As of a couple of months ago , the Senate race in Nevada appeared to be following a predictable trajectory .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D ) was struggling in the polls , and Republicans were rallying around Sue Lowden , a former one - term state senator and the former head of the Nevada Republican Party .
The central question of the race was how Reid would close the gap and manage to win re-election .
One chicken and a felonious campaign contribution later , Lowden and Reid have largely switched places .
Last week , a survey from Public Policy Polling even found Lowden slipping to second place in the Republican primary , narrowly trailing former state Rep. Sharron Angle .
Perhaps now ’s a good time to ask , who ’s Sharron Angle ?
Reid campaign spokesman Jon Summers said the majority leader is prepared to run against any possible opponent , but the campaign clearly relishes the thought of taking on Angle — and claiming Lowden ’s scalp .
Reid ’s campaign has already cut anti-Angle ads , and its oppo research operation has begun digging into her record .
Democrats are eager to lump
Angle together with other tea party candidates across the country — particularly amid the controversy Rand Paul has created with his comments about the Civil Rights Act .
And they believe an Angle win in the June 8 Nevada GOP primary would give them an appealing national narrative : that the Republicans ’
November ticket across the country is filled with “ extreme ” candidates well outside the mainstream of American politics .
On her website — full of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors —
Angle declares : “ Like a soldier going to war , I am fighting for my country , the Constitution and a free society . ”

Washington Post 's SpyTalk blog offers a most unusual revelation :
The CIA faked a video of Osama bin Laden bragging about " conquests with boys , " and wanted to " flood Iraq " with a fake sex tape of Saddam Hussein banging a young boy .
Preparing for the 2003 invasion of Iraq , SpyTalk 's Jeff Stein writes , the CIA 's Iraq Operations group entertained various ideas for undermining Saddam Hussein .
One was to create a video purporting to show the Iraqi dictator having sex with a teenage boy , according to two former CIA officials familiar with the project .
" It would look like it was taken by a hidden camera , " said one of the former officials .
" Very grainy , like it was a secret videotaping of a sex session . "
The idea was to then " flood Iraq with the videos , " the former official said .
They abandoned the project not because it was stupid , but because " Saddam playing with boys would have no resonance in the Middle East — nobody cares ...
We always mistake our own taboos as universal . "
I thought Iraq was n't that gay - friendly , either ?
Anyway , the most important revelation about the plot to turn our enemies into gay porn stars is that the CIA actually completed one video of Osama bin Laden .
The agency actually did make a video purporting to show Osama bin Laden and his cronies sitting around a campfire swigging bottles of liquor and savoring their conquests with boys , one of the former CIA officers recalled , chuckling at the memory .
The actors were drawn from " some of us darker - skinned employees , " he said .
Wikileaks : I think you have your next video target .

Shocker : Most of world 's " happiest countries " have suicide rates higher than the USA
Boffins at the University of Leicester have apparently gazed into their navels and constructed a set of heavily vetted , peer reviewed , comprehensive bullshit " criteria " as to what constitutes that " elusive notion of contentment " known as happiness .
Feeling sad ?
Researchers at Britain's University of Leicester reckon you might just be in the wrong country .
According to Adrian
White , an analytic social psychologist at Leicester who developed the first " World Map of Happiness , " Denmark is the happiest nation in the world .
White 's research used a battery of statistical data , plus the subjective responses of 80,000 people worldwide , to map out well - being across 178 countries .
Denmark and five other European countries , including Switzerland , Austria , and Iceland ... ... The U.S. came in at 23 ...
phony bullshit
To this casual observer , who DOES NOT have a graduate degree insocial sciences , it would seem that happy people would NOT be terribly inclined to off themselves , but then again what do I know ?
Perhaps when socialistic societies rid themselves of misfits , malcontents , and the chronically depressed through high suicide rates , the survivors realize that means more government bling for them and their moods uptick accordingly ?
In a twistedgreeddrivendon' tgivearatsassabouttheotherguy kinda way it might make sense .
Oh , BTW , the US suicide rate is somewhere around 11/100 K [ 2005 ] ( at the height of BDS and the " worst economy since the depression " according to John Kerry ) .
Denmark ?
10.6/100 K [ 2006 ]
Switzerland ?
15.1/100 K [ 2007 ]
Austria ?
12.7/100 K [ 2008 ]
Iceland ?
12.2/100 K [ 2008 ]
Back in 1997 , when the world economy was booming at the zenith of the tech bubble , Denmark 's suicide rate was 14/100 K , so maybe they have spent the past 13 years weeding out the unhappy ones ?

Now that the hype is over , let ’s talk the real deal .
How good is Google ’s VP8 video codec ?
Since “ multiple independent implementations help a standard mature quicker and become more useful to its users ” , me and others ( David for the decoder core and PPC optimizations , Jason for x86 optimizations ) decided that we should implement a native VP8 decoder in FFmpeg .
This has several advantages from other approaches ( e.g. linking to libvpx , which is Google ’s decoder library for VP8 ) :
we can share code ( and more importantly : optimizations ) between FFmpeg ’s VP8 decoder and decoders for previous versions of the VPx codec series ( e.g. the entropy coder is highly similar compared to VP5/ 6 ) .
Thus , your phone ’s future media player will be smaller and faster .
since H.264 ( the current industry standard video codec ) and VP8 are highly similar , we can share code ( and more importantly : optimizations ) between FFmpeg ’s H.264 and VP8 decoders ( e.g. intra prediction ) .
Thus , again , your desktop computer ’s future media player will be smaller and faster .
Since FFmpeg ’s native VP3 / Theora and Vorbis decoders ( these are video / audio codecs praised by free software advocates ) already perform better than the ones provided by Xiph ( libvorbis / libtheora ) , it is highly likely that our native VP8 decoder will ( once properly optimized ) also perform better than Google ’s libvpx .
The pattern here is that since each libXYZ has to reinvent its own wheel , they ’ll always fall short of reaching the top .
FFmpeg comes closer simply because our existing wheels are like what you ’d want on your next sports car .
Making a video decoder is fun !
In short , we wrote a video decoder that heavily reuses existing components in FFmpeg , leading to a vp8. c file that is a mere 1400 lines of code ( including whitespace , comments and headers ) and another 450 for the DSP functions ( the actual math backend of the codec , which will be heavily optimized using SIMD ) .
And it provides binary - identical output compared to libvpx for all files in the vector testsuite .
libvpx ’ vp8/decoder /*.c plus vp8 / common /*. c alone is over 10,000 lines of code ( i.e. this excludes optimizations ) , with another > 1000 lines of code in vpx / , which is the public API to actually access the decoder .
Current work is ongoing to optimize the decoder to outperform libvpx on a variety of computer devices ( think beyond your desktop , it will crunch anything ; performance becomes much more relevant on phones and such devices ) .
More on that later .
Things to notice so so far :
Windows 7 users are more exposed to ransomware , says Microsoft Watch Now
I 've been hanging out with a bad crowd lately .
In the interest of research , I 've been digging into message boards and forums run by unabashed Windows enthusiasts who are intent on breaking Microsoft 's activation technology .
I 've had these forums bookmarked for years and stop in every once in a while just to see what 's new .
This time I decided to drop by and actually try some of tools and utilities to see if I could become a pirate , too .
Unfortunately , I succeeded .
In this post , I 'll share my experiences , including close encounters with some very nasty malware and some analysis on how the latest showdown between Microsoft and the pirates is likely to play out .
You wo n't find names or direct links here -- although these guys seem like genuine enthusiasts , I have no intention of giving them any free publicity .
But if you 're interested in tracking down the tools I tested you should have no trouble finding them using the clues available in screenshots and descriptions here .
If you do intend to try this stuff out for yourself , I recommend extreme caution .
My hunt for utilities that bypass Windows 7 activation technologies led me to some very seedy corners of the Internet .
First , I did what any red- blooded wannabe pirate would do and tried some Google searches .
Of the first 10 hits , six were inactive or had been taken down .
After downloading files from the remaining four sites , I submitted them to Virustotal.com , where three of the four samples came back positive for nasty , difficult - to - remove Windows 7 rootkits .
Here 's one example :
And that experience is borne out by at least one real - world experience , which was reported , ironically , in the Talkback section of this blog .
After I wrote about Microsoft 's most recent anti-piracy initiative last week , one commenter ( a loud , proud Linux advocate ) insisted that the update opened a secret back - channel , probably as part of a plot by Microsoft to covertly gain access to its customers '
PCs .
A day or so later , after checking with his Windows - using friend , he returned with this sheepish admission :
It turns out his iso was not a bona fide purchased copy [ of Windows 7 ] , but rather a cracked version off of the net .
In all likelihood the iso was trojaned ...
Indeed .
Which is why I exercised extraordinary caution .
For my hands - on tests , I used a fresh copy of Windows 7 Ultimate , installed without a product key .
I then looked at two widely distributed tools that work in completely different ways .
Page 2 : Disabling Windows activation completely
A clever little tool called RemoveWAT not only disables Microsoft 's activation subsystem , it also installs the latest anti-piracy update from Microsoft and then disables it , too !
Page 3 : Fooling Windows by tinkering with the BIOS
Big PC makers get to install copies of Windows that do n't require activation .
Naturally , pirates soon figured out how to make any PC look like it came from one of those big factories .
Page 4 : Microsoft versus the pirates
Pirates are clever and fast .
Microsoft is highly motivated to keep its lucrative Windows revenue stream intact .
Are customers going to get caught in the crossfire ?
Details and screenshots begin on the next page .
Disabling Windows activation checks completely
RemoveWAT first appeared last summer , around the time Windows 7 was released to manufacturing .
The philosophy behind this small utility is simple :
It disables the Windows Activation Technologies function while allowing the system to retain its Genuine status in every official check by Microsoft .
The most recent version claims to work with all editions of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 .
( It does not work with Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 . )
I downloaded the most recent edition of RemoveWAT ( v2.2.5 ) and verified that it was clean .
The single .exe file is small ( less than 7MB ) , and the UI is simple :
After clicking the Remove WAT button and rebooting , I noticed a subtle but significant change in the System properties dialog box .
The section describing my system 's activation status was gone .
There was no sign of a Product ID or activation status .
Nothing .
Previously , a message in that section had told me that I had 30 days left to activate .
A close inspection of the Windows \System32 folder explained why .
RemoveWAT installed its own patched version of a crucial DLL file in the Software Licensing subsystem , Slwga.dll .
Thoughtfully , the program 's developer had coded it to save a backup of the actual file so that it could be restored if necessary .
( And when I tested the Restore WAT function , I found it worked just fine on my system . )
As far as Windows was concerned , the system was perfectly valid .
I was able to download and install optional updates through Windows Update and successfully validated the system so that I could install products reserved for Genuine Windows customers .
I was also able to install Microsoft Security Essentials , which performs a validation check during setup .
In a fitting piece of irony , the most recent version of RemoveWAT actually goes out of its way to install Microsoft 's WAT Update ( KB971033 ) , which is designed to detect and remove tampering by programs like ... well , like RemoveWAT .
The pirate code remained working even when I ran the WAT update manually .
Page 3 : Roll your own free OEM copy ? -->
Fooling Windows by tinkering with the BIOS
The other popular approach toward cracking Windows activation takes advantage of the difference between retail and OEM copies of Windows .
Retail copies have to be activated using a unique serial number .
OEM copies from large system makers ( Dell , Toshiba , HP , and so on , collectively known as Royalty OEMs ) use a technique called System Locked Preinstallation ( SLP ) .
The preinstalled copy of Windows uses a single master product key tied to specific information in the system BIOS that is unique to that manufacturer 's systems .
If the encrypted licensing information in the preinstalled copy of Windows matches the information in the BIOS , no activation is required .
Windows pirates figured out how to exploit this hack around the time Windows Vista was launched .
The Windows 7 Loader program , which I used on a test system , looks at your PC 's BIOS to see whether it contains an ACPI_SLIC table with software licensing information ( " markers " for the Windows operating system and the name of the computer maker ) .
If the SLIC table is present , the tool installs the correct product key for your Windows 7 edition along with a digital certificate ; the combination mimics a legitimate OEM preinstallation .
For systems with a BIOS that does n't contain the proper SLIC tables ( a scenario I did n't test ) , it uses an alternate boot loader ( typically some variant of GRUB ) and installs BIOS emulation code to fool the system into thinking your system is a legitimate OEM installation .
You can use the one - click installer or select from advanced options to personalize your PC by choosing a particular brand .
In this case , I had installed a retail copy of Windows 7 Home Premium on a relatively new system ( purchased in mid-2009 ) that was originally licensed for Windows Vista .
I did n't enter a product key during setup , and I had gone more than 30 days without activating .
Here 's what I saw when I ran W7Loader :
The installer correctly detected the brand ( Dell ) and Windows 7 edition .
When I clicked the Install Certificate and Serial button on the right , I was greeted with this message :
The system , which had never been activated , had previously been nagging me with " non-Genuine " warning messages .
As soon as the pirate tool completed its work , the watermark on the black desktop went away and the System properties dialog box told me I was activated with a Dell OEM product ID .
Page 4 : The Empire strikes back -->
The Empire strikes back
The two exploits I describe in this post are certainly not the only ones out there .
Indeed , Windows pirates have been playing a cat - and - mouse game with Microsoft for years .
In the Windows XP era , pirates focused most often on stealing legitimate product keys , especially Volume License keys .
Beginning with Windows Vista , Microsoft has begun building anti-piracy components directly into the operating system , and pirates have aimed their hacking skills at those components with increasing sophistication .
The latest salvo from Microsoft in the war against pirates is the Windows Activation Technologies Update ( KB971033 ) .
In its default configuration , it performs an initial validation check and then repeats the process every 90 days , downloading new signatures to detect exploits that flew under the radar in the previous scan .
When I initially wrote about this subject last month , the question I heard most often was , " Why does it need to keep checking ?
If I get validated , should n't that be good enough ? "
Unfortunately , the experiences I 've written about here prove why that strategy does n't work .
If you used a copy of RemoveWAT that was created in 2009 , you were able to fool Microsoft validation servers with a 100 % success rate .
However , as the anguished cries of forum participants proved , the KB971033 update in February exposed all of those hacks , restoring the correct license files and causing the systems to ( correctly ) fail validation .
As a result , the RemoveWAT developer modified his code and released a version last week that trumped the new update and once again allowed hacked machines to pass the activation test .
In the past , that would have been counted as a win for the pirates .
But with its new signature - based system , Microsoft can improve its exploit - detection code and , at least in theory , identify the updated hacks in 90 days ( or , in the worst case , 90 days after that ) .
The point is that pirates can't count on getting a permanent free pass on activation .
If you 're a hobbyist obsessed with pirating Windows , you have to put up with the nuisance of updating your hacking tools every few months .
But if you 're selling pirated software ( in a box or preloaded on a system ) , you risk getting put out of business and maybe sent to jail when the systems you sold in March are detected as pirated in June or July .
The other question I hear on the subject is , " Why pick on legitimate customers ?
Why not go after the real pirates ? "
There 's a common misconception that only diehard hackers mess around with pirated software .
The reality is that anyone can be a victim , especially if they ever need help reinstalling Windows or repairing some sort of hardware problem .
I have lost count of the number of times I have seen a PC that contains a pirated copy of Windows installed by a nephew or a neighbor or even a local computer tech who was trying to share the cool thing he found on the Internet .
Back in 2007 , I wrote about a firsthand experience with a PC repair tech for a major national chain who used a pirated copy of Windows to " repair " my friend 's PC .
In that case , I was able to spot the unauthorized copy quickly and help my friend undo the damage ( and get his money back from the crooked tech ) .
If that were to happen today , the tech might be lucky enough to get away with the deception for a few months , but he would eventually be caught out .
One thing I learned while researching this piece is the phenomenal determination of pirates .
They 've become increasingly sophisticated and are able to react extremely fast to changes from Microsoft .
For Microsoft , responding to those fast - moving targets without inadvertently inflicting collateral damage on its customers is a tremendous challenge .
Last weekend , I used some sophisticated forensic tools to take an equally close ( and completely unauthorized ) look at what Microsoft is doing with its most recent anti-piracy update .
Tomorrow , I 'll publish the surprising results of that analysis .
The grand master plan for European broadband is out , and one target leaves the United States in the digital dust — a goal of 30 Mbps " or above " for all Europeans by 2020 .
So says the European Commission 's Digital Agenda for Europe , which also wants 50 percent of EU households subscribed to links of 100 M bps or more by that year .
" Today only 1 percent of Europeans have a fast fibre - based internet connection , compared to 12 percent of Japanese and 15 percent of South Koreans , " the document laments .
" Europe needs widely available and competitively priced fast and ultra fast internet access . "
No suboptimals please
The European Commission is the policy arm of the European Union .
Needless to say , Europe is n't jealously comparing itself to the United States , high - speed Internet - wise .
Here our supposedly bold and fearless Federal Communications Commission thinks it 's cool by setting a pokey universal broadband goal of 4 M bps , sans fiber , which the agency says costs too much .
Not the EC , which is wringing its hands over the lack of fiber - to - the - home ( FTTH ) build - out in Europe .
That 's even less than the US's two percent , Digital Agenda ruefully notes .
Beyond all the sturm und drang , however , it is n't entirely clear how the EC hopes to reach its goals .
" Without strong public intervention " the continent risks " a sub-optimal outcome , " the document warns .
So expect a " communication " from the Commission some time soon outlining a common framework for development .
What will this compendium say ?
" For instance , " Digital Agenda says , " the competent authorities should ensure : that public and private civil engineering works systematically provide for broadband networks and in - building wiring ; clearing of rights of way ; and mapping of available passive infrastructure suitable for cabling . "
Great , but that is n't terribly different from language found in the FCC's National Broadband Plan .
The government should establish policies " for the use of spectrum and oversee access to poles , conduits , rooftops and rights - of - way , which are used in the deployment of broadband networks , " our NPB recommends .
" Ensuring these assets and resources are allocated and managed efficiently can encourage deployment of broadband infrastructure and lower barriers to competitive entry . "
And the European broadband situation is also very similar to the US in another respect : 30 percent of Europeans also do n't use the ' Net , the EC report discloses .
One iTunes store to rule them all
But while Europeans are n't looking to the US for leadership when it comes to broadband speed goals , they do see us as way ahead on another front : the online music scene .
Americans download four times as many tunes as Germans , Britons , and Swedes , " because of the lack of legal offers and fragmented markets " in Europe — not that Euro - trade associations are n't plenty peeved at the illegal download rate .
" Citizens should be able to enjoy commercial services and cultural entertainment across borders , " the report observes .
" But EU online markets are still separated by barriers which hamper access to pan-European telecoms services , digital services and content . "
At this point , if iTunes or an equivalent wanted to set up a Euro - wide online music store , Digital Agenda notes , it would have to bargain with rights management organizations in over two dozen countries .
Thus consumers can still stroll across national borders to buy CDs ( and many still prefer to do so ) , but ca n't do the same online because of national rights policies .
And 92 percent of consumers who buy stuff on the Euro - net do so via national sellers , rather than cross - border vendors .
The lack of progress in these areas has also set Europe back in the development of online content , the EC gripes .
" The EU is falling behind in markets such as media services , both in terms of what consumers can access , and in terms of business models that can create jobs in Europe , " the report complains .
" Most of the recent successful Internet businesses ( such as Google , eBay , Amazon and Facebook ) " have originated ( euphemism alert ) " outside of Europe . "
So it 's time to open up access to legal content by streamlining transborder licensing and copyright clearance , the policy doc recommends , on three fronts .
First , proposing a " directive on collective rights management " by the end of this year .
Second , setting up cross-European policies on orphan works and out - of - print items , supported by rights information databases .
And finally , updating the EC 's policies on the reuse of public sector data .
Digital Agenda also urges the Commission to update its cybersecurity rules , noting that only 12 percent of Europeans say they feel " completely safe " making online transactions .
And the report promises , as did the EC's Digital Agenda boss Neelie Kroes last month , that updated net neutrality provisions are in the works — maybe .
The Commission will launch a " public consultation " before this summer " on whether additional guidance is required , in order to secure the basic objectives of freedom of expression , transparency , " and " the need for investment in efficient and open networks . "
The “ A Word ” And Presidential Dignity
Doug Mataconis · · 3 comments
Last night in my post about President Obama ’s “ whose ass to kick ” comment , I said :
It will be interesting to see how the public and the media reacts to this , not the least being because this is the first time that I can remember that a President used and ( admittedly minor ) vulgarity in a public statement .
This is n’t the 1950′s , so I ca n’t imagine that most people will think it ’s that big of a deal , although I would n’t be surprised if the right - wing chatter machine tried to make it the outrage of the day for Tuesday .
Well , it did n’t take long for someone to take offense :
Not everybody was pleased with President Obama ’s uncharacteristic line on the Today Show , spoken in the pre-school hours Tuesday morning , that he wants some “ ass to kick ” in the Gulf oil crisis .
Click here to find out more !
Becky Quick , who co-hosts Squawk Box with lead anchor Joe Kernen and co-host Carl Quintanilla , slapped Obama for using unpresidential language in an interview he knew would be aired as children prepared for school .
“ If you ’re the president of the United States and you go on the Today Show which is a morning show , where you ’re going to have a lot of kids sitting around watching this , I think you choose your words more carefully , ” said Quick .
“ Using the A word when you are on the Today Show talking with Matt Lauer , yeah , that disturbs me .
But I also think that this is a way of trying to prove that I ’m mad , to do exactly what everybody ’s been pushing me to do , and it does n’t ring true . ” ( …)
“ You can point to people who say these things all the time , we ’ve used these words , but again , if you ’re the president of the United States and you are on the Today Show I would expect a different choice of words , ” she said .
Two thoughts come to mind .
First of all , is there really a large preteen and adolescent audience for the Today show on the average morning when most kids in America are still going to school ?
Second after some of the language we ’ve heard on the Watergate Tapes , not to mention Dick Cheney ’s memorable comment to Patrick Leahy on the floor of the Senate , are we really all that shocked to hear what is really an incredibly minor curse word cross the Presidential lips ?
Perhaps I ’m being overly cynical but I do n’t see how this is really a big deal .
Update : I was reminded via Twitter of a previous incident of Presidential cursing .

​ The state of Utah had what it thought was a brilliant idea to eradicate marijuana farming on public land :
Ask citizen snitches to report any pot patches they run across .
“ Did you know marijuana is being illegally grown in Utah ? ” the site , with a keen grasp of the obvious , ominously warns .
“ Have you ever been hiking or camping and seen what looks like an illegal marijuana growing operation ?
We have created this website to make it easier for people to report this illegal activity , so we can crack down and keep these illegal drugs out of our state and off our streets . ”
Yeah , it seemed like a great idea .
That is , until NORML posted a story about Utah ’s misguided efforts .
Within 24 hours , pot-friendly visitors flooded the site with fake tips .
The state made it easy with a website with helpful links to assist its deputized citizenry in identifying marijuana and signs of grow operations , reports Greg Campbell at dscriber
The NORML article noted that while nobody supports the misuse of public lands for growing marijuana , there is a better way to deal with it — removing the penalties for cultivation on private land , instead of turning hikers and campers into snitches .

The report blames weak laws , lax enforcement and fragmented authority , as well as the existing regulatory presumption that chemicals are safe unless strong evidence emerges to the contrary .

“ Only a few hundred of the more than 80,000 chemicals in use in the United States have been tested for safety , ” the report says .
It adds : “ Many known or suspected carcinogens are completely unregulated . ”
Industry may howl .
The food industry has already been fighting legislation in the Senate backed by Dianne Feinstein of California that would ban bisphenol - A , commonly found in plastics and better known as BPA , from food and beverage containers .
Studies of BPA have raised alarm bells for decades , and the evidence is still complex and open to debate .
That ’s life :
In the real world , regulatory decisions usually must be made with ambiguous and conflicting data .
The panel ’s point is that we should be prudent in such situations , rather than recklessly approving chemicals of uncertain effect .
The President ’s Cancer Panel report will give a boost to Senator Feinstein ’s efforts .
It may also help the prospects of the Safe Chemicals Act , backed by Senator Frank Lautenberg and several colleagues , to improve the safety of chemicals on the market .
Some 41 percent of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives , and they include Democrats and Republicans alike .
Protecting ourselves and our children from toxins should be an effort that both parties can get behind — if enough members of Congress are willing to put the public interest ahead of corporate interests .
One reason for concern is that some cancers are becoming more common , particularly in children .
We do n’t know why that is , but the proliferation of chemicals in water , foods , air and household products is widely suspected as a factor .
I ’m hoping the President ’s Cancer Panel report will shine a stronger spotlight on environmental causes of health problems — not only cancer , but perhaps also diabetes , obesity and autism .
Who are we to criticize a politician 's choice of words ?
It 's a tough job .
You have to be expressive to get your message out .
“ Oh ! ” Daley said .
“ It ’s been very effective ! ”
He grabbed a rifle , held it up , and looked right at me .
He was chuckling but there was no smile .

Is the best way to demonstrate the benefits of gun control by picking up a rifle and offering to shoot a reporter ?
Leave that to the PR experts .
What do we know ?
But that apparently was Chicago Mayorstrategy .
At a news conference to discuss Chicago 's gun ban and the Supreme Court 's pending ruling on the issue , a reporter from the Chicago Reader asked him if the ban was effective .
" Since guns are readily available in Chicago even with a ban in place , do you really think it ’s been effective ? " asked Mick Dumke .
Dumke said the room became " very , very quiet " before reporters realized he was joking .
Daley 's press flak said the mayor did n't regret the remarks but said by offering to place the gun in the reporter 's rear end " could admittedly be considered a less - than - ideal example . "

Women 's Health Overview of Constipation
Why is constipation so prevalent in our US society ?
If it is chronic in your body the results could seriously affect your good health in many areas .
A good rule of thumb is if you have a healthy colon you will have a bowel movement twice a day .
Usually the first one occurs without about an hour of waking up in the morning , and the movement is very easy .
There is no straining or waiting for things to happen .
A good bowel movement also releases a lot of solid waste material at once .
When your colon is healthy for instance , that first of the morning bowel movement is generally three to five feet long .
If you do not have a bowel movement at least twice each day minimum , you 're constipated .
Likewise if you do not eliminate several feet of waste material at once , you 're constipated .
If you have to sit on the toilet and wait for your bowels to move - or worse , you sit on the toilet and strain hard for your bowels to move - you 're constipated .
And when you 're constipated , there can be any number of other physical things wrong with you .
The colon is the primary method the human body uses to get rid of toxic materials , bacteria , and wastes .
That colon is over five feet long though , and it touches every area of our body through nerve endings .
So if waste materials are backed up inside your colon - a .k.a. you 're constipated - this can cause you to be sick , generally not feeling well , or have any number of so called syndromes and conditions which are so common in society today .
The colon is where solid waste material ends up in our body , and the colon 's job is to keep that waste material moving until it is expelled through a bowel movement .
The liver however , is what actually starts the waste creation process .
The liver filters and processes our blood , removes the toxins and bacteria that is harmful to use , and creates bile from the filtered materials .
That bile is then sent on through to the colon for disposal .
When the colon is backed up however , the liver is not able to do it 's job as efficiently , because it has no place to send the waste material it 's creating .
So it must wait until the colon clears before it can continue doing it 's job .
And that 's the first problem , because when the liver is not able to filter toxins from our body , we start getting sick .
The second problem though , occurs within the colon itself .
When you 're constipated , that waste material is just sitting there in the colon , and it 's leaking the toxins and poisons back into your body through the thin colon walls .
Essentially , the waste material is slowly poisoning your body , and that 's the second reason we start getting sick .
Constipation
Because of the way many people choose to live their lives , constipation has become a very common , widespread , and chronic problem .
Being constipated is not just uncomfortable and sometimes even painful though .
It can also cause more severe health issues to arise if left untreated for too long .
The colon is one of the primary ways our bodies get rid of wastes and toxins .
The liver filters out a variety of toxins , wastes , and harmful bacteria which it then sends to the colon to be disposed of .
The colon moves that waste along , and eliminates it from our bodies in the form of stool passed during bowel movements .
The colon is a very large organ though .
At five to six feet in length , it holds and moves a lot of waste material through our bodies .
And the material it 's supposed to be moving out of our body can actually get clogged in there , and sometimes it can become crusty and hard so that it 's difficult to move forward .
This is when problems can occur .
The colon walls are thin , so if too much backed up waste material stays in the colon for too long , the toxins and bacteria from that waste can leak back into other areas of the body and cause health problems for other major organs .
Like muscles though , if you do n't use your colon regularly it will become weaker and less effective .
In other words , if you do n't have daily bowel movements then the colon can become weaker and not be able to move things through and out of your body as effectively .
Many specialists feel that a healthy person should have at least two good , effortless bowel movements each day .
You should feel the urge to go , sit down and have it happen almost immediately , without strain or pain .
If you 're not having at least two movements each day , or you have to sit and wait awhile , or you have to strain and push to make your bowels move , you 're constipated .
There are many very easy , completely natural ways to resolve constipation problems though , particularly if the constipation is mild .
Here are several natural ways to make sure your bowels move regularly and easily ...
1. Fruit juice .
Plain old apple , grape , or prune juice often does the trick quite nicely .
These are the strongest bowel moving juices too .
If you just need to keep your bowels moving regularly though , you might choose a citrus juice such as orange juice or home made lemonade instead .
2. Fiber .
Adding fiber to your diet will help keep the waste moving regularly too , because it 's not digested by your body .
So fiber acts as a " broom " when it 's inside your colon .
Fiber can be added from foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables , or you can take fiber supplements instead .
3. Water .
Drinking plenty of water each day will help keep your bowels moving regularly .
In most cases , drinking two to three quarts of water a day will do the trick .
4. Herbal supplements .
There are a variety of herbs which will help relive constipation .
Some of these work quite quickly , while others may take up to 24 hours .
Here 's just a few that work wonderfully :
- Chickweed :
An excellent herb for relieving constipation within a few hours of taking it , this herb also strengthens the stomach and bowels , and helps carry out toxins .
- Slippery Elm : Another wonderful single herb that works for both constipation and diarrhea , because it normalizes the stools while soothing , coating and healing the intestinal tract lining .
Slippery Elm should be taken with lots of water to help move it through your system .
- Cascara Sagrada :
This is one of the strongest herbal laxatives and it's commonly added to over the counter medications for use in relieving constipation .
Take an herbal capsule at night with a large glass of water .

Odd things are happening in women 's bras .
In recent years , the average British bra size has jumped from 34B to 36D , which means that while women 's backs have grown one size , breasts have jumped up two .
Many department stores have increased the range of cup sizes on offer to meet the ballooning demand .
In 2007 Marks & Spencer introduced the J cup .
Earlier this year , Selfridges began stocking a K cup range , and its sales of D to G cups have risen by 50 % year - on - year since 2005 .
Last week , Debenhams started stocking KK bras , which were previously only available in specialist stores .
In a country where one in three women is overweight , you 'd think there was a simple , fat - related reason for this , but obesity alone does n't explain the jump in cup size , nor the biggest growth area in bra sales : smaller back size and bigger cup size .
Judging by recent underwear figures , there are more slimmer women with larger boobs than ever before .
Women are happy about this .
Men are happy about this .
But no one seems happy to explain why this is happening .
Do you know how to work out a bra size ?
As roughly 50 % of the British population wear them , you 'd have thought most of them would have an idea .
But though a 2009 survey found that the average British woman owns 16 bras at any one time and buys four every year , fitting them is a surprisingly tricky activity .
The traditional method reads like an A - level algebra problem .
You take a tape measure and wrap it round your chest at the lowest point where a bra sits .
You record this figure in inches .
You add four to this measurement if the number is even , five if it 's odd – and the resultant number is your band size .
Then you wrap the tape round again and measure the fullest part of the actual breasts .
Next you subtract the band size from breast size to find your cup size .
If the numbers are the same , you 're an A cup .
If there 's an inch difference , you 're a B ; two and you need a C cup and so on .
Alternatively , and many bra experts say more accurately , you can weigh your breasts by dunking them into a full bowl of water and measuring the displaced liquid , with 1 litre of water equalling 1kg .
It 's accurate but useless .
You can do precisely nothing with this information , as no bra manufacturer measures boobs by the pound .
Unsurprisingly , as no one enjoys maths or physics homework , the modern way to find the correct fit is to go to a shop and get someone else to do it for you .
Egged on by TV stylists , such as Gok Wan and Trinny and Susannah , who 've long been rhapsodising over the merits of a well - fitted bra and the wonders they work on your shape and posture , more and more women are doing this .
Previously they could go a lifetime buying new bras by guessing or simply choosing the size they 'd always worn .
They made do .
But trained fitters can now be found in almost every lingerie department ; instead of relying on water or tape they add an element of mystique to this already complicated process .
Fitters are like boob whisperers , their pronouncements made on look and feel as well as measuring .
" We do n't use tape measures because we do n't believe they work .
How can you measure volume with a straight line ? " says Anna Prince , a bra expert for the Bravissimo brand , which specialises in DD + bras .
" Instead we prefer to show our customers how a well - fitting bra looks and what it feels like , so they will be able to tell in a matter of seconds whether they 've got a good fit . "
Marks & Spencer reports that about 8,000 women come to their stores for a fitting every week .
As a result of all this bra buying and breast scrutiny , we have more information now about the dimensions of the average British boob than ever before .
And what 's surprising is how wrong most women were about their bra size .
" In the past few years we 've seen a significant change , " says Helen Spencer , lingerie and swimwear buyer at John Lewis .
" The best - selling size in the business was 34B ; that 's what every woman thought she took .
For us it 's now 32D .
That 's happened in the past 18 months , and watching the sales coming in now , we can see that it wo n't be long before 32 F becomes the biggest seller . "
" There 's been a huge growth in the small back , larger cup lady , particularly among young girls , " says Julia Mercer , head of fit and technology at M&S 's underwear department .
" The younger girls just seem to have bigger breasts now . "
The retailers ' findings are borne out by Britain 's breast biomechanics research unit at Portsmouth University .
It 's a niche academic field , but there is a team of researchers studying how much breasts of varying size move during activity and how trajectory changes with different types of exercise .
Their aim is to improve the design of sports bras .
" The media always contacts us when there 's a new story , " sighs Jenny White , one of this country 's five breast biomechanics researchers .
" And they always get excited when it 's about size . "
But yes , they 've found that women tend to wear the wrong bra size , particularly underestimating the cup .
This finding cannot be explained by weight change alone .
How do the women react to this news ?
" Well , there 's still an idea that bigger is better , so generally they 're very pleased . "
The breast is made of glands , fat and connective tissue .
Breasts make up about 1 % of body weight , 4 - 5 % of body fat .
But the breast has always been more than the sum of its parts .
That 's why these new figures about bra sizes are interesting .
If the average shoe size was up , no one would give two hoots .
But breasts are sexy and thrilling – most of us want to have or to hold a perfect pair of boobs .
Their preferred size and presentation are culturally significant , and the idea of what makes an ideal breast changes .
Social psychologists have found that preferred size increased steadily from the flat - chested 1920s up until the early 1960s , when smaller breasts became more popular again .
Research in the late 1990s found larger boobs were yet again more appealing .
We know that the way we regard them changes , but there has n't previously been such a significant variation reported in breasts themselves .
It 's a peculiar moment of synergy , when culturally we like big breasts and women have suddenly discovered that they have them .
Because big , bouncy , natural breasts are in – not the bee stings of sallow models that have made fashion in recent years so sexless , nor the overblown boob jobs that seemed , if you looked at magazines and films , the only viable alternative .
Fashion houses have ignored boobs for decades , but now underwear as outerwear is a top trend for summer , with every label from Dior and Bottega Veneta to Christopher Kane and Marc Jacobs pushing bra tops and corsets .
And this spring 's recent round of fashion shows featured many models who actually jiggled as they walked , rather than the size - zero coat hangers who usually rule the catwalks .
In Milan , Prada 's collection celebrated curvier figures and accentuated the bust .
In Paris , the Louis Vuitton models included recent mothers Adriana Lima and Karolina Kurkova , while models typically associated with lingerie companies also graced the show : Giles Deacon went for Victoria 's Secret models Laetitia Casta and Bar Refaeli .
Fashion has n't wobbled so much since Vivienne Westwood 's last platform shoe collection tumbled down the catwalk .
Lara Stone has become one of the most talked - about models of the moment , not just because she 's engaged to David Walliams but also because her gap - toothed pout and fuller figure make such a welcome change .
Part of that appeal is her C - cup bosom , and she 's not the only busty model who 's finding favour .
In the Forbes 2009 list of the world 's top- earning models , five of the 10 highest earners take a C cup ( Gisele Bündchen , Heidi Klum , Adriana Lima , Carolyn Murphy and Miranda Kerr , in case you 're wondering ) .
Of course bigger does n't always mean natural , but that does seem to be a requisite now .
On TV , actress Christina Hendricks has become the standout star of the show Mad Men , partly because of the feistiness of her character , Joan Holloway , but also because of her mesmerising embonpoint .
In film , Disney has also come out as an unlikely champion of the natural breast .
A recent casting call for female extras for the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean film specified : " Must have real breasts .
Do not submit if you have implants . "
Breast augmentations are also waning in popularity .
They 've been in decline in the United States since 2007 ( though it still remains the most popular cosmetic surgery procedure in America ) , and the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons ( Baaps ) reports that in 2009 the number of breast augmentations in the UK rose by only 1 % , showing that demand for the procedure is slowing down .
" Ironically , " says Dr Patrick Mallucci of the London Plastic Surgery Associates , " celebrities who have made their names on pumped - up breasts have become reference points for what people do n't want .
Clients often refer to Jordan and say , ' Do n't make me like that . '
Now people do n't bring in photos of celebrities as a guide to how they want to look .
They bring pictures from the internet , or of FHM models who are n't famous but who happen to have nice breasts .
I just do n't see patients who want massive knockers . "
Instead of paying for them , women seem to have developed bigger breasts all on their own .
Lingerie manufacturers deny that vanity sizing – when manufacturers alter the measurements of a dress size so that heavier customers can wear what appear to be smaller clothing sizes – is responsible for the seismic cup - size increase , but there has been something of a revolution in bra manufacturing in recent years .
Bras are phenomenally complex garments and their construction has long kept designers and engineers busy .
As an article entitled " Brassieres : an engineering miracle " from the February 1964 issue of Science and Mechanics journal states : " The challenge of enclosing and supporting a semi - solid mass of variable volume and shape , plus its adjacent mirror image , involves a design effort comparable to that of building a bridge or a cantilevered skyscraper . "
Though the experiments into the production of a plastic spray - on bra in a can also mentioned in the article sadly never resulted in viable underwear , this pursuit of new design and construction methods remain key today .
Sue Dunmore is a designer for a new Australian brand , Dimity So , which specialises in fashion bras for the DD+ market .
Her design degree was in 3D design , specialising in silversmithing .
" What does this have to do with lingerie ? " she says .
" More than you would think , as they are both about creating three - dimensional structures .
You have to be able to understand 3D forms to be able to create great - looking and fitting bras . "
In the past , women could n't wear the 32G or 34 FF bras that are currently flying off lingerie department shelves , because they simply did n't exist .
Katie Halford , founder of vintage - inspired lingerie label What Katie Did , which creates glamorous underwear from 1940s and 1950s patterns and materials , says , " Only 10 years ago it was nearly impossible to find anything bigger than a D cup on the high street , and things have certainly improved .
In the 50s , cup sizes only came in B to D and if you were bigger than that you were encouraged to go up a back size instead – I 've got vintage corselettes in bizarre sizes like 56B . "
Is it possible that boobs have n't actually changed that much , but that underwear has finally been developed to cater for figures that have always existed ?
" There have been huge innovations in underwear , " says Marks & Spencer 's Julia Mercer .
" In strap and bra technology and in control panels in shapewear , which allow zone control . "
She explains that there are 31 components in a bra with a DD + cup , 10 more than are required for smaller sizes .
There 's an extra panel of fabric in each cup to allow volume curve .
There are slings down the side of the cups that hold the wearer 's breasts securely to minimise movement .
The underwiring bands have greater stretch to open up and frame the breasts .
The underband and shoulder straps are modular , so that some parts stretch while others do n't , to create an excellent fit .
" There 's a lot more variety in trends and colours in larger cups now , " says John Lewis 's Helen Spencer .
" Brands that are known for contemporary styles , such as Elle Macpherson 's Intimates , have worked hard to produce good products for G - cup customers .
There are styles with plunging necklines that achieve the same look as smaller cups – a lot of engineering has gone into them .
The improved range of styles makes people more comfortable about purchasing these larger sizes .
They 're pretty bras . "
But even if the underwear industry is n't pandering to vanity sizing , you can't underestimate the effect of women 's vanity on their purchases .
Modern bras may be feats of engineering , but all women know that if you want to buy a bigger cup size , there are easy ways to do so .
" Bras are graded so that if you go down a band size , you go up a cup size .
The cup size for the following band sizes is the same : 30 F , 32E , 34DD , 36D , 38 C , " says Katie Halford .
" In Marks and Spencer I have changed from a 36C to a 32DD in the space of five years , while I remain a 36C in designer brands . "
Improved bra engineering has not improved the disparities in sizing between different brands .
" It 's a minefield of different sizes out there , " says Portsmouth University 's Jenny White .
" There is no standardisation of sizes across the industry . "
Dr Patrick Mallucci agrees : " We hate talking about cup size because it 's such an inaccurate measure .
You 'll be a B cup in one brand and a D in the next .
It creates a lot of confusion when we 're designing breast enlargements .
We talk about form , proportion or shape . "
Changes and sizing inconsistencies in the underwear industry are n't the whole story .
There are various other theories posited in the media for this bosom expansion .
Most of them seem to tie in with the most fashionable current cultural fears and are rather gloomy .
Could bigger breasts be the result of binge drinking and bad diet ?
" A calorie is a calorie no matter where it 's from , " says Sian Porter , consultant dietician and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association .
" True , there are seven calories per gram of alcohol and 50 % of people who do count calories do n't count those in drink , but in the end it all comes down to consumption . "
There have also been a lot of alarming stories reported about xenoestrogens – manmade chemicals that are present in everything from weedkillers and food preservatives to make - up – which may be responsible for everything from increasing breast size and the early onset of puberty in girls to causing males to develop female sexual characteristics .
They may yet be revealed to have wreaked havoc on the biology of the human race in the imminent future , but right now there 's apparently not enough conclusive proof to say either way .
Dr Ian Fentiman is professor of surgical oncology at Guy's , King 's and St Thomas ' School of Medicine in London .
His main area of research is breast cancer , so he 's studied the effects of xenoestrogens because , yes , they 've been implicated in the development of that disease , too .
" There 's little direct evidence but lots of indirect evidence that xenoestrogens have an oestrogenic effect and affect the growth of human breast cancer cells ; but to take that on and say what the impact of this is on human females , well , it 's a wee bit more difficult to say , " says Dr Fentiman .
" We 're doing some work which seems to show that you can see evidence in relatively young women that they 've had exposure to a variety of mutagens and the body has had a response to those .
It may be that if you get an exposure to xenoestrogens at a young age there may be an even more profound effect .
The young breast is very sensitive to a whole variety of stimuli .
But none of it is yet proven . "
Sian Porter says that breast sizes are definitely on the up , but that 's because of a very simple reason .
" We are all much better nourished , " she says .
" Each generation is getting bigger , taller and stronger because we 've eradicated a lot of childhood diseases .
So our mothers ' generation are bigger than our grandmothers and so on .
It 's a long - term trend .
If you have the capacity to grow to 6ft yet you 're malnourished , you 'll only reach 5 ft8 in .
If you 're well nourished during the period when your secondary sexual characteristics develop , you 'll reach your potential .
The babyboomers were the first NHS babies and from then on we 've been in better health – apart from the current problem with obesity . "
And that 's the unavoidable bad news .
" Bra size will be affected by your skin and muscle tone , a variety of factors , " Porter adds .
" But the message has to be that if your clothes are getting tighter or you need bigger ones , you should think about losing weight . "
Sub - scapular fat – or back fat as it's better known , the rolls beneath your shoulder blades – can be an indicator of weight problems .
It 's one area , along with hips , triceps and biceps , that doctors will measure with skin callipers if they 're measuring body fat .
Dr Fentiman concurs with Porter 's theory .
" We know that breast size is changing , but so is the age that women start menstruating .
In 1900 , the average age for menstruation was 16 ; by the end of the century it was coming down to 11 - 12 .
That 's a reflection of reaching a certain body mass and that 's because most people in the western world have easy access to food .
It 's not breast size alone but also body size that is increasing , so nutrition is currently the most obvious explanation .
Yes , there may be other explanations as well .
As with all of these things , science lags a long way behind .
We can make observations , but to explain why those things are happening is more difficult . "
At least , for now , it seems the majority of women are pleased to discover their hidden assets .
Julia Mercer of Marks & Spencer says that one thing she 's noticed among the women coming in to buy the new bra sizes is that they 're proud of their shapes .
" Minimiser bras used to be popular , " she says .
" If you had large breasts you used to try and hide them – now more women are celebrating their breasts . "
Helen Spencer from John Lewis reports a similar experience with her customers .
" In store , I see a customer who 's found the right size and they 're surprised by how fantastic they look .
A few years ago , what was out there was n't very exciting , but I honestly think that now everybody 's just making the best of what they 've got rather than settling . "
Sue Dunmore at Dimity
So concurs : " Consumers these days are used to having choice in every part of their life ; just because you are fuller busted does n't mean that you can't choose to wear beautiful , sexy lingerie just like everyone else . "
The big boob bonanza of 2010 may simply be part of the ongoing evolution of the female form , but it 's one thing women are content not to have to worry about – at least for now .
If you 've got them , you might as well flaunt them .
West Point speech :
This is not the Obama of 2008
President Obama ’s West Point speech on Saturday provides a great example of the structural continuities in American foreign policy .
As president and commander - in - chief , Obama now embraces and owns policies that he previously eschewed .
For example , after running his campaign denouncing the Iraq War and doubting the surge , he is now essentially declaring Iraq a victory ( " this is what success looks like : an Iraq that provides no safe - haven to terrorists ; a democratic Iraq that is sovereign , stable , and self - reliant . " )
After spending much of his first year in office downplaying if not ignoring democracy and human rights promotion , he is now making democracy and human rights promotion one of the four pillars of his national security strategy .
After previously rhetorically distancing himself from American exceptionalism , he now says that a " fundamental part of our strategy is America ’s support for those universal rights that formed the creed of our founding . "
In short , through a combination of the burdens and responsibilities of office , prevailing geopolitical realities , the deep cultural currents of U.S. foreign policy , the bureaucratic systems that reinforce those cultural currents , and the crucible of learning that takes place every day in the toughest job in the world , the President Obama of today acts and sounds considerably different than the one elected in November 2008 .
( John Hinderaker over at Powerline — a site never hesitant to criticize the Obama administration — makes a similar favorable observation about the speech and its essential continuity with U.S. foreign policy ) .
This is not at all to say that his foreign policy is identical to that of his predecessors — in important ways it does differ , and as I have written elsewhere , often not for the better — but only to point out that truly profound structural changes in American foreign policy are very rare .
And generally for good reason .
Some media coverage , such as Peter Baker ’s New York Times article , attempts to portray the speech as a " repudiation " or at least distancing from the Bush administration ’s grand strategy , and makes much of the fact that he did not emphasize " unilateral American power " or affirm " pre-emption " or " prevention . "
Baker is one of the very best , and best - sourced , White House correspondents around , so it may be that his article reflects some additional background conversations with Obama administration staff attempting to advance a particular message .
But at least when it comes to the text of the speech , here I think Baker ’s article overshoots .
For example , in the midst of discussing the importance of international cooperation , Obama described American leadership in " steering those currents in the direction of liberty and justice " — in other words , a polite way of saying that American power and influence will continue to shape the international order .
Or the fact that President Obama did not explicitly affirm the possibility of the preemptive use of force does not mean that his Administration actually rejects it .
As historian John Gaddis has shown , since the days of John Quincy Adams ( while Secretary of State to James Monroe ) , American presidents have reserved , and sometimes used , the right to take action against looming threats .
Unless President Obama were to explicitly reject the possibility of ever using force in a preemptive or preventive manner to protect the nation ( highly unlikely ) , it will remain an option within American national security doctrine .
In his speech , President Obama also previewed his soon - to - be- released National Security Strategy , ostensibly built around the four pillars of connecting renewal at home with strength abroad , integrating diplomacy and development , building international cooperation and international institutions , and promoting human rights and democracy .
As basic principles , these are sound .
Whether they will amount to a coherent strategy ( which needs to identify end goals , identify threats or obstacles to those goals , and explain how and why the tenets of the strategy will defeat those threats and overcome those obstacles ) remains to be seen , once the NSS document itself is released .

Cork scientists are at the forefront of a world breakthrough in prosthetics with the creation of an artificial hand that can touch , feel , grip and hold
CORK SCIENTISTS are part of an international team that has developed a bionic hand that can touch , feel , grip and hold , representing a worldwide breakthrough in prosthetics .
The next generation artificial hand enables two - way communication between nerve impulses in the brain and sensors on the prosthetic , allowing amputees to feel sensations through the fingers and palm .
The Smart Hand is the result of a € 1.8 million European Union - funded project , for which researchers at the Tyndall National Institute at University College Cork created the mechanism that links the movement and sensing of the hand to nerve endings in the body .
The aim of the project was to create a prosthetic hand capable of movement and sensory touch that mimics the human hand .
The new prosthetic hand will improve the quality of life for amputees , enabling the activities of daily living to be performed in a more natural way .
Researchers have reported huge public interest in the project , which could greatly improve the scope of movement and strength for amputees .
Research teams from Ireland , Italy , Iceland , Israel and Denmark contributed to the project , led by Lund University in Sweden .
Head of the Life Sciences Interface Group at the Tyndall National Institute , Dr Paul Galvin , who took over the leadership of the project from John Alderman , said the Cork team ’s input related to the creation of a connection between the nerve and the electronic mechanism that powers the hand .
“ There are various prosthetics available , but none has the capability to be directly controlled by the brain .
The Smart Hand has been designed with a view to match human sensing and movement as closely as possible , ” he said .
“ The aim was to create a next generation prosthetic hand , moving from prosthetics with limited capabilities to being able to interface directly with the brain .
“ The intentions of the brain travel through the nerves to the prosthetic , and sensory information from the Smart Hand is also fed back to the brain in a two - way communication . ”
The Cork - based group faced the challenge of connecting the device to biological nerve endings in a manner that damages neither the nerve nor the electronic mechanism .
The result is a flexible structure that wraps around the nerve cell like a cuff , creating a steady and enduring mode of contact .
“ If you imagine the nerve as a cylindrical object , the challenge was how to link the electrical connections of the prosthetic to this .
A rigid structure would not be successful , so the Tyndall group created a new flexible electrical connector device that wraps around the nerve tissue , connecting directly to the nerve , ” Dr Galvin said .
The team used standard cell culture tests to develop a mechanism that would not be damaged by biological solutions surrounding the nerves .
The work , which began in 2006 , took 39 months to complete .
However , while significant progress has been made , further developments and trials need to be conducted on various aspects before the bionic hand can be ready for use by amputees .
“ As a research project it is essentially complete and has successful demonstrated the concept , but it must now go through a phase of optimisation and trials before it will be available for use by patients , ” Dr Galvin said .
When Karen listed her seven year old Ford Focus on carsguide.com.au , part of the prominent News network devoted to buying and selling cars , she hoped for interested buyers .
Instead , all she got was the tired old overpayment scam .
Karen listed her car for sale .
A used 2003 Ford Focus , new stereo , about 94,000 kms .
Now , Karen thought maybe she would get no interested buyers .
Or , she might get a few bites but price and negotiations may not work out .
Either way that 's life , that 's business .
What she did n't expect was to receive not one , not two but no less than seven responses in the first two days that read almost exactly alike :
Hello Mate ,
I just want to know if you have the service history and log book for the car .. cos i have gone through it on the website and it suit my taste ... i really want to get the car so i will accept your offer .
i am buying the car as a birthday gift for wife .
I am on sea at the moment as i am a marine engineer and due to the nature of my work , phone calls making and visiting of website are restricted but i squeezed out time to check this advert and send you an email regarding it .
I really want the car to be a surprise for my wife so i wont let her know anything about the car until it gets delivered to her , i am sure she will be more than happy with the car ... I will be paying with PayPal because i do n't have access to my bank account online as i do n't have internet banking , but i can pay from my PayPal account , as i have my bank account attached to it , i will need you to give me your PayPal email address so i can make the payments asap for the car and please if you do n't have PayPal account yet , it is very easy to set up , go to WWW .
PayPal.com and get it set up , after you have set it up i will only need the e-mail address you use for registration with PayPal so as to put the money through .
Do n't worry about the pick up , my shipping agent will be coming to pick it up , I 'll like you to send me your address so that my shipping agent can figure it out and come for the pick up and other necessary things .
For the test drive my agent will be in charge when he comes for the pickup .
..... And how much is your final price for the car ?...
Awaits your response ..
Stephen
The responses varied names and reasons for not coming in person but all had several features in common .
First , the so - called buyers were always happy to buy the vehicle sight - unseen and without attending in person .
Second , they all insisted on making payment via PayPal .
Initially Karen had listed PayPal as a payment option ( along with bank cheque , cash and so forth ) but removed this after the first batch of responses .
It did n't make any change in the responses received .
What we have here is a classic case of the ' cheque overpayment scam ' which is detailed on the Australian Government 's Scamwatch web site .
In essence , this scam is played on those selling items over the Internet or through classifieds .
The scammer will make an offer , usually quite a generous offer , and makes payment for more money than the agreed price .
The seller is urged to make a refund - and fast enough , the scammer hopes , that they do n't realise the initial payment actually bounces or is rejected .
The scammer may not genuinely be interested in the item being sold but if it is something small and which can be posted then the seller loses that as well as cash .
If you receive such e-mails yourself , you are urged to report these to the appropriate Government body .
While it is easy to delete scam e-mails unless they are reported the perpetrators will continue to be free to try their hand at such tactics .
Disappointingly , these were the only responses Karen received , making her question just who CarsGuide is marketing to .
i TWire asked Annie Petersson from News Digital Media whether CarsGuide were concerned about their site being used by scammers , whether they had any protections and controls in place or planned to do so , and if they knew how many of their sellers are targeted in this way .
Annie told iTWire " Carsguide 's website is no more , or less , affected by scams than any other motoring site .
' Carsguide takes scams extremely seriously .
We have extensive advice on the site detailing the different types of scams , including the latest versions , and how to avoid them .
' Examples of our advice can be found here and here .
' We provide links to The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission 's website and the government 's ScamWatch site .
We also ask any readers that are suspicious of an advertisement or offer to contact us . '

Let me know .
When Brazil and Turkey clinched a deal with Iran over its disputed nuclear program last weekend , the two non-permanent members of the Security Council not only challenged the unbridled political power exercised by the five big powers but also jeopardized U.S. plans for a unanimous resolution imposing sanctions against Tehran .
As a result , the 15 - member Security Council now remains split , with at least two countries — and possibly more — lined up against a U.S. - inspired resolution against Iran .
The Brazil - Turkey initiative , which has undermined the upcoming resolution likely to be adopted next month , has also triggered implicit political threats against the two " renegade " countries .
According to unnamed government sources both in Europe and Washington , Turkey ’s longstanding attempts to join the European Union ( EU ) are likely to be derailed further .
And so would Brazil ’s plans to join as a permanent member of the Security Council ( along with Japan , Germany and India ) .
Both countries , with strong economic links to Iran , stand accused of thwarting mostly Western efforts to isolate Tehran .
Norman Solomon , executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy , told IPS that rather than wisely encouraging Turkey and Brazil to pursue their new diplomatic efforts with Iran , the U.S. government is spurning those constructive efforts .
" Washington is failing to affirm the enormous positive potential of the kind of diplomacy that Turkey and Brazil are offering , " he said .
Instead of searching for a new configuration , the administration of President Barack Obama is falling back on an old one : confrontation , he noted .
" Led by Washington , the escalation of rhetoric from the world ’s biggest nuclear - weapons powers is aimed at a government that is engaged in a nascent nuclear program with unclear goals , " said Solomon , author of War Made Easy : How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death .
Under the agreement reached last week , Iran has agreed to ship about half of its nuclear fuel stockpile to Turkey .
Iran , which has continued to vehemently deny it has any plans to develop nuclear weapons , says its existing projects are aimed at developing nuclear energy , not armaments .
" That the Brazil / Turkey initiative has set back Brazil ’s bid for a permanent seat and Turkey ’s application for EU membership assumes that these countries were on track to achieving their aspirations , " a U.N. diplomat told IPS .
The fact is that the five big powers in the Security Council , the United States , Britain , France , Russia and China ( P5 ) , have never been keen on having new permanent members in their ranks .
" They would like to keep membership to this exclusive P5 club closed .
And Turkey ’s chances of getting admitted into the EU have also dimmed in recent years , " he pointed out .
And so , in reality , both Turkey and Brazil are not in any danger of losing what they do not have — or what they have been promised but never delivered .
Phyllis Bennis , director of the New Internationalism Project at the Washington - based Institute for Policy Studies , told IPS the U.S. crusade for new U.N. sanctions against Iran has been underway for a long time .
" But the new intensity , the new scurrying around to make sure China and Russia were on board , the new scramble for an immediate public announcement , all reflected Washington ’s frustration with Iran ’s new agreement with Turkey and Brazil , " she said .
That agreement requires Iran to send about half of its low - enriched uranium to Turkey in return for somewhat higher - enriched prepared fuel rods for use in its medical reactor — pretty close to what the United States and its allies were demanding of Iran just months ago .
" So the harsh U.S. response — condemning the agreement as ‘ just words , ’ and demanding that Iran make even more concessions , implying that only a complete and utter Iranian surrender would suffice — makes clearer than ever the reality that the U.S. policy towards Iran is not about an actual nuclear weapons threat but about power politics , " said Bennis , author of Ending the US War in Afghanistan : A Primer .
If adopted , the proposed resolution would be the fourth , imposing a variety of sanctions against Iran .
The current resolution improves on the previous three by requiring U.N. member states to inspect ships and aircraft headed into or out of Iran — if there are grounds to suspect that banned materials were on board .
Solomon said that rather than genuinely pursuing a nuclear - weapons - free Middle East , " The administration in Washington is maintaining the U.S. policy of winking at Israel ’s sizeable nuclear arsenal while insisting that nuclear developments elsewhere in the region must strictly adhere to Washington ’s edicts . "
Turkey and Brazil should be supported — not undermined — as those two countries endeavor to find solutions to the dangerous standoff between Washington and Tehran , he declared .
Speaking on condition of anonymity , the U.N. diplomat told IPS that the Turkey / Brazil initiative has definitely complicated matters .
" The initiative was in some ways a reaction of some of the bigger , more influential non-permanent members to the secretive manner in which the P5 plus 1 ( Germany ) have dealt with this issue , " he noted .
They have been keeping discussions to themselves and not sharing information or bringing the non-permanent members into the discussions , thereby giving the impression that the non-permanent members will have no choice but to go along with whatever resolution the P5 plus - 1 produce , he said .
Besides the five permanent members , the 10 non-permanent members in the Security Council are Austria , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Brazil , Gabon , Japan , Lebanon , Mexico , Nigeria , Turkey and Uganda .
Bennis said that new U.N. sanctions are not going to stop Iran ’s nuclear enrichment — like sanctions against any country with a repressive government , they are far more likely to impact the civilian population .
The Brazil - Turkey initiative , on the other hand , actually takes major steps towards increasing international oversight of Iran ’s nuclear power program , and , if allowed to go forward without the all - too - likely U.S. interference , could well lead to a significant diminution of Iran ’s enrichment , she added .
" If that were really the goal of the U.S. anti-Iran mobilization , you ’d think they would be pleased , " Bennis said .
Instead , she pointed out , the U.S. Congress and the Obama administration appear to be moving as fast as they can to prevent the Brazil - Turkey initiative from working , potentially even resolving the current crisis .
Ironically , the one thing that could prevent a new round of U.N. sanctions might just be a renewed level of independence in the U.N. Security Council .
Even if U.S. pressure won promises from Russia and China that they would n’t veto a harsh new sanctions regime , that ’s not the same as a promise to vote for the sanctions .
If current Council members Brazil and Turkey can convince some of their friends and allies on the Council to resist the U.S. pressure , Chinese and Russian abstentions could allow a new " coalition of the unwilling " to stop the sanctions .
Led by Turkey and Brazil , other Council members — whom the U.S. and other veto - holders rarely consult — could stop a sanctions move in its tracks .

Where once they shuffled , now they run .
Initially born of forbidden voodoo rituals or the sign of a religious apocalypse , for the past decade zombies have slowly metamorphosed into the by - products of something else entirely .
Advertisement
Science now , not the supernatural , is most often to blame when loved - ones become something less than human and begin to prey on the survivors .
While earlier works of fiction have played with the notion of what a zombie is and how it comes to be , it is pop culture 's modern influence on an ancient fear that has had the greatest impact on the undead 's evolution .
Advertisement
But why ?
God is Dead , But Science is Undead
" In so many ways , our supernatural gods have been replaced by technological wonders — so of course our monsters can't be far behind , " Dr. Carolyn Kaufman , who has a doctorate in clinical psychology , tells Kotaku .
" The god / monster duality reflects what happens when something we trust religiously turns on us .
The pleasant propaganda ( the so - called " good intentions " ) is shucked away in place of something hungry and mindlessly evil ( the money - grubbing executives , for example ) .

" These days most people are not afraid that god is going to strike them down , they 're more afraid that something in the medical world or pharmaceutical world is going to backfire . "
And at the same time , Kaufman points out , science has helped to decrease peoples ' fear of the supernatural .
Advertisement
" Science has demystified so much of that , " she says .
" But there is still is so much mystery behind what big corporations are doing .
They have so much power and so much power in our lives . "
And with this shift in perspective , this realigning of what is dreadful and frightening to the masses , comes a shift in how those fears are played upon in pop culture .

Books and movies had 28 Days Later , House of the Dead and The Crazies .
Video games have Resident Evil , Dead Rising , The Secret World and , perhaps , even Left 4 Dead .
Fear of the Unknown
It turns out that Left 4 Dead , Valve 's popular zombie apocalypse first - person shooter , has n't quite yet spilled the beans about what caused their outbreak of the undead .
Advertisement
Valve 's Chet Faliszek was surprisingly coy when we asked him exactly what gave birth to his games ' zombies .
" While I appreciate your attempt to fish an answer out of me on how the Infection in Left 4 Dead started , we are n't giving that away yet , " Faliszek said .
" But in the ( upcoming episode of Left 4 Dead 2 ) " The Passing " and the comic book coming out following its release , we will learn more on how the L4D Infection works and the implications of that behavior . "
Advertisement
This ambiguity of the zombies ' origins is deliberate , Faliszek says .
While the developer knows that people want " tidy " explanations for horrific events , Valve decided to avoid that .
Instead Left 4
Dead tells its story through messages scrawled on walls and snippets of conversation , never really revealing what it is that we should fear .
Advertisement
What we can tell so far gives little indication of what caused the outbreak , but it does show that despite facing a ending world the survivors , at least initially , have little interest in discussing religion .
Faliszek points out that 's because so far , in both the first and second games , the survivors do n't have the time to sit down and chat really .
Advertisement
" They are all still rooted in practical survival , " he said .
" With the Infection sweeping the land quickly and our meeting the eight Left 4 Dead one and two survivors early in the Zombie Apocalypse , they have n't had a chance yet to think about anything but their survival or in the case of Coach ; cheese burgers . "
He adds that despite not knowing what it is that gave birth to the undead , the creatures still tap into deeper fears .
Advertisement
" They are more than just enemy soldiers , but a force on the world that is overwhelming , " he said .
" It is everything that can overwhelm you in life coming at you as one single clear enemy .
Once the zombie apocalypse starts , you know the world is never going to go back to the way it was .
You can't be a conscientious objector to the war on zombies , they are a force you have to fight or they will destroy you .
" There is also this feeling , while it is an overwhelming force working against you – if you play your cards just right , do everything perfectly , you can survive .
It is up to you .
It represents your daily life itself but in a clear and simple package . "
World War II shooter Call of Duty : World at War , which features a surprise appearance of zombies in its multiplayer modes , also decided to be ambiguous about their zombies ' origins .
" In Call of Duty : World at War , Nazi Zombies represent a fear of the unknown " said Josh Olin , Community Manager at Treyarch .
" Their origin and biology is deliberately vague , a riddle to be solved by those who are interested .

Fear of the Supernatural
Of the video games out or coming out that feature zombies , only one seems to seriously look at the concept of these creatures being the by - product of the supernatural .
Advertisement
The yet - to - be released computer game The Secret World is a massively multiplayer online game set in a world deeply influenced by religion , said the game 's creative director Ragnar Tørnquist .
" Religion plays a huge role in history and mythology , in modern conspiracies , urban legends and pop culture – it's something that affects all of us ; politically , spiritually – positively and negatively , " Tørnquist said .
" It 's an important part of the real world , and it's an important part of the secret world .
Of course , our setting is n't based on a specific religion or set of beliefs – or religion in general – but it's a world where demons and vampires are real , where powerful secret organisations have ruled over mankind for millennia , where magic is everywhere and where the lines between the natural and the supernatural are thin .
The spiritual – whether it 's religion , the occult , or simply the fear of things that go bump in the night – fits right into that . "
Advertisement
While publishers Funcom have been tight - lipped about how expansive the game will be , they have said that it will include modern day settings in New England , Egypt , New York , Seoul and London .
All of which were researched to allow the game to tap into the local cultures ' beliefs and traditions .
Among the supernatural creatures players will stumble across and fight will be hordes of the undead .
Zombies that can be , Tørnquist says , categorized as supernatural .
They are not born of a virus or bio- hazardous material , but rather mystical means , he says .
Advertisement
But despite that , Tørnquist and his team still are n't tapping into a fear or religion or religious consequences in their use of these creatures , but rather the ominous threat of a greater power in control of the undead .
" Our zombies play on people 's fear of – and hope in – something bigger than ourselves , something ancient and mystical and spiritual that cannot be explained by science or technology , " he said .
" It 's the idea of a world – a universe – of secrets , only a few of which we have deciphered .
And there really is something terrifying and dreadful about seeing the dead being brought back to life by those who wish to destroy mankind – it's a slap in our collective faces and a great incentive for joining the war on darkness . "
Advertisement
Fear of the Known
Like Dr. Kaufman , Tørnquist sees the move away from supernatural zombies as a response to a shift in public sentiment and fears .
Advertisement
" I guess it 's the zeitgeist – the spirit of the times – to fear disease , pollution , technology gone haywire , " Tørnquist said .
" Zombies were traditionally supernatural ; corpses reanimated through witchcraft and voodoo rather than victims of the superflu , but I think that most of us – at least in Europe and North America – fear a pandemic , global warming or a natural catastrophe more than we do dark sorcery . "
This fear of science could always give way to a resurgence in religion and fears driven by the supernatural , mythological and religious .
After all , Kaufman points out , a similar shift has happened before .
Advertisement
" Even centuries ago , technology seized the human imagination as a way to ( accidentally ) create monsters , " she points out .
" Take Frankenstein , for example , or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde .
These authors argued that technology was giving humans the tools of the gods , and that humans were too flawed to handle it .
" These days I think people worry less about humans having the power of gods than about letting someone else have the power of gods .
Absolute power is n't frightening unless it belongs to someone else .
In the modern world , though , lots of entities have overwhelming power over our daily lives — the drug companies , the Apples and Microsofts , and so on . "

Most of us are n't all that resourceful .
If the futon we bought from IKEA is missing one of the tiny screws from the manual , we dial the 800 number and wait for them to ship it to us .
But there are people who have built incredible solutions to some of life 's most basic problems using stuff that you 've thrown out because you thought it was useless .
Here are five people who prove that calling anything else useless might be the most hypocritical thing you 've ever said ...

Do n't have the money for a bitchin ' ride but live in the former USSR ?
No problem ; you most likely have some sort of innate ability to turn garbage into mobile gold .
If there 's one thing we learned from Napoleon and Hitler , it 's that Russia is nothing but a hellish frozen landscape .
It makes sense then that one of the Russian people 's main pastimes is taking random junk and turning it into snowmobiles .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
That unnamed retiree is dominating Mother Nature in his homemade snowmobile composed of old motorcycle parts , a carousel seat and even an old novelty coke bottle .
The awesomely effective machine cost barely anything and took him less than a year to build .
He 's far from the only Russian to use garbage to kick the tundra 's ass .
Ever wonder what happened to that weightlifting bench Chuck Norris tricked you into buying , and everything else on TV tricked you into throwing out without ever using ?
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Why , a Russian built a snowmobile out of it , not to mention that inner tube you forgot to tie down while driving down the highway .
Michael Jordan 's Hitler - stache has to have some logical explanation .
Possible theories behind the " Herr Jordan " follow :
1 . He likes a challenge .
Michael Jordan has already sold you everything you never thought you 'd buy .
I sat through Space Jam , and though I have no specific memory why , I still somehow ended up buying the Quad City DJs ' theme song to the movie .
Like Michael Bay with Transformers 2 , he is testing his powers to see if he can make the public embrace the unembraceable because he is both powerful and bored .
2. Lost a bet with Charles Oakley .
Self - explanatory , because Charles Barkley carries an invisible tire iron named " Reggie " loyal to him and only him at all times .
3 . He has a deep philtrum .
A snot - path from his his nose to his lip as deep as the Marianas Trench , invulnerable to normal razors hey wait ...
4 . This is a marketing campaign 's first stage .
Step one : " Do you have a deep philtrum ? "
Step two : Charlie Sheen points at him , says " Hey , it 's black Hitler ! "
Step three : " Try Gillette 's new Contoured Philtrum Decimator , now with 17 Blades . "
Step four : " Jordan backs over Sheen three times in his car at the country club and drives off clean - shaven . "
MARKETING VICTORY .
( And if he backs over Charlie Sheen , one for humanity at large . )
5 . He 's the President of Zimbabwe .
Always a possibility .
Unlike iPhone users , owners of Android smart phones are n't tied to a single app store .
On Monday , mobile game publisher Gameloft made 10 of its Android games available directly through its website , bypassing the need to use Google 's Android Market .
The games , which run on Android handsets like the Motorola Droid , HTC Desire and Nexus One , include versions of Ubisoft games like Assassin 's Creed and Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X. as well as mobile platform hits like Asphalt 5 and Let 's Golf .
Buying games direct from the source requires users to do a little bit of tweaking :
In order to grab and install apps and games from outside the Android Market , users must change their phone 's settings to accept downloads from " unknown sources . "
Gameloft vice president of publishing Baudouin Corman told Wired.com in an email that the company feels that Android is still in the " early stages " of game distribution , and that it wants to test multiple avenues to find the optimal system to get consumers their games .
" We have supported Android from the very beginning , " he said , citing the 30 different games that Gameloft has released on the platform so far .
Last year , another Gameloft executive said that the company had " significantly cut ( its ) investment in Android platforms . "
Corman insists that Gameloft is committed to Android phones .
But Google still has a long way to go before Android becomes the gaming gold mine that the iPhone has been .
This is n't the first time Gameloft has experimented with offering games for Android phones outside of Google 's Android Market .
Prior to Monday , a handful of games like Oregon Trail to 1 vs 100 have been available via direct download from Gameloft .
But when I visited Gameloft 's webstore with my Droid , I had a heck of a time figuring out how to pay my three bucks for Oregon Trail .
I hope making the payment process more clear is part of Gameloft 's plans .

And they call it progress .
Today 's giant mechanised ships that hoover fish from the ocean depths are less effective than 19th - century sailing vessels , a study has discovered .
In fact , the UK 's modern fishing fleet must work 17 times harder for the same catch as its Victorian counterparts .
The nets are not the problem , nor the men who haul them in .
It is the fish .
All the fish in the sea does n't mean the same any more .
Over -fishing is not a new environmental problem but , like its terrestrial cousin , habitat and biodiversity loss , it is one that society finds hard to grasp .
The study , released by experts at York University and the Marine Conservation Society , paints a dismal picture of life beneath the waves .
One of the first to examine records of catches landed , the research assessed the availability of fish by comparing the effort trawling vessels put in with the amount they take home – called the landings of fish per unit of fishing power ( LPUP ) .
The job of a fisherman is never easy , but the study highlights just how much more difficult it has become as their prey dwindles .
From 1889 to 2007 , the LPUP declined by 500 times for halibut , more than 100 times for haddock , and more than 20 times for plaice .
In the waters of England and Wales , 19th - century fishermen were landing four times as much as today .
In 1937 , at the peak of the UK 's fishing industry , the catch was 14 times what it is now .
The figures indicate fish stocks were in decline long before a dip in catch quantity in the 1960s .
This was masked by technical development and the shift to new fishing grounds .
The experts say their findings reinforce calls for reform of EU fisheries policy .
They are not the first to call for such a change to protect fish .
Each year , scientists at the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas issue their dire roll call of stocks and urge politicians to curb quotas .
Each year , the politicians ignore the advice and send their boats out again .
And with every journey , so their task gets harder .

The drugs were collected when HMS Manchester docked in Colombia
A Royal Navy wren has been jailed for smuggling cocaine into the UK on board a warship which had been on counter - narcotics training .
Teresa Matos , 37 , from Gateshead , admitted importing the drugs worth £ 2 m .
The cocaine was found in the lining of Matos 's clothing when HMS Manchester arrived in Plymouth , Devon , last August en route to its Portsmouth base .
Matos was jailed for seven - and - a- half years at Portsmouth Crown Court .
Three men from London were also jailed .
The Angolan - born steward was granted asylum in Britain in 2004 .
The rewards that were to be made , had you been successful , would have been considerable and the penalties must be considerable as well Judge Ian Pearson , Portsmouth Crown Court
Her boyfriend Raul Beia , 39 , from Clapham , south - west London , who was also granted asylum to live in the UK , was jailed for 13 years after being found guilty of illegally importing drugs .
Abdul Banda , 34 , of Ashbourne Road , Ealing , West London , who pleaded guilty to the charge , was jailed for 10 - and - a - half years .
The court was told Beia and Banda were the " ringleaders " of the operation , while Matos was a courier and Dean Langley was recruited to receive and distribute the drugs .
Twenty - year - old Langley , of Clem Attlee Estate , Fulham , west London , who had denied involvement , was sentenced to 11 years .
The court was told Matos picked up the 4.94kg haul of 100 % pure cocaine while HMS Manchester had docked at the port of Cartagena in Colombia , South America , in July last year .
CCTV footage
The destroyer , which had been on a seven - month deployment across the Atlantic and South Pacific , had spent time in Cape Verde for counter - narcotics training with the island 's coastguard .
It had also visited the US , the Falkland Islands , Brazil and Colombia .
Judge Ian Pearson said : " This was a serious importation of a considerable quantity of cocaine .
" The rewards that were to be made , had you been successful , would have been considerable and the penalties must be considerable as well .
" It goes without saying this offence is so serious that only a custodial sentence of some length may be justified . "
Matos , of Contsworth Court , Gateshead , was arrested in Plymouth while Banda was arrested with Beia and Langley at Portsmouth 's Ibis Hotel .
The three men had been caught on CCTV purchasing digital scales , plastic boxes and clear food wrap to be used to distribute the drugs .
Judge Pearson ordered for the drugs and paraphernalia to be confiscated and destroyed .
Following the sentencing , the Ministry of Defence said criminal behaviour would not be tolerated in the Royal Navy .
" Individuals given custodial sentences are usually discharged from the service , " a spokesman said .
Remarks of President Barack Obama Saturday , June 19 , 2010
Weekly Address
Washington , DC
At this moment , our nation is facing a host of big and difficult challenges .
And more than anything else , what ’s required to meet those challenges right now is a sense of cooperation and common purpose among our leaders .
What we need is a willingness in Washington to put the public ’s interests first – a willingness to score fewer political points so that we can start solving more problems .
That ’s why I was disappointed this week to see a dreary and familiar politics get in the way of our ability to move forward on a series of critical issues that have a direct impact on people ’s lives .
In the United States Senate , we have legislation that would boost our economic recovery and help Americans who ’ve been affected by the worst recession in generations .
We ’ve certainly made progress since we were losing 750,000 jobs per month around the time I took office .
Our economy is growing again , and we ’ve added jobs for five straight months .
But there are still millions of Americans out of work , and millions more who are struggling to pay the bills .
The legislation in the Senate right now would extend unemployment benefits to those workers who lost their job through no fault of their own .
It would provide relief to struggling states that would help save the jobs of thousands of teachers and cops and firefighters .
There are also provisions in this legislation that would extend the tax credit for first - time homebuyers , as well as tax cuts to keep research and development jobs here in the United States .
Unfortunately , the Republican leadership in the Senate wo n’t even allow this legislation to come up for a vote .
And if this obstruction continues , unemployed Americans will see their benefits stop .
Teachers and firefighters will lose their jobs .
Families will pay more for their first home .
All we ask for is a simple up or down vote .
That ’s what the American people deserve .
Just like they deserve an up or down vote on legislation that would hold oil companies accountable for the disasters they cause – a vote that is also being blocked by the Republican leadership in the Senate .
Right now , the law places a $ 75 million cap on the amount oil companies must pay to families and small businesses who suffer economic losses as a result of a spill like the one we ’re witnessing in the Gulf Coast .
We should remove that cap .
But the Republican leadership wo n’t even allow a debate or a vote .
And as we speak today , 136 men and women who I ’ve nominated for key positions in the federal government are awaiting a vote on the floor of the Senate .
All are highly qualified .
Very few are controversial .
The vast majority already have support from both parties .
But most of them are seeing their nominations intentionally delayed by Republican leaders , or even blocked altogether .
They can not get a vote .
What this means is that , at a moment when our country is facing so many challenges – a time when we need all hands on deck – we cannot get the qualified people we need to start the jobs they were appointed to do .
Look , the nature of our democracy is that we ’ll always have disagreements and debates -- even heated ones .
That ’s healthy and it ’s important .
But let ’s argue over genuine differences – over ideas and policies .
And let ’s go into those debates with an open mind – a willingness to find common ground and a conviction that , in the end , one way or another , we will have a vote to decide them .
Next week , I ’ll be meeting with a bipartisan group of Senators to discuss how we can transition away from our dependence on fossil fuels and embrace a clean energy future .
I do n’t expect that we ’ll agree on a solution right away .
In fact , I know that there will be plenty of disagreement and different ideas .
But at least it shows that Republicans and Democrats can still sit down together in an attempt to tackle the big challenges facing our nation .
I know the political season is upon us in Washington .
But gridlock as a political strategy is destructive to the country .
Whether we are Democrats or Republicans , we ’ve got an obligation that goes beyond caring about the next election .
We have an obligation to care for the next generation .
So I hope that when Congress returns next week , they do so with a greater spirit of compromise and cooperation .
America will be watching .
Thanks .

Bicycle Maintenance Guide and Riding Tips
Introduction and Table of Contents
I often get asked about bicycle maintenance and repairs , and tips for how to ride efficiently .
This little manual is intended as a summary of what I have learned over the years .
I am not a professional mechanic .
All of what I say here is the result of personal experience and opinion and may in places flatly contradict professional techniques , but it has served me well .
I offer no guarantees that it will work for you .
If your bicycle falls apart because I said something wrong , you are on your own .
They are the muscular , leg - roomy fixtures of New York ’s crowded streetscape , the automobiles that came to represent the city .
The Ford Crown Victoria served as the mainstay of taxi and police fleets .
Its close cousin , the Lincoln Town Car , could reliably be found idling outside Lincoln Center or waiting to whisk a Wall Street type home for the evening .
But in a little more than a year , both models will go the way of the Checker cab .
Ford Motor Company plans to shutter the Canadian plant that manufactures the cars and discontinue the recognizably bulky frame that gives them their shape .
That means the end for vehicles that have come to symbolize the full spectrum of New York life , from private black sedans purring on Park Avenue to the ubiquitous sight of the yellow cab , great equalizer of the varied urban tribe .
New technology is being used to obtain images of planets around other stars .
One day we may be able to detect signs of plate tectonics on these distant worlds .
A planet outside of our solar system , said to be the first ever directly photographed by telescopes on Earth , has been officially confirmed to be orbiting a sun- like star , according to follow - up observations .
The alien planet is eight times the mass of Jupiter and orbits at an unusually great distance from its host star — more than 300 times farther from the star than our Earth is from the sun .
Astronomers first discovered the planet in 2008 using visible light observations from telescopes on Earth , making it the first direct photo of an extrasolar world .
But at the time there was still the remote chance that it only looked like it was orbiting the star , from the perspective of Earth , due to a lucky alignment of object , star and observer .
" Our new observations rule out this chance alignment possibility , and thus confirms that the planet and the star are related to each other , " said astronomer David Lafreniere , who led the research team that discovered the planet .
The new observations that confirm the planet circles its parent star were made using high - resolution adaptive optics technology at the Gemini Observatory .
The observatory is an international collaboration with two identical 8 - meter telescopes , located at Mauna Kea , Hawaii and Cerro Pachon in northern Chile .
Planet around young star
The host star , which has an estimated mass of about 85 percent that of our sun , is located approximately 500 light - years away in a group of young stars called the Upper Scorpius Association that formed about 5 million years ago .
The planet has an estimated temperature of over 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit ( about 1,500 degrees Celsius ) .
This makes the planet much hotter than Jupiter , which has an atmospheric cloud - top temperature of approximately minus 166 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 110 degrees Celsius ) .
The relatively young age of the system — our solar system is 4.6 billion years old — explains the high temperature of the planet , according to the researchers .
[ The Strangest Alien Planets ]
The contraction of the planet under its own gravity during its formation quickly raised its temperature to thousands of degrees .
But , once this contraction phase is over , the planet will slowly cool down by radiating infrared light .
Within billions of years , the planet will eventually reach a temperature that is much more similar to that of Jupiter .
Tale of a planet find
Lafreniere and his research team firstannounced their planet 's discovery in September 2008 .
At the time he was at the University of Toronto , but is now at the University of Montreal and Center for Research in Astrophysics of Quebec .
In 2008 , the researchers claimed that the discovery also represented thefirst picture of a planet that orbits around a star similar to our sun .
Other astronomers have also made similar claims , including a 2004 discovery of an object that could be a planet or a type of failed star called a brown dwarf .
" Back in 2008 what we knew for sure was that there was this young planetary mass object sitting right next to a young sun-like star on the sky , " Lafreniere said .
The close proximity of the two cosmic objects seemed to suggest that they were associated with each other , but there was a possibility — albeit unlikely — that they were unrelated and had only aligned in the sky by chance .
One of the objects might have been closer or farther by considerable distance .
So more observations were required to confirm the cosmic find .
The results of the study will be published in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal .
The system , known as 1RXS J160929.1 - 210524 ( or 1RXS 1609 for short ) , will give scientists a unique example to study , as its extreme separation from the star seems to challenge common planetary formation theories .
" The unlikely locale of this alien world could be telling us that nature has more than one way of making planets , " said the study 's co-author Ray Jayawardhana of the University of Toronto .
" Or , it could be hinting at a violent youth when close encounters between newborn planets hurl some siblings out to the hinterlands . "
The team of astronomers initially detected the exoplanet using the Gemini Observatory in April 2008 , which made it the first likely planet known to orbit a sun- like star that was revealed by direct imaging .
At the time , the researchers also obtained a spectrum of the planet and were able to determine many of its characteristics , which are confirmed in the new study .
" In retrospect , this makes our initial data the first spectrum of a confirmed exoplanet ever ! , " Lafreniere said .
The spectrum illustrates absorption features due to water vapor , carbon monoxide and molecular hydrogen in the planet 's atmosphere .
Other distant planets photographed
This is not the only exoplanet to be discovered using direct imaging .
Since initially observing 1RXS 1609 , several other alien worlds have also been found , including a system of three planets that orbit around the star HR 8799 .
This discovery was also made using the Gemini Observatory .
The latest exoplanet confirmation is unique , however , because the planets around HR 8799 orbit much closer to their host star .
The study of 1RXS 1609 also verified that no additional large planets ( between one and eight times the mass of Jupiter ) are present in the system that are closer to the star .
Future observations may reveal evidence on the origin of thestrangely far - out planet .
In fact , within a few years , it should be possible to detect a slight difference in the motion of the planet and its star , due to their mutual orbits .
This difference , however , will be " very small , " said the study 's co-author Marten van Kerkwijk of the University of Toronto , since the fastest possible orbital period is more than one thousand years .
Clocking alien planet 's speed
But , using Gemini , it is possible to precisely measure the velocity of the planet relative to its host star .
This can help astronomers determine whether the planet is following a roughly circular orbit — as would be expected if it really formed far from its host star — or whether it is in a very non-circular or even unbound orbit .
The latter could be the case if it formed closer to the star but was kicked out as a result of an encounter with another alien planet , researchers said .
The adaptive optics system on the Gemini telescopes were crucial to making the observations of 1RXS 1609 .
" Without adaptive optics , we would simply have been unable to see this planet , " Lafreniere said .
" The atmosphere blurs the image of a star so much that it extends over and is much brighter than the image of a faint planet around it , rendering the planet undetectable .
Adaptive optics removes this blurring and provides a better view of faint objects very close to stars . "
You know , if Rand Paul loses his Senate race , in a way I ’ll be sorry .
He ’s been so much fun in such a short period of time !
Anyway , given the flap over his assertion that he would n’t support the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 , some Republicans are making the argument that they were the party of civil rights , while Democrats were the enemies .
And there ’s some truth to that : in the 1950s and early 1960s , the opponents of civil right were largely Southern Democrats .
But what happened to those Southern Democrats ?
They became Republicans .
And I ’m not just speaking metaphorically : many Republican members of Congress during the era of GOP dominance were , literally , former Democrats who switched parties .
The point is that today ’s Democratic party is , effectively , the party of Lyndon Johnson , whose decision to push forward on civil rights cost the party the South , as he knew it would .
Meanwhile , today ’s Republican party is the party of Richard Nixon , who cynically exploited the backlash against civil rights to build a new majority .
So yes , let ’s honor the great Republicans of yore ; I ’m a Lincoln man , myself .
But let me tell you , George W. Bush was no Abraham Lincoln .
A team of leading scientists have spent two years analysing the effects of 20 of Britain 's most widely used drugs , and have devised a scientifically rigorous - and controversial - new ranking for them .
The BBC's Horizon programme has followed their research and looks at the science behind the headlines .
How do the brain and body react to each stimulant as it passes into the bloodstream , and what are the long - term effects of drugs relative to their classification ?
If the current classification should be changed in view of the latest findings , what exactly is Britain 's most dangerous drug ?

Forsvaret bekrefter i en pressemelding at fire soldater døde etter at VG
Nett tidligere søndag kveld skrev at flere norske soldater var blitt drept i Afghanistan .
Soldatene var på oppdrag ved Almar sør i Faryab - provinsen da de ble rammet av veibomben .
VG
Nett har fått bekreftet at de fire norske soldatene som ble drept , satt i samme kjøretøy da de ble rammet av en eksplosjon .
Kjøretøyet var en pansret Iveco feltvogn , som er det mest brukte kjøretøyet blant de norske styrkene i Afghanistan .
Et helikopter rykket kjapt ut for å hente de drepte soldatene og kjøretøyet tilbake til den norske leiren .

AFGHANISTAN -EKSPERT :-
Må vente flere trefninger med norske soldater
- Går veldig inn på oss
- Det er med stor sorg vi har fått melding om at fire av våre soldatkolleger har falt i kamp , sier generalløytnant Bernt Iver Ferdinand Brovold , sjef for Forsvarets operative hovedkvarter , i en pressemelding søndag kveld .
- Vår viktigste jobb akkurat nå er å ta vare på medsoldatene til de drepte .
Det er klart dette går veldig inn på oss .
Våre tanker går spesielt til de drepte soldatenes pårørende , sier han .
Aftenposten .
no meldte i natt at Taliban skal ha tatt på seg ansvaret , ifølge en melding postet på et islamistisk forum .
Det har så langt ikke lykkes VG Nett å få verifisert disse opplysningene .
PROTOKOLL : Send din siste hilsen til de fire norske soldatene
Norge har tatt på seg et spesielt ansvar for gjenoppbygging og sikkerhet i Faryab - provinsen , som ligger i det nordvestre hjørnet av Afghanistan .
Det er her , i den norsk - ledede leiren utenfor Meymaneh , at størsteparten av de norske soldatene i Afghanistan er stasjonert .
Også flere sivile aktører jobber ut fra denne leiren .
Forsvaret jobber natt til mandag med å varsle pårørende til de involverte soldatene .
Norge har i dag en styrke på 512 soldater i Afghanistan .
De norske tapene kommer bare to måneder etter at åtte norske soldater ble skadet , to av dem alvorlig , da de ble angrepet under oppdrag i Ghowrmach - distriktet i Faryab - provinsen .
Opprørerne brukte håndvåpen og granater , og kampene varte i seks timer før situasjonen roet seg .
Helikoptre ble sendt inn for å evakuere fire av de åtte skadede soldatene .

Blodigste måned siden invasjonen
Juni har vært den blodigste måneden i Afghanistan siden invasjonen for snart ni år siden .
97 utenlandske soldater har blitt drept så langt denne måneden .
Tidligere søndag ble tre NATO - soldater , to av dem fra USA , drept i kamper i Afghanistan .
To av soldatene ble drept under kamp øst i Afghanistan , mens den tredje ble drept under et angrep sør i landet .
313 utenlandske soldater er drept i Afghanistan i årets seks første måneder , mot 520 i hele fjor .
En talsmann for den NATO - ledede ISAF - styrken mener det høye tapstallet i juni er et resultat av at kampen mot Taliban og andre opprørere nå er trappet opp .
- Takket være styrkeoppbyggingen har vi vært i stand til å utfordre opprøret og Taliban i områder der de ikke har blitt utfordret på mange år , sier brigadegeneral Josef Blotz .
- Det er en av årsakene til at vi har opplevd noe flere voldshandlinger de siste dagene og ukene .
Beklageligvis har dette også ført til høyere tapstall , sier Blotz , ifølge NTB .
Lederen for den amerikanske etterretningsorganisasjonen
CIA , Leon Panetta , medgir at kampene blir stadig hardere i Afghanistan .
- Vi gjør framskritt , men det er tøffere og går saktere enn noen hadde trodd på forhånd , sier Panetta til fjernsynsstasjonen ABC .

Ni norske soldater drept
Til sammen har nå ni norske soldater mistet livet under oppdrag i Afghanistan .
25 . januar ble 22 år gamle Claes Joachim Olsson drept da kjøretøyet han satt i , ble rammet av en veibombe om lag fire kilometer sørøst for Ghowrmach , og dermed har 2010 blitt det dødligste året for norske soldater i Afghanistan .
Taliban tok på seg ansvaret for å ha lagt ut veibomben som tok livet av 22 - åringen .
I 2009 ble den 30 år gamle norske etterretningsoffiseren , kaptein Trond Petter Kolset fra Steinkjer , drept av en selvmordsbomber vest for Mazar-e Sharif i Badghis - provinsen .
To år tidligere ble den 22 år gamle soldaten Kristoffer Sørli Jørgensen drept av en veibombe nord for Meymaneh i Faryab - provinsen , og noen måneder tidligere samme året ble spesialsoldaten Tor Arne Lau - Henriksen skutt og drept i et angrep i Lowgar - provinsen sør for Kabul .
Tommy Rødningsby var den første norske soldaten som omkom i Afghanistan .
29 - åringen ble drept under et rakettangrep mot en norsk kolonne i Kabul .
- Vil bli verre
Området hvor nordmennene opererer er farlig , og kommer ikke til å bli bedre i overskuelig fremtid mente sjefen for fredsinstituttet PRIO ved det forrige norske dødsfallet i Afghanistan .
- Jeg tror det vil bli verre og ser det ikke som veldig sannsynlig at det blir bedre uten at det skjer en hel omlegging av strategien , sa PRIO - sjef Kristian Harpviken til VG Nett .
- Slik det ser ut nå , er det lite som tilsier at en militær opptrapping lykkes .

State treasurer and gubernatorial candidate Dean Martin on Tuesday unveiled a multi- pronged border security plan that calls for the immediate deployment of 3,000 troops to the Arizona - Mexico border , and a new partnership with Sheriff Joe Arpaio to house illegal immigrants in " tent city " style jails .
Martin , who is pitted in the Republican primary against a host of opponents , spent most of Tuesday focusing on incumbent Gov. Jan Brewer , who he considers his main competition in the race for the GOP nomination .
During his remarks , he repeatedly criticized Brewer for not acting aggressively on immigration and border issues .
" The governor has been in office for 18 months and only recently discovered we had an immigration problem when she started doing election year polling , " Martin said .
Martin said if elected , his first action as governor would be signing an executive order to deploy troops to the Arizona border at state expense � despite the state 's ongoing budget woes .
He proposes to pay for the $ 50 to $ 60 million per year cost by refinancing the state 's debt and by utilizing existing prison space � rather than building new prisons .
Part of that plan involves working with Arpaio to establish a " statewide " tent - city style jail system , specifically designed to house illegal immigrants who have been convicted of crimes at low cost .
" There is no reason the state of Arizona should be building comfy new prisons for those who are violating our laws , " Martin said .
Other components of Martin 's effort include the completion of a border fence , to be funded both through private citizen donations and state monies , and the creation of a rancher relief fund that would compensate Arizona ranchers and border property owners for damages they incur when " illegal aliens and smugglers cross their property . "
He said the funds for that would come from property seizures generated by Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organization Act ( RICO ) cases .
Brewer 's campaign and gubernatorial staff bristled Tuesday at the suggestion that the governor has not made illegal immigration and border security a priority since taking office .
Spokesman Paul Senseman pointed to repeated correspondence that the governor has sent to the White House asking for additional troops and resources .
He also said the governor has long supported staunch illegal immigration measures , including Proposition 200 , which required proof of identification to vote and proof of citizenship to register to vote .
In addition , her campaign manager , Doug Cole , said that Martin 's plan to require Arizona citizens to foot the bill for troop deployment to the border is flawed , and that it is the governor 's position that such costs should be born by the federal government .
" Why should voters , who already pay federal taxes , pay again to pick up with is a federal responsibility ? "
Cole said .
Martin and Brewer square off in their first televised gubernatorial debate on Tuesday , against other primary opponents , Paulden businessman Owen " Buz " Mills , Tom Gordon of Mesa and Matt Jette of Apache Junction .
The Republican primary will be held Aug. 24 ; early voting begins July 29 .
Image caption The Taliban remain strong in North Waziristan
Up to 700 people in a tribal region of north - west Pakistan watched the Taliban publicly execute a man accused of killing two brothers , officials say .
Masked militants shot the man , blindfolded and bound , dead at a football ground in Miranshah , the main town in North Waziristan .
Militants in Pakistan 's tribal areas have killed scores of people accused of spying for the US in recent years .
But such public executions by the Taliban are rare .
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says that the latest execution highlights the power the Taliban wields in the region and reflects the growing power and confidence of the militants .
' Quick justice '
Our correspondent says that the security forces appear to have been powerless to stop the execution from taking place .
The killing also signifies an effort by the Taliban to win local people 's sympathy by delivering quick justice , our correspondent says .
Locals in Miranshah told the BBC that the man who was killed , known only as Waheed , was 25 .
They said two masked militants opened fire on him , killing him on the spot .
He had earlier been found guilty by a self - styled Taliban " court " .
A government official said that the body of the dead man was found near the town , along with a letter that named him and said he had been executed on the orders of a Taliban council for killing two brothers , Noor Zeb and Alam Zeb .
Local sources say Waheed opened fire on his two brothers in Miranshah 's cycle ground area after a brief altercation last month .
There have been instances of public Taliban " justice " in the area before , but they are not common .
In December 2005 , the Taliban in Miranshah clashed with a local militia led by Hakim Khan .
His group had set up checkpoints in the area and were extorting money from motorists , traders and residents .
Both sides suffered casualties , but eventually the Taliban killed him and nearly 24 of his men .
They were condemned as robbers and extortionists and their bodies were left hanging from trees .
The Pakistani army has launched several offensives in the volatile north - west over the past year , killing hundreds of militants and capturing several of their strongholds .
But it has resisted US pressure to launch an offensive in North Waziristan .
​ Crestview , Florida mayor hopeful Alan Sampson , who was charged with marijuana possession and possession of “ narcotics equipment ” after police reported seizing a bong from his bedroom in March , said someone broke into his home last week and left rolling papers in his bathroom drawer .
“ I do n’t know if someone was trying to leave me a message or if it was some of the kids in the neighborhood , ” Sampson said , reports Michael Stewart at Florida Freedom Newspapers
Sampson , who has vowed to fire Crestview Police Chgief Brian Mitchell if he ’s elected mayor , said he does n’t use rolling papers .
​ Sampson told deputies who responded to his call that he was running for mayor and that he has made enemies because of campaign promises .
“ Mr. Sampson advised he believes the rolling papers have been planted in his home to get him into trouble , ” the sheriff ’s department said .
Deputies responded to a call at Sampson ’s home on May 8 .
The mayoral candidate told deputies he got home the previous day to find his master bedroom door open and the screen cut from the frame .
“ The screen was neatly cut using an unknown sharp object , ” the report said .
The responding deputy also said he found a living room screen facing Sampson ’s back yard that was also cut away from the window frame .
The missing screens were not recovered .
Deputies got a “ latent fingerprint ” from the window in the master bedroom and the rolling papers were seized and would be checked for fingerprints , too , according to the police report .
Sampson said nothing was taken from his burglarized home .
Just three days ago , officials announced that charges of marijuana possession and battery against Sampson would be dropped if he met conditions laid out in a deferred prosecution agreement .
Under the agreement , the charges will be dismissed if Sampson does not break any laws for the next 10 months ; if he has no contact with teenagers involved in an altercation that led to the battery charge ; and if he completes 25 hours of community service .
In the latest incident involving Sampson before the rolling papers case , the mayoral candidate was arrested March 21 after police serving a search warrant on his home said they discovered marijuana stems and seeds and a bong in his master bedroom .
According to Sampson ’s arrest report , a confidential informant told members of the Crestview Police Department ’s Street Crimes
Unit that he had bought marijuana from a minor living at the home — Sampson ’s 15 - year - old son — “ on numerous occasions . ”
The informant was sent to the home on two occasions , and bought pot from the minor both times while under police surveillance , according to the search warrant .
Police said they found 12 grams of suspected cannabis and digital scvales in the minor ’s jacket pockets .
The minor was charged with possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia .
Sampson has identified the minor as his son and says police coerced the confidential informant into giving his son the pot and scales later brought back while under police surveillance .
“ I never believed in my wildest dreams drugs would be p-lanted on my 15 - year - old son by police in order to obtain a search warrant for my house , ” Sampson said .
Sampson , a long - time critic of the local police department , has vowed to fire the police chief if elected .
He maintains his arrest was an act of retaliation by police in an attempt to destroy his reelection campaign .
“ My goal is to clean out the cesspool that is called the Crestview Police Department , ” Sampson wrote in an email .
Police declined to comment , but in an earlier statement , said “ The Crestview Police Department does not and has never had any interest in Alan Sampson ’s campaign for mayor of the City of Crestview . ”
The battery charge resulted from a February 18 incident after an argument between Sampson and six teenage boys outside his home .
Sampson said he argued with the boys , who were skateboarding , when they blocked his driveway and refused to move as he was leaving for work .
Here in Bangalore , a city of 6.5 million known for its booming high - technology industry , pleasant climate and good private schools , local health managers commonly pay bribes to senior bureaucrats or elected officials to get good jobs , say investigators , civic leaders and senior civil servants .
The health professionals then exact payments from subordinates and patients , emulating their bosses .
" Most of the district health officers have to pay bribes to get promotions and postings , and they in turn collect bribes from their staff and patients , " said Hanumappa Sudarshan , the vigilance director for health and education in Karnataka State 's anticorruption agency .
" It 's a vicious cycle . "
Mr. Sudarshan 's boss , Nanjegowda Venkatachala , a retired Indian Supreme Court justice who heads the agency , put it even more bluntly : " The greed of politicians is ruining the country .
There 's nothing to mince in this regard . "
No matter where the corruption starts , it moves down through the ranks and finally to the poor , for whom it is an inescapable burden .
Though Bangalore has made progress in fighting corruption , it persists in the hospitals .
In the narrow lanes of the slums and working - class neighborhoods around the 30 - bed Austin Town maternity hospital , families with babies and toddlers described their personal experiences of bribery .
Shobha Rani , the doctor in charge , emphatically disputed such accounts in an interview earlier this year .
" I 've not come across even one patient who 's come here and said I 've been charged for anything , " she said .
" So many times , I 've spoken to patients without the knowledge of my staff .
I say : ' Tell me the truth .
What did you face ? '
They always give me a good report . "
But people who have used the hospital tell a different story .
Nagaratna Hanumanthu , 23 , and her husband , Hanumanthu , 28 , a sugar - cane - juice vendor with a single name , lost their first baby to a raging fever just two days after he was born .
Their anxieties were high last November when their daughter was born at Austin Town .
