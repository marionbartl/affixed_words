A businessman on a drink - driving charge advertised to pay a student $ 510 a week to chauffeur him in his Hummer and Lamborghini .
Gary Richards , a director of six companies , placed an advert with Student Job Search in Auckland for a tidy and positive student to drive him to " business appointments " for seven weeks .
He has since " filled the job privately " .
The applicant had to be available in business hours from Monday to Friday – but " can study while the employer is in meetings " .
Richards is charged with driving with excess breath alcohol of 701 micrograms per litre of breath – the legal limit is 400mcg .
He is due to appear in court on June 18 .
Student Job Search spokesman Marek Koliandr said three students were referred for the job , which drew reasonably high interest .
" It sounds like a pretty sweet job . "
The pay rate was lower than the $ 15 an hour the service would usually expect and the hours were " a bit awkward " for students to fit into their schedules .
" Most students attend classes and do exams , so I do n't see how they 're going to fit this in . "
Antony Williams , one of those short - listed , said he thought at first that the job was too good to be true .
" The experience of driving one of ... [ those ] vehicles is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity .
I thought , ' This is me . ' [ I am a ] safe driver , good personality , easy to get on with . "
Mr Koliandr said demand for jobs was high , with the unemployment rate at 6 per cent .
" Students are generally competing more with people that have more experience and skills . "
About 45,000 people registered for Student Job Search in the year to May , compared with 10,000 the year before .

How is that a sleepy , conservative organization like the postal service ends up licensing its brand to a company that can't resist every honey pot scheme and opt out technique in the book ?
I needed to send a package today and figured I 'd try them out .
Visited the site on my Mac , got all the way through registration , entered my card to pay for stamps and then ( and only then ) did I find out their software does n't work on a Mac .
Of course , they knew I was on a Mac but did n't bother to alert me early on .
Now they have my card , but hey , it 's the USPS , so I trust them .
Just for kicks , I call in to ask about the Mac compatibility issue .
It turns out that by entering my card to pay for stamps , I 've agreed to pay them $ 15.95 a month .
Forever .
And ever .
Or until I notice .
I go online to cancel my account and discover that you can't cancel your account online .
You have to call them .
Oh .
( The people on the phone are friendly , for what it 's worth … )
Can you imagine this sort of thing happening at a store ?
Or in a sleepy government office ?
They told me that they have 400,000 paying customers .
I wonder how many of them are paying a monthly fee without realizing it …
Can I suggest three simple principles for ethical dealings online :
When charging someone , tell them exactly what you 're charging them for , on the page itself , not buried in a link .
If you 're billing someone monthly , send them an email every month to tell them you 're doing so .
If that 's going to lead to people quitting , the answer is n't to avoid the email , the answer is to make your service more valuable .
It should be as easy to quit something ( even a free service ) as it is to join it .
There 's something about the mechanics and arms - length nature of the web that just begs companies that know better to treat people in a way that they'd be humiliated to try face to face .
According to the Wall Street Journal , a New York man has filed a lawsuit against Facebook claiming to own an 84 % stake in the company .
Paul D. Ceglia filed a suit in the Supreme Court of New York ’s Allegany County on June 30 , claiming that a 2003 contract signed between him and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg entitles him to a large stake in the company as well as monetary damages .
Judge Thomas Brown issued a temporary restraining order restricting the transfer of Facebook Inc. ’s assets following the lawsuit .
Mr. Ceglia claims that he signed a contract with Mr. Zuckerberg on April 28 , 2003 , to design and develop a website which eventually turned into Facebook .
The contract stated that Mr. Ceglia would pay a $ 1 000 fee and get a 50 % stake in the product .
It was also stated that Mr. Ceglia would receive an additional 1 % interest in the site for every day until it was completed after Jan 1 , 2004 .
In a statement , a spokesman for Facebook said that , “ We believe this suit is completely frivolous and we will fight it vigorously ” .
This is n’t the first time that Facebook has been faced with legal trouble , in September 2004 , a rival social networking site ; ConnectU filed a lawsuit against Zuckerburg alleging he stole the idea for Facebook from them .
The website has also been faced with numerous privacy lawsuits over its ever changing privacy policies .
In recent years Facebook has seen an explosion in growth and surpassed competitors like myspace.com to hold the title of largest social networking site .
Facebook has more than 500 million registered users globally .
Facebook CEO , Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly worth an astonishing $ 4 billion according to Forbes magazine .
If this case proves to be legitimate the social networking giant may be in some big trouble .
Many investors , including Microsoft , who invested $ 240 million into the company may be keeping a weary eye on the proceedings .

At least six Americans are among those injured in Sunday 's bombings in Kampala , Uganda , CNN has confirmed .
Read the full CNN.com report
[ Updated at 6:50 p.m . ]
At least nine people have died in pair of bombings that struck a restaurant and a rugby ground in Uganda 's capital as patrons gathered to watch Sunday 's World Cup final , police said .
Nine people died and five were wounded at an Ethiopian restaurant in Kampala , police spokeswoman Judith Nabakooba said .
But there was a yet - undetermined number of fatalities and injuries at a rugby field where other fans gathered to watch Sunday night 's match between Spain and the Netherlands , Nabakooba said .
Earlier , police indicated that at least 40 people had been killed in the two bombings .
The bombs went off within 25 minutes of each other shortly after 10 p.m. ( 3 p.m. ET ) , as fans gathered in both locations .
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for what Nabakooba called " definite acts of terrorism . "
Islamic militants battling Somalia 's U.N. - backed transitional government have threatened attacks on Uganda and Burundi , which contribute troops to an African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia .
But Nabakooba said the investigation of Sunday 's bombings is not yet focused on any specific group .

Rural areas will need to find new ways to fund fibre broadband
The broadband tax has been scrapped in the last - minute scramble to rush key legislation through before Parliament is dissolved next week .
The tax was a key part of Labour 's strategy to ensure all parts of the country get super - fast broadband .
The Conservatives have always opposed the tax , preferring to allow the market more time to roll out services before government intervention .
The levy was among three taxes in the Finance Bill to be dropped .
The 10 % tax increase on cider and tax relief on holiday homes were also scrapped .
The 50 p - a - month broadband tax would have been applied to all households with a landline telephone .
It is estimated that it would have raised about £ 170 m a year to help fund broadband roll - out .
It was aimed at the final third of the country where experts say it would be too expensive for commercial players such as BT and Virgin Media to roll out fibre services .
But the tax proved controversial and the Conservatives had vowed to scrap it if it had become law and they had won the election .
If funding is needed to roll broadband out to rural areas , the Conservatives plans to use some of the TV licence fee set aside for digital switch - over .
That would not be available until 2012 .
The cross-party Business Innovation and Skills committee of MPs had labelled the tax unfair , because most of those who would pay it would not benefit from it .
It is likely to be reinstated if Labour is re-elected in the 6 May general election .
Andrew Ferguson , editor of broadband news website Thinkbroadband , said it made the future of fast broadband uncertain .
" Dropping of the 50 p per month tax will be welcomed by those that thought it was unfair , but it throws the current plan Labour plans to have next generation broadband to 90 % of homes by 2017 in disarray , " he said .
Malcolm Corbett , chief executive of the Independent Networks Co-operative Association ( Inca ) , was more pragmatic .
" The government will have to raise money by other means , perhaps by getting the private sector and the communities themselves involved .
With them on board , you have a fighting chance of achieving universal access , " he said .

Stop aux vuvuzelas ?
Canal + a dégainé son arme fatale , un nouveau procédé technique qui gomme cette impression qu'une grosse escadrille de frelons en rut vole au - dessus des joueurs .
La chaîne cryptée a fait appel à la société française Audionamix , qui a mis au point le moyen d'effacer certaines fréquence sonores sans pour autant altérer le son d'ambiance générale d'un stade .
On peut en faire l'expérience dans cet extrait .
Canal + a coupé les vuvuzelas dès la rencontre Afrique du Sud-Uruguay qui s'est jouée mercredi soir .
Soufflez , braves supporters à la maudite trompette , on ne vous entend plus !
" La société Audionamix a pris contact avec les trois diffuseurs mardi soir , raconte Cyril Linette , directeur des sports de Canal + .
Nous avons réagi le plus vite en signant un contrat d'exclusivité le soir même à minuit . "
Le montant serait de quelques centaines de milliers d'euros .
Tout ceci s'est passé par fax et par téléphone car le représentant commercial d'Audionamix était , ce soir - là , en déplacement à Los Angeles .
La société française travaille , en effet , souvent avec les Studios d'Hollywood .
TF1 travaille sur les micros de type Formule 1
L'exclusivité signée par Canal + a -t - elle pris de court TF1 et France Télévisions ?
TF1 nie s'y intéresser .
" Le procédé de Canal + gomme à la fois les vuvuzelas et l'ambiance générale du stade , estime la première chaîne .
Notre souci est double : nous nous devons de respecter l'ambiance des stades du pays organisateur .
Or , la vuvuzela en fait partie .
Mais nous devons au public de TF1 une qualité d'écoute des commentaires . "
La
Une affirme avoir choisi de doter Christian Jean - Pierre et consorts de micros directionnels , de type Formule 1 .
TF1 promet des progrès supplémentaires dans l'atténuation des nuisances sonores dès le match de ce soir qui oppose la France au Mexique ( à suivre en direct sur Le Point. fr ) .
" TF1 ne manque pas de souffle , si je puis dire ! , s'exclame Cyril Linette .
Au contraire , le procédé Audionamix permet de retrouver des sons qui avaient complètement disparu depuis le début du Mondial : le ballon qui frappe la barre , le coup de sifflet de l'arbitre , la clameur du public .
C'est à ce confort d'écoute qu'aspirent nos abonnés . "
Canal + revendique un vuvuzela effect sur ses audiences d'hier en hausse de 3 % sur la population abonnée .
De quoi souffler dans les trompettes de la victoire ...
“ I was a little tense when I woke up so I went and worked out for a little bit , ” said McNally from his home in Glen Head , New York , having just finished another work out session .
“ Then I came back , and my family had a barbeque at my house . ”
With his mother , father , sister , and grandfather by his side , McNally eventually turned on the television and waited patiently to see his name pop up on the screen .
But it never did .
“ I was watching on TV , but I actually did n’t see it come up , ” said McNally , who models his game after New York Islanders defenceman Mark Streit .
“ But my adviser was there and he called to congratulate me and I was ecstatic . ”
“ It feels good ; it ’s an honour , ” he added .
“ Both me and my family were really happy . ”
The Vancouver Canucks used their fourth - round pick ( 115th overall ) to select the offensive defenceman who led Massachusetts prep school Milton Academy in scoring last season with 35 points in 28 games .
And though this week is his first time in Vancouver , McNally could n’t be happier .
“ I know they have a great fan base in Western Canada and I know that people out there love hockey .
I ’m just really excited . ”
After meeting with Canucks scout Brian Chapman this past season at Milton Academy , and after speaking with the team ’s management at the recent NHL draft combine in Toronto , McNally knew the Canucks were interested but he still “ had no idea ” where he would end up .
And can you blame him ?
The U.S. prep school defenceman of the year interviewed with 18 NHL teams at the combine , in addition to meeting with six teams at school and receiving a few phone calls to boot .
Clearly , McNally ’s abilities had intrigued a number of different NHL teams , but the general consensus is that the lesser competition he faces at prep school along with his decision to attend Harvard University played a role in his free fall at this year ’s entry draft .
When asked how long he intends to remain at Harvard before making the jump to the professional ranks , McNally said that was n’t the first time he ’s heard the question .
“ I talked about that with a lot of teams , ” said McNally , who has been told by more than one scout that his style of play is similar to that Washington Capitals defenceman Mike Green .
“ I think I ’d be willing after two years , if the team thought I was ready and if I thought I was ready , to maybe make the jump .
But at this time , I ca n’t really say . ”
“ It ’s really up to the Canucks organization , ” he added .
“ But I ’m hoping that I ’ll be ready as soon as I possibly can be . ”
McNally intends on spending one more season at Milton Academy before joining the Harvard University Crimson in the fall of 2011 .
And although he was drafted by the USHL ’s Indiana Ice , he does n’t see them in his future .
He does , however , hope to one day see the Canucks in his future , even though becoming a professional hockey player never used to be something he strived for .
“ I ’ve always worked hard in hockey , but I ’ve always worked not necessarily to become a pro , but just to get better and maybe play in college , ” said McNally , whose philosophy was similar to that of recently acquired defenceman Keith Ballard .
“ But now that this is a reality and it ’s a possibility that I could turn pro , that ’s just going to motivate me even more and I ’m going to work even harder . ”
Following this week ’s prospects development camp in Vancouver , McNally will return to Long Island , where he will be skating four times a week with Lithuanian skills coach Aleksey Nikiforov – who has worked with Leafs defenceman Mike Komisarek , Ottawa Senators forward Alexei Kovalev , New York Rangers defenceman Matt Gilroy , and others – while continuing to hit the gym .
McNally does n’t have to wait for his name to be called by an NHL team anymore , but he still knows there ’s a long road ahead , thanks to advice from his dad – a football player turned FBI agent .
“ He always used to tell me since I was little that sports are n’t a sprint , they ’re a marathon , ” said McNally .
“ You ’d see all these kids who were so much better than me , so he ’d tell me sports are n’t a sprint , they ’re a marathon so keep working hard and eventually you ’ll get to where you want to be . ”
That ’s what McNally ’s done , and that ’s what he ’s going to continue to do .
June 30 , 2010  --
A former Air Force officer will be one of 10 plaintiffs included in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union today against the U.S. government challenging the country 's no -fly list .
Steve Washburn , 55 , an American citizen , learned he was placed on the no-fly list when he and his wife attempted to fly home to New Mexico from Dublin , Ireland .
CLICK HERE to follow the ABC News Investigative Team 's coverage on Twitter .
" When we went to board the plane they told me ' I 'm sorry , we can't let you get on the plane .
You 're on the U.S. no - fly terrorist watch list , ' " said Washburn .
Now Washburn – who made it home after a carefully scripted 72 hour journey through Germany , Brazil , Peru and Mexico to avoid U.S. airspace - and others are a part of the ACLU lawsuit that charges the government of violating their constitutional rights .
The suit names Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. , FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III and Timothy J. Healy , the director of the Terrorist Screening Center as defendants .
It contends " The Constitution does not permit such a fundamental deprivation of rights to be carried out under a veil of secrecy and in the absence of even rudimentary process . "
It goes on to say " … no government official or agency has offered any explanation for Plaintiff 's apparent placement on the No Fly List or any other watch list .
Nor has any government official or agency offered any of the Plaintiffs any meaningful opportunity to contest his or her placement on such a list . "
" This is profoundly un-American , " said Ben Wizner , a staff attorney at the ACLU 's National Security Project .
" People who are protected by the Constitution have a right to fundamental due process .
If the United States government is going to maintain a watch list and prevent people from flying , there has to be some way for people to confront the evidence against them and rebut it . "
Individuals on the no-fly list are prevented from boarding flights that enter or depart the U.S. or that fly over U.S. airspace .
No Fly List
A spokesman for the Terrorist Screening Center declined to comment on any of the cases presented in the lawsuit .
In an email statement he said , " … the FBI is carefully to protect the civil rights and privacy concerns of all Americans , " and directed ABC News to public testimony given by Director Healy at a recent congressional hearing .
In a March 10 Congressional hearing , Healy said , " …. these people are identified by fragments of information .
They 're identified by a source saying , ' this guy 's involved in it .
So it 's not a black and white system . "
He went on to say " It 's a balancing act between civil liberties and the protection of the American people . "
Prior to the Christmas day bombing attempt of an American passenger plan , U.S. officials said there were approximately 4,000 individuals on the no-fly list .
That number is now believed to be nearly 8,000 .
Steve Washburn , 55 , a former Air Force officer , was stuck on Emerald Isle for three months , unable to return home until last month , because he appeared on the no fly list .
He worked as a security expert in Saudi Arabia but wanted to return home with his wife in February after a brief visit in Ireland with his stepdaughter and new grandchild .
Washburn said he was halted from boarding a direct flight from Dublin to the U.S. in February .
" When we went to board the plane they told me ' I 'm sorry , we can't let you get on the plane .
You 're on the U.S. no - fly terrorist watch list , ' " said Washburn .
" That was the moment I found out for the first time I was on the no fly list . "
He later contacted the FBI who told him they had no concerns about him and even suggested Washburn get around the no fly list by flying to Mexico then walking across the border , he said .
When contacted about Washburn 's ordeal , the FBI would not comment on his or any other person 's experience involving the no fly list .
Washburn says he took their advice and boarded a flight to Mexico .
However his wife – a Spanish citizen with a visa – was not permitted to fly with him although she was told she is not on a no fly list .
Three hours into his flight , the pilot was ordered to return to London Heathrow Airport where Washburn was detained , fingerprinted and tested for DNA by Scotland Yard officials .
Washburn said he learned the plane was forced to return because it would briefly enter U.S. airspace , triggering the no fly list restriction .
No Fly List
Washburn , a Muslim convert , said he has never committed a crime and served honorably in the Air Force and at NORAD .
He finally made it to the U.S. last month after a carefully scripted 72 hour journey through Germany , Brazil , Peru and Mexico to avoid U.S. airspace .
He was detained and questioned overnight in Mexico by officers .
Once in El Paso , Texas , Washburn said he was held at U.S. Customs for seven hours and was handcuffed to a chair while they asked him questions that previous FBI agents had asked and he had answered .
" You feel abused and you get angry because you 're thinking , ' This is injustice , ' " he said .
" No one will tell you why or how you got on the list .
Growing up in America we 're taught the great American system in that you 're innocent until proven guilty . "
Another recent addition to the no fly list is Adama Bah , a 22 - year - old caregiver who was accompanying the family she works for on a trip to Chicago earlier this year .
When she attempted to check in for her flight at LaGuardia Airport at the automatic ticket window , she received the message , " See an agent . "
The agent scanned her ticket and immediately called her supervisor .
" I did n't know what was going on , " said Bah who was has lived in the U.S. since she was two .
She was granted asylum in the U.S. in 2007 on grounds she would be persecuted if deported to her native Guinea .
" NYPD officers and the Port Authority police officers came over and told me I was on the no fly list . "
Bah says no one has yet to tell her why she is on the no-fly list .
" I honestly do n't know why .
Nobody tells you why , " said Bah .
" It is upsetting but it 's more of confusion .
I did n't do anything wrong and no one 's giving me an answer as to why I 'm on this list . "
Bah is also one of the plaintiffs in the ACLU case and hopes the lawsuit will bring attention to her plight .
Gilbert Chagoury
While not involved in the ACLU lawsuit , Gilbert Chagoury , a jet - setting billionaire businessman with close ties to President Bill Clinton , was also added to the no-fly list in the wake of the attempted Christmas day bombing .
Chagoury , 64 , a Nigerian citizens of Lebanese descent , was pulled off a private jet on January 15 at Teterboro airport in New Jersey and detained for more than four hours after agents discovered his name was on the then - recently updated no - fly list .
" I think a huge mistake is an understatement , " Chagoury told ABCNews.com and the Center for Public Integrity .
" I cannot accept being labeled a terrorist when I am known all over the world as a person who loves peace .
It really hurts , " he said .
Ben Wizner , the ACLU attorney representing the plaintiffs in their case against the government , agrees that we need to have the best security at airports and that people should be scrutinized carefully before they get on plans .
But he says , " This is really something out of Kafka where you show up at an airport , you 're told you can't fly , you not even told any reason for this ordeal , and you 're not given any way to get off the list . "
Individuals who find themselves on the list can submit a complaint to the Department of Homeland Security 's Travelers Redress Inquiry Program ( TRIP ) .
The complaint is reviewed by the agency and referred to the Terrorist Screening Center redress team .
Three of the plaintiffs in the ACLU legal action are veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces , one is a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Somalia and two – including Bah from Guinea – are permanent residents .
The complaint will be filed today in Oregon .

With mounting criticism from his own electorate over his party ’s indecisive intervention in the Emmanuel affair , Shas chairman Eli Yishai launched an offensive at Israel ’s secular society , which , he said , is plagued by ethnic discrimination far worse than that in the haredi sector , while reiterating that the true solution to discrimination involves creating alternative Sephardi frameworks .
“ The true facts should be stated , once and for all … only one Sephardi justice presides in the Supreme Court among 14 Ashkenazi justices … 12 prime ministers led Israel since the state ’s founding , not one of them Sephardi … of the 19 IDF chiefs of staff , only six were Sephardi , and the list goes on , ” Yishai said in an interview Thursday with , Shas ’s weekly newspaper , noting also the differences in income and education between the ethnic groups , with the Sephardim at a disadvantage .
Yishai also toned down the rhetoric against Yoav Laloum , who had filed the original petition against the segregated school and was recently doomed by Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef to losing his place in the afterlife as a result .
While Yishai reiterated that Halacha in generally forbids turning to secular courts , as he stressed in Sunday ’s faction meeting , he managed to credit Laloum with “ good intentions , ” even if the court petition proved counterproductive .
“ The true and correct solution to eradicating discrimination is to establish religious Sephardi educational institutions , ” and not to conduct court battles , Yishai stressed in the interview .
“ This is one of the reasons Shas was founded . ” Yishai tried to set the track straight on his movement ’s involvement in the Emmanuel case , tellingit was Shas that first acted to provide a solution to the Sephardi girls who “ separated out ” in the local Beit Ya’acov .
“ Two - and - a - half years ago [ Religious Services Minister ] Yaakov Margi toured Emmanuel , and was shocked at what he saw in the school .
Following that , we had an extensive meeting and decided to found a Sephardi school , so that those girls would n’t feel discriminated against , despite the deficits the school has , due to the small size of the public it serves .
Today , it is one of the best schools we have . ” Much criticism has been leveled at Yishai personally , since he , like other prominent Sephardi haredim , sends his children to Ashkenazi schools .
Yishai has explained that he did n’t want to fight his battles on his children ’s backs , and they would have had to take buses to more distant Sephardi institutions while they could walk to the nearby Ashkenazi school .
But now it seems as though his children should get used to the idea of changing schools next year .
“ I say this to myself and my friends – it is time for all the Sephardi men [ committed to Torah ] to enroll their daughters in Sephardi elementary and high schools , which is how we will ‘ return the crown to its former glory , ’ ” he said .
Yishai also noted in the interview that he approached Deputy Education Minister Meir Porush , and the two agreed on forming a joint rabbinical committee that will have the authority to decide on issues involving accepting Sephardi girls to Ashkenazi institutions .
Yishai ’s increasing response to the criticism that he and his partydid n’t do enough in the Emmanuel affair might be in part due to thefact that former Shas leader Aryeh Deri has become part of the publicdiscourse on the matter , though Yishai said he is not concerned by thepossibility of Deri starting another party as an alternative to Shas .
After a Channel 2 poll found that a party led by Deri would win sevenseats and bring Shas down from 11 to eight , a Gal Hadash poll broadcaston Channel 10 found that Shas voters want him back in politics .
According to the poll , 63 percent of Shas voters want a Deri comebackand 45 % said they would vote for a party led by him .
Among the generalpublic , only 31 % want Deri back in politics and only 15 % would vote fora party led by him .
Asked how Shas was handling the Emmanuel affair , 52.5 % of Shas voterssaid poorly and just 19 % said well .
Among the general public , 61 % saidthe party mishandled the crisis and just 13.5 % said the party handledit well .
War may be hell , but it can make for great television , as Ken Burns proves in his masterful 11 - hour PBS series chronicling the deadliest war in American military history .
The Civil War was a landmark TV event that held record numbers of viewers riveted to their screens and reinvented the documentary form .
Taking full advantage of the fact that the Civil War was the first war to be captured extensively on camera , Burns synthesizes evocative archival photographs ( among them , Matthew Brady 's emblematic images of Union soldiers ) with diverse and illuminating narrative voices .
Well - known actors read diary entries , letters from the front , official dispatches , and speeches from the era .
These voice - over readings convey the full range of human fears and hopes of those shaping and being shaped by the war , while an engaging group of historians ( most notably Shelby Foote ) provide historical perspective .
The result is a seamless collage that illuminates , with quiet nobility , this most painful chapter in our nation 's past .
It 's been said that history belongs to the victors ; like Homer before him , Burns demonstrates that a major chunk of it belongs to the best storytellers .
Here are the strings the world ’s top tennis players , ( and a few recently retired players ) , are using in their rackets , together with the rackets they ’re using thrill spin slot , and the tensions , ( in lbs ) , they most commonly string at .
These tensions are known as ‘ Reference Tensions ’ , and are the tensions the pros will hit with when they arrive at a tournament .
Having seen how the racket feels at the Reference Tension , they ’ll then , if necessary , take the tension up or down a couple of pounds at a time until the get the feel they ’re looking for .
Things such as court surface , temperature , altitude , as well as their next opponent , will all contribute to any change required , but everything will start from the Reference Tension .
Where two tensions are shown the first is the tension of the main strings , and the second is the tension of the cross strings .
Where hybrid stringing is shown , the first named string is used for the main strings , and the second named is used for the cross strings .
For example , Roger Federer uses Wilson Natural Gut for his main strings , and Luxilon Alu Power Rough for his cross strings , whereas Andy Murray uses Luxilon Alu Power for his main strings , and Babolat VS Touch for his cross strings , try it out for free .

June 8 primaries happened in many different states with many different candidates .
But all had the same message .
The battle lines are drawn .
It ’s Main Street versus Wall Street .
And it ’s about jobs .
Wait , a minute .
But , CNN and all report these primaries are about the anti-incumbent atmosphere , popularity of President Obama and strength of the tea party movement .
Plus , on June 8 , women ruled .
OK .
You decide .
Here are the results .
Voters in ten states , plus one run-off , went to the polls on June 8 : California , Nevada , Arkansas ( run-offs ) , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Iowa , Virginia , South Carolina , New Jersey and Maine .
All states had House of Representatives primaries , 7 states had governors ’ primaries and 6 , plus 1 run-off , had Senate races .
Big headlines went to California , the Arkansas Senate run-off , Nevada and South Carolina .
Conservative Democrat Sen. Blanche Lincoln narrowly beat upstart challenger Arkansas Lt. Gov. Bill Halter .
Labor and progressive groups like MoveOn backed Halter .
Lincoln refused to support worker rights bill , Employee Free Choice Act , which curbs the bosses ’ power to interfere in a worker ’s right to collective bargaining .
She also infuriated progressives by refusing to support the “ public option ” during the health care reform fight .
Lincoln won by 10,000 votes , 52 percent to 48 percent .
Politico ’s Ben Smith reports a “ senior White House official ” ( can you say , Rahm ? ) called and told him unions “ flushed down the toilet ” $ 10 million dollars by backing Halter .
The AFL - CIO and SEIU both issued statements on Arkansas results , which contradicted the official .
Richard Trumka , president of AFL - CIO , said , “ Taking a two - term incumbent in deep red Arkansas into a runoff is a virtually unprecedented achievement .
If working families were able to accomplish this in Arkansas , imagine what they can achieve in other states .
“ It is also now abundantly clear to all politicians that if they want to get the support of working families on Election Day , they are going to need to fight for their issues every day . ”
SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said in a statement , “ Tonight , Sen . Lincoln won a narrow victory after a bruising runoff election where each and every day she was reminded that her success is only measured by doing right by working people and their families .
The tens of thousands of volunteers and activists have made their point loud and clear :
If you stop fighting for working families , working families will stop fighting for you . ”
Arkansas is a “ right to work ” state , meaning its laws severely hamper a worker ’s right to join a union .
Yet the campaign brought it to a runoff and forced Lincoln to shift on some issues , for example , finance reform .
What will happen in the general Senate election there is still in flux .
In California , two women , both Republicans and corporate CEOs , Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina , will battle Jerry Brown for governor and incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer for the U.S. Senate , respectively .
California labor leader Art Pulaski said , primary results “ set in motion a battle for the soul of California .
It ’s Main Street vs. Wall Street . ”
He vowed labor would counter “ massive spending with an unprecedented grassroots campaign ” on critical issues like jobs , health care and retirement security .
Tea party and Club For Growth candidate Sharron Angle beat her opponents for Nevada ’s Republican Senate nomination .
She will face Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in November .
Angle is reportedly Reid ’s opponent of choice because of her extremist views .
Political analyst Nate Silver says
Angle ’s victory puts Reid in a much better place to win in November .
If Reid “ slips through , ” Silver says , “ or if Rand Paul [ GOP Kentucky Senate candidate ] gums up the race so much he loses what otherwise should have been a surefire Republican hold in Kentucky there is a going to be a major reassessment of the value of the tea party to the Republican Party . ”
Voter turnout on June 8 overall was reported as low - to - moderate .
Unions , community and other groups are planning a major push to increase voter turnout for the November mid-term election .
The recently announced iPhone 4 includes a feature called FaceTime ; it ’s wifi videophone functionality .
In Infinite Jest , David Foster Wallace wrote that within the reality of the book , videophones enjoyed enormous initial popularity but then after a few months , most people gave it up .
Why the switch back to voice ?
The answer , in a kind of trivalent nutshell , is : ( 1 ) emotional stress , ( 2 ) physical vanity , and ( 3 ) a certain queer kind of self - obliterating logic in the microeconomics of consumer high - tech .
First , the stress :
Good old traditional audio - only phone conversations allowed you to presume that the person on the other end was paying complete attention to you while also permitting you not to have to pay anything even close to complete attention to her .
A traditional aural - only conversation [… ] let you enter a kind of highway - hypnotic semi-attentive fugue : while conversing , you could look around the room , doodle , fine - groom , peel tiny bits of dead skin away from your cuticles , compose phone - pad haiku , stir things on the stove ; you could even carry on a whole separate additional sign - language - and - exaggerated - facial - expression type of conversation with people right there in the room with you , all while seeming to be right there attending closely to the voice on the phone .
And yet — and this was the retrospectively marvelous part — even as you were dividing your attention between the phone call and all sorts of other idle little fuguelike activities , you were somehow never haunted by the suspicion that the person on the other end ’s attention might be similarly divided . [ … ]
Video telephony rendered the fantasy insupportable .
Callers now found they had to compose the same sort of earnest , slightly overintense listener ’s expression they had to compose for in - person exchanges .
Those caller who out of unconscious habit succumbed to fuguelike doodling or pants - crease - adjustment now came off looking extra rude , absentminded , or childishly self - absorbed .
Callers who even more unconsciously blemish - scanned or nostril explored looked up to find horrified expressions on the video - faces at the other end .
All of which resulted in videophonic stress .
And then vanity :
And the videophonic stress was even worse if you were at all vain .
I.e. if you worried at all about how you looked .
As in to other people .
Which all kidding aside who does n’t .
Good old aural telephone calls could be fielded without makeup , toupee , surgical prostheses , etc .
Even without clothes , if that sort of thing rattled your saber .
But for the image - conscious , there was of course no answer - as - you - are informality about visual - video telephone calls , which consumers began to see were less like having the good old phone ring than having the doorbell ring and having to throw on clothes and attach prostheses and do hair - checks in the foyer mirror before answering the door .
Those are only excerpts … you can read more on pp. 144-151 of Infinite Jest .
Eventually , in the world of the book , people began wearing “ form - fitting polybutylene masks ” when talking on the videophone before even that became too much .
Tugboat bowlines , fisherman 's knots , sheet bends .
The best knots are named for their jobs on the ocean , but they have numerous , practical uses on land as well .
Here 's how to tie the versatile bowline ( and more properly tie any knot ) .

There are dozens of knots with hundreds of uses .
Tied properly and with suitable material , they are extremely reliable — the very reason that sailors have been relying on tried and true methods of knot tying for centuries .
Sailors , rock climbers , boy scouts — anyone schooled in the practical art of knot tying — will tell you that tying a knot is one thing , but tying it properly is another .
You can improve your knots by dressing them properly and , of course , with practice .

When a knot is properly dressed , it means that each part of the knot is in the right place with the correct tension .
The rope does n't cross itself unnecessarily , and nothing is more slack or taut than it should be .
Knots that are improperly dressed can lead to excessive stress and rubbing on the knots , which will gradually weaken the rope and , eventually , cause the knot to fail .

The above is a properly dressed knot .
Note the adjacent rope in each part of the knot ; there are no unnecessary crossovers or tangles .
What this really boils down to is practice and patience - take care to keep your knots neat as you 're tying them , fixing as you go as well as when you set , or tighten , your knot .
The bowline ( pronounced " boh - lin " , and pictured at top ) is a knot that 's used to form a fixed loop on the end of a rope .
In sailing , it 's commonly used to attach a line to the head of a sail , or has other objects passed through it .
Even if you do n't know more knots than how to tie your shoelace , learntosail of Hubpages.com has a quick lesson on how to tie this useful knot .
According to learntosail :
There are over 200 different types of bowline knots out there .
But few are more secure or faster to tie than the one used in this sailing story .
You can tie the quick - tie bowline blindfolded , in the dark , behind your back , or underwater .
It will hold your boat in a storm and you can tie it around yourself as a safety line .

The bowline has many uses , and with practice , you can tie one in under ten seconds .
Master this knot and you 're sure to find uses for it in your everyday hacks .

" Now the trumpet summons us again , not as a call to bear arms , though arms we need ; not as a call to battle , though embattled we are – but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle . "
– John F. Kennedy
In 1945 , unlikely allies toppled Hitler 's war machine , while humanity 's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire .
Where once there stood many great powers , there now stood only two – the United States and the Soviet Union .
The world had scant months to collectively sigh in relief before a new conflict threatened .
Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades , this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks , but by spies and politicians , scientists and intellectuals , artists and traitors .
Twilight Struggle is a two - player game simulating the 45 year dance of intrigue , prestige , and occasional flares of warfare between the USSR and the USA .
The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight .
The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new superpowers scramble over the wreckage of WWII and ends in 1989 , when only the United States remained standing .
Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card - driven classics We the People and Hannibal .
It is a quick - playing , low - complexity game in that same tradition .
The game map is a world map of the period , whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower .
Twilight Struggle 's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game .
They cover a vast array of historical happenings : the Arab - Israeli conflicts , Vietnam , the peace movement , the Cuban Missile Crisis , and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation .
Subsystems capture the prestige - laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions , with the possibility of game - ending nuclear war .

JOHANNESBURG —
In an irritated battle of wills , South African officials slammed the door Monday on any possibility of banning vuvuzelas at the World Cup .
Hundreds of millions of soccer viewers got their collective foot caught .
Nobody could hear them scream .
Vuvuzelas are here to stay and will never be banned , tournament communications chief Rich Mkhondo told reporters .
Look at them as part of our culture .
As our guests , please embrace our culture , please embrace the way we celebrate .
The implied rebuke of tournament boss and national hero Danny Jordaan , who seemed to suggest Sunday that the horn might soon drone its last , shows just how deeply all this complaining has offended South Africans .
That ’s fine .
But might we gently suggest that our cultural sensitivity stops somewhere around 80 decibels .
And if so , let ’s leave South African vuvuzelas , Danish death metal and NASCAR sitting in customs .
Forever .
Over here , where they ’re celebrated , locals are protesting that there is an art to playing the vuvuzela .
Getting a trumpet sound out of one — instead of a wet splutter — takes a bit of practice .
Once you ’ve managed that much , you might eventually learn to create a honk that could be described as musical .
Barely .
At a South African professional soccer match , the vuvuzelas form an organized chorus .
Fans combine playing with dancing and chanting .
The vuvuzela drone rises and falls depending on the action .
Here at the World Cup , we ’ve already seen astounding choreographed cheers in the stands , the vuvuzelas being tossed about in concert like conductor ’s batons .
What we have n’t done is heard any of them , because the amateurs in the crowd are blowing their brains out non-stop .
Those guests Mkhondo is talking about ?
They ’re the ones driving you crazy .
Estimates are that 650,000 vuvuzelas — which sell here for as little as 20 rand ( $ 2.70 ) — were bought up before the tournament .
Starting Friday , they were suddenly available at every stoplight .
Street hawkers catering to passing tourists are jacking the prices up nearly tenfold .
Judging by the fans entering the parks — most of whom appear to be learning ( badly ) as they go — business is good .
Okay , so if the vuvuzela is here to stay , why ca n’t they just block them out on the televised feed ?
Not so easy , say the experts .
Apparently , the low drone of a vuvuzela operates on a similar frequency to the human voice .
Eliminating the horns also dampens the sound of the TV announcer ’s patter .
Many of you have already resorted to that zero sum solution by muting games .
Sound engineers working here have talked about another sort of “ art ” — that of getting an audible feed set up at all .
They ’re quite pleased with themselves .
You ’re not .
You ca n’t figure out how to work the remote , so they ’d like to collectively invite you to come on over and try to do better .
I ’m not trying to scare you , but it gets worse .
In an effort to speed his journey to some special place in aural Hell , Mkhondo warned that the vuvuzela is coming to your town .
“ The vuvuzela is now an international instrument , ” Mkhondo said .
“ People will buy them and stuff them in their suitcases and take them home . ”

Two primate species were among the seizures of bushmeat by customs
About 270 tonnes of illegal bushmeat could be passing through one of Europe 's busiest airports each year , the first study of its kind estimates .
A team of researchers says the illicit trade could pose a risk to human or animal health and increase the demand for meat from threatened species .
The figure is based on seizures from searches carried out over 17 days at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris .
The findings appear in the journal Conservation Letters .
A team of researchers from France , Cambodia and the UK said it was the " first systematic study of the scale and nature of this international trade " .
" We estimate that about five tonnes of bushmeat per week is smuggled in personal baggage through Paris Roissy - Charles de Gaulle airport , " they wrote .
During the 17 - day study , a total of 134 passengers arriving on 29 flights from 14 African nations were searched .
Nine people were found to be carrying bushmeat , which had a combined mass of 188kg .
In total , 11 species were found - including two types of primates , two kinds of crocodiles and three rodent species - four of which were listed as protected species .
' Lucrative trade '
Co-author Marcus Rowcliffe from the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) explained why the international team of researchers decided to carry out the research .
Only a small proportion of Africa 's bushmeat is exported Calls for bushmeat ban rejected
" As no study like this had been carried out before , we really had no idea as to the volume of bushmeat coming into airports , " he told BBC News .
" It was a surprise when we saw how much was arriving . "
The products were not only imported for personal consumption , but were part of a lucrative organised trade with high prices indicating luxury status , Dr Rowcliffe added .
" A 4kg monkey will cost around 100 euros ( £ 84 ) , compared with just five euros in Cameroon , " he said .
Based on the data gathered from the 29 flights covered by the study , the researchers then calculated the weekly and annual inward flow of bushmeat .
" Assuming that ( the study 's ) rates are representative of the average weekly rate over the year , this equates to ... 273 tonnes of bushmeat , " they calculated .
The team suggested that there were likely to be a number of factors behind the large volume of bushmeat being imported .
" First , detecting and seizing these products is not a priority , " they explained .
" Second , penalties for importing illegal meat or fish are low and rarely imposed .
Third , the rewards for transporting bushmeat are potentially high . "
The researchers acknowledged that the study had a short time scale and limited geographical coverage , and said that a longer and large scale survey was now required to build on the findings .
However , they added that their study did allow them to consider ways to control the trade .
They suggest offering incentives to customs officers , increasing the penalties for illegally importing the products and raising awareness among passengers that bringing such products into the EU was prohibited .
The team concluded : " The large scale of current imports makes it important to consider all options for reducing the flow of illegal meat and fish , and of bushmeat in particular . "
Carnival Cruise Lines aimed to increase bookings when it tapped Google Mobile Ads to deliver platform - specific ads such as click to call to mobile users searching for travel information .
As a result of the campaign , the ratio of sales calls to service calls into the inbound call center are claimed to have increased by 20 percent .
Additionally , Carnival was able to boost booking on mobile devices 175 percent over a three - month period , it was claimed .
? With more and more people searching the Internet from their phones , mobile advertising has become a great new way to reach users of high - end mobile devices , ? said Samantha Hartsfield , search account manager at Razorfish , Chicago .
?
We have already worked with several clients to successfully use Google Mobile Ads to drive more leads and conversions .
? Carnival was curious as to whether such a considered and complex purchase like booking a cruise would be executed on a mobile phone , ? she said .
?
It ?s logical that consumers would investigate and purchase things like retail items on a mobile device , but what about booking travel and cruises ?
? Together with Carnival Cruise Lines , we set out to answer that question .?
Razorfish is Carnival Cruise Lines ? ad agency .
Searching for conversions
To see if mobile advertising would drive traffic and conversions cost - effectively , Razorfish conducted several search - based advertising campaign experiments using Google Mobile Ads for Carnival .
Razorfish duplicated Carnival ?s online ad campaigns in the cruise line 's AdWords account but switched the campaign settings to target high - end mobile devices .
To measure performance and determine how users interact with high - end mobile phones to investigate vacation and travel , Razorfish tracked several conversion metrics .
The team set up online mobile tracking that let them to see precisely when users dropped off before the cruise booking process was complete .
Additionally , they were also able to tie some conversions occurring over the phone or on the Carnival Web site to their mobile search campaign if the conversion originated from a mobile ad .
This conversion attribution was only valid if consumers opened the confirmation email from Carnival on the same mobile devices as the original search query .
? We saw significant drop - offs when users were asked to type in information , ?
Ms. Hartsfield said .
?
But what was really encouraging is that they were calling Carnival or going to the Web site afterward to complete the booking process .?
Next , Razorfish and Carnival Cruise Lines decided to test ways to optimize the mobile campaigns .
They launched device targeting with even more detailed ad copy using keyword phrases such as ? book your next vacation on your iPhone today .?
Additionally , Carnival and its agency added click - to - call numbers in the mobile search ads .
? Carnival saw click to call as a great value , because the cost of a call is the same as the cost of a click , ?
Ms. Hartsfield said .
?
It was a low - risk , high - value proposition .?
Right call
The ratio of sales calls to service calls into Carnival ? s inbound call center as a result of its click - to - call mobile search campaign was 20 percent higher .
Overall bookings increased as well .
While there is typically a small seasonal spike in bookings in January and February , Carnival claimed to see a 175 percent increase in bookings on high - end mobile devices from January to March .
Despite the fact that the number of bookings occurring on the Web site is substantially higher , conversion rates from click - to - call leads are comparable .
Carnival or Razorfish would not disclose hard numbers beyond percentages .
? Driving call center volumes really was n?t the top priority ?
improving online bookings was , but offering the call - to - click option actually drove more interested leads overall to convert , ?
Ms. Hartsfield said .
? Carnival is now working on building a more engaging experience that keeps users in the funnel so they don?t drop off due to limitations of the mobile platform such as typing in a lot of information .
? With Google Mobile Ads and click to call , Carnival Cruise Lines is ahead of the curve in understanding how consumers use mobile devices in the context of travel ?
and it 's driving tangible returns , ? she said .
Everything is set for Chris Bosh to join LeBron James in Cleveland .
Everything , that is , except Bosh 's approval .
The Toronto Raptors have told the Cleveland Cavaliers they will do a sign - and - trade with them for Bosh , according to several league sources .
The exact details of the potential trade have not been solidified , but Toronto likely would get Anderson Varejao and / or J.J. Hickson , Delonte West and perhaps Anthony Parker .
A draft pick could be involved as well .
PEBBLE BEACH , CA — In an effort to show appreciation for his Father ’s Day gift , Phil Mickelson , participating in the final round of the U.S. Open Sunday , reluctantly used a pitching wedge his three children created from a cardboard tube , construction paper , a shoe box , and masking tape .
“ Oh , boy .
I ’m never going to get all the glitter out of my golf bag , ” Mickelson was overheard saying as he stared down a 135 - yard shot to the No. 1 green , his children eagerly looking on .
“ This is going to be a long day . ”
Mickelson then examined the pitching wedge ’s yarn grip and the grooves drawn on the clubface in magic marker , sighed , set up to the ball , and proceeded to make a 47 on the hole .

While the Arches National Park is located in the southeastern part of Utah the Bryce Canyon National Park can be found in the southwestern part of Utah .
Whereas the first is world famous for its arches the major drawcard of the Bryce Canyon National Park is its natural amphitheatre with pointy rockformations , also known as hoodoos , which are formed due to erosion of the rocks found alongside the plateau .

Image caption Mr Kim told buyers he had captured the healing powers of Lourdes
A South Korean professor who claimed he could make tap water into holy water will face fraud charges , police say .
The man , named as Prof Kim , claimed he could digitally capture the elements of holy water from Lourdes , France , that believers say has healing powers .
He had sold devices to more than 5,000 people , making almost 1.7bn won ( $ 1.3 m , £ 870,000 ) .
Eight people , including Prof Kim 's wife and brother - in - law , will also be charged .
The famous shrine to the Virgin Mary at Lourdes offers water which some believe has healing powers .
Mr Kim had claimed his ceramic and paper filters , and plastic cards used in water purifiers , had captured those powers for onward transmission .
He and his associates allegedly told customers that different devices cured different illnesses , including diabetes and tumours .
" Professor Kim says if the medical properties are changed into digital signals , and radiated onto any water , the water will adapt those properties , " the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper quoted police as saying .
But police said experts had confirmed that this was " completely impossible , based on no scientific evidence " .
The police also said that the people who had bought the devices had complained when they did not work .

When Gustavo Villafane was 9 , he was hit by a train .
He lost both his legs and one of his arms .
Now Villafane is one of the best wheelchair basketball players in the world .
He and his Argentine teammates are preparing for the Paralympic Games , to be held in November in Venezuela .
The adapted sport was born in 1940 in England .
South America joined the movement in the 1950s after a polio epidemic swept through the region leaving many disabled .
The sport is now played in more than 75 countries .
It aims to be as democratic as possible .
The scoring system ensures that athletes with severe disabilities , including paraplegics , can participate on equal terms .
Each player gets a score , ranging from one for the most affected players , up to 4.5 for those with a lesser disability .
Each team must have 14.5 points on the court .
They use the same ball as in Olympic basketball and the hoop is at the same height .

It is n’t long before one gets the sense that there ’s something off about Agora ; something not quite right .
Chances are it ’s when Rachel Weisz , as the beguiling fourth - to - fifth - century Neoplatonist philosopher Hypatia , drops a cloth stained with her menstrual blood at the foot of a student who seeks to woo her ( a style of abstinence - only education today ’s advocates might do well to copy ) .
Despite every indication that what you ’re watching is a standard Hollywood period epic , you begin to doubt that it will ever get to the obligatory love scene .
If you happened to read Hypatia ’s Wikipedia page on the way to the theater , you might even begin to fear for not seeing her undressed until the end , when she is stripped and torn to pieces by a bestial Christian mob .
Alejandro Amenábar ’s $ 73 million , English - language movie ( which just began a limited US release in New York and , on June 4 , Los Angeles ) is bursting at its formulaic seams .
In two overwrought hours it crams in sex appeal , city - sized sets , gory battle scenes , political intrigue , religious zealotry , and enough of Neoplatonism ’s greatest hits to give us a sense for what Hypatia is supposed to be standing for .
This last part , while being the toughest to reconcile — not least because of Hypatia ’s inconvenient celibacy — is also Agora ’s best hope .
It comes as a welcome contrast , for instance , to HBO ’s Rome , which turns figures like Cicero and Cato into wimps compared to a muscular Mark Antony , with no mention of the intellectual feats by which we now know them best .
Ancient world or this one , big ideas do n’t easily compete on screen with messy power struggles and lustrous bodies .
But it ’s worth a try .
“ I believe in philosophy , ” Hypatia declares , against all odds .
“ Philosophy , ” growls a sensible politician .
“ Just what we need in times like these . ”
Amenábar stands with the heroine ; he did n’t just make this movie for his health .
Since Voltaire and Edward Gibbon , the story of Hypatia has been a favorite nugget of the Enlightenment narrative : her death at the hands of crazed monks marks the end of Greek high culture and the start of a steady descent into the Dark Ages .
The story is supposed to stand as a beacon , like the lighthouse that towered over Hypatia ’s Alexandria , of the danger that religious passions pose to all that is wise and tolerant about the human spirit .
Just in time for my own childhood indoctrination ( one which I am loathe to disavow ) , Carl Sagan repeated this telling in his Cosmos TV series .
Sagan followed Gibbon in associating Hypatia ’s murder with the destruction of Alexandria ’s famous library ; with her body , away went the literature of the ancient world , lost forever .
To remember Hypatia is now to take a stand for liberation against dogma .
( No less than two journals of feminist thought bear her name . )
It is this mantle that Agora seems to inherit and this message , for our own age of zealotry and intolerance , that it appears meant to convey .
Ideas are propped up to fight like gladiators , with Faith in one corner and Reason in the other .
“ I wonder if it ever occurred to Amenábar that his movie might incite violence against religious people … ”
Hearing about Agora ’s success in Spain last year ( it was the highest - grossing film of the year , sweeping up awards ) could n’t help but bring to mind the empty insides of so many of that country ’s churches , still charred after the various anti-clerical mobs of the last few centuries .
I was n’t the only one to make that association .
With predictable ressentiment , an open letter came to Amenábar from the Religious Anti-Defamation Observatory , a Catholic watchdog group in Spain , warning him : “ Your film is going to awaken hatred against Christians in today ’s society . ”
American “ Catholic evangelist ” Father Robert Barron adds in his Catholic New World review , “ I wonder if it ever occurred to Amenábar that his movie might incite violence against religious people , especially Christians . ”
One can only hope that it ’s not a good enough movie to drive people to the streets .
In an interview with the New York Times , though , Amenábar turned the tables on his pious critics .
“ Fundamentally , this is a very Christian film about the life of a martyr , ” he explained .
“ Jesus would not have approved of what happened to Hypatia , which is why I say no good Christian should feel offended by this film . ”
In this respect , at least , his sentiments have historical basis .
Our best period account of the life and death of Hypatia comes from Socrates Scholasticus , a Christian historian in Constantinople who had among his sources a pair of refugee pagan priests from Alexandria .
His decree on the whole matter is , exactly , Amenábar ’s : “ Surely nothing can be farther from the spirit of Christianity than the allowance of massacres , fights , and transactions of that sort . ”
Nor were his sentiments any fluke ; Hypatia was widely admired by Christians in antiquity and afterward for her learning , chastity , and martyrdom — beginning with her onetime student Synisius of Cyrene , portrayed in the movie as a surfer dude trapped in bishop ’s clothes .
The Suda , a tenth - century Byzantine ( Christian ) encyclopedia wistfully remembers her beauty and eloquence , reserving no sympathy for the fellow - Christians who did her in .
From that point the Gibbon - Sagan narrative only continues to unravel .
First , it is n’t at all clear that the great library was destroyed by Christians in Hypatia ’s time , as the movie suggests .
Caesar set it on fire half a century before the birth of Christ .
And the last straw may have been a Muslim conquest of Alexandria in 642 .
What is given in Agora as the orgiastic immolation of the library ’s volumes corresponds with the Christians ’ destruction , in 391 , of a magnificent temple dedicated to Serapis , essentially a political god intended to unite the Alexandrian ethnic maelstrom under imperial rule .
The Serapeum was not the library , though it seems to have housed at least an offshoot of the library ’s collection .
In any case , Agora reminds us that its destruction was provoked by a prior pagan attack on Christians ( provoked , in turn , by Christians , etc. , ad infinitum ) .
Early accounts differ about what actually led to Hypatia ’s death .
The Suda places the blame squarely on the Christian Patriarch Cyril ( that ’s St. Cyril to you ) , who grew jealous of the crowds her lectures gathered and sent goons to kill her .
Socrates Scholasticus ’ depiction is a bit more messy : a triangle of political intrigue between Cyril , Orestes the Roman prefect , and the lady philosopher .
This is the scenario Agora most closely follows .
And despite Amenábar ’s noble effort to squeeze in a scientific discovery before the end , her death just does n’t seem to have been about ideas , ultimately .
In Alexandria at the time , people were getting martyred left and right for not much good reason at all .
Socrates Scholasticus tells us , “ The Alexandrian public is more delighted with tumult than any other people : and if at any time it should find a pretext , breaks forth into the most intolerable excesses ; for it never ceases from its turbulence without bloodshed . ”
With Jews , Christians , pseudo - Christians , philosophers , and pagans all angling for power , Hypatia ’s may be more a story about universal stupidity than anything else .
As the Stars , the Streets
The best - developed character in Agora , held as a foil against the street riots , is the sky .
Amenábar used a starscape calibrated to look exactly as it would have in antiquity , accounting for axial precession .
Several times he juxtaposes the stars ’ stillness , and the Earth ’s roundness , with the chaos below .
Like a good Platonist , Hypatia was obsessed with the stars , which Plato and Aristotle held to be demigods , eternal as the universe and its Prime Mover .
Contemplating of their order and their perfection is where her philosophy lurked .
Unfortunately , other Platonic legacies mar her contemplation in Agora : an obsession with the circle , which blinds her to the elliptical motion of the planets , together with sitting atop a society predicated on slavery and gross inequity .
The Christians turn out to be even worse astronomers , but they do get some things right .
The Parabalani ( a band of the patriarch ’s bodyguards that Agora implicates in Hypatia ’s murder ) were actually a fellowship chosen from among the poor , principally to serve the poor .
They tended to the sick and buried the dead , risking infection in the process .
Between violent mob scenes , the movie does at least give a glimpse of what brought so many in the vast Alexandrian underclasses to wear the sign of the cross : bread , freedom , and the good news of the Beatitudes .
Hypatia ’s slave Davus is , to her , only a slave , albeit a clever one ; among Christians , he learns that feeding the hungry is better than fattening the full .
Hypatia ’s society collapsed around her , it must be admitted , because its time had come .
Alexandria had built its wonders on slavery ( Sagan called it , in the Cosmos segment on Hypatia , “ the cancer of the ancient world ” ) , and those who enjoyed them did n’t bother to do anything about the streets .
But Christians did — or at least , in their way , they tried to .
The lesson of Hypatia , inscribed as much in Agora as in the historical record , is not one of reason over faith or inquiry over intolerance .
It ’s that as we yearn for the peace of the stars , we have to take care of our city too ; we have to make this world just , and thereby safe , for philosophy .
Not just about bacon !
What ?
Are you still here ?
Five years ago , you could n’t walk into a movie theater without seeing Jackass ’s Johnny Knoxville —
The Ringer , Daltry Calhoun , The Dukes of Hazzard , and Lords of Dogtown all opened in the space of one year .
But since then , Knoxville has gone into Hollywood hibernation , shifting his focus from onscreen to offscreen , and this year he ’s produced three projects —
The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia , a fascinating longitudinal look at a hillbilly clan that premiered at last year ’s Tribeca Film Festival ; The Birth of Big Air , a documentary about BMX maestro Mat Hoffman that airs on ESPN in July ; and The Dudesons in America , a Finnish version of Jackass , which premiered on MTV last week ( a new episode premieres tonight ) .
Knoxville is coming out of hiding to injure himself and others as he films Jackass 3 , and he talked to us about the mental prep that goes into Jackass stunts , his hillbilly roots , and what kind of bodily fluids we should be prepared to see from him in the future .
How are you feeling today ?
Oh , my body ’s a wreck .
But we ’re getting great footage .
We ’ve been shooting since February : two weeks on , two weeks off .
Is that so your body can rest up ?
Yeah , it is .
We edit as we go , but you ca n’t do this like a regular movie , six to eight weeks , twelve weeks in a row .
You just can’t .
What ’s your mindset when you ’re prepping for Jackass stunts ?
A couple days before the stunts , if I ’m doing something particularly dangerous , I will go over every worst - case scenario in my head , like this could happen , this could happen , this could happen , this could happen .
I try to think about that to where it ’s ingrained in me .
But then when the stunt ’s on , you just commit and do it .
If you half - commit , first of all you ’re gonna have to do it again because you did n’t get the shot .
[ Also ] , if you half - commit , you usually definitely will get hurt .
So when you run over the worst - case scenarios , is that to make sure it ’s safe ?
Or is it more of a mental exercise ?
No , it ’s not safe ; it ’s not safe at all .
I just try to think of all the things that could go wrong so in that split second when it happens , maybe your body reacts in a way where it protects you just a little .
You ’re still gonna get a concussion , or something sprained or broken .
But those are all acceptable .
When you decided to do Jackass 3 in 3 - D , did you guys have a brainstorming session to come up with stunts that would look awesome in 3 -D ?
We try not to let it affect what we do .
That was a big reason I did n’t want to do 3 - D. I was kind of the last convert because I did n’t want it to affect the relationships between the guys or what we do as a group .
I would say about 90 to 95 percent of the ideas we do n’t write for 3 - D .
We just write and then after we get the idea we ’ll go , “ Oh , and if we do this , that ’ll probably look good in 3 - D , ” in addition to whatever we thought of .
Can you give any hints as to what kind of bodily fluids or props we can look forward to seeing ?
Oh , God .
Well , you can look forward to all the bodily fluids : poo-poo , pee-pee , throwup .
[ Laughs . ]
I thought [ Jackass Number Two ] was better than the first one , and this one is feeling even better than Number Two .
Everyone ’s energy is so high , and so we ’re really excited .
Our problem now is a lot of good stuff ’s not even gonna make the movie .
You ’re also producing The Dudesons in America , which features four Finnish friends who are equally dedicated to nearly killing themselves in the name of being stupid .
Do you feel like you ’re kind of passing the Jackass torch on to them , in a way ?
I do n’t think it ’s a passing of the torch .
We ’re doing Jackass right now , but it is like extending our family .
We definitely are glad to have the Dudesons in our family .
Do you think you could ever do a Jackass TV show again ?
Or are you getting too old to put your body through that on a regular basis ?
Mmm , no .
That ’s not the reason .
I ’m actually in better shape now than I was for [ Jackass ] one or two , at least before the film started .
It ’s just once you went from TV to film , there ’s no reason to take it back to TV .
It seems like a step back .
I was fascinated by The Wild and Wonderful Whites , your documentary about a family of wild , hard - drinking Appalachian outlaws , but some people have said the film is exploitative .
Do you understand that reaction ?
Yeah , we were aware of that .
It ’s a very fine line to walk between documenting exactly how these people live and telling their story accurately , and then you mix in , “ Well , it ’s a documentary and people are gonna see this and there are people that are gonna say it ’s exploitative . ”
But I think it ’s a side of life that a lot of Americans do n’t know , and we wanted to show how the Whites live and what they ’re up to .
I do n’t feel like we ’re exploiting them .
We ’re telling their story .
You grew up in Tennessee .
Were you exposed to hillbilly culture ?
Yes , ma’am !
Yup , I grew up in south Knoxville , right at the foot of the Smoky Mountains .
So yeah , I know that culture very well because I am that culture .
Not necessarily the White culture , but I know southern mountain people .
You were in a bunch of movies in the mid-aughts , then it seems like you kind of disappeared .
Where does acting rank on your priority list these days ?
I just started really getting back into acting again .
I did go away for a little bit .
I just turned down things and , I do n’t know , I guess I was going through a period in my life of a little bit of change .
But now I just did this part in this film the Farrelly brothers are producing that ’s a series of shorts .
Kind of like a Kentucky Fried Movie type of thing , and my thing was with Seann William Scott , and Brett Ratner directed .
Yeah , after Jackass I ’m gonna do some films .
Are you missing your garden gnomes ?
And we 're not talking the Reading Phillies dumping the Ryan Howard version ahead of the Aug. 3 giveaway .
Colonial Regional police have recovered " numerous " ceramic garden figurines , including a bunch of garden gnomes , near Alyssa Avenue in Hanover Township , Northampton County .
Police say they believe the figurines were taken from a particular housing development .
So , if your gnomes have wandered off in the vicinity of Hanover Township , call Colonial Regional at 610-861-4820 .
A few years back , I acquired an interesting - looking little cookbook called Desserts from an Herb Garden .
It tempted me with a wide range of really unusual - sounding combinations and categories ( it covers cookies and candies , cakes , pies , crisps , custards , puddings , frozen desserts , and plated desserts ) .
The librarian in me loves that it has two indexes – your usual index at the back that lists everything by name and ingredients , and a “ Recipes Listed by Herb ” index up front – fantastic when I ’ve got an abundance of one particular herb and want to find something to use it up .
I had n’t actually baked anything from it until this year – chalk it up to substandard herb gardens since we ’ve moved to the new house ( 3 years ago , sigh ) , or just forgetfulness … but I ’ve gotten it out twice in the last week , and the results have been fantastic !
The first thing I tried was the Lemon - Rosemary Cream Cake , which came out like a dream .
The cake uses cream for the fat and no butter at all , which gives it a really light airy texture – almost like an angel - food cake , but without the stickiness .
( One taster commented that it was the first homemade cake he ’d ever had that reminded him of the texture of store - bought cakes ( rather than being dense and very moist ) .
He loved it , so I can forgive him the comment and take it in the spirit it was intended . 🙂
Next week , the Apple - Basil Cake .
Mmmm .
Lemon-Rosemary Cream Cake
from Desserts from an Herb Garden , by Sharon Kebschull Barrett .
Cake Ingredients :
2 cups bleached all - purpose flour ( I used Lily ’s White )
3/4 teaspoon coarse salt ( I used Trader Joe ’s sea salt )
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon minced rosemary leaves
1 Tablespoon minced lemon verbena or lemon zest ( I used lemon balm , because I have lots of it and no verbena – next year ! )
1/2 cup nonfat or low - fat buttermilk ( I used Maple View Dairy ’s buttermilk , they ’re a local dairy that makes exceptional products )
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 eggs
1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
3/4 cup heavy cream ( Maple View , again )
Glaze Ingredients :
1 cup confectioner ’s sugar
1 tablespoon half - and half or milk
4 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
Preheat oven to 350F .
Grease and flour ( or pancoat ) a 10 - cup Bundt pan .
Whisk together flour , salt , baking powder , and rosemary and lemon verbena leaves ; set aside .
In a small bowl , whisk together buttermilk and vanilla ; set aside .
In a large bowl , beat eggs on medium speed with sugar until thick ; batter should fall in a ribbon when beaters are lifted .
With mixer on low speed or by hand , alternately mix in flour nad buttermilk mixtures , beginning and ending with flour .
Mix just until combined .
In another bowl with clean beaters , beat cream until stiff peaks form ; gently but thoroughly fold into batter .
Pour batter into prepared bundt pan and smooth the top .
Bake for 45 minutes , until the top just springs back when pressed .
Cool 10 minutes in the pan on a rack , then turn cake out onto rack to cool completely .
Transfer cake to a serving platter and glaze : Whisk together confectioners ’ sugar , half and half , and lemon juice and drizzle over cake .
Note : I totally skipped glazing , and while the cake would have been stupendous with the glaze , it was just fine without – lightly sweet and delicately perfumed with the taste of the herbs inside .
Yummy !
The proof of the pudding , they say , is in the eating .
Germany begin their World Cup 2010 campaign against Australia on Sunday with coach Joachim Loew remaining true to his pledge that youth will lead the way .
Loew experimented with his youth policy throughout qualification with a number of exciting youngsters blooded along the road to South Africa but the real test awaits them in Durban .
Germany will hope that Jogi has blended the right ingredients and that his mix of youth and experience does n't sink in the heat of competition like a failed soufflé .
With an average age of around 25 , Germany 's likely starting line - up in the Moses Mabidha Stadium will be Die Mannschaft 's youngest team in over 70 years .
But what it may be lacking in years , it certainly makes up for in excitement and quality .
Germany are expected to play in an offensively minded 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation , which could include Lukas Podolski and attacking midfielder Mesut Oezil , along with either Thomas Mueller or Toni Kroos playing behind a lone striker , either Miroslav Klose or Cacau .
Youth at the heart of Germany 's creativity
German young guns Kroos , Mueller and Badstuber
Much has been written about the wisdom of charging the likes of Oezil , Mueller and Kroos with the job of conducting Germany 's attacks , given the fact that these fresh - faced starlets are all short of their 23rd birthdays .
What is mostly forgotten in this analysis is that both Oezil and Mueller have spent the past season playing against some of the top teams in Europe while holding down first - team places in two of Germany 's best teams , Werder Bremen and Bayern Munich respectively .
Kroos , meanwhile , was an instrumental component in Bayer Leverkusen 's best season in many a year .
Germany should therefore have few concerns that these youngsters will be over - awed by the occasion .
And if there are a few jitters , Loew has maintained enough of the experienced guard in the side to calm the nerves and help repel what is expected to be a robust Socceroos team .
Experienced back - up
Loew 's plan to play new stars with experienced players aims to bring Germany new energy
New captain Philipp Lahm will command fellow stalwarts Per Mertesacker and Arne Friedrich in the back four , all of which will give one of the two talented youngsters Holger Badstuber or Jerome Boateng the confidence to take his place in Germany 's defensive quartet , safe in the knowledge that his fellow stoppers have been here before .
Ahead of them , the increasingly mature and influential Bastian Schweinsteiger will shepherd the midfield with newcomer Sami Khedira by his side .
Ahead of the creative trio of Podolski , Oezil and Mueller ( or Kroos ) - who is likely to get the nod ahead of Piotr Trochowski - Germany may have the old head of Miroslav Klose to aim for as the chosen lone striker .
While Klose has been off the boil for Bayern this season , he is still a proven World Cup striker who always seems to rise to such an occasion .
Germany will hope this is the case again this year as his deputies all come with question marks .
Mario Gomez and Stefan Kiessling have never proved convincing at this level , and while Cacau has looked good in recent friendlies he has had few appearances in competitive matches in a Germany shirt .
" We watched a video of Australia on Friday and they made a big impression , " said Oliver Bierhoff , the Germany team manager .
" They have not conceded a goal in 17 of their last 27 games , they are sturdy and they will be very focused , " he warned .
Socceroos play the waiting game
Australia were no push - overs in Germany in 2006
The Australian team will be full of experience with an average age over 30 and are expected to face this young , attacking Germany with defense in mind .
A strong defensive game and organization was the key to Australia 's strong showing in the 2006 World Cup which saw them through to the knockout stage where they were felled by a very debatable penalty decision in extra time against Italy - the side who went on to become champions .
The Socceroos will send out a team charged with soaking up German pressure , hoping to sap the strength of Germany 's youngsters while hoping that star midfielder Tim Cahill can unlock the defense on the counter - attack .
Australia 's Dutch coach Pim Verbeek was hoping that striker Harry Kewell would be fit enough to spearhead those attacks but the Galatasaray forward is unlikely to start after missing all the Socceroos ' warm - up games due to injury .
While Kewell could well be back to face Ghana in the next game , Joshua Kennedy will continue to fill in for the time being as Australia 's lone striker against the Germans .

Texas Congressman Ron
Paul thinks that the media and the public are being too hard on President Obama for his response to the Gulf Oil Spill :
Rep. Ron Paul , the libertarian Republican lawmaker from Texas , said that people were expecting too much from the president in his ability to react to the ongoing spill into the Gulf .
“ I ’m a pretty big critic of the president , ” Paul said during an appearance on “ Imus in the Morning ” on the Fox Business Network , “ but I just do n’t see the justification for coming down hard on the president . ”
“ I think it represents the idea that the American people think the president is everything to everybody that he should fix an oil leak , ” Paul added .
“ When your father stood up , told me I sucked and then exposed himself on Xbox Live I knew I was going to marry him someday . ”
I was pressing the random button in the comic navigation when I finally came across this comic .
And it got me thinking …
If I was a female , I think the number one thing to turn me off of gaming would be the creepy male gamers .
Now , I ’m not saying all male gamers are creepy .
Uh , case in point .
But we ’ve all been on Xbox Live and as such have seen some of the least common denominators that lurk on there .
You know what I mean ?
It ’s that stigma that causes a lot of females to avoid what we consider non-casual gaming altogether .
I personally do n’t think it ’s because these games supposedly are n’t geared towards them .
A good game is a good game and there ’s more than enough variety out there for everyone .
No , I think the perception of the people they think game plays a lot into their desire to pursue gaming further .
But then again , I could be completely off .
After all , I am one X gene short of really knowing what I ’m talking about .
Not likely but some very alarming news came out this week in an article published by Advertising Age .
The mammoth light beer brewers are seeing a downturn in sales at alarming rates and are scrambling to figure out how to right the ship .
The most shocking ( well not really but we ’ll get to that ) stats show the following …
Anheuser - Busch ’s Bud Light , the largest U.S. brand , is down 5.3 % year to date , and the drop is in comparison to 2009 , the first negative year in the brand ’s 28 - year history .
It ’s no less grim at No. 2 U.S. brewer MillerCoors , where the company ’s leading lights , Coors Light and Miller Lite , are down 0.5 % and 7.5 % , respectively .
The first thing pointed out is the current recession and its effect on the beer market as a whole .
The Beer Institute reports that beer shipments across the industry are down 4 % so the biggest players are going to take the majority of that burden due to their market share .
Reason number two is the “ death by a thousand cuts ” theory .
While most of the smaller brewers make less beer in a year than is spilled by the big boys , you put enough of them out there competing in the same segments and it is going to create problems .
For every style AB has on the market , you can easily find 50 others just like it that are perceived to have a higher level of quality and taste .
I ca n’t make it any simpler than this , the beer drinker in America is starting to gain more knowledge into what makes a good beer .
Vortex Bottles , Drinkability claims and Cold Activated Labels mean very little to the person on the hunt for a solid brew .
While billion dollar marketing campaigns may help brand awareness ( obviously ) , they do n’t make the beer taste better .
I do n’t want to drink a beer so cold that the label on the bottle needs a little scarf and jacket .
When a big brewery releases a “ craft ” beer ( see Bud Light Golden Wheat ) , it ’s in a tough spot because people realize that the 10 other wheat beers on the shelf were made by companies who take great care in the product they release because its their future on the line .
I ’m not saying that BLGW is bad , just that if this beer fails , AB is n’t going to face the financial pressures a small brewer would if one of two brews in their product line did n’t make it .
We ’ve all seen the guy driving a snazzy sports car around because he is , uhhhem , lacking somewhere else .
This feels the same to me , if you need to constantly distribute the message that your beer is great for a gimmicky marketing reason , I ’m not exactly going to run out and spend my hard earned money on it .
If you have to tell me your beer is drinkable or is cold when the label turns a certain color , not only am I a little insulted as a human being capable of basic understanding but you are selling me on the wrong aspects of your product .
Sell me on why I am going to enjoy your beer .
Sell me on why I should dedicate valuable fridge space to your beer .
Sell me on why this beer will be great for a get together with friends .
Do n’t sell me on the color of the label .
I ’m guessing that Anheuser - Busch and Miller Coors will continue to do what they are doing which is to further pump up the marketing budgets on their key lines instead of actually making them taste better .
They should take a page from Domino ’s and put quality ahead of marketing .
Wo n’t happen but a boy can dream right ?
I ’m curious to hear your thoughts on Bud Light , Miller Lite and Coors Light , comment below .
( In full disclosure , my beer fridge is always loaded with Miller Lite because I enjoy it for what it is , a light beer that fits into a price range that I am comfortable with and is a means to an end .
The fridge is also full of any number of craft beers that I really enjoy because simply put , they have what the big boys do n’t . )
In America , we define ourselves in the superlative : we are the biggest , strongest , fastest country in the world .

In un Paese che crede assolti i prescritti Andreotti e Berlusconi , si può dire di tutto .
Ma le corbellerie dette e scritte sulla sentenza Dell ’ Utri vincono il campionato mondiale della balla .
1 ) “ Mangano è il mio eroe : in carcere gli fu chiesto di parlare contro me e Berlusconi .
E se avesse inventato anche una minima cosa , una parolina contro me e Silvio , sarebbe uscito subito senza morire in cella di cancro .
Poteva vivere raccontando qualsiasi falsità e non l’ha fatto .
Poteva salvare la sua vita e tornare a casa ” ( Marcello Dell ’ Utri ) .
Questo signore che parla di mafia citando i Fratelli Karamazov non ha mai spiegato chi avrebbe offerto a Mangano la libertà in cambio di bugie .
Nessuna legge , nemmeno quella sui pentiti , garantisce libertà immediata a chi parla : chi l’avesse fatto avrebbe commesso un reato .
Perché Dell ’ Utri , se sa chi è , non lo denuncia ?
Mangano , dopo gli 11 anni ( 1980 - ’91 ) scontati per mafia ( processo Spatola ) e droga ( maxi- processo ) , fu riarrestato nel ‘ 99 per tre omicidi e condannato in primo grado a due ergastoli .
Poco dopo fu scarcerato per motivi di salute e il 23 luglio 2000 morì di cancro ai domiciliari ( non in cella ) .
Nessuno , viste le imputazioni , poteva garantirgli di “ uscire subito ” .
Né tantomeno di guarire dal cancro , che purtroppo colpisce sia in cella sia a piede libero .
2 ) “ Bastava confermare che , quando parlavamo al telefono di un cavallo , sotto c’era la droga .
Invece Mangano lo voleva vendere a Berlusconi , ma io gli dissi che a Silvio non interessava perché troppo focoso ” ( Dell ’ Utri ) .
È la telefonata Mangano - Dell ’ Utri intercettata dalla Criminalpol il 14 febbraio 1980 .
Mangano : “ Ci dobbiamo vedere ” .
Dell ’ Utri : “ Come no ?
Con tanto piacere ! ” .
M : “ Le devo parlare di una cosa… Anzitutto un affare ” .
D : “ Eh , questi sono bei discorsi ” .
M : “ Il secondo affare che ho trovato per il suo cavallo ” .
D : “ Davvero ?
Ma per questo dobbiamo trovare i piccioli ” .
M : “ Perché , non ce n’hai ? ” .D : “ Senza piccioli non si canta messa ” .
Ora , se Mangano voleva vendere il proprio cavallo a Berlusconi , perché non dice “ mio ” , ma ( rivolto a Dell ’ Utri ) “ suo ” ?
Perché Dell ’ Utri , se il cavallo non era per lui , si preoccupa di non avere “ piccioli ” ?
E perché , in tutta la conversazione , non dice mai quel che inventa oggi , e cioè che Berlusconi non voleva il cavallo perché troppo focoso ?
3 ) “ Quando l’ho conosciuto , Mangano era avulso dall ’ambiente mafioso .
Ad Arcore ha lavorato bene .
Dopo , come dice Dante , ‘ che colpa ho io della sua vita rea ? ’ ” ( Dell ’ Utri ) .
Nel 1974 , quando Dell ’ Utri lo ingaggia ad Arcore , Mangano ha 33 anni e ha già collezionato denunce , condanne e 5 arresti per assegni a vuoto , truffa , lesioni , ricettazione , estorsione , rapporti con narcotrafficanti e mafiosi .
Per la questura di Palermo è già un “ soggetto pericoloso ” .
Per i carabinieri Dell ’ Utri è perfettamente “ a conoscenza del suo passato ” .
Ad Arcore dal 1974 al ’ 76 , Mangano organizza sequestri , mette una bomba nell ’ altra villa di B. , viene arrestato due volte in due anni per scontare pene su reati commessi prima .
Tant’è che Dell ’ Utri , al processo , sostiene di averlo cacciato appena scoperto ( molto tardi ) che era un delinquente .
Salvo poi continuare a frequentarlo e definirlo eroe .
E ancora :
4 ) “ Sentenza comica , un mafioso part time , che è picciotto ma appena appena , sembra uno di quegli espedienti da commedia all ’italiana ” ( Maurizio Belpietro , Libero ) .
“ Sentenza pilatesca , incoerente .
I giudici mi fanno passare per mafioso fino al ’ 92 , ma cadono in contraddizione : se fosse vero , la mafia non mi avrebbe mollato proprio nel ’ 92 , quando poteva sperare nei veri vantaggi del potere , della politica ” ( Dell ’ Utri ) .
Il discorso sarebbe ragionevole se la sentenza dicesse che Dell ’ Utri è mafioso fino al ‘ 92 e poi smette .
Ma è impossibile che un giudice sano di mente sostenga una simile fesseria .
I processi non ricostruiscono la storia .
Affermano le responsabilità penali solo sui fatti dimostrati da prove oltre ogni ragionevole dubbio .
Se un rapinatore imputato per 10 rapine viene condannato “ solo ” per 9 , nessuno si sogna di affermare che , dopo quelle 9 , ha smesso , o che prima era un galantuomo : semplicemente si dice che sono provate 9 rapine e il resto no .
Cos’abbia fatto prima e dopo , lo si può immaginare ; ma non è compito dei giudici , almeno fino a prova del contrario .
Nessuno dice che dal 1993 Dell ’ Utri sia diventato buono : solo che le prove non bastano a condannarlo per il post - 1992 ( la formula “ il fatto non sussiste ” si sposa spesso con l’art .
530 comma 2 Cpp , che assorbe la vecchia insufficienza di prove : dalla motivazione sapremo se anche lui , come Andreotti , per gli anni più recenti s’è salvato per quel motivo ) .
5 ) “ Dovevano assolvermi anche per il ‘ prima ’ del 1992 , ma non l’han fatto per dare un contentino alla Procura .
Per evitare lo schiaffo …
Il problema è la Procura .
Caselli e Ingroia sono potentissimi , in grado di condizionare l’ambiente .
Spero di non trovare in Cassazione un giudice di Palermo ” ( Dell ’ Utri ) .
Sostenere che 7 anni per concorso in mafia sono un contentino ai pm sconfitti , è ridicolo .
Specie se lo fa un senatore della Repubblica .
Dell ’ Utri è imputato per i suoi rapporti con Cosa Nostra dai primi anni ‘ 70 al ‘ 96 : un quarto di secolo .
In primo grado è stato condannato per fatti commessi fino al ’ 96 .
In appello “ solo ” fino al ’ 92 : un quinto di secolo ( ora , come per Cuffaro , sui fatti post -‘96 esclusi incredibilmente dalla Corte d’appello – dai contatti intermediati col latitante Palazzolo nel 2003 - 2004 ai rapporti con la ‘ ndrangheta nel 2008 – si può aprire un nuovo processo ) .
6 ) “ Difficile che a Palermo delle toghe abbiano il coraggio di mettersi contro altre toghe , quantomeno in processi che hanno risonanza ” ( Belpietro ) .
Se è vero che i giudici di Palermo non osano mai dare torto ai pm , perché il Tribunale assolse Andreotti in primo grado ?
Perché la Corte d’appello , la prima volta , assolse Contrada ?
Perché Tribunale e Corte d’appello assolsero Mannino ?
Si è sempre detto ( mentendo ) che i “ processi eccellenti ” dell ’èra Caselli sono finiti tutti nel nulla .
Ora si dice ( mentendo ) che i giudici danno sempre ragione alla Procura .
7 ) “ Il reato potrebbe cadere in prescrizione , perché tra breve saranno trascorsi i 20 anni .
I giudici , condannando Dell ’ Utri , lo salvano ” ( Belpietro ) .
La prescrizione , per il concorso esterno aggravato dalle armi e dal denaro , scatta 22 anni e mezzo dopo gli ultimi reati accertati : 1992 più 22 e mezzo fa 2014 - 2015 .
Cinque anni per il verdetto in Cassazione bastano e avanzano ; il rischio prescrizione si concretizzerebbe in caso di annullamento con nuovo Appello e nuova Cassazione , ma l’annullamento potrebbe riguardare l’insostenibilità dell ’ assoluzione post - ’92 e , allungando i tempi del reato , si allungherebbe la prescrizione .
8 ) “ Il concorso esterno è una fattispecie di reato così generica ed evanescente da ricomprendere anche le semplici amicizie o frequentazioni , buone o cattive .
Ci penserà la Cassazione a cancellare questa vergogna antigiuridica , come è puntualmente avvenuto con Mannino ” ( Il Foglio ) .
La “ vergogna antigiuridica ” l ’ha inventata Falcone nell ’ ordinanza del “ maxi- ter ” ( 1987 ) : “ Manifestazioni di connivenza e collusione da parte di persone inserite nelle pubbliche istituzioni possono realizzare condotte di fiancheggiamento del potere mafioso , tanto più pericolose quanto più subdole e striscianti , sussumibili – a titolo concorsuale – nel delitto di associazione mafiosa .
È proprio questa ‘ convergenza di interessi ’ col potere mafioso che costituisce una delle cause maggiormente rilevanti della crescita di Cosa Nostra e della sua natura di contropotere , nonché correlativamente delle difficoltà incontrate nel reprimerne le manifestazioni criminali ” .
Quanto a Mannino , la Cassazione s’è ben guardata dall ’affermare che il concorso esterno non esiste : ha soltanto ritenuto che , per lui , non fosse sufficientemente provato .
Infatti la stessa Cassazione ha condannato Contrada a 10 anni per concorso esterno .
9 ) “ Il dispositivo nega ogni relazione tra la discesa in campo di Berlusconi , il vero obiettivo del processo .
Liquida come balle sesquipedali le rivelazioni di Spatuzza e Ciancimino .
Le responsabilità nelle stragi e i collegamenti tra mafia e Forza Italia vengono archiviati ” ( Belpietro ) .
“ Crolla tutto il castello dei teoremi sulle trattative tra lo Stato e la mafia e sui mandanti occulti delle stragi ” ( Lino Jannuzzi , Il Giornale ) .
“ La sentenza assolve Dell ’ Utri dall ’accusa più grave : quella di aver ordito un golpe mafioso con le stragi del ‘ 93 ” ( La Stampa ) .
“ Un macigno sulla tesi FI - mafia - stragi del ‘ 92 ” ( Il Riformista ) .
“ Ma le stragi no ” ( Il Foglio ) .
Difficile che Ciancimino venga smentito , visto che non è stato neppure ascoltato dalla Corte .
Di Spatuzza si può dire al massimo che mancano i riscontri , anche perché sono giunti in extremis e la Corte li ha respinti .
Quanto a B. , non è mai stato “ il vero obiettivo del processo ” , altrimenti la Procura avrebbe chiesto di rinviare a giudizio anche lui , invece l’ha archiviato .
Dell ’ Utri non è imputato per le stragi ( inchieste archiviate , per lui e per B. ) .
Comunque la condanna comprende anche il 1992 , l’anno di Capaci e via D’Amelio .
Mai il processo Dell ’ Utri s’è occupato di trattative Stato - mafia e mandanti occulti delle stragi , su cui indagano Palermo , Caltanissetta e Firenze .
Qui le uniche “ balle sesquipedali ” sono quelle di Belpietro , Jannuzzi e altri giuristi per caso .
10 ) “ Resto senatore , fino a sentenza definitiva sono innocente ” ( Dell ’ Utri ) .
Ma lui ha già una condanna definitiva a 2 anni e mezzo per false fatture e frode fiscale .
Che ci fa un pregiudicato in Parlamento , a parte tenere compagnia agli altri ?
In so many ways , the Bush years were deplorably unkind to the scientific community .
Remember the political manipulation of studies confirming global warming , the muzzling of climate scientists who refused to back the Bush administration ’s official views , the censorship of evidence showing the ineffectiveness of “ abstinence only ” education , or the NASA official who banned the use of the phrase “ Big Bang ” unless it was accompanied by the pejorative modifier “ theory ” ?
It was in this politically charged , anti-intellectual climate that my friend Chris Mooney ’s book , The Republican War on Science , became a runaway bestseller .
All of that seemed to change with the election of President Obama .
In his inaugural address , he spoke about the importance of “ restor[ing ] science to its rightful place . ”
During the first weeks of his new administration , President Obama ordered his advisors to develop rules to “ guarantee scientific integrity throughout the executive branch . ”
Surely things must have improved since January 2009 .
Not so , say some scientists .
One and a half years after President Obama ’s directive to develop rules to guarantee scientific integrity in the executive branch , no rules have been issued .
And a story in this weekend ’s Los Angeles Times reports that complaints from government scientists about censorship and interference with their work have continued at the same rate as under the Bush administration .
Scientists told the L.A.
Times about a wide range of interference with science :
In Florida , water - quality experts reported government interference with efforts to assess damage to the Everglades stemming from development projects .
In the Pacific Northwest , federal scientists said they were pressured to minimize the effects they had documented of dams on struggling salmon populations .
In several Western states , biologists reported being pushed to ignore the effects of overgrazing on federal land .
In Alaska , some oil and gas exploration decisions given preliminary approval under Bush moved forward under Obama , critics said , despite previously presented evidence of environmental harm .
The most immediate case of politics allegedly trumping science , some government and outside environmental experts said , was the decision to fight the gulf oil spill with huge quantities of potentially toxic chemical dispersants despite advice to examine the dangers more thoroughly .
White House officials told the L.A.
Times that they remain committed to protecting science from interference , and that proposed guidelines would be forwarded to Obama in the near future .
Let ’s hope the administration will quickly find the courage to reverse a government culture that condoned political interfere with science .
The nation can ill - afford a Bipartisan War on Science .

With one sharp , determined kick , the little plastic sheet rattles off its hinge and swings open .
You find Ron hugging his knees , rocking back and forth on the toilet .
He has wildly applied lipstick all over his face , and is singing something about âfeeling prettyâ quietly to himself .
He went to his happy place .

You shove a finger down your throat , and painfully bring up a series of small rubber orbs .
You grab two in your fists , and begin advancing upon Ron. â If you had any gag reflex left , â  you warn him , â this would be terrible for you .â 
His eyes cloud over ; a dim , unfocused stare overtaking them .
In a flash he is on you , slamming you with an leaping spin-kick .
Youâre not even sure how he managed that in an airplane bathroom so small you'd have to lift the lid just to get your dick out , but manage it he has .
â CHO!â 
Ron shouts , his blur of a fist embedding itself into your stomach .
You puke two condoms full of heroin onto his shoes in retaliation , but he seems unphased by your attack .
He crouches down quickly , then leaps upward , bringing with him a soaring uppercut that sends you backflipping into oblivion .
You die choking on your foot , and nobody mourns you , because you make terrible , terrible decisions .
Remember that one time you ate a penguin ?
That was messed up , dude .
The End .

You kick at the surprisingly hearty plastic door again and again , only to rebound uselessly off of it .
Karate is way harder than it looks on Power Rangers .
Ron mistakes your pathetic blows for polite knocking , and informs you in a choking voice that it is âoccupado.â 
After several minutes of begging , pleading , apologizing , and ultimately dropping to your knees and singing two verses of Journeyâs â Open Armsâ for him while the rest of the cabin laughs at you , he relents .
He emerges from the bathroom oddly composed , pats you on the head , and seamlessly trots off to offer drinks to the other passengers .
With no time to spare , you shove a finger down your throat and bring the drug bags up .
You frantically rip into each bag , downing their contents as fast you can .
After a foul feast of prophylactic - and - vomit flavored mystery drugs , you once again take your seat next to the ratty conspirator .
â Did you flush it all ?â 
He asks .
The hatred you feel for yourself at this moment actually borders on the hilarious .
You stifle a giggle .
A giggle which is impossible to stifle , because the shaking of your own ribs tickles you , which makes you giggle more , and this ridiculous situation is pretty funny , which makes you giggle more , which makes your ribs tickle again , and all of this is irrelevant now because the time vortex has opened up , and the entire front half of the plane is being swallowed by the pastel swirling of the Underverse .

Nintendo has n't released a straight - up sequel to a Super Mario game in almost two decades .
Ignoring nominal sequels Yoshi's Island and Wario Land , Mario's own adventures - from perfect World to muddy Sunshine and the transformation of old Super Mario Bros. to New - have been a cascade of revisions and re-versions , almost always familiar but never the same .
You could even say that about Super Mario Galaxy itself .
The 2007 Wii classic hit the reset switch in virtually every level - sometimes several times per level - as it spun Mario 's world upside down , inside out and round and round .
Super Mario games have always liked playing with the rules rather than by them , but none have ever done it with such dizzy gusto .
By sending Mario into space , Super Mario Galaxy could ignore what little logic the Mushroom Kingdom ever had , taking its only immutable law - gravity - and twisting it around tiny 3D planetoids , or flipping which way was up in side - scrolling sections that almost mocked the series ' roots .
Levels could be one - off gameplay gags or fragmented mini-epics in which the plumber would slingshot through the ages of Mario , from impossible future to retro reference and back again .
So , Galaxy is as deserving of a production - line sequel as any game in this illustrious canon .
All Super Mario Galaxy 2 has to do is to live up to the dense invention and unstoppable momentum of its predecessor .
That 's a tough challenge , of course - but not long into the new game , you know Nintendo 's Tokyo studio has risen to it .
Strangely , neither Bowser nor Peach is named ; they are " the monster " and " your special one " respectively .
Inevitably there are moments of déjà vu .
The intro rattles through a telegraphed version of the original 's misguided attempt at grandiose scene - setting , in which Mario 's nemesis Bowser rather perfunctorily kidnaps Princess Peach .
" Have fun with your stupid mushrooms , " he bellows , and we 're off .
Like Super Mario
World , the game proper starts outside Yoshi's house - but this time it 's floating on an asteroid , and you 'll pass under it , through it and out of the chimney pipe before shooting off through a series of miniature levels that do n't so much lead as shove you through a crash - course in Galaxy 's wraparound , 360 - degree platforming .
Just as in the first game , you need to smack a Piranha Plant baby - boss 's bottom to earn your first star .
Some settings and even level layouts are strikingly familiar .
They 're usually put to a new purpose , but there are some direct quotes from Mario Galaxy too .
( One late level surprises with a note - for - note reconstruction of a moment in Mario 's more distant past , and might reduce the unwary fan to actual nostalgic tears . )
Such things are dispensed with quickly enough to come off as tribute rather than rehash , and if you did n't play the first game they 'll just seem like yet another bright stitch in this tapestry of fun .
New Super Mario Bros .
Wii's auto - pilot Super Guide returns as the Cosmic Guide .
Stars earned with its help still count , but are a disappointing shade of tarnished brown : the brown of your shame .
A tighter , more organised and more economical game than the first , Super Mario Galaxy 2 rolls that glorious tapestry out before you in plain view and at a brisk pace .
It shows only limited interest in anything that is n't catapulting Mario , soaring and whooping , through the cosmos to his next challenge .
It does give you a starship home , but instead of the original 's befuddling Disney fantasy with its melancholy space - princess , you get a jolly giant Mario head made out of brickwork and turf and captained by a fat , avuncular purple star .
Even the helm looks like it 's smiling .
Although gradually populated with friends , diversions and chances to earn 1 - ups , Starship Mario is not actually a hub world .
The magic and mystery of Mario 64's castle can never be recaptured , it turns out , and Galaxy 's scattershot worlds can't be tied together thematically , so time and effort are saved with point - to - point world maps in the New Super Mario Bros. style .
Each of the six worlds is capped by a Bowser or Bowser Jr. boss stage , and as with the other 3D Marios , you 'll regularly need to revisit previous areas - or Galaxies - to earn enough stars to progress .
Welcome to the second installment of our three - part Linux post - mortem .
Part 1 lay the foundations for the article and where we ’re coming from .
Today ’s post directly addresses the question “ What worked and what did n’t ? ” with a set of ‘ pros and cons ’ that cropped up during the port .
The final post will offer a more nuanced set of reflections on these experiences , their implications for game development , and my advice for moving Linux forward as a gaming platform .
Porting Osmos to Linux : What I Loved
Let ’s start with an account of the stuff that stands out as having worked really well — things that were well designed , pleasant to use , and easy to learn .
Love : Live discs and bootable USBs
Being able to boot into an OS from USB without having to first install to the HD is fab , and the various Linux distros have for the most part done a good job of supporting this behaviour .
During development , live discs were helpful in two main ways .
Firstly , when I was starting out , they made it easy for me to poke around and find a distro to use as my ‘ core ’ Linux install ( i.e. the install on which to do the bulk of my Linux development ; I settled for Ubuntu 9.04 ) .
Secondly , live discs made it easier to do quick first - blush tests of cross - distro / DE / WM compatibility for my executables and packages without having to first fully install and configure every OS .
One wish for the live discs would be for the OS versions they contain to have more robust HW drivers , particularly for video .
I realize drivers are a tricky issue in Linux and hard to support generically out - of - the - box , especially on a live OS ( where , for example , rebooting to install a better driver is n’t in the cards ) , but for game development it would be great to have decent video performance when booting from a live disc .
Love : Code :: Blocks
I was looking for a simple , light - weight , easy - to - use C++ IDE that was easy to find in binary form for several distributions ( I did n’t want to have to compile an IDE myself ) and that had some kind of interface sitting on top of gdb .
Code :: Blocks was the answer .
It was n’t bug free , mind you , and crashed on me once or twice per day ( at times to great frustration because of state loss … but nothing reliably reproducable , I ’m afraid , hence no bug reports filed ) .
But , critically , it provided a simple project system , a simple - yet - powerful set of compiler / linker options , the essential find / error / debug / bookmark interactions , and a basic gdb front - end .
Essentially everything I needed was there , it was simple to use , and it was available and ( relatively ) stable cross -distro .
Love : The Linux Package Manager
Linux ’s package system may not have been easy - breezy to support ( more on this below ) , but it sure was easy - breezy to use .
It was straightforward to find the developer libs / headers I needed and get them automatically installed into the right places .
It was fantastic that dependencies are automatically tracked and installed , and that headers / libs install to central and standard places for trivial inclusion / linkage into the project .
Two footnotes : firstly , this smoothness of experience was conditioned in part by the legwork that went into ensuring Osmos relied only on the most core of libs ( libs / packages that ought to play nice and be easily found on any distro ; GL / GLX , X11 , FreeType , OpenAL , libogg / libvorbis , etc ) .
Secondly , a couple of the enterprise - oriented distros seemed to require a prohibitive amount of leg - work to configure for engineering purposes ; this makes sense if the distro is targeted towards the consumer / office end of the market spectrum rather than the engineer , but for someone new to development on Linux , it ’s painful if you do n’t do your homework ahead of time .
Love : Support from the Linux Community and our Beta - Testers
It ’s great to see how keen Linux users are to help support software on Linux .
The average Linux user is on - the - ball and really encouraging in terms of their enthusiasm for Linux and their appreciation of our efforts to get Osmos on Linux .
Post - launch , we ’ve been getting great feedback and PR support from a few key folks in particular .
When the Linux port went into beta I issued a public call for testers and recruited about 50 people .
Each one was top - notch in terms of being observant while playing the game .
They were all helpful with their detective work , and the average level of technical savy - ness was very high when it came to sniffing out audio and WM / X issues for repro .
Folks were keen to try the game on as many machine specs as they could , and were keen to volunteer information and “ run with ” the testing on their own .
All this resulted in a very short beta period ( less than two weeks ) in which a lot of solid testing occurred very quickly , and with only a single patch being required to hammer out all known issues .
Love : Cross - Platform Compatibility is Good for your Code
While not a Linux - specific observation , there ’s no doubt that developing multiplatform software is always beneficial for the code .
Each platform has different analysis tools , compilers that issue different warnings and generate different code , and video drivers with different behaviour ; all of these serve to highlight any underlying issues in your project , and so the work invested on one platform has benefits for the other platforms too .
For the sake quality and stability , cross- platform compatibility has been a good thing for Osmos .
What I Did n’t Love
Let ’s move on to the stuff that was less easy to love ; things that stood out as being frustrating , difficult to use , and in some cases broken .
Did n’t Love : Supporting multiple Distros / DEs / WMs/drivers/etc .
The # 1 obstacle to getting more games on Linux is that it ’s very difficult to get your game working correctly and acceptably on all machines .
It ’s really hard to guarantee a smooth experience for all players when there ’s a combinatorial explosion of possible distributions , desktop environments , window managers , driver / hardware versions — each with their own unique foibles , bugs , and undocumented behaviours .
It ’s the classic PC gaming problem , but magnified .
Linux loves freedom and choice , which I applaud — but some amount of standardization , collaboration and “ Let ’s work together ” - ness is required for the platform to be friendly to application developers .
Did n’t Love : Audio
Brace yourselves , folks , because I ’m going to put it bluntly : audio in Linux is a mess .
The audio situation is another major obstacle to game development on Linux .
It ’s 2010 ; audio is a solved problem .
And yet on Linux , it ’s shocking that you cannot count on something as simple as non-streaming playback , never mind any kind of processing ( which most games are wont to do ! )
There are a variety of standards ( ALSA , OSS , PulseAudio , Phonon , … ) — which one to choose ?
Each standard has different problems on different machines .
For a given standard , some drivers are buggy and poorly configured by default , while others do horrible thinks like block on open when another process opened the device .
This is all another way of saying that there are no audio standards .
What is a developer to do ?
“ But does n’t OpenAL hide all the mess behind a single stable API ?
Ideally you ’d write the audio code once in OpenAL and then walk away . ”
This is n’t how it happens in practice , because the fact of the matter is that the mess is still there .
Simply wrapping another software layer around the underlying problem does n’t make it go away .
Using OpenAL for audio does n’t all - of - a - sudden mean I can count on anything runtime - behavior - wise .
I write my code in OpenAL ( rather than having to write directly in ALSA , PulseAudio , etc ) , but at runtime I still need to make choices — for example , by saying which underlying audio layer I want to use — and different people ’s machine / lib / driver combos will do different things .
Simply using the local machine ’s default audio device does n’t guarantee anything about what ’s going to work and what does n’t , and a game needs guarantees in order to work correctly .
The audio situation is quite horrible I ’m afraid .
Did n’t Love : Lack of Documentation and Consensus
In the Linux world there is so much choice and non-standardization , and it ’s really hard to find out about things .
Documentation is sorely lacking , and it ’s hard to find solutions because when a question is asked , people do n’t agree on the answer .
Forum threads are n’t a good substitute for proper documentation , because forum threads can quickly become historical and fall out of date , meaning folks looking for answers spend a lot of time chasing down false - leads and asking themselves “ Is this forum thread relevant to me ?
Is it really what I ’m looking for ? ”
In the Linux world , it seems to take a great deal of detective work and reverse engineering to get things done ; the plethora of choice means that the newcomer is never certain about their choices — and there will always be someone who disagrees with you ( often vocally ) .
Did n’t Love : Drivers and Hardware Support
My main development machines are two off - the - shelf laptops with mainstream components , and neither of them had WiFi or video that worked out - of - the - box on any distribution I installed .
It took many hours to get decent hardware performance .
Proprietary drivers , open source drivers … which do I chose ?
Do I really have to compile a driver for myself ?
What ’s more , when a new Linux user inquires about driver problems on a forum , the standard line of defense is to blame the problems on hardware manufacturers .
Whether or not the manufacturers deserve blame , the Linux platform folks need to step up , acknowledge the reality of the situation , and try to work to improve the platform .
The chipsets that did n’t work for me ( without great effort ) were nowhere close to bleeding edge ( ATI and Intel graphics , Broadcom Wifi ; some models dating back to 2007 ) and all are widely available on a large segment of the consumer - level market .
Linux needs better support for its HW ; if I ca n’t walk into BestBuy , pick up a run -of - the - mill laptop and have my video and networking hardware work , then the platform is troubled .
Did n’t Love : Packaging the Game
It took days of effort to create the binary packages for Osmos ( I ’m happy to say that it ’s looking like we do n’t have to patch ! )
How should an app be packaged in Linux ?
Should I build my own libs and package them with my game , or rely on package dependency info and hope the distros have the right versions in their package repositories ?
Which package formats do I choose ( .deb , .rpm , .tar.gz , others ) ?
Do any of the package formats have naming conventions I need to follow ?
What do you need to do to support both 32 bit and 64 bit ?
What are the standard practices for where / how my game is layed out on the filesystem ?
What goes where and where do you commonly put softlinks ?
How do I represent softlinks in the various package systems ?
Do architecture - specific files belong in special places ?
Are there any standards for what ’s in the environment path ?
How do I integrate my app into the desktop environment ?
What DEs are worth supporting ?
Do I need to do separate things to support separate DEs ?
There are no standards or clear answers to any of these questions .
There ’s no documentation for this stuff !
Asking on the forums will typically net you a spectrum of answers with no consensus answer and lots of little side arguments .
I basically reverse engineered what I saw other apps doing ( which sadly was of little comfort because everyone does it differently ) .
I settled on supporting .deb/.rpm/.tar.gz with explicit 32 bit and 64bit executables for both the demo and retail versions of Osmos , with no redistributed libs and instead relying on package dependency info .
So far , this has worked out for nearly all distros except CentOS which has an archaic version of libvorbis and nothing new in the standard repositories .
Side - note for those interested : I did n’t venture anywhere near cross-compilation and instead simply built the 32bit and 64bit executables on separate 32 bit and 64bit Ubuntu installs ( which , interestingly enough , both displayed unique and undocumented WM / Xserver interactions , despite being the same version of Ubuntu ! )
Did n’t Love : No OS - level GUI layer for simple dialogs
This is something of a minor point compared to the above , but I want to mention it because it comes up often enough in cross-platform development .
Because Linux has no OS - level GUI layer , games that need any kind of UI must link against heavy - weight UI libraries ( GTK , QT , etc ) which typically impose some kind of application framework .
Common examples of the usage of UI in the gaming world would be a dialog that prompts the user for input the first time a game is run ( e.g. “ Launch in fullscreen ? ” ) or that displays a message when an app terminates unexpectedly .
For Osmos , I had to cut such user - friendly elements because I did n’t want the game to have any but the most basic of dependencies .
Whew !
Alright : in part 3 , I ’m going present a more general discussion of the implications of some of these issues for game developers , and reflect on ways to improve matters .
Stay tuned …

In my previous post , I gave a brief overview of different techniques used to improve the quality of the results on Amazon Mechanical Turk .
The main outcome of these techniques is a matrix that describes the error rate of each worker .
For example , consider the task of categorizing webpages as porn or not .
We have three target categories :
In this case , the confusion matrix of a worker , inferred using the techniques described in my previous post , would look like : where $ Pr [ X \rightarrow Y ] $ is the probability that the worker will give the answer $ Y$ when given a question where the correct answer is $ X $ .
( The sum of the elements in each line should sum up to 1 . )
And here is the question that seems trivially easy : Given the confusion matrix , how can we detect the spammers ?
The simple answer is : Just sum up the elements out of the diagonal !
Since every non-diagonal element corresponds to an error , if the sum is high , the worker is a spammer .
Of course , this ignores the fact that class priors will often differ .
So , instead of giving equal weights to each category , we weight the errors according to the class priors ( i.e. , how often we expect to see eachanswer ) .
For example , if in confusion matrix isand the class priors are 80 % $ G$ , 15 % $ PG$ , and 5 % $ R$ , then the weighted error rate isNotice that the error rates for the first line , which correspond to category $ G$ , got weighted more heavily .
Unfortunately , this method does not work very well .
When we started using this technique , we ended up marking legitimate workers as spammers ( false positives ) , and classifying spammers as legitimate workers ( false negatives ) .
Needless to say , both mistakes were hurting us .
Legitimate workers were complaining and ( understandably ) badmouthing us , and spammers kept polluting the results .
Let me give some more details on how such errors appear .
Spammers on Mechanical Turk are often smartlazy .
They will try to submit answers that seem legitimate but without spending too much time .
( Otherwise , they may as well do the work :-)
In our case , we were categorizing sites as porn or not .
Most of the time the sites were not porn , and only 10 % - 20 % of the time we had sites that were falling into one of the porn categories .
Some workers noticed this fact , and realized that they could keep their error rate low by simply classifying everything as not -porn .
Following the standard way of computing an error rate , these workers were faring much better than legitimate workers that were misclassifying some of the not - porn sites .
Here is an illustration .
With three categories ( G- , PG13 - , and R - rated ) , the confusion matrix for a spammer looks like this :
With class priors are 80 % in G , 15 % in PG13 , and 5 % in R , the weighted error rate of the spammer is : Compare this overall error rate with the one of a legitimate worker , with rather modest error rates :
The error rate for this legitimate worker is : Yes , the legitimate worker appears to be worse than the spammer !
The second type of error is when we classify honest workers as spammers .
Interestingly enough , when we started evaluating workers , the top " spammers " ended up being members of the internal team .
Take a look at the error rate of this worker :
The error rate is :
The error rate would imply that this worker is essentially random .
A clear case of a worker that should be banned .
After a careful inspection though , you can see that this is not the case .
This is the confusion matrix of a worker that tends to be much more conservative than others and classifies 65 % of the " G " pages as " PG13 " .
Similarly , all the pages tat are in reality " PG13 " are classified as " R " .
( This worker was a parent with young children and was much more strict on what content would pass as " G " vs " PG13 . )
In a sense , this is a a pretty careful worker !
Even though this worker does mix up R and PG13 pages , there is a very clear separation between G and PG13 / R pages .
Still the error rate alone would put this worker very clearly in the spam category .
You will notice that one thing that separates spammers from legitimate workers is the information provided by their answers .
A spammer that gives the same reply all the time does not give us any information .
In contrast , when the biased worker gives the answer " PG13 " , we know that this corresponds to a page that in reality belongs to the " G " class .
Even if the answer is wrong , we can always guess the correct answer !
So , by " reversing " the errors , we can see how ambiguous are the answers of a worker , and use this information to decide whether to reject a worker or not .
You can find more details about the process in our HCOMP 2010 paper " Quality Management on Amazon Mechanical Turk " .
You can also find a demo of the algorithm at http://qmturk.appspot.com/
and you can plug your own data to see how it works .
The code will take as input the responses of the workers , the misclassification costs , and the " gold " data points , if you have any .
The demo returns the confusion matrix for each worker , and the estimated " cost " of each worker .
The output is plain text and kind of ugly but you can find what you need .
The code is also open source and available at Google Code

Researchers from University of Minnesota have removed a barrier to improving solar cell efficiency by showing how heat energy currently lost from semiconductors can be captured and transferred to electric circuits .
They hope manufacturers will use the results to produce solar cells with twice the output of current solar cells and at a lower cost .
In current solar cells , the topmost layer is made from a crystalline semiconductor , usually silicon , which absorbs excess solar energy in the form of " hot " electrons , and radiates the energy away before it can be harnessed .
Up till now , capturing this heat into an electric circuit before it cools has not been possible , however the team constructed semiconductors of lead selenide only a few nanometers wide called “ quantum dots ” , and transferred the heat into wires of titanium dioxide successfully before the hot electrons cooled .
The next step will be to build and improve solar cells with quantum dots , but a further obstacle will need to be addressed ; there is still heat loss from titanium dioxide .
Up until now solar cell heat research has focused on heat exchangers that harness heat energy for building heating and cooling , rather than for solar power itself , or on heat - absorbing solar glazing ; but now the potential is there for building solar cells with efficiencies approaching 66 % compared to current efficiencies which rarely exceed 30 % .
The researchers are confident that their research has paved the way for high - efficiency , low - cost solar cells .
“ This is a very promising result , ” said William Tisdale , graduate researcher from UM .
“ We ’ve shown that you can pull hot electrons out very quickly – before they lose their energy .
This is exciting fundamental science . ”
The research was published in this week 's Science and carried out at the University of Minnesota 's College of Science and Engineering .
Collaborators were chemical engineering and materials science professors Eray Aydil and David Norris , and University of Minnesota graduate student William Tisdale .
Other authors of the paper were Brooke Timp from the University of Minnesota and Kenrick Williams from UT - Austin .
It was funded primarily by the U.S. Department of Energy , and partially by the National Science Foundation .
Earlier grants provided by the Initiative for Renewable Energy and the Environment ( IREE ) also supported this research .
Obama seeks “ inflection point ” on Gulf oil disaster
19 June 2010
The past week saw the Obama administration , BP , and the US media seek out an “ inflection point ” in the Gulf oil blowout crisis , as chief White House adviser David Axlerod put it .
Their aim was to somehow defuse growing popular anger over the disaster , while refurbishing the credibility of the government and stock value of BP .
However , the exercise has underscored the subservience of the entire political establishment to the corporate and financial elite .
Over the weekend Obama toured the Gulf Coast , his third trip to the region since the April 20 explosion that killed eleven workers and initiated the biggest oil spill in US history .
The previous trips , which had each lasted just a few hours , had failed in their objective of portraying Obama as “ in command ” and “ angry and frustrated . ”
This time Obama visited several Gulf Coast states over three days , media in tow , advising Americans “ to come down here and enjoy the outstanding hospitality ” — and eat seafood , which the president declared to be “ delicious ” after a lunch in Alabama .
In a near repetition of the now - infamous comments made by George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , Obama promised Gulf residents “ we ’re going to be able to leave the Gulf Coast in better shape than it was before . ”
New Orleans , it should be noted , has never recovered from Katrina .
On Tuesday , Obama held his prime - time Oval Office speech on the blowout .
A spectacle of cowardice and evasion , capped off by sanctimonious invocations of religion , the speech made no condemnation of BP , its actions in the events leading up to the disaster , or its cover - up of the size of the blowout afterwards .
On Wednesday came the administration ’s White House meeting with top BP executives Tony Hayward and Carl - Henric Svanberg .
Afterwards Obama unveiled his plan for a BP escrow account of up to $ 20 billion that the oil giant will come up with over four years .
The sum , even in the unlikely event it is ever paid in full , does not even begin to approach what would be required to deal with the crisis .
Though Obama said the escrow , the Independent Claims Facility ( ICF ) , did not represent a cap on BP liability , most analysts expect that it will serve precisely that purpose .
In words carefully tuned to financial markets on Wall Street and the City of London , Obama declared , “ BP is a strong and viable company and it is in all of our interests that it remain so . ”
Markets took measure of the ICF , bouncing BP share values upwards after a sharp decline over the previous weeks .
With an estimated $ 30 billion in operating cash flow next year and enough oil reserves to supply the US market by itself for two years , BP will have little trouble meeting the $ 20 billion — even should it be required to do so .
“ Add cash lying around in bank accounts and in short - term investments and BP could raise $ 25 billion without breaking much of a sweat , ” the AP notes .
“ The US government will become insolvent before BP does , ” Bruce Lanni , a stock analyst with Nollenberg Capital Partners , told AP .
One UK investor cited by the Financial Times remarked that BP was now a buying opportunity .
“ If the escrow fund is adequate , $ 20 bn against the value of BP ’s assets is minimal . ”
On Thursday came Hayward ’s appearance before a US House Energy Committee meeting focused on internal documents that clearly illustrate BP ’s criminal negligence in the lead - up to the disaster .
This event was aimed to give vent to popular anger , as politicians — themselves intimately tied to the oil industry and implicated in the deregulation of the economy that led to the disaster — would take turns grilling Hayward , by now a despised symbol of corporate power .
Instead , secure in the knowledge that BP will face no real consequences , Hayward blithely dismissed virtually every question , informing the congressmen that the company ’s own , internal investigation took precedent .
One Republican congressman , Joe Barton of Texas , went so far as to twice apologize to Hayward for BP ’s supposed suffering at the hands of the Obama administration and its ICF escrow , which he called a “ shakedown . ”
The US media seized on Barton ’s comment on Thursday and Friday to ponder whether or not Obama had , in fact , “ gone too far ” in his alleged rough handling of BP , bringing the week ’s propaganda campaign to a miserably dishonest end .
The New York Times led the charge .
Writer David Sanger presented the escrow account as a “ display of raw arm - twisting ” that might raise questions over “ the power of government overreach . ”
The Times worried that Obama could appear “ viscerally antibusiness ” or to be “ at war with American - style capitalism . ”
This of a president who has overseen the largest handover of public money to financial concerns in history !
In fact the operating principle of Obama ’s response to the disaster from the outset has been to defend BP and the oil industry as a whole .
Just as there were no consequences for Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan , and the other finance houses who wrecked the world economy for their own enrichment — they are doing better than ever — there will be no consequences for BP .
Indeed , two months since the beginning of the greatest environmental disaster in US history , not a single person has even been fired — let alone charged with a crime .
Whatever the attempts by the administration and the media to turn the page on public opinion , however , facts are stubborn things .
Hours before Obama ’s Tuesday speech , government scientists revealed that oil is gushing into the Gulf at a pace of 60,000 barrels per day — 12 times the rate BP and White House had clung to for weeks .
Heavy crude is lapping up on the coasts of four states .
Entire industries have been shut down , wiping out tens of thousands of jobs .
Species face annihilation .
What the events of the past week make clear is that opposition to the crimes of BP and of the corporate elite as a whole can find no expression through their bought - and - paid - for representatives in the two big business parties .
The working class must intervene as an independent force .
There is no possibility of confronting the catastrophe in the Gulf outside of this .
As a first step , the assets of BP must be immediately seized and used to mount an emergency response .
Even these resources , however , will be inadequate to deal with the economic and ecological catastrophe .
The crisis in the Gulf requires the mobilization of social resources on a vast scale , including the hiring of hundreds of thousands of workers , scientists and engineers .
Trillions can be made available to the banks overnight when it is a matter of bailing out the accounts of the super - rich .
However , when it comes to problems affecting millions of people — education , health care , and now ecological devastation — the claim is that there is simply “ no money ” to be found .
In fact , the freeing up of resources for these urgent necessities requires the nationalization of the giant banks and corporations and their subordination to the democratic control of the working class .
A rational solution to the crisis is impossible so long as society remains under the stranglehold of the corporate and financial elite .
The Gulf oil disaster is a demonstration of the bankruptcy of the capitalist system and the urgent necessity for socialism .

The Federal Court has ordered a dating website to publicly disclose that it created and operated well over a thousand of the profiles on the site .
The court found that Jetplace Pty Ltd created 1,371 profiles which purported to represent actual users of its RedHotPie website and appeared in the site 's ' Uncut ' section .
The court found that Jetplace used some of its own profiles to send messages or flirts to members of the website , and that the company 's profiles also appeared in searches carried out on the website .
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission launched legal action against the company late last year , alleging that the profiles breached the Trade Practices
Act because they were misleading and deceptive .
The court found that the profiles made misleading representations that the website had performance characteristics and benefits it did not have .
" The ACCC will not hesitate to take swift and decisive action where consumers are exposed to misleading tactics by website operators , " the ACCC 's chairman Graeme Samuel said in a statement .
" Website operators such as Jetplace must accept that there is significant potential for many vulnerable people to be attracted to socialising and dating websites and that the website operators have a legal responsibility under the Trade Practices
Act to ensure the information they place on the website is accurate . "
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission company registry shows that Jetplace has been registered since 2002 and is based in West Perth .
The Jetplace website says that in May 2005 redhotpie.com.au was second to rsvp.com.au in web rankings for the Australian dating category , but gives no more up to date information .
The court also found that Jetplace directors , Maxwell James McGuire and Mark Semaan , were party to the offending conduct .
The ABC has received a written response from the company , which says it fully cooperated with the ACCC when it became aware of its enquiries in November 2008 , and that it consented to the court 's orders .
" The central matter of concern to the ACCC was part of RedHotPie.com.au's User Security Suite ( USS ) which depended on the use of a very small number of administrative profiles created by the Company to act as their eyes and ears on the website .
The User Security Suite successfully assisted in the detection of and action against illegal activities and predatory behaviour on the website , " director Max McGuire said in the statement .
" A total of 1371 profiles were created over a four year period for the User Security Suite .
Only a small number of these profiles were active at any given time .
" This part of the RedHot Pie User Security Suite was voluntarily deactivated in November 2008 following the identification of the ACCC 's concerns .
This part of the site 's User Security Suite would have been of minimal inconvenience to bona fide members of the site , and most will not have been aware of its existence or its passing . "
It is a similar response to that which the ABC received from Mark Semaan last year , when the ACCC launched its court action .
" The central matter of concern to the ACCC was the use by RedHotPie of ' monitoring profiles ' .
These profiles were used as part of the site 's User Security Suite ( USS ) which successfully assisted in the detection and action against illegal activities , predatory behaviour and scammers on the website , " Mr Semaan wrote in an email on November 6 2009 .
" This part of the RedHot Pie User Security Suite was voluntarily deactivated almost one year ago following the identification by [ the ] ACCC of concerns in relation to them .
Most bona fide members of the site will not have been aware of its existence or its passing . "
Director Mark Semaan 's LinkedIn page says he has been with the company since January 2004 , and lists his previous employer as BHP Billiton .
Mr Semaan 's LinkedIn page also says he studied finance and computer science at Edith Cowan University .
Verizon ’s DROID
X has only just gone on sale – and is already sold out , with new deliveries not expected until July 23rd – but the carrier is already looking to phase out its predecessor .
According to a leaked screenshot Droid Forums received from the carrier ’s systems , both the Motorola DROID A855 and the DEVOUR A555 are being classed end - of - life , with “ limited or no remaining shipments from the vendor ” .
It ’s unclear how much time that gives would - be DROID ( or indeed DEVOUR ) owners to pick up their handset of choice , so we ’d advise ringing ahead to check your local Verizon store has them in stock .
Both are currently available for order via the carrier ’s website .

All the popular SSRI drugs were linked to miscarriage risk
( Natural News ) Back in 2005 , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) warned that exposure to the antidepressant paroxetine ( sold as Paxil , Paxil CR , and Pexeva ) in the first trimester of pregnancy might increase the risk for birth defects , especially heart problems .
Did this halt the widespread prescribing of paroxetine and other antidepressants for pregnant women ?
Unfortunately , the answer is no .
In fact , background information in a just published study in ( the Canadian Medical Association Journal ) notes the drugs are frequently used in pregnancy .
Almost 4 percent of pregnant women take them at some point during the first trimester -- and the result can be tragic .
Most previous studies on the use of these medications in pregnancy have been small and have n't looked as miscarriages as a main outcome .
But this large study by researchers from the University of Montreal and the Sainte - Justine University Hospital Center ( CHU Ste - Justine ) evaluated the association between antidepressant use in pregnancy in detail -- analyzing classes , types and doses of the drugs and the risk of miscarriage .
In all , the scientists investigated data on 5124 women in Quebec from a large population - based cohort of pregnant women who had miscarried by 20 weeks of gestation .
Then they compared their findings to a large sample of women from the same registry who carried their babies full term .
Of the women who lost their babies , 284 had taken antidepressants during pregnancy .
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , especially paroxetine , were associated with the increased risk of miscarriage .
Venlafaxine ( sold under the brand names Effexor , Alventa , Argofan , and Trevilor ) , which is the sixth most commonly prescribed antidepressant in the U.S. , belongs to another slightly different class of SSRIs called arylalkanolamine serotonin - norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) and , like paroxetine , it was also especially likely to cause miscarriages .
In addition , higher daily doses of antidepressants and a combination of different drugs raised the risk substantially .
" These results , which suggest an overall class effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , are highly robust given the large number of users studied , " Dr. Anick Berard of the University of Montreal and the Director of the Research Unit on Medications and Pregnancy at CHU Ste - Justine wrote in the article .
Overall , an astounding number of Americans , some 27 million , now take SSRIs .
However , as NaturalNews has previously reported , new dangers from these drugs continue to be uncovered .
For example , last December Albert Einstein College of Medicine researchers announced their findings that taking SSRIs significantly raises the risk of strokes and death in women after menopause ( https://www.naturalnews.com/027841_SSRI_drugs... ) .
New York ( CNN ) --
Protesters gathered in lower Manhattan mid-day Sunday to demonstrate against plans to build a mosque near the site of Ground Zero , where the twin towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed by Islamist hijackers on September 11 , 2001 .
Protest organizer Pamela Geller , a conservative blogger , and her group , " Stop the Islamicization of America , " planned the event because , according to the group 's website , " Building the Ground Zero mosque is not an issue of religious freedom , but of resisting an effort to insult the victims of 9/11 and to establish a beachhead for political Islam and Islamic supremacism in New York ...
Ground Zero is a war memorial , a burial ground .
Respect it . "
Geller said the NYPD and security at the rally told her about 5,000 demonstrators were there .
But NYPD spokesman Sgt. Kevin
Hayes said the police department 's policy is to not provide crowd estimates and that he could not confirm Geller 's number .
CNN iReporter Julio Ortiz - Teissonniere , who attended the rally and sent photos to CNN , said the number was closer to 200-300 while he was there for the first 45 minutes of the event .
All three said the protest was peaceful .
Human rights advocates , politicians and families of 9/11 victims addressed the crowd .
Both Geller and Ortiz - Teissonniere said those family members elicited a powerful , emotional response from the protesters .
Geller recently told CNN's Joy Behar that no one 's telling the mosque 's planners they can't build it , but " We 're asking them not to . "
" We feel it would be more appropriate maybe to build a center dedicated to expunging the Quranic texts of the violent ideology that inspired jihad , or perhaps a center to the victims of hundreds of millions of years of jihadi wars , land enslavements , cultural annihilations and mass slaughter , " Geller said .
The project calls for a 13 - story community center including a mosque , performing art center , gym , swimming pool and other public spaces .
It is a collaboration between the American Society for Muslim Advancement and the Cordoba Initiative .
The Cordoba Initiative aims to improve relations between Muslims and the West .
" The Cordoba Initiative hopes to build a $ 100 million , 13 - story community center with Islamic , interfaith and secular programming , similar to the 92nd Street Y , " its website says , referring to the cultural institution on the upper East side of Manhattan .
Daisy Khan of the American Society for Muslim Advancement told CNN it was a " community center with a prayer space inside . "
She said the project was an opportunity for American Muslims living in New York to " give back " to the community .
" There is a lot of ignorance about who Muslims are .
A center like this will be dedicated to removing that ignorance and it will also counter the extremists because moderate Muslims need a voice , " she told CNN .
" Their voices need to be amplified . "
Local political leaders turned out in support of the community last month after Mark Williams of the conservative Tea Party Express reportedly said the mosque was for " the worship of the terrorists ' monkey - god . "
" To make room for peace there can be no room for hatred , bigotry or prejudice , " City Councilman Robert Jackson said at the May 20 demonstration .
The project has the backing of the Community Board of lower Manhattan .
It does not require city permission to go ahead .
iReport : Protests against mosque near Ground Zero
The plan has split people touched by the September 11 attacks .
" Lower Manhattan should be made into a shrine for the people who died there , " said Michael Valentin , a retired city detective who worked at ground zero .
" It breaks my heart for the families who have to put up with this .
I understand they 're [ building ] it in a respectful way , but it just should n't be down there . "
Others such as Barry Zelman said the site 's location will be a painful reminder .
" ( The 9/11 terrorists ) did this in the name of Islam , " Zelman said .
" It 's a sacred ground where these people died , where my brother was murdered , and to be in the shadows of that religion , it 's just hypocritical and sacrilegious . "
But Marvin Bethea , who was a paramedic at ground zero , said it was " the right thing to do . "
" I lost 16 friends down there .
But Muslims also got killed on 9/11 .
It would be a good sign of faith that we 're not condemning all Muslims and that the Muslims who did this happened to be extremists , " he said .
" As a black man , I know what it 's like to be discriminated against when you have n't done anything . "
CNN 's Nicole Bliman , Richard Greene and Mark Morgenstein contributed to this report .
The build - up of fat and grease underground is the result of years of " sewer abuse " - when anything other than water , human waste and toilet paper is put down drains - according to Thames Water .
The concerns about bike thefts in Los Angeles increased Friday as LAPD detectives said they are searching for two men who are responsible for shooting two cyclists who fought the robbers in Koreatown .
One of the victims was so badly wounded during the April 4 robbery that he was only released from the hospital last week , police said .
“ They nearly killed him , ” said LAPD Det.
Dennis Bopp , who is investigating the shootings .
“ It was a crime of opportunity that turned to violence . ”
The shooting unfolded about 3.a.m. , when the two victims stopped to get food from a catering truck at Pico Boulevard and Westmoreland Avenue .
The victims left their bicycles unguarded nearby .
As the men bought food , two men walked up and grabbed their bikes .
The cyclists saw their bikes being wheeled away , chased the robbers and began struggling for control of the bicycles , Bopp said .
One of the robbers pulled out a handgun and shot one of the victims in the ribcage .
Then , as they rode off , he shot the second cyclist in the shoulder .
The shooting comes as the LAPD reported a 29 % increase in bike thefts last year compared to 2008 .
Nearly 2,000 bikes were reported stolen last year in Los Angeles -- and authorities believe the actual number of thefts was much higher because so many people do n't report stolen bikes .

If you ’re were ever a Star Wars fan , chances are you made a very difficult decision , sometime around 2001 , to admit that it had turned to pure , distilled space - crap .
Especially after the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica turned out to be the greatest thing of all time *.
But what if Star Wars could be as good as BSG ?
Well , thanks to enterprising modders UnitedStudios , the question may soon be answered .
Slated for an August , 2010 release , Battlestar Galactica : At War is a full conversion of Star Wars : Empire At War : Forces Of Corruption that aims to replace everything in the game with elements from the BSG universe .
More details , and Olmos Power , after the jump :
UnitedStudios is making some rather fantastic promises about this game : New Factions , ( Colonial and Cylon Races ) ;
In game - elements incorporated from the original 70′s BSG as well as the modern version ;
Hero unit based on series characters ;
An exhaustive list of ships from the BSG universe .
It sounds amazing , especially since they also promise you ’ll be playing an approximation of the entire storyline , from [ SPOILER ALERT ] the nuking of the 12 colonies , through the discovery of ( the Second ) Earth .
No word on whether it will come force you to direct Lee Adama as he plays detective , but even if , it ’s a victory for all colonial citizens .
August is a long way off still , and the production diary indicates they ’re only about 50 % complete .
You can see by the screen cap that it ’s definitely still in Work - In - Progress mode .
But even if this ends up being delayed , it still just made my top 3 must play mods of whatever year it comes out .

WASHINGTON — Two senior Republican senators criticized Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan Thursday for memos she wrote as a young law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall , saying the papers suggest she lets politics dictate her legal decisions .
Sen .
Jon Kyl of Arizona and Jeff Sessions of Alabama said the writings show that Kagan was highly opinionated and wanted to use the law to achieve specific policy results , rather than deciding legal questions on their merits .
" It indicates a developing lawyer who has a political bent to their legal work -- pretty significantly so , " said Sessions , the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee that will hold Kagan 's confirmation hearings .
The memos , Sessions added , " show that her background is heavily in political advocacy ... more than the meat - and - potatoes discipline of serious legal work . "
The two senators cited notes Kagan wrote to Marshall in which she argued that the Supreme Court should n't take certain cases based on her fear that they would give its conservative majority the chance to scale back abortion and criminal rights , among others .
In one , regarding a dispute over abortions for women jail inmates , she advised Marshall to vote to reject an appeal even though she had reservations about a federal appeals court ruling in favor of the inmates .
" This case is likely to become the vehicle this court uses to create some very bad law on abortions and / or prisoners ' rights , " Kagan said in an April 1988 memo .
Kyl called the memos " troubling . "
" They reveal time and time again an effort to reach a certain result in the case , " he said .
" There 's a disturbing pattern that evolves here when you read these that suggests that she is more interested in taking a case or not taking it based upon how they can advance the law to suit themselves or play defense against a court that she thinks might make bad law . "
The publicly available memos have been on file at the Library of Congress since 1993 .
Kagan , 27 when she began working for Marshall in 1987 , said in Senate testimony last year that she tried to " channel " Marshall in her memos , not express her own views .
Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , the chairman of the Judiciary Committee , said it's no surprise that Kagan would try to apply her boss ' legal approach as his clerk .
" It is unsurprising that her evaluation of cases as a law clerk were mindful of Justice Marshall 's long - standing jurisprudence , and that her recommendations to him applied the lens through which he viewed cases and the law , " Leahy said .
Kyl rejected that explanation , citing the personal terms Kagan often used to articulate her stance on points of law .
" I do n't think she 's simply channeling a person with whom she disagrees .
I think she 's complicit in the effort to make law rather than decide law , " Kyl said .
The two also highlighted a memo in which Kagan recommends Marshall call for a response from the government to accusations by a child pornographer that he was entrapped by a Postal Service sting operation into sending sexually explicit videos through the mail .
Kagan wrote that she was " a bit shocked " that the government had published a newsletter called " Love Land " including ads offering sexually oriented material .
Sessions said the language suggests " a rather personal view , not the dispassionate legal view that you would expect from a law clerk . "
The White House defended Kagan , noting that she recommended Marshall deny the pornographer 's appeal .
As solicitor general , Kagan successfully defended a law allowing courts to keep " sexually dangerous " inmates imprisoned indefinitely .
" Republicans are resorting to false attacks in their desperate attempt to find a reason to criticize General Kagan , " said Ben LaBolt , a White House spokesman .
" Kagan 's record on tough penalties for sex offenders is clear . "
Both senators said they have n't decided yet how they 'll vote on Kagan 's confirmation .
Kyl , the No. 2 Republican who also sits on the Judiciary panel , was one of seven in his party to join Democrats last year in voting to confirm Kagan as solicitor general .
He has said repeatedly that vote will have no bearing on his decision about whether she 's fit to have a lifetime term on the nation 's highest court .

Sharron Angle :
In wake of Gulf spill , we need to " deregulate " Big Oil
Dems are gearing up to paint Sharron Angle , the ultra - conservative candidate who 's now taking on Harry Reid , as another Rand Paul and possibly even further to his right .
And here 's another data point :
Angle said in a recent interview that the Gulf spill was an " accident " and opined that we need to further " deregulate " the oil industry in the wake of the disaster .
Here 's the exchange , from a Nevada Newsmakers interview on May 26th , more than a month into the spill crisis :
QUESTION : You have been in support of onshore drilling in the United States as well as offshore drilling , are you rethinking that policy with what is going on in Louisiana ?
ANGLE : No .
I think that what happened in Louisiana was an accident .
They 're cleaning it up .
We need to go forward and talk about prevention and not about whether we keep it out all together .
We know that lot of the problems that have been caused for us with foreign policy and even with our own gas prices here domestically going up is our dependence upon foreign oil .
We have oil reserves and petroleum reserves that we should tap into .
And that 's a policy that we really need to look at as a nation .
How do we deregulate enough to invite our industries to come back into the United States and quit outsourcing their business ?
It 's astonishing how quickly a picture of Angle is taking shape as more and more info comes to light .
Sam Stein , for instance , finds an Angle quote from 2009 in which she seems to suggest that it 's wrong for a married man and woman to hold jobs simultaneously .
And TPM reports that Angle embraced the patriot group " Oath Keepers , " which warns members to resist some sort of nefarious plot that apparently exists -- who hatched it is unclear -- to create " giant concentration camps . "
As I noted here yesterday , the Reid operation is gearing up to paint Angle as , well , a nutjob , as a cross between Rand Paul and Orly Taitz .
There does n't appear to be a shortage of material .
In 2008 , when Tony Kornheiser was a Monday Night Football commentator for ESPN , Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers once sat down with him for a pre-game production meeting .
It would be an extreme understatement to say that Rodgers came away unimpressed .
In an interview with ESPN Radio in Milwaukee , Rodgers went off on Kornheiser and said he was embarrassingly unprepared for his job .
“ You know who was better than Tony Kornheiser ?
Dennis Miller was ten times better , ” Rodgers said , via SportsRadioInterviews.com .
“ Dennis Miller was a great comedian , but one of the worst Monday Night Football guys ever .
And he was ten times better than Tony Kornheiser .
His stuff was actually funny .
Tony was n’t funny at all .
He did absolutely no research .
We ’d sit in those production meetings and he would add absolutely nothing to the conversation .
I ’d be like , ‘ What are we doing here ?
This is stupid . ' ”
Rodgers praised Monday Night Football play - by - play man Mike Tirico as coming into production meetings thoroughly prepared .
Kornheiser ?
Not so much .
“ You get in there with Tony and he ’s asking you all these dumb questions that have no application to the game you are playing or anything you are doing , ” Rodgers said .
“ He ’s terrible . . . .
I do n’t think he ’s funny .
I do n’t think he ’s insightful .
I do n’t think knows , really , anything about sports . ”
Most football fans regard Ron Jaworski as one of the top analysts in the business , but Rodgers is n’t particularly thrilled with Jaworski , either .
“ I like him , but , when I was coming out , he did the worst segment in the history of TV about me talking about my fundamentals , ” Rodgers said of Jaworski .
“ It was not even close to anywhere near my fundamentals .
The first time I met him , someone introduced me to him and I said , ‘ Yeah I know him .
He ’s the guy who ripped me before the draft . ’
The rest of the night he told me how great I was .
I was like , ‘ I know your song and dance . ’
And now he loves me . ”
The whole interview , in which Rodgers criticized other ESPN employees and took a shot at the Detroit Lions , is well worth listening to .
Rodgers comes across as an entertaining and engaging player who ’s not afraid to speak his mind .
When he retires , he ’d be perfect for the Monday Night Football booth .
Or as co-host of Pardon the Interruption .
Image caption Ipsa 's costs in its start - up year are estimated at £ 6.5 m
MPs have questioned expenses officials in private , following an explosive public evidence session last week .
A second committee hearing had been due to be held in public , but a " round - table discussion " took place behind closed doors instead .
Some MPs are upset the new Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority ( Ipsa ) will cost £ 6.5 m this year .
Its predecessor cost £ 2 m last year .
But Ipsa says its cost includes start - up expenses and the figure will fall .
Chairman Sir Ian Kennedy and his colleagues faced a committee of MPs , set up by Commons Speaker John Bercow , for the second time in a week on Tuesday .
At a hearing last week , several parliamentarians vented their anger at Ipsa , accusing it if running an over - complicated computerised expenses system and questioning its staffing costs .
A parliamentary spokeswoman told the BBC : " The committee has decided they took a lot of evidence last time and would like a bit more time to think about what 's been said . "
Rather than having a formal evidence session , there will be a " round - table discussion " , she added .
Ipsa estimates that MPs ' staffing costs and expenses costs may be £ 12 m a year lower than under the previous expenses scheme and that its own running costs will be cheaper than those of the old system .
This is devastating .
The working poor of New Orleans must feel like they have a target on their backs .
Katrina , the Gulf disaster ... now this ?
Apparently Habitat for Humanity is so worried about legal exposure , they 've been stonewalling the residents :
NEW ORLEANS —
For more than a year , the local chapter of Habitat for Humanity has insisted there were no defects in the Chinese drywall it used to build nearly 200 houses for victims of Hurricane Katrina , including many in its heavily publicized “ Musicians ’ Village ’’ development in the Upper Ninth Ward .
But a house - by - house canvas of Musicians ’ Village by reporters from the Sarasota Herald - Tribune and ProPublica found several homeowners who reported serious problems and one who said she had complained to Habitat for more than a year about corrosion and electronics failures believed to be related to her drywall .
The reporters ’ interviews with dozens of residents also turned up a second potentially significant problem :
Some of the homes that Habitat officials believed had been built with American - made drywall actually contain a Chinese product instead .
As a result , Habitat has begun investigating as many as 50 post - Katrina homes that used the allegedly American - made product .
Most of the targeted homes are in Musicians ’ Village , which was largely bankrolled by Harry Connick , Jr. and Branford Marsalis in an attempt to bring musicians back to the city after the hurricane .
But some are in other New Orleans neighborhoods .
A Habitat spokeswoman said the investigation has already confirmed that five houses have Chinese drywall and are exhibiting problems associated with the product , such as corroded electrical wiring .
The New Orleans chapter of the prominent non-profit continued using Chinese drywall in the Village and its other New Orleans projects throughout 2009 -- long after other builders stopped -- because it said it had done tests showing that the stockpile of Chinese product it bought from Taishan Gypsum Co. in March 2007 was not problematic .
[...]
Three homeowners in Musicians ’ Village told reporters of a range of problems , from failed appliances and electronics to corroded metals and jewelry .
They also complained about health issues , including irritated eyes and respiratory problems .
One Musicians ’
Village homeowner said that since mid-2009 she has repeatedly complained to Habitat about appliance failures and strange corrosion in her home .
She said Habitat officials kept promising to send an inspector , but never did .
Other owners said they raised questions but were promised they had nothing to worry about .
When a reporter visited homes that Habitat originally said were made with American drywall , he found that at least three had wallboard that was clearly stamped “ Made in China . ”
Each of those homes also had corrosion and other problems associated with contaminated drywall .
Why Wal - Mart 's sales should have everyone worried
( Fortune ) --
It certainly looks like happy days are here again .
Many of the nation 's biggest retailers , including Saks , Hewlett - Packard , Home Depot , and Target have released cheery sales reports .
April 's jobs reports showing a slight increase in the workweek and pay for workers , and more hiring across the board .
And then there is Wal - Mart , whose happy yellow face switched to a grimace when it released first quarter sales on Tuesday .
Although international growth helped push revenues up 6 % , sales at U.S. stores fell 1.4 % from the same period last year .
And the company had no one to blame but its shoppers .
" More than ever , our customers are living paycheck to paycheck , " said Tom Schoewe , the chief financial officer .
So who are you supposed to believe ?
In this case , Bentonville .
When Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) , an economic bellwether , notes that customers can't afford the gas to get to the stores and that they 're increasingly using food stamps when they get there , things are bad .
True , other consumer - dependent companies are doing better , but by how much ?
Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ , Fortune 500 ) made its numbers by selling hardware to corporations , not consumers .
Home Depot ( HD , Fortune 500 ) was pulled forward by do - it - yourselfers buying small items and by homeowners making one - off summer purchases of new landscaping tools and grills ; big ticket items are still sitting collecting dust , while the contractor business remains weak .
Saks ( SKS ) ' results were impressive , but it sells luxury goods to a sliver of the American demographic , one that benefitted most from the psychologically important stock market rise earlier this year .
The problem is that both the economy and consumer sentiment remain shaky .
Even Target ( TGT , Fortune 500 ) , which reported better than expected results yesterday , was forced to concede that .
While touting his company 's success , Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel , noted that " We believe that both are still somewhat unstable and fragile and will likely continue to experience occasional setbacks as the year progresses , " he said .
On shaky ground
That frailty in confidence has n't been helped by the flash crash or the video of rioting in Greece .
But there are also more structural concerns that could affect the durability of the US recovery .
Overall , while retail sales have continued to expand over the last seven months , the rate of increase has slowed since March .
Also , much of the retail rebound has taken place on the shoulders of wealthier consumers -- about 40 % of all spending currently comes from the 20 % of households with the highest incomes .
That spending , juiced by earlier stock market gains , has led wealthy Americans to spend their savings at an increasing clip ( a cause for concern in and of itself ) .
If that is n't worrisome enough , how about the fact that other retail fuel has come from a decidedly different source : Americans walking away from their debt - sopped homes , which has freed them to spend again .
You can't build a sustainable consumer - led economy with that kind of material .
And the setbacks mentioned by Steinhafel could be more prolonged if the Wal - Mart demographic does n't start putting more skin in the game .
That demographic remains large .
The unemployment rate still hovers around 10 % .
Moreover , the rate of under - employment ( those whose hours are cut or can only find part - time work ) continues to increase , and more than 40 % of the employed are now working in what are often low - wage service jobs .
These Americans are going to need more than confidence to get moving .
They are going to need more work and more money .
So far , they 're getting neither .
Real wages have continued to decline .
Inflation - adjusted personal disposable income has remained relatively flat .
And , even if current economic growth were sustained , it would take more than three years to bring the unemployment rate below 6.3 % , where it was at the peak of the 2001 recession .
Meanwhile , the Mortgage Bankers Association reported yesterday that the number of mortgages in foreclosure has climbed to a new record , with foreclosures and delinquencies now accounting for one out of every seven US mortgages out there .
Wal - Mart has tried to spin this dismal situation as something of a lucky break for future quarters , with Schoewe noting the fact that " our customer remains under pressure " will speak " positively to the opportunity for Wal - Mart " in the future .
That view may be a bit Pollyanna - ish given the their customer 's current straits .
Of course , if they can scrape together enough money to buy the gas to get there , they might just spend up a storm .

Have you heard the exciting news ?
Apparently appalled at the paucity of solid learnin ’ in America ( excepting , of course , Texas ) , media maestro and renowned art historian Glenn Beck has announced the opening of his own great patriotic hall of academe .
The forthcoming institution o’ learnin ’ , appropriately titled Beck University , will “ explore the concepts of Faith , Hope and Charity and show you how they influence America ’s past , her present and most importantly her future . ”
Its faculty features such luminaries as a free - market economist whose degree is in psychology and a Texas Republican Party bigwig who hates , hates , HATES church - state separation .
It even has an Ivy - style crest — featuring a feather , a buffalo , and the disembodied head of George Washington — and a Latin motto , “ Tyrannis Seditio , Obsequium Deo ” ( roughly translated : “ Revolution against tyrants , submission to God ” ) .
No word yet on whether RNC Chairman Michael Steele , apparently in need of some good historical and civics education of late , has enrolled .
But just in time for the Independence Day weekend , the MoJo staff has produced a list of course offerings we hope to see at Beck U. next fall .

New Orleans , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
A highly anticipated test designed to measure pressure within BP 's ruptured Gulf of Mexico oil well finally began Thursday , and for the first time in nearly three months , oil stopped flowing into the Gulf .
The move was lauded by a variety of officials as a positive step , accompanied by a strong note of caution that the cutoff was simply part of the test , as BP and government experts try to assess how the well is holding up .
The test got under way after two days of delays , first as government scientists scrutinized testing procedures and then as BP replaced a leaking piece of equipment known as a choke line .
The data are being particularly closely scrutinized at six - hour intervals .
Higher pressure readings mean the well is containing the oil , while lower pressure means some is leaking out .
The " well integrity " test could end after one of the six - hour periods , if the results are disappointing .
But it could go on for 48 hours .
The longer it goes , the better indications are that the well is holding with a custom - made sealing cap .
BP cautioned that the oil cutoff , while welcomed , is n't lilkely to go beyond the 48 hours .
Valves are expected to open after that to resume siphoning oil to two ships on the surface , the Q4000 and Helix Producer , as government and BP officials assess the data and decide what to do next .
Two more ships are due to join them in coming weeks , bringing containment capacity to 80,000 barrels of oil a day , more than high - end estimates of how much oil had been leaking .
" It felt very good to see no oil going into the Gulf of Mexico , " BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said in a briefing .
He said company officials are " obviously very encouraged " but they are " trying to maintain a strict focus " on remembering the whole purpose of the test , which is to gather data and decide how to proceed .
" I do n't want to create a false sense of excitement , " he said .
" We want to move forward and make the right decisions . "
And BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said on CNN's " Situation Room " that while no leaks were apparent , " It 's way to early to celebrate . "
Retired Adm . Thad Allen , who is overseeing the government 's response to the spill , said in a statement it " remains likely " that sending the oil to containment ships will be the avenue officials decide to pursue after the test , until the ultimate solution is readied -- sealing the well by pumping mud and cement through one of two relief wells being drilled .
The wells are expected to be completed in August .
The second one serves as a backup to the first .
In some earlier briefings , Allen had been mentioned the possibility of leaving the cap closed , after the test .
Allen said experts also will examine options for shutting off the well again temporarily , if there 's a hurricane .
Meanwhile , from state and local officials around the Gulf region , there were warnings that the cleanup from the spill could take years .
" Hallelujah .
It 's a step in the right direction , " said Democratic Sen .
Bill Nelson of Florida , who 's been outspoken about the damaged caused by the spill .
But he noted , " My goodness .
This have taken us three months .
We 've been hurt , and hurt badly . "
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindall said in a statement he was " cautiously optimistic " as the test proceeds .
But he said , " Work to revitalize our coast wo n't be done until our waters and our shores are completely clean and our wildlife , our communities and our coastal industries are 100 percent restored . "
Florida Governor Charlie Crist sounded a similar note , stating , " While I am pleased that oil no longer is flowing freely into the Gulf of Mexico , there is more work to do to help families , businesses and communities on the Gulf Coast as they recover from this disaster . "
BP 's stock jumped on word that the oil flow had been cut off , as part of the test .
The stock rose $ 2.74 a share , more than 7 percent , to close at $ 38.92 .
Earlier this month , it traded below $ 30 a share .
The oil stopped flowing shortly before 2:25 p.m. CT , according to Wells .
And a series of cameras some 5,000 feet below the surface clearly showed the halt -- a far different scene from the images day after day of a relentless flow .
The stacking cap , lowered in place earlier this week , has never been deployed at such depths or under such conditions and , therefore , there were no guarantees on how well it would contain the oil , BP said .
In the test , BP closed off -- one by one -- the valves on the cap system through which oil could escape .
If at any time the pressure is deemed too low -- meaning that oil is escaping through another source in the breached well -- the testing would stop , according to Allen .
Allen compared low pressure in the well to a leaky garden hose that dribbles out water with your thumb pressed hard on the nozzle , Allen said .
The catastrophe in the Gulf began when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and triggering the relentless spill .
Allen said the cap was not designed to permanently shut in the well -- it was meant to move to a four - vessel containment system and assure redundancy in the event of a hurricane .
But he had said in earlier briefings there could be a huge side benefit if the oil can be contained -- a " twofer , " as he called it .
As for the relief wells , BP pumped drilling mud into them to mitigate risks during the pressure testing .
Oil recovery was also stopped Wednesday ahead of the integrity test but resumed while BP was fixing the problem with the leaking choke line .
It was stopped again with the testing under way .
Image caption China has not yet backed Seoul 's report on the Cheonan sinking
South Korea says it has persuaded China and Japan to take part in financial sanctions against North Korea .
It comes in the wake of the sinking of a South Korean naval ship by a North Korean submarine .
In a BBC interview , South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung - hwan speculated that the sinking of the Cheonan might have been the result of internal Pyongyang politics .
North Korea has angrily denied any responsibility for the attack .
The North Korean military , Mr Yu said , might have decided to do it in order to distract attention from other problems .
Mr Yu had no criticisms to make of China for failing to condemn North Korea publicly for the sinking of the Cheonan .
On the contrary , he felt that China had been privately helpful and understanding during the three - way summit with South Korea and Japan , which ended on Sunday .
South Korea is hoping to make the regime in Pyongyang pay a heavy price for its actions .
It is invoking UN resolution 1695 , passed in 2006 , which makes it possible to introduce economic sanctions against North Korea for breaching its international obligations .
The government in Seoul wants all inflows of money to North Korea to be stopped .
If China , which has so far delayed announcing its own findings on the sinking of the Cheonan , does take part in the sanctions , it could make life even harder for President Kim Jong - il 's regime .
Fragile economy
Things are already difficult enough for him .
The famine of the past seems mostly to have been dealt with , at least for now , as a result of the government 's decision to allow a quiet measure of free enterprise .
But this has helped to create a great deal of corruption among low - level officials , on a scale which the North Korean regime had never previously allowed .
Towards the end of last year North Korea introduced a currency reform which had the effect of raising some salaries by as much as 10,000 % .
This made it possible for a lot of people to buy things they had only previously dreamt of .
The shops were suddenly filled with great quantities of cheap consumer goods , mostly brought or smuggled in from China .
But it also introduced alarming rates of inflation .
The inflow of cash from outside has never been large , but it has helped to keep North Korea 's immensely fragile economy going .
If the Chinese join in a wider blockade , it could have serious political consequences as well as economic ones .
It comes at a time when Kim Jong - il , the so - called " Dear Leader " , is becoming manifestly weaker .
He was once surprisingly clever at wrong - footing both South Korea and the United States in the past , but ever since his stroke in 2008 his powers have waned .
If things go wrong it could have very serious consequences far wider than just Korea Yu Myung - hwan , South Korea Foreign Minister
Now his third and youngest son , Kim Jong - un , seems to have been selected to take over from him , just as Kim Jong - il himself was once chosen to succeed " the Great Leader " , Kim Il - sung .
Scarcely anything is known about Kim Jong - un , who is either 27 or 28 - accounts vary .
He is thought to have been educated in Switzerland , and he possibly speaks quite good English .
Only one authentic photograph of him exists in the public domain , and since that was taken when he was eleven it is not much of a guide to his appearance now .
Rumour in South Korea has it that he was involved in the disastrous decision to reform the currency last year .
Mr Yu admitted in his BBC interview that all these things made people feel nervous about the future of the peninsula at present .
" If things go wrong it could have very serious consequences far wider than just Korea , " he said .
It sounds like a measured understatement .
This MRI image demonstrates structural brain changes between patients who characterized IBS symptoms primarily as pain , compared with non-painful discomfort .
Credit : UCLA
A large academic study has demonstrated structural changes in specific brain regions in female patients with irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , a condition that causes pain and discomfort in the abdomen , along with diarrhea , constipation or both .
A collaborative effort between UCLA and Canada 's McGill University , the study appears in the July issue of the journal Gastroenterology .
The findings show that IBS is associated with both decreases and increases in grey matter density in key areas of the brain involved in attention , emotion regulation , pain inhibition and the processing of visceral information .
IBS affects approximately 15 percent of the U.S. population , primarily women .
Currently , the condition is considered by the medical field to be a " functional " syndrome of the digestive tract not working properly rather than an " organic " disorder with structural organ changes .
Efforts to identify structural or biochemical alterations in the gut have largely been unsuccessful .
Even though the pathophysiology is not completely understood , it is generally agreed that IBS represents an alteration in brain - gut interactions .
These study findings , however , show actual structural changes to the brain , which places IBS in the category of other pain disorders , such as lower back pain , temporomandibular joint disorder , migraines and hip pain — conditions in which some of the same anatomical brain changes have been observed , as well as other changes .
A recent , smaller study suggested structural brain changes in IBS , but a larger definitive study had n't been completed until now .
" Discovering structural changes in the brain , whether they are primary or secondary to the gastrointestinal symptoms , demonstrates an ' organic ' component to IBS and supports the concept of a brain - gut disorder , " said study author Dr. Emeran Mayer , professor of medicine , physiology and psychiatry at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
" Also , the
finding removes the idea once and for all that IBS symptoms are not real and are ' only psychological . '
The findings will give us more insight into better understanding IBS . "
Researchers employed imaging techniques to examine and analyze brain anatomical differences between 55 female IBS patients and 48 female control subjects .
Patients had moderate IBS severity , with disease duration from one to 34 years ( average 11 years ) .
The average age of the participants was 31 .
Investigators found both increases and decreases of brain grey matter in specific cortical brain regions .
Even after accounting for additional factors such as anxiety and depression , researchers still discovered differences between IBS patients and control subjects in areas of the brain involved in cognitive and evaluative functions , including the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices , and in the posterior insula , which represents the primary viscerosensory cortex receiving sensory information from the gastrointestinal tract .
" The grey - matter changes in the posterior insula are particularly interesting since they may play a role in central pain amplification for IBS patients , " said study author David A. Seminowicz , Ph.D. , of the Alan Edwards Centre for Research on Pain at McGill University .
" This particular finding may point to a specific brain difference or abnormality that plays a role in heightening pain signals that reach the brain from the gut . "
Decreases in grey matter in IBS patients occurred in several regions involved in attentional brain processes , which decide what the body should pay attention to .
The thalamus and midbrain also showed reductions , including a region — the periaqueductal grey — that plays a major role in suppressing pain .
" Reductions of grey matter in these key areas may demonstrate an inability of the brain to effectively inhibit pain responses , " Seminowicz said .
The observed decreases in brain grey matter were consistent across IBS patient sub - groups , such as those experiencing more diarrhea - like symptoms than constipation .
" We noticed that the structural brain changes varied between patients who characterized their symptoms primarily as pain , rather than non-painful discomfort , " said Mayer , director of the UCLA Center for Neurobiology of Stress .
" In contrast , the length of time a patient has had IBS was not related to these structural brain changes . "
Mayer added that the next steps in the research will include exploring whether genes can be identified that are related to these structural brain changes .
In addition , there is a need to increase the study sample size to address male - female differences and to determine if these brain changes are a cause or consequence of having IBS .

Git for other purposes
Git is usually used to manage source code , though it ’s described by its creator as a stupid information tracker .
When my team was looking to rework our CM system , I was able to apply my spare - time dabbling with git .
CM is a software engineering discipline all its own , and a large company can easily have several people whose full - time job it is to manage software configurations .
CM basically boils down to taking several independent components and combining them into something consumable .
In our case , we have an executable produced by one team , a set of manuals that comes from another team , some kernel - mode drivers that are on their own timeline because of WHQL , and some other odds and ends .
The goal of the new system was to allow things that change together to be kept in the same place , and simply refer to fixed versions of other things .
For instance , version 9 of our driver might need to pull in version “ 2010 - 06 - 10 ” of the manuals .
We currently use a VSS - workalike to manage these things , but that has some problems .
Our tool ca n’t manage file renames or reorganization , so we ’re stuck with a directory that has every historical name for a file , and the directories have no sanity .
It ’s a mess .
The problems we have with our current tool simply do n’t exist with git .
You can move files around and rename them with impunity , since a git commit is just a bunch of path / object mappings ( rather than a listing of files , each with its own history ) .
So I hacked together a set of scripts that would take built binaries , commit , tag , and push them to a central repository for safekeeping .
Each component comes with a script that knows how to pull other components in .
The whole thing uses git tags to manage component versions .
One thing we had to manage properly was nightly builds .
The central repo is only used for actually - released versions of the software ; pushing all the nightly builds to it would be a waste of time .
However , we wanted the automated nightly to be able to use the CM machinery to create an installable package .
This is a bit tricky , and at first glance seems silly : why would you commit something into a version control system if you only want some of the versions to actually be stored ?
It ’s not so bad .
The trick is to git reset -- hard origin / master before the script copies in the new versions of the files .
Here ’s what a fresh clone of a component looks like :
This is a component with three real versions stored on the server .
Now we ’ll wait four days , and see what happens to our local repository :
Pretty messy .
There are four throwaway builds stored in there .
We have n’t pushed any of these , so all of those commits only exist on this machine .
Now we ’ll do a real build :
And now we need to give the server both the commit on master as well as the new tag :
$ git push origin master Counting objects : 5 , done .
Writing objects : 100 % ( 3/3 ) , 233 bytes , done .
Total 3 ( delta 0 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) Unpacking objects : 100 % ( 3/3 ) , done .
To < remote > ad9c250..725bf06 master -> master $ git push origin v4 Total 0 ( delta 0 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) To < remote > * [ new tag ] v4 -> v4
And now our gitk window looks like this :
And a fresh clone looks like this :
Success : none of the nightly builds were stored in the central repository .
Git is a pretty nice source control system , but it does a pretty decent job at configuration management as well .
WaPo ’s “ Top Secret America ” investigation is crafted to form Orwellian conclusions .
The political and intellectual classes are biting the bait to reel us in .
“ Top Secret America “ , a special investigation by Dana Priest and William Arkin at The Washington Post ( WaPo ) , highlights the “ concentration of top - secret government organizations and the companies that do work for them ” that includes over 850,000 people with top secret clearance — over a quarter - million in the ‘ private sector ’ — and an annual $ 10 bn National Security Agency regime within the $ 75 bn Big Brother black hole .
The reaction from Capitol Hill and the mainstream media is strikingly uniform : that the problem is the cumbersome inefficiency of the Big Brother regime , not that Big Brother is watching us .
Today ’s addition to the report highlights the extention of the National Surveillance State without limits to ‘ Main Street ’ .
“ In some parts of the cluster , they occupy entire neighborhoods .
In others , they make up mile - long business parks connected to the [ National Security Agency ] campus by a private roadway guarded by forbidding yellow ‘ Warning ’ signs , ” Ms. Priest and Mr. Arkin reported , adding later : “ Six of the 10 richest counties in the United States , according to Census Bureau data , are in these clusters . ”
The investigation has identified 45 governmental organizations with 1,271 sub-units and 1,931 non-governmental corporations “ engaged in top - secret work for the government ” — categorized in 23 types of spying , datamining and execution .
The narrative that has become of this investigation has n’t scratched the surface of privacy rights , free speech or the moral authority of government to criminalize every human being .
The National Surveillance State shifts the burden of proof from the State to the citizen .
The very nature of “ this behemoth ” is immoral , let alone unconstitutional .
David Ignatius at the WaPo is the one who calls this system a “ behemoth ” , but his criticism — like most — is against the size , the cost , the inefficiency .
The danger of this dominating the narrative is that it quickly monopolizes the narrative — and it has .
“ The paradox here is that a smaller , better - controlled intelligence community will actually make the country safer than the unmanaged sprawl we have now , ” he wrote yesterday .
He notes that “ this complex features many of the old Cold War giants ” and goes on to list the beneficiaries within the military - industrial complex , but supports the government turning these corporations into welfare queens , though he adds :
“ The war on terrorism has been a magnet for spending , just as the Cold War was . ”
Mr. Ignatius is taking this report and criticizing , not the Big Brother violations , but that it ’s “ bloated ” and calls for it to be “ leaner and meaner ” .
What these line - pushers are hiding is that the smaller these programs become , the more centralized the data collection becomes and the less likely whistleblowers come out to shed light on the rights abuses of Washington .
By definition , there will simply be less people capable of whistleblowing , less with access to evidence of abuses and in reality the “ bloated ” government bureaucracy is outsourced to corporations replacing the people with technology .
Technology incapable of identifying when it ’s undeniable that government has gone too far .
Technology without a weighed conscience .
The paradox is that a “ leaner and meaner ” spying complex , this investigation at the WaPo would ’ve hit so many brick walls that it would n’t exist .
The functions would remain the same ; just deeper in darkness .
The 1,931 corporations will just dwindle down to the “ Cold War giants ” monopolizing the contracts and threatening employees with losing their jobs if they violate confidentiality .
What ’s missing from the overall discussion is that this places the so - called ‘ progressives ’ is a spot with shit in their faces .
They ca n’t strike the root of the Big Brother conundrum without conceding it as the inevitable lovechild of big government and mass consent , as Justin Raimondo wrote at AntiWar.com :
Government programs have many more lives than the mere nine attributed to cats : efforts to kill them off or even trim them down meet with defeat a great deal of the time .
This hardiness is rooted in their very existence , which automatically creates a made - to - order political constituency .
Once a government program is created , a pressure group — consisting of the economic beneficiaries of the program — inevitably arises which lobbies to extend and expand it .
This applies in spades to those “ private ” companies whose sole “ customer ” is the U.S. government , and it is one of the chief energizing factors behind the exponential growth of “ Top Secret America . ”
It is also the classical libertarian explanation for the growth of Big Government , not only in America but everywhere the State exists .
The core mainstream defense for the State is blown away by this reality that delegitimizes the loyalists even more , as Mr. Raimondo added :
Conservatives who question the utility of multiple layers of bureaucracy , and even cite Hayek , usually fail to apply the same principle to the realm of national security , where they ’re all for what they would otherwise denounce as “ big government . ”
Yet the general principles governing economic science are equally applicable to all the realms of human action , including intelligence - gathering and the defense of the nation .
Indeed , it is precisely here , where failure to understand those principles can lead to mass death , that they must be applied most stringently .
To be more precise , a middle class family paying a couple hundred dollars within the same federal health care program as politicians is a socialist welfare program where we ’re supposed to fear that it means Stalin gives us our next prostate exam or pap smear ; but some corporation that creates nothing but the resources and manpower to destroy lives and liberty being handed billions every year become untouchable issues .
In The General Idea of the Revolution ( 1851 ) , Pierre - Joseph Proudhon aptly reasoned :
To be governed is to be watched over , inspected , spied on , directed , legislated at , regulated , docketed , indoctrinated , preached at , controlled , assessed , weighed , censored , ordered about , by men who have neither the right , nor the knowledge , nor the virtue .

Attorney General Holder Attacks 5th Amendment
So why did I think of Miles Davis when I heard what Attorney General , Eric Holder , had to say on ABC ’s “ This Week ? ”
Holder said the administration needs to consider at least modifying the public safety exception for reading a suspect his rights to ensure law enforcement can act with flexibility and within constitutional bounds .
It appears an attack on the reading of Miranda Rights to suspects of a serious crime is underway .
Ignore the 5th Amendment just a little bit , because this guy is a terror suspect and we want to question him a little differently .
Lets not be better people , lets dehumanize ourselves , just like the people who hate us .
Miles Davis experienced freedoms and half freedoms , sadly the half freedoms were in his own country .
I always thought Miles Davis was , for a short time , the coolest person on the planet .
His look , his stature and above all his music .
The freedom in his music , did not reflect the freedom in his life , a trip to Europe set his music free .
Paris is many things : a city of romance ; a hotbed of culture , and the inspiration for countless artists , musicians and poets .
It ’s also a place that , for more than 40 years , had a special relationship with the jazz trumpeter Miles Davis .
Paris was the first foreign city Davis ever visited , and it was one of the last major cities he played in , shortly before his death on 28 September 1991 .
In 1949 , a 22 - year - old Davis travelled to Paris , as part of a quintet .
The band was booked to play at the first Paris international jazz festival since the war ended .
In the US , Davis was already a rising star in the jazz world , but while he was highly respected among his peers , in mainstream America he was seen as a second - class citizen .
It was a time when segregation and discrimination were rife , and most US states enforced anti-miscegenation laws .
But France was a different story , and nothing could have prepared Davis for the reception he would receive in Paris .
“ This was my first trip out of the country , ” recalled Davis in his autobiography .
“ It changed the way I looked at things forever … I loved being in Paris and loved the way I was treated .
Paris was where I understood that all white people were not the same ; that some were n’t prejudiced . ”
“ Miles often talked about Paris , ” says the Australian film director Rolf de Heer , who worked with Davis in Paris in 1990 .
“ The French were in love with Miles and treated him like a god .
He liked that because it was a form of respect he did n’t get in his own country . ”
French jazz pianist René Urtreger adds : “ Miles was proud and touched by the fact that in France , jazz was considered to be very important music . ”
Parisian cafe society in 1949 , was full of love and humanity for all comers , after experiencing the beastly side of humanity since early 1940 , they decided which way was best .
Miles Davis found his musical freedom in Paris and he took that freedom everywhere with him from then on .
The thought of a “ Jim Crow ” style attack on the 5th Amendment made me think Miles Davis would n’t like it .
MILES DAVIS
OH WHY OH WHY DID MILES LOVE PARIS
Using Generative Techniques in Flash Design
Wikipedia ’s article on generative art describes it as “ … art that has been generated , composed , or constructed in an algorithmic manner … ”
Generative techniques , while somewhat obscure to those outside the technology sector , can be used to produce highly detailed , ever changing visual patterns within the confines of a system that you define– think of those visualizations that were popular to watch while listening to your favorite tunes on Windows Media Player in the 90s .
Many designers shy away from randomness , but I would argue that since a computer can create iterations of a generative system extremely quickly , you can get desirable results by simply running the program again and again until something special begins to unfold .
You can then take vectors you have generated into Illustrator for refining if you like , as well .
Generative techniques are also extremely valuable for animations , especially related to representations of natural processes like plants growing , objects blowing in the wind , and various particle effects for obvious reasons .
In this article , we ’ll be focusing on how one can go about creating generative systems .
You will need a working knowledge of Actionscript 3 to implement these ideas .
Before we dive into the code , I ’m going to briefly describe the general structure I use for nearly all generative pieces I create .
Keep in mind that this is simply the system I ’ve developed for the way that I work and it allows me the most flexibility .
There are thousands of programmers creating generative visuals and each one of them has their own way of doing things .
However , I do think that this structure allows for a great deal of flexibility .
Step 1 : Create an empty bitmap
As you may be aware , if you have a lot of vector information visible in a Flash application at one time , you can slow your computer down to a crawl .
Adding even more vector data will cause the program to freeze and crash .
This is why it is valuable to create an empty bitmap as your first layer .
This way , you can bake your vectors into the bitmap image and clear them out immediately after each drawing operation .
This however will not work for printing since your bitmap will only be at screen resolution , so if you would like to print your work at high resolution , you will simply disable the code that clears the vectors ( and make sure you can stop the program before it gets out of control ! ) .
If you are creating a visual system that will be displayed on a screen , then it makes sense to bake everything into a bitmap to maximize performance of your application , and also so that you can apply effects to the bitmap image itself .
You can use either built - in Flash effects ( blur can be extremely useful for creating depth over time ) , or you can write your own functions that manipulate the bitmap on a per-pixel level .
The possibilities are endless .
Step 2 : Create your ‘ Pen ’
For the next layer , I create a sprite object that will act as a pen , meaning I will use the drawing API to create vectors inside this sprite .
Sometimes I have several pens layered on top of each other that do different things .
As described in step one , you can draw the contents of the pen(s ) to your bitmap and then clear it after each drawing iteration .
Step 3 : Colors
In order to maximize the control I have over what colors are in use in a visual system , I define color sets inside arrays .
Usually I create one array for fills and one for strokes , but depending on the complexity of the visual system sometimes adding more arrays can be useful .
Step 4 : Symbology
I create an empty movie clip in the library where I can put hand - drawn vectors in each frame for further reference by the program .
Again , depending on the complexity , I may create more than one movie clip holder for symbols .
Step 5 : Timing
The final step is creating either a Timer object or an ENTER_FRAME event that will trigger the pen to draw something .
I usually just go with an ENTER_FRAME event .
Inside the listener function is where I write the code that calls all the drawing functions , as well as draws the generated vector information into the bitmap ( if applicable ) .
That ’s it !
Within this simple structure we can do anything we like visually .
We can write any drawing algorithm we are crazy enough to conjure up , dynamically place hand drawn vectors and position them how we like , control the color scheme of both our generated and hand - drawn vectors , and we can bake it all into a bitmap image for further manipulation .
Below , you will find an AS3 template class that incorporates these ideas .
In part 2 of this series , we will look at the code that drives this piece I have created :
Nick Elliott is a frontend developer specializing in Flash at Oncall Interactive .
He received his BA in Digital Media Technology from Columbia College Chicago .
Over the past several years he ’s worked on projects for clients such as Wilson , Nike , Microsoft , Playboy and many others .
His generative artwork has been showcased at several galleries around Chicago including the Hokin Gallery at Columbia College Chicago and the Murphy Hill Gallery .
Nick is also an electronic musician and implements generative ideas in his music .
A newly - formed advocacy group , whose leaders say they intend to target the Obama administration over its alleged lack of support for the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , appears to be far more closely tied to the Republican Party than similar groups in the past .
“ The Emergency Committee for IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s leadership unites two major strands of support for the Jewish state , ” Politico ’s Ben Smith writes .
“ The hawkish , neoconservative wing of the Republican Party , many of whom are Jewish , and conservative Evangelical Christians who have become increasingly outspoken in their support for Israel . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
But although Smith suggests that the group was formed to appeal to “ some American backers of Israel [ who ] remain deeply suspicious of ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s efforts to press Israel toward specific policy shifts , ” his own reporting makes it clear that the chief goal is to improve the GOP ’s electoral prospects in House and Senate races this fall .
“ One official at an American Jewish organization , ” Smith remarks , “ expressed concern that a group with such Republican origins would contribute to a deepening partisan cast to the debate over Israel . ”
The Emergency Committee for Israel was publicly launched only last week , when its executive director , Noah Pollak , appeared on CNN to argue that the Obama administration had recently become more willing to “ bow to reality ” by dropping some of its “ demands and criticisms ” of Israel and by signaling a belief “ that something needs to be done ” about Iran .
Despite its recent debut , the group has already raised enough money to begin running what Politico describes as a “ scathing ” attack ad against the Senate campaign of Rep. Joe Sestak ( D - PA ) .
The ad criticizes Sestak “ for signing a letter criticizing IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s blockade of Gaza while not signing a defense of Israel circulated by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and for appearing at a fundraiser for the Council on American Islamic Relations . ”
The unusually close ties between the Emergency Committee for Israel and the Republican Party were underscored earlier this week when Jim Lobe , the bureau chief of Inter Press Service , discovered that “ the partisan connections behind this group are so thinly veiled that a two - minute examination of their domain name registration uncovered ties to the Republican Party and the George W. Bush administration . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The domain turns out to have been registered not by Pollak or any of his Neocon allies but by Margaret Hoover , a political commentator who frequently appears on Fox News .
Hoover formerly held a variety of positions in the Bush administration and served as an associate director in the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs in 2004 - 05 , when it was overseen by Karl Rove .
Rove himself has been actively creating a network of front groups intended to pour massive amounts of funding into the 2010 elections , which raises the question of whether the Emergency Committee for Israel could be another such group , created to tap a slightly different audience of potential donors on behalf of Republican candidates .
In an article two months ago titled “ Rove , GOP plot vast network to reclaim power , ” Politico noted that Rove and former RNC Chair Ed Gillespie “ are the most prominent forces behind what is , in effect , a network of five overlapping groups , three of which were started in the past few months . ”
It was recently reported that just one of Rove ’s groups , American Crossroads , had “ raised nearly $ 8.5 million in June , much of it solicited from wealthy donors . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Karl has always said : People call us a vast right - wing conspiracy , but weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re really a half - assed right - wing conspiracy , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â one of Rove ’s organizers told Politico .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Now , he wants to get more serious .

Liz Cheney attacks Obama for saying flotilla deaths were " tragic "
It 's not surprising that Liz Cheney is now faulting Obama 's handling of the Israeli raid on the flotilla .
What is noteworthy is how she 's doing it :
She 's faulting the President for describing the loss of life as " tragic . "
Not kidding .
From Liz 's new statement ...
Yesterday , President Obama said the Israeli action to stop the flotilla bound for the Gaza Strip was " tragic . "
What is truly tragic is that President Obama is perpetuating Israel 's enemies ' version of events .
The Israeli government has imposed a blockade around Gaza because Hamas remains committed to Israel 's destruction ...
President Obama is contributing to the isolation of Israel , and sending a clear signal to the Turkish - Syrian - Iranian axis that their methods for ostracizing Israel will succeed , and will be met by no resistance from America .
There is no middle ground here .
Either the United States stands with the people of Israel in the war against radical Islamic terrorism or we are providing encouragement to Israel 's enemies -- and our own .
Keep America
Safe calls on President Obama to reverse his present course and support the state of Israel immediately and unequivocally .
This is noteworthy because it shows how little oxygen Obama 's response to the raid has lent to right - wing criticism .
Obama has declined to criticize Israeli conduct , has repeatedly alluded to Israel 's right to defend itself , and has not taken a clear stand on whether the administration wants meaningful international involvement in the probe of the whole affair .
Not much here to criticize .
Also :
When Obama used the term " tragic , " on Larry King last night , he was clearly referring to the loss of life resulting from the attack .
It 's particularly interesting that Liz sees fit to criticize Obama 's description of these casualties as " tragic , " given that one of the dead was an American citizen .
If the people who brought us television had played by the same rules that today 's wireless carriers impose – we 'd probably all be listening to the radio .
Which is a nice way of saying the wireless industry – AT&T , Sprint , Verizon and T - Mobile – needs some ground rules that make clear they are common carriers that get the right to rent the airwaves by abiding by fair rules .
Right now , they play by their own rules .
Imagine if the wireless carriers controlled your wired broadband connection or your television set .
You'd have to buy your television from your cable company , with a two - year contract , and when that ended , you 'd have to ask them to unlock it so you could take it to another provider .
If the wireless company ran your ISP , you 'd have to use a computer they approved , and if you wanted to use a different one , you 'd pay more .
Want Wi -Fi in your house ?
That 'll be an extra $ 30 a month and $ 150 to buy an approved but functionally limited Wi -Fi device .
Luckily , that 's not the case .
Let 's recap the freedoms you have with your television :
The specs are standard and public .
Any company that wants to make a television – whether it be an HD , 3 - D , internet - connected plasma 6 - footer or a handheld TV Walkman – just makes a television , according to transparent ( FCC ) spectrum rules .
Then you get to buy it .
It just works .
You watch the stations you want .
You can hook it up to cable or satellite or DVR or plug a DVD player into it .
With your home broadband connection , you can buy the router of your choice , hook up as many computers as you like , and use whatever programs you like on your computers .
You can even use your connection as a base station for your cellular phone , or have your bathroom scale automatically report your weight to Twitter .
You can even share that internet connection with whomever you like , including strangers who might otherwise be customers of that same ISP .
When you upgrade your computer or router ( or even the smartphone that uses your home Wi - Fi ) , your ISP does n't even know and does n't care .
The world of mobile in the U.S. is different .
Much different .
You only get a single device , one that has to be preapproved by the carrier .
The device is almost always locked down .
If you manage to pry its OS open enough to install software , you void your warranty .
If you care to use your 3G connection occasionally as a modem for your laptop , be prepared to pay $ 30 extra a month – or hack the device and ( see above ) void your warranty .
If you want to switch devices , you 'll often be forced to ' upgrade ' to a more expensive plan , even if your current plan offers unlimited data .
For instance , Sprint has tens of thousands of users using its old friends - of - a- employee plan , known as SERO , which offered unlimited data on its best smartphones .
Unhappy with the bargain it struck , the company refuses to let those customers upgrade to new devices – even if they buy the devices for full price .
Any device that runs on these carrier 's networks must be approved by the carriers .
The wireless industry defends itself , saying that it 's changed its ways .
Long notorious for crippling their phones and strangling app developers who wanted access to their devices , the carriers have loosened their policies , since AT&T made its fateful deal with Apple , which ripped control of the device out of AT&T 's hands .
The result showed to the world how the wireless industry had purposely crippled cell phones to boost their bottom lines , customers be damned .
Now , the FCC , which is mulling more official net - neutrality rules , has the chance to finish the job Apple started , but could n't bring itself to finish – removing the carriers stranglehold over mobile devices .
Unfortunately , the idea of setting basic , common carrier ground rules – rules that simply lay out what freedoms we all expect – are somehow being twisted into the government taking control of the internet .
( In which case , we must be living in a Communist country because the proposal is simple . )
Require the nation 's wireless carriers to publish the specs they use on their networks , so that any device maker can make a device that works on any network or all the networks .
Then require the carriers to offer service , with published limits , to any customer , using any compliant device , at a fair price .
Subscribers would have the right to use more than one device , or at the very least , switch them with minimal effort .
Those devices could run whatever software they like , so long as they do n't harm the network .
That should be the requirement for the carriers who are using the public 's spectrum .
AT&T and Sprint and Verizon and T - Mobile may have paid hefty sums to rent the airwaves , but they do not own them .
The carriers will doubtlessly whine to Congress that their networks are too special and too fragile .
Meanwhile , they will brag to customers about how strong and robust their cell networks are – touting services like streaming video for the iPhone , Skype on Verizon , and SprintTV on Sprint smartphones .
They can't have it both ways .
If their networks are fragile , then they should lose their licenses , and the country should redistribute them to tech companies that can manage them well .
If the networks are strong and robust , then like their wire - line competitors they should have to open them up to any device that comports with published standards .
There 's a history of this .
When AT&T was forced to allow non-AT&T approved devices in the Carterfone decision , we soon saw an explosion in new devices that found innovative uses for the network .
We got home answering machines , fax machines and portable phones .
Even better , we got modems .
Granted there 's been an explosion of innovation ( finally ) in mobile devices in the past few years .
Apple , Palm and HTC are all making beautiful devices that feel like magic in your hand .
The Kindle and iPad are likewise magical , relying on 3G connections .
But what we really need is to break the carrier 's stranglehold on devices .
We should free the makers and small companies of the world to make devices without having to negotiate with carriers to get their approval .
Say you wanted to make a phone just for weekend nights , say one that included a lighter and a slot for holding whatever kind of cigarette you like .
What carrier would offer that phone ?
Or how about ones designed for kids , the elderly or the disabled ?
A company could make a phone with guts that mesh with a number of networks , making the wireless companies have to compete for your business .
Google made a half - hearted effort to break the carrier 's grip with its Nexus One , which they wanted to sell directly to individuals who could then choose their carrier .
Among the problems leading Google to close its online store was that the carriers soon decided that playing that game was n't in their long - term interest .
Verizon and Sprint backed out of their commitment to support the device – leaving U.S. customers with only T - Mobile .
The carriers 's lobbying association likes to point to all the cool new phones and ask " Where 's the harm ? "
The problem is the harm comes from the devices and services that have n't been invented yet , because wireless is n't an open platform .
We literally do n't know what we are missing .
When AT&T was forced to open its network by a federal court , the challenge came from a device maker whose product , the Carterfone , connected a two - way radio to the phone line .
It was a nifty invention , though one that few citizens used .
But it opened the way for devices that we all use daily .
It 's time to do the same for wireless .
The airwaves are ours , not the networks ' , and it 's past time for them to be open .
Now , we just need an FCC and an administration with the guts to stand up to the dissembling and the lobbying of the nation 's wireless carriers .
They maintain profit margins of 40 percent , in no small part because they keep choking innovation .
If they do n't stop , they ought to lose their licenses .

The pope handed one of the most powerful jobs in the Vatican to a cardinal who said recently that abortion was wrong , even in cases of rape .
The reshuffle also saw a senior prelate moved from the institution that helps frame the Catholic church 's " pro-life " doctrines after he appeared to question the announcement by another archbishop that the mother of a child rape victim had removed herself from the church by arranging for her daughter to terminate her pregnancy .
Archbishop Rino Fisichella was transferred to head a new department charged with stemming the advance of secularisation , particularly in Europe .
It is the appointment of Cardinal Marc Ouellet , however , that is likely to arouse most controversy .
As prefect of the Congregation for Bishops , Ouellet , until now the archbishop of Quebec and primate of Canada , will be responsible for drawing up shortlists from which the pope decides who is to get a bishop 's mitre .
The prefecture is often regarded as the third most important job in the Vatican administration since its incumbent can prevent even the most gifted priest from rising to a position of leadership in the church .
Ouellet has in the past been touted as a successor to Benedict .
This year , Ouellet provoked what the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation termed a " firestorm of criticism " when he told an anti-abortion conference in Quebec City that terminating a pregnancy was a " moral crime " even in rape cases .
He said he understood that a sexually assaulted woman should be helped and her attacker held accountable .
" But there is already a victim , " he said .
" Must there be another one ? "
Pauline Marois , leader of the Parti Québécois , said she was outraged by Ouellet 's views and accused him of trying to get abortion recriminalised – a claim a spokesperson for the archdiocese denied .
Four days after he made his remarks , the Quebec national assembly passed a unanimous resolution affirming women 's right to free and accessible abortion .
Last year , there was worldwide controversy when Archbishop José Cardoso Sobrinho of Olinda and Recife in Brazil said the mother of a nine - year - old girl who had been repeatedly raped by her stepfather had excommunicated herself from the Catholic church .
In response , in an article published on the front page of L'Osservatore Romano , the Vatican 's official newspaper , Fisichella wrote : " Before giving thought to excommunication , it was necessary and urgent to safeguard the innocent life of this girl . "
He was replaced as president of the Pontifical Academy for Life by a Spanish prelate close to the conservative Opus Dei .
Fisichella 's appointment to head the nascent Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation is not a demotion , but it marked the second time in a week that the pope sent a clear signal that he would not tolerate public dissent .
On Monday , the Vatican announced that the archbishop of Vienna , Cardinal Christoph Schönborn , had come to Rome to explain himself to the pontiff after apparently questioning priestly celibacy and accusing a fellow cardinal of mishandling a prominent sex abuse scandal .
Wanted : Women 's Words on Their Orgasms
Women , would you consider being a part of a very special book project ?
I am turning to all the wonderful women out there for some frank and down - to - earth contributions .
I am collecting women ’s first - person accounts of the detailed physical experience of orgasms .
I ’m really hoping that some of you can help me out with this .
Feel free to pass it on to any women who might be interested .
Details –
I am seeking first person descriptions from women about their orgasms .
· Who :
You are a woman , 18 years or older , who have experienced one or more variety of orgasms .
( Transwomen !
I want your unique perspectives too ! )
· What : Essay of clear and detailed description of your orgasm , from start to finish , focusing on the physical experience , expressed in your own words .
When does it start ?
What parts of your muscles and body parts ?
What ’s the hint of it ?
Where does it start ?
How does it move through your body ?
What sort of sensations ?
Imagine trying to illustrate your orgasm to a person who ’s never had it .
This is not about what your partner is doing to you , what they are saying nor euphemistic description of romance or lust .
Another way to think of this -
How would you describe the detailed body experience of a sneeze ?
How would you describe the physical sensation of being in an airplane taking off ?
In the same way , how would you describe an orgasm ?
Talk about where , what muscles and specific physical locations , the sensations starts and where it goes , including precise physical description of the sensation .
What sort of physical chain reactions were happening in you immediately before leading up to the orgasm ?
I 'm looking for descriptions that are really body based , focused on skin , muscle , nerve endings and the process of what an orgasm does to , with and in the body .
Sometimes the sensations or part of sensations are n't exactly pleasant .
I want those details too .
This is not about writing erotica , euphemisms or turning on the reader .
While some may be turned on , the focus is on a frank and precise body - event description .
· If you have more than one type of orgasm , each variety would be written in a separate essay piece .
I 'm also interested in the smaller orgasms , the brief ones , the ones that are just about a quickie to get to sleep , or even the not - so - fabulous orgasms .
· How Long ?
As long as it takes for you to describe it .
It may be a couple of paragraphs or couple of pages .
· Credit line :
How would you like your essay to be credited ?
You ’ll have one or two lines .
· Editing :
At most I will edit for grammar , spelling and readability .
I want to keep it as true to your original narrative and tone as possible .
· Send to midori@fhp-inc.com
• Please make sure that there 's an e mail I can reliable reach you at .
I may have some questions around editing or some other detail .
I 'm happy to answer any questions on this .

Tutorial
Basis
A Mocker instance is used to command recording and replaying of expectations on any number of mock objects .
Expectations should be expressed for the mock object while in record mode ( the initial one ) by using the mock object itself , and using the mocker ( and / or expect ( ) as a helper ) to define additional behavior for each expression .
For instance :
1 >> > mocker = Mocker ( ) 2 >> > obj = mocker .
mock ( ) 3 4 >> > obj . hello ( ) 5 >> > mocker .
result ( " Hi ! " ) 6 7 >> > mocker .
replay ( ) 8 9 >> > obj . hello ( ) 10 ' Hi ! ' 11 12 >> > obj . bye ( ) 13 Traceback ( most recent call last ) : 14 . . . 15 mocker .
MatchError : [ Mocker ]
Unexpected expression : obj . bye 16 17 >> > mocker .
restore ( ) 18 >> > mocker .
verify ( )
In this short excerpt a mock object is being created , then an expectation of a call to the hello ( ) method was recorded , and when called the method should return the value " Hi ! " .
Then , the mocker is put in replay mode , and the expectation is satisfied by calling the hello ( ) method , which indeed returns " Hi ! " .
Calling the unexpected method bye( ) on the mock raises an error .
Finally , a call to the restore ( ) method is performed to undo any needed changes made in the environment , and the verify ( ) method is called to ensure that all defined expectations were met .
The same kind of logic may be expressed more elegantly using the with mocker : statement ( Python 2.5 + ) , as follows :
1 >> > obj = mocker .
mock ( ) 2 3 >> > obj . hello ( ) 4 >> > mocker .
result ( " Hi ! " ) 5 6 >> > with mocker : 7 . . . obj . hello ( ) 8 ' Hi !'
Also , the MockerTestCase class , which integrates the mocker on a unittest .
TestCase subclass , may be used to reduce the overhead of controlling the mocker .
A test could be written as follows :
1 >> > class SampleTest ( MockerTestCase ) : 2 . . . 3 . . . def test_hello ( self ) : 4 . . . obj = self .
mocker .
mock ( ) 5 . . . obj . hello ( ) 6 . . . self .
mocker .
result ( " Hi ! " ) 7 . . . self .
mocker .
replay ( ) 8 . . . self .
assertEquals ( obj . hello ( ) , " Hi ! " )
After each test method is run , expectations defined will be verified , and any requested changes made to the environment will be restored .
Expression kinds
The following expression kinds are currently understood by Mocker , and will be properly recorded if used on a mock object :
value = mock.attr
mock.attr = value
del mock.attr
mock ( [ *args , ** kwargs ] )
value in mock
mock [key ]
mock [key ] = value
del mock [key ]
len ( mock )
bool ( mock )
iter ( mock )
Notice that these expressions may be nested .
For instance , notice how the following expressions are recorded and replayed back :
1 >> > obj = mocker .
mock ( ) 2 >> > len ( obj .
attr . method ( " param " ) ) 3 >> > mocker .
result ( 3 ) 4 5 >> > mocker .
replay ( ) 6 7 >> > method = obj .
attr .
method 8 >> > result = method ( " param " ) 9 >> > len ( result ) 10 3
Expression reactions
Mocker may instruct mock objects to react in certain ways once recorded expressions are seen during replay mode .
There are two different ways to specify that , and they are completely equivalent .
One of them is using method calls on the mocker instance itself , and the other is using the expect ( ) helper .
As an example :
>>> obj1 = mocker.mock ( ) >>> obj1.hello( ) >>> mocker.result ( " Hi ! " ) >>> obj2 = mocker.mock ( ) >>> expect ( obj2.hello( ) ) .result ( " Hi ! " )
The following reactions are supported :
result ( value ) -
Make the last recorded expression return the given value on replay .
generate ( sequence ) - Last recorded expression will return a generator with the given sequence .
throw ( exception ) -
Make the last recorded expression raise the given exception on replay
call ( func , with_object =False ) -
Make the last recorded expression cause the given function to be called ( result of function is also the result of the expression ) .
If with_object is True , the called function will receive the patched or proxied object so that its state may be used or verified in checks .
count ( min [ , max ] ) -
Last recorded expression must be replayed between min and max times ( max=min , if max is n't given , and max may be None , in which case there 's no upper limit ) .
passthrough ( [ result_callback ] ) -
Make the last recorded expression run on the real object once seen ( works with proxies , patches , and replacements ) .
If result_callback is given , it will be called with the value returned by the real method as the only argument .
Check the API documentation for a more detailed explanation of these methods .
Parameter matching
Mocker offers a very flexible way to match parameters in method calls .
In simple cases , parameters are matched using basic equality .
For instance :
1 >> > obj = mocker .
mock ( ) 2 3 >> > obj . hello ( " Joe " ) 4 >> > mocker .
result ( " Hi Joe ! " ) 5 6 >> > obj . hello ( " Jeff " ) 7 >> > mocker .
result ( " Hi Jeff ! " )
In more interesting cases , a few special parameters may be used to define the expectation .
1 >> > obj = mocker .
mock ( ) 2 3 >> > obj . hello ( " Joe " , " morning " ) 4 >> > mocker .
result ( " Good morning , Joe ! " ) 5 6 >> > obj . hello ( " Jeff " , ANY ) 7 >> > mocker .
call ( lambda name , when : " Good %s , Jeff ! " % when )
It 's possible to specify keyword arguments in a similar way , and also to match a variable number of positional or keyword arguments using the ARGS and KWARGS special parameters , respectively .
These may be used alone or alongside other normal parameters .
As an example , the following code will record an expression which will match any method calls that take " Joe " as the second argument .
1 >> > obj = mocker .
mock ( ) 2 >> > obj . hello ( ANY , " Joe " , ARGS , KWARGS )
The following special parameters are available :
ANY - Matches any single parameter ( positional or keyword , depending on the context used ) .
ARGS - Matches any number of postional parameters , in the position where it was used .
KWARGS - Matches any number of keyword arguments .
IS ( object ) - Matches parameter if it is the given object .
IN ( object ) - Matches parameter if it is contained in the given object .
CONTAINS ( object ) - Matches parameter if it contains the given object .
MATCH ( func ) - Matches parameter if func( param ) is true .
Patching limitations :
At this time patching does n't work in classmethods .
Ordering of expressions
By default , mocker wo n't force expressions to be expected precisely in the order they were recorded .
You can change this behavior in a few different ways .
Which one is used in a given occasion depends only on convenience .
One way to obtain ordering is calling mocker.order ( ) .
With this , the mocker will be put in a mode where any recorded expressions following it will only be met if they are replayed in the recorded order .
When that 's used , the mocker may be put back in unordered mode by calling mocker.unorder ( ) , or by using a with mocker.order ( ) : block , like so :
1 >> > with mocker .
order ( ) : 2 . . . obj . hello ( ) 3 . . . mocker .
result ( " Hi ! " ) 4 . . . 5 . . . obj . bye ( ) 6 . . . mocker .
result ( " See ya ! " ) 7 8 >> > 9 10 >> > mocker .
replay ( ) 11 12 >> > obj . bye ( ) 13 Traceback ( most recent call last ) : 14 . . . 15 mocker .
MatchError : [ Mocker ]
Unexpected expression : obj . bye 16 17 >> > obj . hello ( ) 18 ' Hi ! ' 19 >> > obj . bye ( ) 20 ' See ya ! '
Note how the first call to bye ( ) raises an error , because hello ( ) had n't been called yet .
Proxying
Two powerful features of Mocker which are n't commonly seen in other mocking systems is the ability of proxying to existing objects , or even patching the real instance or class .
When an object is proxied , Mocker will create a mock object which will hold a reference to the real object , and will allow expressions to passthrough ( mocked or not , and by default or on request ) .
To understand how it works in practice , let 's define a new class :
1 >> > class Greeting ( object ) : 2 . . . 3 . . . def hello ( self , name ) : 4 . . . return " Hi %s ! " % name 5 . . . 6 . . . def bye ( self ) : 7 . . . return " See ya ! "
Let 's see an example :
1 >> > greeting = Greeting ( ) 2 3 >> > obj = mocker .
proxy ( greeting ) 4 >> > obj . hello ( " Jeff " ) 5 >> > mocker .
result ( " Hello buddy ! " ) 6 7 >> > obj . hello ( " Jim " ) 8 >> > mocker .
passthrough ( ) 9 10 >> > mocker .
replay ( ) 11 12 >> > obj . hello ( " Jim " ) 13 ' Hi Jim ! ' 14 15 >> > obj . hello ( " Jeff " ) 16 ' Hello buddy ! '
17 18 >> > obj . hello ( " Joe " ) 19 ' Hi Joe ! ' 20 21 >> > obj . hello ( " Jim " ) 22 Traceback ( most recent call last ) : 23 . . .
24 AssertionError : [ Mocker ]
Unmet expectation : 25 26 = > obj . hello ( ' Jim ' )
27 - Performed more times than expected .
Note how we requested that one call taking " Jeff " as an argument should result in a message with Hello , and that a single call taking " Jim " as an argument should be made , and it should passthrough to the real object .
Then , when replaying , we 've used both of them , and then a third call which uses neither was made , and it passed through ( that 's the default setting , see the patch ( ) method documentation for more details ) .
Also interestingly , a second call with the " Jim " argument failed , because we said it 'd happen only once ( mocker.count ( ) could have changed this ) .
Mocker also offers a proxy and replace mode , which basically means that if using the replace ( ) method instead of proxy ( ) , on replay time the returned mock object will replace the original object in namespaces of the whole Python interpreter ( including modules , etc ) .
Using that system , it 's trivial to perform environment - level changes , such as in functions defined in standard Python modules .
Both replace ( ) and proxy ( ) offer a mode where the passed object may be an " import string " instead of an object , to facilitate that kind of operation even more .
Here is a simple example to illustrate how it may be used ( luckily examples are still simple even when the explanation is n't ) :
1 >> > obj = mocker .
replace ( " time.time " ) 2 >> > obj ( ) 3 >> > mocker .
result ( 123 ) 4 5 >> > mocker .
replay ( ) 6 7 >> > from time import time 8 >> > time ( ) 9 123
Note that this works even if modules have already run " from time import time " by the time mocker is instructed to perform the replacement .
As explained in the Basis section , changes will be undone when the mocker is restored .
Patching
Being able to patch objects is another powerful and uncommon feature found in Mocker , which is certainly handy in certain occasions .
When an object is patched , Mocker will return a mock object as usual , and will allow expectations to be defined on it .
But then , when put on replay mode , Mocker will make modifications so that the real class or instance acts as defined by the recorded expectations .
Just like with proxies , Mocker will allow expressions to passthrough to the real implementation when desired .
Once the Mocker is restored ( by calling mocker .restore ( ) explicitly , or by the end of a with block , or by returning from a test method in MockerTestCase ) , Mocker will ensure that the patched object is put back in its original form .
Let 's define the same Greeting class again , just for proximity with the following examples .
1 >> > class Greeting ( object ) : 2 . . . 3 . . . def hello ( self , name ) : 4 . . . return " Hi %s ! " % name
Patching works both in classes and in instances .
When a class is patched , all instances of this class will act and be restricted by defined expectations , while if defined in the instance itself , only the given instance will reflect these .
Here is a simple example of changes performed for an instance :
1 >> > greeting = Greeting ( ) 2 >> > obj = mocker .
patch ( greeting ) 3 4 >> > obj . hello ( " Jeff " ) 5 < mocker .
Mock object at 0xb76c608 c > 6 >> > mocker .
result ( " Hello Jeff ! " ) 7 8 >> > mocker .
replay ( ) 9 10 >> > greeting .
hello ( " Jeff " ) 11 ' Hello Jeff ! '
12 >> > greeting .
hello ( " Joe " ) 13 ' Hi Joe ! ' 14 15 >> > type ( greeting ) 16 < class ' __main__.Greeting ' > 17 18 >> > mocker .
restore ( ) 19 >> > greeting .
hello ( " Jeff " ) 20 ' Hi Jeff ! '
As explained in the Basis section , changes are fully undone when the mocker is restored .
Mocked expressions may easily passthrough to the real object , using the mocker .
passthrough ( ) method , as previously explained .
Specification checking for API conformance
One issue with using mock objects is that , depending on the amount of integration test performed , real objects may diverge from the mocked objects , and this might go unnoticed for a while .
Mocker tries to minimize that situation by allowing method calls to be checked for conformance against the real object .
These checks may be easily enabled for pure mock objects , and are performed by default with proxies and patched objects ( it 's possible to disable these ; see the API documentation for more information ) .
Here is an example :
1 >> > class Greeting ( object ) : 2 . . . 3 . . . def hello ( self , name ) : 4 . . . return " Hi %s ! " % name 5 6 7 >> > obj = mocker .
mock ( Greeting ) 8 >> > obj . hello ( " Joe " , " what ? " ) 9 10 >> > mocker .
replay ( ) 11 12 >> > obj . hello ( " Joe " , " what ? " ) 13 Traceback ( most recent call last ) : 14 . . . 15 AssertionError : [ Mocker ]
Unmet expectation : 16 17 = > obj . hello ( ' Joe ' , ' what ? ' )
18 - Specification is hello ( name ) : too many args provided
Notice that passing the spec as the first parameter of the mock ( ) method will also enable the type simulation , as explained in the next section .
To perform just specification checking , use the spec keyword argument explicitly .
To disable specification checking for a specific expression , Mocker offers the nospec ( ) method .
It 's also possible to disable these checks on proxies and patched objects using spec=None when buildling these .
Type simulation
It 's possible to ask Mocker to lie when its _ _class_ _ attribute is accessed .
This makes it easier to perform type - related checks in the implementation while still using mock objects .
This is enabled by default on proxies , and may be easily requested with pure mock objects , as follows :
1 >> > obj = mocker .
mock ( Greeting ) 2 3 >> > mocker .
replay ( ) 4 5 >> > obj .
__class__ 6 < class ' __main__.Greeting ' > 7 8 >> > isinstance ( obj , Greeting ) 9 True 10 11 >> > type ( obj ) 12 < class ' mocker .
Mock ' >
Note how type ( ) will still reveal the truth .
Also , the first argument to mock ( ) will enable specification checking ( see previous section ) .
Use the type keyword argument if you really want just type simulation .
Extension to unittest .
TestCase
Mocker offers MockerTestCase , which is a handy subclass of unittest .
TestCase integrating Mocker support .
It 's by no means required for using what Mocker offers , but even then it 's definitely a convenient integration .
Test methods will have a Mocker instance available on self .
mocker , and at the end of each test method , expectations of the mocker will be verified , and any requested changes made to the environment will be restored , without any manual intervention .
It also offers self .
expect , which is an alias for the expect ( ) helper .
Tests which do n't require the mocker will not be affected .
Here is a short example :
1 >> > class SampleTest ( MockerTestCase ) : 2 . . . 3 . . . def test_hello ( self ) : 4 . . . obj = self .
mocker .
mock ( ) 5 . . . obj . hello ( ) 6 . . . self .
mocker .
result ( " Hi ! " ) 7 . . . self .
mocker .
replay ( ) 8 . . . self .
assertEquals ( obj . hello ( ) , " Hi ! " )
In addition to the integration with Mocker , this class provides a few additional helper methods , which make it interesting even when Mocker itself is n't needed .
assertIs ( first , second ) - Asserts that first is the same object as second .
assertIsInstance ( obj , cls ) - Asserts that obj is an instance of cls .
assertIn ( first , second ) - Asserts that first is contained in second .
assertStartsWith ( first , second ) - Asserts that first starts with second .
assertEndsWith ( first , second ) - Asserts that first ends with second .
assertApproximates ( first , second , tolerance ) - Asserts that first is near second by at most the given tolerance .
assertMethodsMatch ( first , second ) - Asserts that methods of class first exist in class second , and take precisely the same arguments .
makeFile ( content=None , suffix= " " , prefix= " tmp " , basename = None , dirname = None , path =None ) - Creates a file ( if content is not None ) with the given information and returns its filename .
The file is removed after the test method returns .
makeDir( suffix= " " , prefix= " tmp " , dirname = None , path =None ) - Creates a temporary directory and returns its name .
The directory and its contents are removed after the test method returns .
addCleanup ( func , *args , ** kwargs ) -
After the test method is finished , ensure that func ( * args , ** args ) is called .
In addition to these , the following extensions to standard modules were made :
assertRaises ( exc , func=None , *args , ** kwargs ) -
In addition to the standard features , this method returns the raised exception so that further tests on it may be done .
Also , it supports the Python 2.7/3.2 use of assertRaises ( ) with a single argument , so that it can be used as : with self.assertRaises ( MyException ) : raising_logic ()
assertRaisesRegexp(exc , regexp , func=None , *args , ** kwargs ) - Works very similarly to assertRaises ( ) , but will also ensure that str( error ) matches the provided regular expression .
All of the expected negations and aliases for these methods are also available ( note that one of them is spelled assertIsNot , rather than assertNot Is , for obvious reasons ) .
Credits for the assertApproximates ( ) idea go to Twisted 's Trial .
In Damascus , rumors circulated that the epidemic stemmed from a virus introduced by Israel or another enemy of the Assad regime .
But physicians who treated the soldiers were quoted as saying that the diarrhea was the result of food and water contamination linked to a heat wave that struck Syria .
Nida quoted soldiers as saying that their rations were inadequate for the brutal summer training .
One recruit said breakfast for eight soldiers consisted of eight olives , four loaves of bread and 200 grams of jam .
An opposition leader , however , did not rule out that the epidemic was the work of a hostile intelligence agency .
Farid Ghadry , president of the Reform Party of Syria , said Syria 's enemies have multiplied since 2003 .
" Any country could have been involved , including European countries who have paid a dear price politically for engaging with Assad with no results to show for , " Ghadry said .
" The military hospitals have been receiving hundreds of cases of soldiers being treated for food poisoning , " an opposition source said .
The opposition Web site Nida Syria reported that new recruits were hardest hit by the spread of diarrhea and related digestive disorders .
Nida quoted soldiers as saying that the epidemic stemmed from the harsh conditions in training , including a shortage of food and water .
… and a special message from Vibram Five Fingers to counterfeiters !
First the “ select footwear ” partnership with Merrell … ( or jump to the “ message “ )
Vibram has partnered with Merrell to launch “ Merrell Barefoot , ” a collection of “ six minimalist styles for men and women ” for Spring 2011 according to a July 2010 article titled Sole Mates written by Greg Dutter for Footwear Plus Magazine ( Click “ Current issue , ” page 42 : also here ) .
According to the article , the partnership plays off of the two brands being “ long - term partners in creating some of the outdoor market ’s top - selling shoes ” with Merrell ’s aim being “ to build on what Vibram is creating [ around barefoot technology ] for a Merrell audience that ’s potentially a little different , ” according to Merrell ’s general manager , Jim Zwiers .
That said , do n’t expect Merrell Barefoot to look like Vibram Five Fingers — these are slated to be mono - toed “ shoes . ”
Per the article :
The difference starts with Merrell foregoing FiveFingers ’ glove - like toe design for what Zwiers describes as an “ actual shoe . ”
Other differences include a narrower last , a little added cushioning in the forefoot area , padding in the tongue and heel , Merrell ’s proprietary Omni-Fit lacing system on most styles , and lightweight upper materials …
Zwiers notes the differences are largely cosmetic and wearers still get the full barefoot experience … ”
Further details about Merrell Barefoot indicate that the shoes will be lightweight , with the lightest coming in under 5 ounces per shoe for women and 7 ounces per shoe for men .
The line will retail between $ 90 and $ 120 .
Perhaps anticipating the future of minimalist footwear and increasing demand for shoes that cater to feet ( and not vice versa ! ) , Merrell Barefoot is already planning for an expanded line in 2012 .
So what is going on here ?
It ’s not surprising that we are starting to see other shoe manufacturers get in on the production of minimalist “ barefoot shoes ” after seeing the rampant growth of Vibram Five Fingers ( Note on page 20 of Footwear Plus is an article about barefoot running ! ) .
Indeed , the article also mentions in an aside that , “ Vibram is developing a barefoot running collection with a leading athletic brand . ”
Interesting .
I ’ll be curious to see how this Merrell Barefoot line turns out — immediate questions that spring to mind :
How will the narrower last affect barefoot feel ?
Will toes still be able to splay naturally ?
When it ’s all said and done , how much sole are we talking about here ?
Is there a heel - toe drop ?
How neutral is the shoe ?
Lots of questions and I guess we ’re just gonna have to wait until more information is released about “ Merrell Barefoot ” shoes .
That said ,
It ’s worth noting that the above pictured yellow and black Merrell Barefoot shoe had a byline calling it the “ Trail Glove . ”
Should n’t it be the Trail Mitten ?
Just sayin’ !
Finally , I ’ll wrap this up with a hilarious advertisement by Vibram that graced the back cover of Footwear Plus and a question : what do you think about the Merrell Barefoot ?
Sound off in the comments !
The back of Footwear Plus magazine , Vibram has a special message “ to anyone thinking about infringing on any of our 200 + patents and trademarks . ”
( Perhaps they ’re referring to the fake Five Fingers producers ? )

CLEVELAND — Shocked Cleveland residents stared silently Thursday as workers tried for the 11th consecutive day to dismantle the massive black - and - white " We Are All Witnesses " LeBron James mural hanging from the downtown area 's Landmark Office Tower .
Advertisement
Friday morning , as was the case the previous morning and the morning before that , Clevelanders awoke to find the iconic , 10 - story - tall image of James — his arms fully extended after tossing his signature talcum powder into the air — completely intact , dominating the city 's skyline as if it had never even been touched .
In the week since James ' announcement that he would join the Miami Heat , Cleveland city officials and citizens alike have attempted to tear down , shred , deface , and even burn the image from the wall only to find it back in place the next day .
Advertisement
No one has reported observing the mural 's reappearance .
" We ca n't escape it , " said 42 - year - old Clevelander Mark Hoffman , who along with 300 other local Cavaliers fans watched as the mural was ripped into thousands of pieces and buried under two tons of dirt in Riverside Cemetery Wednesday evening .
" The next morning it was there .
Just … there .
It 's always there .
Hovering over us like some sort of demon . "
Advertisement
" We are all witnesses , " a visibly traumatized Hoffman mumbled while swaying back and forth , his eyes engaged in a removed , distant stare .
" We are all witnesses .
We are all witnesses .
We are all witnesses . "
As the city becomes increasingly disturbed and agitated , sources confirmed that the banner 's sinister hold on the metropolis appears to be growing in strength .
The image , they say , somehow becomes clearer and more ominous each time it reappears , intensifying the utter hopelessness and betrayal citizens have felt ever since James held a nationally broadcast television special to announce that he was leaving his home state in search of an NBA title with the Heat .

The banner 's resilience has reportedly taken on almost supernatural properties :
On Tuesday city officials removed it panel by panel , only to find an identical mural hanging directly behind it .
On Wednesday , not only did the banner reappear after being loaded onto a chartered one - way flight to Siberia , but the LeBron James depicted in the new banner was wearing a Heat jersey and holding two NBA Championship trophies in his outstretched hands .
" I walked up to the banner with a ladder and a rented power sprayer and painted it over about halfway , " 36 - year - old Luke Denton said .
" I took a two - minute break to get some water , and when I looked up , the paint had disappeared .
As if I 'd never even done it . "

" And I could have sworn that LeBron 's face was staring right at me , " Denton added .
" He had this demented grin that I 'll never forget .
Why does he want to torture us ?
Why ? "
Though the hated billboard is said to typically reappear as James ' haunting likeness , some have seen other disturbing images .
Last Thursday when the mural was attached to four 1,000 - pound weights and forcibly sunk in the Cuyahoga River , commuters driving into the city reported seeing in its place a 10 - story - tall photograph of John Elway leading Denver to victory over the Browns in the 1987 AFC Championship game .
Others saw a still image of Michael Jordan jumping into the air and pumping his fist after his game - winning shot over Craig Ehlo .
Many pedestrians , meanwhile , reported seeing a 100 - foot banner of Earnest Byner 's 1988 fumble on the three - yard line .

An attempt to demolish the building altogether proved futile , as it was mysteriously replaced the following day by the completely new 15 - story Art Modell Public Library .
" I would like to assure the citizens of Cleveland that we are doing everything in our power to rid our city of the LeBron James mural , " Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson said Thursday , adding that a priest from Bulgaria would be brought to the city next week to exorcise the banner .
" That being said , if you gouge your eyes out like I did , you can't see the image . "
Advertisement
" However , " Jackson continued , " on the very threshold of audibility , you can still hear LeBron 's voice repeating , ' This fall , I am going to take my talents to South Beach . ' "
As of press time , nobody outside the Cleveland area had seen the mural once since it was originally taken down last Sunday .
Scientists have filmed and studied the gaits of three - legged dogs , in a bid to develop robot - building strategies .
The researchers want to find out how the dogs compensate for the loss of a limb .
They hope ultimately to develop robots that could compensate similarly .
The scientists filmed the dogs from several angles with high speed cameras as they ran on treadmills .
They presented their research at the Society for Experimental Biology Annual Meeting in Prague , Czech Republic .
In the study , dogs that had already lost either a fore - limb or a hind - limb through an accident or injury ran on a treadmill for two minutes .
The researchers filmed the dogs with a set of 10 high - speed infrared cameras .
They also placed several reflective markers on the dogs ' skin , which allowed them to trace the movements of different parts of the animals ' bodies .
Image caption
The researchers produced a trace of the dogs ' movement
Martin Gross from the University of Jena in Germany led the study , which is part of an EU project called Locomorph .
" At the end of the project we will hopefully have some robots that will be very efficient in unknown environments , " he told BBC News .
" Because maybe something could happen to the robots whereby they could lose a limb . "
Dr Gross said that his brother 's three - legged pet inspired him to use the dogs in his biomechanics research .
" The one with only three legs is still the fastest of all his dogs , " he said .
The dogs found adjusting to missing a fore - limb more difficult than missing a hind - limb .
The scientists say that this is because more of the animal 's body weight is born by the fore - limbs .
Dr Gross and his team have already developed some small , quadrupedal robots , and this study - to develop ways for their robots to manage if they are " injured " - will continue for the next two years .
Image caption Student anarchist to Tory MP ... a natural progression ?
A study is being used to support the theory many educated , middle - aged left - wingers are in fact conservatives who can't admit it .
Is this true ?
It is the cynic 's perennial view of youthful idealism : that each student radical will turn sharply to the right once the pay cheques start coming in and the mortgage needs to be paid .
By virtue of this stereotype , we might imagine rabble - rousing undergraduate Rik from 1980s sitcom The Young Ones by now having transmogrified into Tory MP Alan B'stard - an easy enough exercise , given that both men were played by the same actor .
But an academic study has been seized on by centre - right commentators as evidence that this is more than just a cliche .
Champagne socialists
Dr James Rockey , of Leicester University , analysed the stated values of 136,000 people in a survey carried out in 48 countries , and found that the well - educated were most likely to misplace themselves on the political spectrum .
They have this vision of their younger selves wagging their finger Toby Young , Journalist
A tendency was observed among this group to identify as left - wing , and vote accordingly , despite holding views on wealth distribution that placed them further to the right , Dr Rockey reported .
In his paper , Dr Rockey suggested that this was due to the fact that " people compare themselves not to the population as a whole but to the people they know " and that " political preferences change over time " .
The Daily Telegraph pounced on these findings , proclaiming them as evidence that " many middle - aged ' champagne socialists ' fail to notice their views shifting " and have become , despite their left - wing university days , right - wingers who cannot bring themselves to acknowledge the fact .
The newspaper 's editorial stated that the research proves " the facts of life are , as Margaret Thatcher had it , conservative " , and that those who do not face up to this are simply displaying an inversion of the Marxist theory of false consciousness .
Conservative ' coming out '
The journalist Toby Young - who , in his own words , " came out " as a Conservative voter for the first time ahead of the 2010 general election - thinks the Telegraph has a point .
What it comes down to is that right - wingers do n't understand us ... they do n't get why we would still want to make the world a better place when we 're better off John O'Farrell , Author
He believes that prime minister David Cameron has been largely successful in " decontaminating " the Tory brand - falling short only among the intelligentsia , who from their university days belonged to social circles that automatically viewed right - wing ideas with contempt .
" As students , most people will have been on the left , " he believes .
" With the onset of wisdom , they become more realistic and realise the utopian dreams they had when they were young were impractical .
But they have this vision of their younger selves wagging their finger . "
However , the writer and long - standing Labour activist John O'Farrell argues that the Leicester study is far from comprehensive enough to back up the thesis .
He admits that his younger self might be dismayed that he now subscribes to Sky TV , and bemoans Guardian journalists who educate their children privately .
Better off ?
But he insists that with age comes experience - and the wherewithal to translate egalitarian principles into practical action .
" What this comes down to is that right - wingers do n't understand us , " he says .
" They can see why we 're on the left when we 're students , but they do n't get why we would still want to make the world a better place when we 're older and better off .
Yes , I live in a nice house now - but does that mean I 'm meant to ignore my mum and all the people I grew up with in Barking ?
Billy Bragg , Song - writer / activist
" But when I was young I used to go on demos , chanting ' Maggie , Maggie , Maggie , out , out , out . '
Now I 'm chairman of the governors of an inner-city comprehensive - and I think I 'm doing far more to turn my values into reality . "
The left - wing singer - songwriter Billy Bragg agrees , citing the veteran socialist Tony Benn - who started out as a moderate and grew more radical with age - as an example he would like to emulate .
" When you become a father , you realise that everyone is someone 's child .
As you get older , you worry about who is going to pay for your pension , " he says .
" It seems that the logic of organised compassion makes more sense to me than ever .
" Yes , I live in a nice house now .
But does that mean I 'm meant to ignore my mum and all the people I grew up with in Barking ?
That would be the most hypocritical thing of all . "
Left and right may always find themselves set in opposition .
But if each side fails to appreciate what motivates the other , the prospect of achieving any kind of consensus seems remote .

SAN ANTONIO , Texas – Some 30,000 participants turned out for the National Council of La Raza ( NCLR ) annual conference here last weekend , where a major theme was the struggle to overturn Arizona ’s anti-immigrant SB 1070 law .
The four - day event was open to the public .
The NCLR gives voice to Latino interests , needs and culture , and was a big opportunity for the two Texas gubernatorial candidates to try to win Latino support .
Advertisers spent money to reach the Latino community , which is approximately half the population here .
A major workshop called “ What ’s the Matter with Arizona ? ” drew over 500 people .
Daniel Ortega , who is leading the legal fight for NCLR , explained the Arizona law in clear detail .
Its provision forcing police to act as immigration agents was denounced .
Even the Arizona organization of police chiefs opposes it .
Ortega said that stopping someone who looks “ suspicious ” ( wearing the wrong kind of shoes ? ) is outside the calling of local police .
Here in San Antonio , Police Chief William McManus has also spoken against this new role , saying it will harm police officers ’ relationships in the Latino community .
Police also complain the law allows the public to sue officers for “ not doing their job . ”
Arizonans who might want to give safe harbor , food and water to undocumented workers could be arrested .
Panelists and NCLR President Janet Murguia passionately spoke about the work of NCLR on different fronts , including legal action in defense of immigrant rights .
On July 22 , there will be a hearing to get an injunction that would stop the law from going into effect on July 29 .
Murguia stressed unity with other groups .
Emphasizing Latinos ’ enormous economic impact , she called for “ flexing our economic muscle using boycotts . ”
The panel stressed calling , writing and texting Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig to stop the 2011 All Star game from being held in Phoenix .
A workshop attended by over 200 youth emphasized that the effect of the law has already been felt .
The majority of them expressed fear of going outside .
Over half said they had already been stopped , sometimes repeatedly , and by the same police officer .
Addressing the convention , Mary Henry , president of the Service Employees Union ( SEIU ) , spoke strongly against the Arizona law , the detaining of people and orphaning of millions of children .
At a spirited “ Wise Latina ” luncheon attended by about 1,000 people , Murguia energized the crowd by exploding in anger at members of Congress and candidates who try to out - do each other in bashing immigrants for political gain .
“ Not one Republican has expressed concern for our civil rights , and they have stood in the way of comprehensive immigration reform , ” she charged .
Texas state Rep . Trey Martinez Fischer spoke of the building of the Texas State Legislature ’s Mexican American Caucus , now up to 40 members .
So far , it has prevented all proposed anti-immigration bills from getting out of committee .
Henry Cisneros , former San Antonio mayor and Clinton administration housing secretary , well known and loved in Texas , said Arizona has gone over the line .
He was given a standing ovation .
Republican Gov. Rick Perry spoke on the first day .
He disappointed most of the crowd , who were interested in a more humane immigration law .
Perry stressed militarization of the border .
Opposing Perry , Democratic candidate Bill
White drew cheers by emphasizing that , if he becomes governor , he will absolutely veto any copycat of Arizona ’s law .
On the last day , the main speaker was Maj. Gen. Angela Salinas .
She was the first Hispanic woman to become a Marine Corps general .
She was honored along with Latinos who have given their lives to defend the country .
It was made clear that an inordinately higher percentage of Latino soldiers have died and been injured in the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .

The Windsor man was pushed along the tram tracks after he was struck on the corner of Williams and Dandenong roads in St Kilda East just before 1 pm .
Paramedics say he was lucky to escape with only bruising to his leg and a sore knee in an accident that has put the spotlight on the divisive issue .
Stumbled across this cute little muscle girl from Aeverotica and thought I ’d make up a small gallery to quench your drooling lust .
No idea who she is but she does remind me somewhat of a young Summer Kalish a bit .
Matrix found another picture gallery of her .. man oh man wadda muscle minx she is .. good find Matrix !
Using that gallery I found her model page where we learn her name is Tania and is 23 years old ( could of fooled me ) from Russia .
They tell us “ Tania works as a fitness trainer in sport club .
She like bodybuilding and works on improving her body . ”
Found two more galleries :

Hodgson was Switzerland manager at the World Cup finals in 1994
Fulham manager Roy Hodgson is part of the BBC Sport team in Cape Town for the 2010 World Cup .
The former Inter Milan boss has been in charge of 15 teams during his 34 - year managerial career , including Switzerland and Finland at international level .
He steered the Swiss to the last 16 of the 1994 World Cup in the United States .
Hodgson , 62 , took Fulham to the final of the Europa League last season and was named manager of the year by the League Managers Association .
He took time out from the studio to answer some of your questions on the World Cup sent in via Twitter
Why do you think some of the bigger teams are underperforming so far ?
karlhysteria
Two reasons .
There is always a nervous start to tournaments because it is always difficult to push aside the fear of failure and the worry that it is not going to go your way .
You build up to them for such a long time so that sometimes in that couple of games you do not necessarily show the best of yourself , either as an individual or as a team .
606 : DEBATE
The second factor is that maybe we have underestimated the level of organisation - and the level of difficulty - that the bigger teams are being caused by teams defending well and limiting their time and space .
Of course , it does not matter what team you are playing against if they are capable of getting six , seven or eight players behind the ball all the time because by the time you get somewhere near their penalty area , there is not going to be a lot of space for you to play the ball into .
And , on top of that , we are talking about A ) a lively ball and B ) lively pitches , so nothing really has combined so far to help the forwards at this World Cup .
Most of what has gone on has helped the defenders here so far , which is obviously going to help the sides that have done more defending .
Hodgson says he would love to sign Argentina star Messi Roy , if you had the money of Roberto Mancini and Manchester City , who from this World Cup would you sign ?
blueinyorkshire I would sign Lionel Messi .
I do not think you would win too many prizes for guessing that though !
How much bearing would performance at a World Cup have on your decision to sign a player ?
davidlbevan
I do not think World Cups are great places to sign players from because World Cup football is often very different from the type of football played in the league that you are looking for players to play in .
Of course it is a great showpiece for players and , as a manager , I am always looking at players and trying to assess their qualities .
But hopefully if I was watching someone here I would be , if you like , confirming a decision I had made from watching them in their league matches rather than suddenly deciding that player X is a wonder player on the back of one or two games at a World Cup .
So it is a good question and not one that I can answer " I never would " or " I always would " .
I would just hope that I had done enough research by the time the World Cup came around so I only had to be convinced one way or the other .
Are there any players that you are tracking at this World Cup and is there anyone you have been particularly impressed with so far ?
wigmanreturns
There have been a lot of players that I am impressed with - a lot of players I do not know that well .
But I have not come here in particular to track players , I have come here to work for the BBC and most of the player tracking that I have been been doing , I have been doing over a long period of time .
It would take me too long to name every individual player who has impressed me here but I suppose I am more impressed in some ways by teams .
I have been very surprised by the level of organisation of many of the teams from whom maybe we did not expect a great deal before the World Cup .
We have seen a lot from them too , like the North Koreans against Brazil , Switzerland 's win over Spain and the Serbians beating the Germans .
Of course , in each of those games , several top players have sprung to my attention .
Banks saves from Pele at the World Cup finals in 1970 Apart from England winning the World cup in 1966 , what is your favourite World Cup moment ?
nickdegaris
Well , yes , England winning the World Cup is very special but , after that , it would be that magnificent group game four years later in Mexico at the 1970 World Cup , when England played Brazil in a very , very exciting match .
We saw that magnificent piece of play that culminated in Gordon Banks making that save , which has gone down as probably the greatest save in history .
That was a great moment and there was another in the World Cup final that year - the goals that the Brazilians scored by carving holes in what was a man - to - man Italy defence were amazing .
I have a lot of good memories from that tournament but my favourite memory of all is from 1994 when I was manager of Switzerland and we beat Romania 4 - 1 in our group game in Detroit .
What 's your take on the Jabulani ball ?
Should players be able to cope or have things gone too far in trying to change the game ?
ramone78
For a number of years now we have had good footballs and people have got used to them .
There is not usually a vast difference in playing with the different makes of ball either .
I do not know why it is necessary , apart from the obvious commercial reasons , to have a new football for the World Cup .
I do not know why there is a need to constantly tinker with them , make them lighter or change the material .
As a football man and a football coach , I am not interested in the commercial aspect of the change .
I am more interested in the technical aspect and there is no doubt that this football has not assisted the technical development of players during this tournament - if anything it has detracted from it .
Will they get used to it ?
It is light and it moves a lot so whether you get used to it or not it is still a lighter ball .
Maybe players will in some ways start to adjust their technique and the teams that go further in the tournament will no doubt become more comfortable with it but it would have been nice if we had n't been always wasting our time to some extent talking about the ball when we should really be talking about the game .
Fulham 's Dempsey after his equaliser for the US against England What did you make of Clint Dempsey 's goal for the United States against England ?
Were you proud of him as a Fulham player or are you going to have words with him when he 's back at Craven Cottage ?
sparticus
Of course I was pleased for Clint .
His job is to do well for his team and , although he plays in England and is used to playing against English players , he cannot be expected to dilute his performances against England because he is earning his living in that country .
He was playing for the US and England were an opponent - his job was to damage the opponent and he did it very well .
We have to congratulate him on that .
Roy Hodgson was speaking to BBC Sport 's Chris Bevan .

Stem - cell transplant passes safety trial .
HIV ( pictured ) can find it hard to invade stem cells whose defences are bolstered by gene therapy .

A combination gene therapy that endows human stem cells with three ways to resist HIV has passed its first safety test in humans .
Four patients with AIDS who were infused with these cells tolerated the treatment , and the cells produced their anti-HIV weapons for up to two years .
The study is published today in Science Translational Medicine1 .
Not enough cells were transplanted in the trial to cure the patients or even reduce their viral load .
But researchers hope that after further clinical trials , combination gene therapy may replace or complement anti-retroviral drugs as a way to treat people living with HIV .
The trial piggybacked on a standard treatment , in which individuals with AIDS receive transplants of their own previously saved blood stem cells , in an attempt to prevent the development of lymphoma ( blood cancer ) .
In addition to normal blood stem cells , the patients were also given cells into which three types of RNA - based gene therapies were carried by a lentivirus .
Last year , a different research group reported on a later - stage trial in which an RNA enzyme targeting HIV was delivered to 38 HIV patients using their own blood stem cells .
While the treatment was somewhat effective , it did not reduce viral load to a statistically significant degree — perhaps because levels of the therapeutic gene in the blood dropped considerably during the course of the 100 - week trial2 .
In another study published last year , however , German physicians found that an HIV patient who also had leukaemia was seemingly cured of both diseases by a stem - cell transplant3 .
The cells came from a donor who had a protective deletion in a gene that gave him natural resistance to HIV ( see ' Stem cell transplant wipes out HIV ' ) .
In the current trial , the researchers engineered a combination of genetic resistance into stem cells , aiming to replace an immune system susceptible to HIV with one able to resist the virus 's attack1 .
Three - pronged attack
First , to stop HIV from penetrating the host cells , the researchers gave the cells an RNA enzyme that would cleave the message that codes for a protein called CCR5 , preventing HIV from using the protein as a co-receptor to enter the cell .
" We know from a lot of populations that this is a great target — it can downregulate [ HIV levels ] by 90 % , " says John Rossi , a molecular biologist at the Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope in Duarte , California , who worked on the trial .
But interfering with CCR5 is not foolproof , because HIV can evolve other ways of penetrating the cell .
" If somehow the virus should get into these cells , " Rossi explains , " then we have the cells armed with two different approaches " to fight back .
So the researchers used a second mode of attack , and inserted a decoy RNA that interferes with a viral protein called tat , which is important for replication .
Third , they used a technique called RNA interference ( RNAi ) , in which they deployed a short sequence of RNA to degrade the message coding for that same viral protein and one of its partners in crime .
Such different mechanisms will make it harder for viral resistance to develop , Rossi notes .
In three of the four patients , the blood stem cells continued to produce these RNAs 18 – 24 months after they had received the transplant .
The patients also showed no adverse reactions to the vector — a long - standing concern with gene therapy .
Early promise
" It 's a small study , but it 's a step in the right direction , " says Pablo Tebas , a clinical researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia who works on gene therapy and vaccines for HIV .
" The most promising thing is that it shows you can modify stem cells in a way that makes them [ HIV -] resistant , and the progeny of those cells would still be resistant to HIV and would still be functional . "
Tebas 's group , in collaboration with Sangamo , a biotechnology company based in Richmond , California , is conducting a trial with a therapy that aims to delete the CCR5 protein in cells .
To make sure that the therapy was safe — and that patients received enough non-engineered cells to treat their lymphoma —
Rossi says that the researchers could only include a small proportion of engineered cells in the transplanted mix .
That was not enough to reduce the patients ' viral load .
But the team did see promising hints that the number of engineered cells increased when levels of virus in the blood went up , suggesting that these cells are selected for at the crucial time .

" That is the stage [ at which ] you should reach a level of transduction where you get an increase in the number of transduced cells in the face of infection , " says Premlata Shankar , an HIV vaccine researcher who works with RNAi at Texas Tech University Health Science Center in El Paso .
" I do n't think we are there yet . "
" What we really want to do now is increase the percentage of gene - modified cells in the patient , " says Rossi .
He and his colleagues are planning a new trial , in collaboration with Benitech , a biotech company based in Melbourne , Australia , in which they will be able to take cell samples containing a larger number of a patient 's blood stem cells and transplant only engineered cells , without diluting their effects by also transplanting natural ones .

This fragment of a lower arm bone represents just one piece of the second partial skeleton of science 's best - known early human ancestor .
It 's 400,000 years older than the famed hominid " Lucy , " which is the same species , and it 's male .
The discovery of a new hominid skeleton in Ethiopia shows that the human ancestor represented by the famed " Lucy " walked on two legs rather than moving like a knuckle dragger , researchers say .
Anthropologists have long debated whether the short - statured female Lucy typically walked upright or not .
She had represented the only known skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis , and would have stood at a height of 3.5 feet ( about a meter ) some 3.2 million years ago .
But the second partial skeleton , named " Kadanuumuu " ( " big man " in the Afar language ) , has both the shoulders and long legs that compare well to modern humans , according to Yohannes Haile - Selassie , curator and head of physical anthropology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in Ohio .
" It 's only the second partial skeleton of A. afarensis to be recovered ; it 's 400,000 years older than Lucy and it's male , " Haile - Selassie said .
" But just as important , the fossil remains provide conclusive proof that A. afarensis could walk upright freely without the use of its hands . "
Kadanuumuu lived even earlier than Lucy around 3.6 million years ago , but would have towered over the smaller female at a height of 5 to 5.5 feet ( 1.5 to 1.7 m ) tall .
His legs and arms look proportionally similar to that of modern humans .
The new skeleton contains most of the parts found in Lucy , along with previously unknown pieces , such as much of the rib cage and a nearly complete adult shoulder blade .
" Kadanuumuu 's shoulder was also a major discovery , " Haile - Selassie noted .
" It shows that our ancestor 's shoulder blade and rib cage were much more similar to those of modern humans than previously had been thought . "
The older , bigger brother to Lucy appears to match well with fossilized footprints that also date back to 3.6 million years ago in Laetoli , Tanzania .
That eastern African site shows that early human ancestors regularly walked upright , without knuckle - dragging impressions or unusually spread toes .
Renowned Ethiopian fossil hunter Alemayehu Asfaw found the first part of Kadanuumuu in February 2005 at Korsi Dora , about 210 miles ( nearly 340 kilometers ) northeast of the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa .
Later excavations by an international team between 2005 and 2008 turned up an upper arm , collarbone , neck bones , ribs , pelvis , sacrum , a thighbone , a shinbone and the shoulder blade .
The discoveries came as part of the Woranso - Mille Project that has been ongoing since 2004 .
Researchers published their early findings in this week 's issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , and hope to continue revealing more about the skeleton officially designated KSD - VP - 1/1 .

When it comes to renewable energy , we hear plenty about the latest developments in solar and wind .
But what about the latest developments in kinetic energy ?
Kinetic energy is created through movement — like walking or running .
It can be applied on a small scale , using the vibrations you create when you go hiking to power a cell phone or MP3 player .
On a larger scale , it has the potential to take vibrations created by waves as they move through water and turn them into energy that powers homes and businesses .
Kinetic energy is at the heart of a new clean energy business in Cleveland , Ohio called Tremont Electric .
Tremont plans to move kinetic energy into the American mainstream — and create local clean energy manufacturing jobs in the process .
Tremont Electric was formed in 2007 by Aaron LeMieux .
He was inspired to research kinetic technology after hiking on the Appalachian Trail and being forced to stop , repeatedly , in small towns to re-charge his CD player .
After that experience , LeMieux began exploring whether he could develop a technology capable of transforming human - created kinetic energy into electrical energy that could power a hand - held device .
The result is the nPower PEG ( personal energy generator ) , which LeMieux ’s company , Tremont Electric , began selling the PEG in May .
The device is the size of a glasses case .
You can toss it into your backpack or briefcase and it will harvest the energy you generate as you walk .
The PEG would also be handy for first responders who find themselves in emergency rescue situations when power is n’t available .
Tremont Electric started out in LeMieux ’s kitchen , then moved to his basement , then to a storefront .
When it began offering the nPower PEG on pre-order , it received more than 2,000 requests within just a few months .
Now the company has nine full - time employees , and big plans for the future .
The company ’s goal is to move into a manufacturing facility in Tremont and hire some 200 workers within the next two years .
Tremont also has a strategy for creating additional job growth in its community by sourcing its parts from local suppliers .
“ More than 80 percent of our components are manufactured locally , so we ’re fueling the local economy , ” says Jessica Davis , Tremont Electric ’s director of PR and sustainability .
“ We use local spring and circuit board manufacturers .
The idea is to really grow Ohio and make us a capital of clean energy manufacturing . ”
Northeast Ohio , where Tremont is located , could certainly use the jobs .
According to Rebecca Bagley , president and CEO of the nonprofit economic development organization NorTech , the region ’s unemployment rate is hovering at 13 percent .
“ We ’re in a transition , ” says Bagley .
“ from an industrial economy where we were second in the world for headquarters of Fortune 500 companies , and now we ’re at a tipping point — a lot of our manufacturing base has gone elsewhere , so how do we move forward ? ”
Bagley and NorTech believe that clean energy could be the answer .
NorTech ’s analyses show that clean energy is one of just a few emerging economic sectors in northeast Ohio .
“ We think there ’s a significant opportunity , ” says Bagley .
“ We have more than 400 companies in our cluster , and we have strong energy institutions .
With advanced energy comes manufacturing jobs , and we have the capability to manufacture here in Ohio . ”
Ohio Third Frontier is a state program that provides funding for various stages of research , development and deployment of technologies in particular emerging industry sectors , including advanced and alternative energy .
Ohio voters recently reauthorized $ 700 million for Third Frontier .
Tremont has applied for a Third Frontier grant , not for its nPower PEG , but for its efforts to harvest the kinetic energy of waves .
Tremont has partnered with Ohio State University and the University of Akron to evaluate the potential of wave energy in the Great Lakes and to test whether Tremont ’s nPower technology could be used to capture that energy and send it back to the grid .
The project is still in the research and development phase , but Tremont founder LeMieux is confident that kinetic energy technology has a future .
“ nPower technology is scalable and provides a range of product opportunities from small , implantable bioelectrical generators , to human - motion powered generators , to large commercial - scale wave energy converters , ” says LeMieux .
“ nPower is not just a device - making technology , it is an industry - making technology . ”
Artificial antibodies made from plastic shown to work in living animals
( Nanowerk Spotlight )
Antibodies are certain types of protein that are found in blood or other bodily fluids and are used by the immune system to identify and neutralize potentially harmful foreign objects such as bacteria , viruses , and other microorganisms .
The ability of an antibody to recognize a specific target molecule depends on a small region of the antibody – the antigen - binding site – that responds only to a certain protein – the antigen – on the surface of the foreign object .
The antigen - binding site is extremely variable , allowing a vast number of antibodies with slightly different antigen - binding sites , to exist .
In order to facilitate nanotechnology applications in medicine and biology , scientists routinely are conjugating nanoparticles with biomacromolecular ligands .
A more direct approach , where its chemical composition determines a nanoparticle 's affinity to specific biomacromolecules , has not been explored a great deal yet .
Nevertheless , synthetic polymer nanoparticles capable of binding to specific biomacromolecules are of significant interest as substitutes for antibodies .
Such particles can be utilized as inexpensive and stable functional materials for medicine , drug targeting , separations , biosensors , diagnostics , and antidotes for toxins and viruses .
A U.S. - Japanese research team has now developed methods for synthesizing protein - sized polymer particles with a binding affinity and selectivity comparable to those of natural antibodies by combining molecular imprinting nanoparticle synthesis with a functional monomer optimization strategy .
In effect , they have created a plastic antibody , an artificial version of the real thing .
They have also demonstrated that it works in the bloodstream of a living animal .
As a result , we can now consider synthetic polymer nanoparticles , prepared by an abiotic process in the chemical laboratory , as alternatives to biological macromolecules .
Applications could include antidotes for toxins , protein purification and therapies that currently use antibodies .
" I believe the key finding of our recent work is that a synthetic polymer nanoparticle can function with antibody - like affinity and selectivity in a living organism to capture and neutralize a peptide toxin , " Kenneth J. Shea tells Nanowerk .
" Antibody - like affinity means the ability to bind a specific target molecule ( like a peptide or protein ) but have little affinity ( selectivity ) for other molecules ( the lock and key analogy ) . "
AFM images of the plastic antibodies ( Images : Dr. Shea , University of California , Irvine )
Shea , a professor of chemistry at the University of California , Irvine , together with Dr. Yu Hoshino and collaborators from the University of Shizuoka in Japan ( Naoto Oku's group ) , have published their findings in a recent edition of Journal of the American Chemical Society ( " Recognition , Neutralization , and Clearance of Target Peptides in the Bloodstream of Living Mice by Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanoparticles : A Plastic Antibody " ) .
Shea explains that his team and others have previously prepared synthetic polymers that can recognize and bind to another molecule .
However , the recognition often takes place under highly controlled laboratory conditions .
In order to function in a biological environment such as the blood stream , the recognition and binding by the synthetic nanoparticle must take place in the presence in a sea of competing molecules ( proteins , peptides , cells , etc. ) .
" The polymer nanoparticle must avoid being cleared by the natural filtering systems of the blood and must not trigger an immune responses " he says .
" All of these present formidable challenges for the design of a nanoparticle .
Our present work demonstrates that these challenges can be overcome . "
To fabricate their plastic antibodies , the team uses an approach called molecular imprinting , a process similar to leaving a footprint in wet concrete .
For these particular experiments , they chose melittin – the principal active component of bee venom and a well - studied biotoxin – as the target and imprint molecule .
They mixed it with a monomer solution and then started a chemical reaction that links these building blocks into long chains , and makes them solidify .
When the plastic particles hardened , the researchers leached the melittin out .
That left the polymer nanoparticles with tiny melittin - shaped craters , i.e. melittin - imprinted polymer nanoparticles .
The researchers tested the efficacy of their plastic antibodies in vivo on mice .
Mice were injected intravenously with a high dose of melittin and then intravenously with the synthesized polymer antibodies .
A control group that did not receive the antibody injection showed a 100 % mortality rate .
The group that received the plastic antibodies showed a significantly reduced mortality rate as well as a significant reduction in peritoneal inflammation caused by melittin .
The melittin - plastic antibody complexes were then cleared from the blood by the mononuclear phagocytic system in the liver .
" From our results we conclude that imprinted polymer nanoparticles efficiently capture the cytotoxic peptide melittin in the bloodstream , " says Shea .
" The strong and specific affinity of the imprinted nanoparticles enabled the rapid sequestration of the target peptide in the biological milieu . "
He points out that his team 's results establish for the first time that a simple , nonbiological synthetic nanoparticle with antibody - like affinity and selectivity can effectively function in the bloodstream of living animals .

The Dutch public broadcasting organization NPO has launched a trial project which will see it publish all recent video broadcasts via BitTorrent downloads and streams .
With the trial NPO wants to gauge the demand for BitTorrent downloads , and whether P2P technology can cut down distribution costs significantly .
With an ambitious trial , NPO is the first public broadcaster worldwide to make all its latest content available to stream or download via BitTorrent .
The goal of the trial is to assess the demand for downloadable content and whether it ’s possible to effectively reduce the bandwidth costs of the streaming platform currently in use .
The decision to use BitTorrent , the most efficient P2P protocol , was an easy one .
Through the current platform NPO streams are watched more than 13 million times per month .
With the BitTorrent - powered streams , users will offer their own bandwidth which means that streaming costs could go down drastically .
NPO has partnered on the project with the Dutch company Bitnomica , who use the Open Source Swarmplayer software developed at the Technical University of Delft , Netherlands .
Due to rights issues , viewers have to use a special player through which the files will be viewable for 10 days after the initial broadcast .
They can download the .tstream files with most of the regular BitTorrent clients , but the player seems to work best .
NPO ’s BitTorrent Library
Currently , only a few hundred recent videos are available , but a back - catalogue of tens of thousands could be added if the half - year trial turns out to be a success .
During the trial NPO aims to put as much fresh content on BitTorrent as possible , with daily updates of all the latest video broadcasts .
Although NPO is the first major TV broadcaster to widely adopt BitTorrent , there have been others who ’ve made videos available this way .
Norwegian public broadcasting organization ( NRK ) has previously set up its very own BitTorrent tracker to distribute several of their TV - shows , DRM free .
In Canada , public television broadcaster CBC used BitTorrent to distribute one of its TV - shows after they ran into distribution problems .
If successful , this trial could be a major breakthrough for BitTorrent - powered streaming as it might convince other parties to try it out and get a taste of the future of web - based video delivery .
In the UK the BBC has been eager to adopt BitTorrent as well .
They did a trial earlier this year but thus far rights issues have contributed in holding back a roll - out on a wider scale .
Harvey Pekar , who died on Monday , was unique in underground comics .
In a sea of artists like Robert Crumb who wrote and drew their own stuff , Harvey was a writer .
Just a writer who wrote about … well , himself .
Crumb illustrated his “ American Splendor ” comic along with many other artists who were happy to bring this man ’s amazing words to life .
Paul Giamatti portrayed Harvey in a film entitled American Splendor and he hit the nail on the head .
But the thing that I will always remember Harvey for is his appearances on David Letterman .
Here are some of those :

NEW YORK — The euro sank to the weakest point in more than four years against the dollar as a disappointing U.S. jobs report , combined with fears the euro - zone sovereign - debt crisis is spreading across the region , led investors to flee risky assets .
The common currency fell below $ 1.20 — the 10 - year average — and is on a course that could bring it to $ 1.18 , where it exited the first day of trading when the euro was introduced in 1999 .

Child marriage is forced marriage .
Sixty million girls around the world have been forced into marriage before the age of 18 , a number that grows by 25,000 child brides every day .
The consequences of this pervasive human rights violation are grim and , often , deadly .
Child brides have a diminished chance of completing their education , resulting in limited opportunities and income - earning potential later in life .
These girls also are twice as likely to be beaten or threatened with violence by their husbands than girls who marry later in life .
In addition , child marriage is usually accompanied by early child bearing , placing young girls at risk for complications during and after childbirth .
In fact , complications associated with pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death for girls ages 15 – 19 worldwide .
You can take action to help end this practice now !
Ask Congress to co-sponsor and help pass the International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act .
Editor 's note : Sharmeen Obaid - Chinoy is an award - winning documentary filmmaker and journalist who has been working in Pakistan and Afghanistan documenting the rise of the Taliban and other radical factions since 2001 .
She is working on a pilot project to counter radicalization in Pakistan and is writing her first book .
TED , a nonprofit organization devoted to " Ideas Worth Spreading , " hosts talks on many subjects and makes them available through its website .
( CNN ) --
The Taliban are running suicide schools inside Pakistan , preparing a generation of boys for atrocities against civilians .
In my documentary on the subject , " Children of the Taliban , " I came across the cases of many young men who were committed to giving up their lives for what they believed to be the glory of Islam .
Fifteen - year - old Zainullah blew himself up , killing six people .
Another boy , Sadiq , killed 22 and Masood killed 28 .
Since more than 60 percent of the population of Pakistan is under age 25 , it seems there will always be a steady supply of recruits waiting to create havoc in the country .
The Tehreek - i- Taliban and the various extremist organizations that have been allowed to fester across the country have now joined hands , increasing the reach of their network , sharing recruits , plans , training centers , materials and safe houses .
It was only a matter of time before this would happen , since the Pakistani government 's flawed policy of fighting " Bad Taliban " -- those who carry out attacks inside Pakistan -- and turning a blind eye to " Good Taliban " -- those who carry out attacks outside Pakistan -- was bound to come back and haunt them and it has .

Since 2003 , the number of suicide bombings has grown exponentially across Pakistan .
In 2009 , 78 attacks occurred across the country ; this year more than 29 attacks have taken place .
The Tehreek - i- Taliban is boasting that they have an army of suicide bombers waiting in the ranks to carry out more attacks at their command -- and I believe them .
This is no ragtag army fighting in the mountains of Khyber - Pakhtunkhwa , until recently called the Northwest Frontier Province .
These people have a vision , are well trained and their recruitment process is tried and tested .
In urban centers , the Taliban recruit from two fronts , Islamic madrassas and low - income neighborhoods .
They have a network of sympathizers who run radical Islamic schools , providing free education to the very poor .
Typically , older Taliban fighters or recruiters spend an evening at one of these schools , glorifying the front lines , showing students videos of their heroics , and talking to them about paradise and the afterlife .
The students they address have already been primed by years of brainwashing ; they have no access to entertainment , sports , books or even their family .
The madrassa is the only home they know , they are often beaten by their teachers , told to study the Koran for hours at a stretch in Arabic , a language alien to them .
They are frustrated and suddenly , they are provided with an opportunity to give their life up in the name of Islam and earn glory .
They are promised lakes of milk and honey and virgins in the afterlife .
The young boys I speak with say to me :
Why would I want to live in this world -- where they rely on charity , dry pieces of bread and water , where they are subjected to harsh treatment , when they can be free and be the envy of their colleagues in the afterlife .
They are only too eager to sign on the dotted line and join the ranks of the Taliban .
In the past few years , the Taliban have relied on other radical organizations , like Jaish-e Mohammad , Lashkar - e- Jhangvi and Harkat - ul - Mujahideen , to recruit young men from low - income neighborhoods in smaller urban centers .
These organizations have had a presence there for years ; first they recruited young men to fight in Afghanistan against the Soviets , then in Kashmir against the Indian Army .
The Taliban have just re-activated these lucrative networks .
Smaller urban centers tend to have high levels of unemployment and the youth have fewer outlets to expend their energy .
These radical organizations lure in young men from mosques after Friday sermons , from college campuses and through local neighborhood recruiters .
The young men who show slight interest are invited to selected safe houses where trained recruiters begin brainwashing them .
A young man I met in Karachi described the process to me , telling me that in the end he could not carry out the attacks , but that almost everyone he knew from his group was now working for the Taliban and their affiliates .
Once inside the safe house , the young men are provided literature , so - called proof , about the atrocities supposedly being committed by the government of Pakistan at the behest of the United States .
Then , lengthy discussions ensue about their future .
Will they ever have jobs , will they be able to provide for their families in this corrupt environment ?
Would they not want to be part of a process that changes the country and brings accountability ?
They are promised money , their families are promised compensation and the radical organizations then begin the next phase -- training .
A number of young men who had gone through this ideological brainwashing period told me that training to be a bomber was their best option to get out of poverty .
They said that they believe in the cause , because these people understood their needs , and provided them with opportunities , while the rest of society shunned them .
Weeks of brainwashing also convinced them that they are fighting an evil and are working toward creating a just ideal Islamic society .
There is very little deterrent to suicide bombings , especially in a Third World country like Pakistan .
Fighting the Taliban and the various radical organizations on the front lines is like adding a Band - Aid to a cut , it may stop the bleeding but unless you clean it with antiseptic , the germs stay and multiply .
The Pakistani government and its allies must overhaul their policies in Pakistan .
They must tackle the madrassa system of education head on and they must look to provide alternate avenues and employment for the youth .
Thousands of civilians have lost their lives to terrorist attacks inside Pakistan , and thousands more will -- because , unlike the Pakistani government , which has no coherent policy to deal with the radicals , the Taliban have one to deal with Pakistan and its citizens .

Skype , the voice / video / messaging service used by millions , has run into a little irony problem .
The mobile application interface Fring announced on Monday that Skype " is refusing to allow fring to restore connectivity " to the service , and has been " forced to stop its 4 years of Skype interconnectivity following threat of legal action . "
The news comes following Fring 's recent rollout of its two - way video calling capability over WiFi and 3G .
Reproachful comments accompanied Fring 's disclosure .
" Needless to say , we are very disappointed that Skype , who once championed the cause of openness is now trying to muzzle competition , even at the expense of its own users , " the company declared on its blog .
They are afraid
Fring offers mobile users software that aggregates a wide variety of instant messaging and conferencing apps , so that consumers do n't have to manage Skype , Yahoo , Twitter , and the like on a separate basis .
The dig at Skype refers to the fact that the company has famously called on the Federal Communications Commission to extend its Carterfone open device principle to wireless technology — requiring wireless carriers to offer access to any device or application that does n't hurt the network , as landline common carriers must .
And , of course , there was that huge to - do about AT&T not allowing Skype to transmit across the iPhone 's 3G network , which became quite a cause until AT&T reversed course .
So here 's Skype , supposed avatar of openness , closing down access to Fring .
" They are afraid of open mobile communication , " Fring 's blog post intemperately added .
" Cowards . "
But is that really the case ?
" I want to make one thing absolutely clear : this is untrue , " pushed back Skype 's Robert Miller several hours after the Fring broadside .
In breach
Fring was " using Skype software in a way it was n't designed to be used , " Miller insists .
And that put Fring " in breach " of Skype 's API Terms of Use and End User License Agreement .
Among other offenses ( to Skype ) , Fring just announced that it is " temporarily reducing support to third - party Skype " as a consequence of the huge boost in two - way video calling it is now handling .
" Fring 's mis-use of our software was increasingly damaging our brand and reputation with our customers , " Skype charges .
The withdrawal of support was " damaging our brand and disappointing our customers , who have high expectations of the Skype experience . "
There was is " no truth " to Fring 's blocking claims .
" Fring made the decision to remove Skype functionality on its own . "
Hopefully this can be resolved without anyone else getting called a coward .
We did wince a little at Skype 's assertion that Fring has been using Skype " in a way it was n't designed to be used . "
Two years ago Comcast deployed almost those same words in response to tests indicating that the ISP was blocking BitTorrent transmissions .
When BitTorrent is used " as designed to be used , " Comcast 's David Cohen insisted , it runs fine on the cable giant 's network .
To be fair , Skype is talking about third - party access to its own software here .
But remind us again who gets to decide how these apps should be used ?
Skype may well have a strong case .
We 'd like to see more details .
Drug policy should be based on science , not ideology .
Thank you for supporting the Vienna Declaration .

Thursday ( July 1 ) marked Canada ’s 143rd birthday .
2010 has been brimful for our juvenile nation , though we have not behaved well this year .
I am an extraordinarily proud Canadian , I believe that Canada can be great , but this July 1 , less that one week after the largest mass arrest in Canada , I was embarrassed .
Canada has accomplished many great feats in the past , many of which I share with people when I am traveling and think of when I sport our Maple Leaf .
A Canadian invented peacekeeping , we see health care as a human right , and in the past we have opened our doors and provided safe homes for refugees .
Canadian forces stood their ground in 1994 when one the most devastating genocides in human history swept through Rwanda , and in 2003 we clenched our jaw and told George W. Bush that we will have no part in his invasion of Iraq .
Fast forward to 2010 and we live in a much different country .
In 2004 - 2005 Canada ramped up production in the Athabasca oil sands , which became commonly known as the “ tar sands ” .
In 2006 , Canada cut funding to all women ’s groups that engage in advocacy .
Just a few months ago our minister of finance bragged , “ We are staying on course to having the lowest corporate income tax rate in the G7 by 2012 . "
To top off the emetic assault on Canada ’s working class , this weekend marks the debut of the HST — a consumer tax , which by all definitions is regressive , i.e. hurts poor people .
The bill for the Vancouver 2010 Olympics was nearly 50 percent greater than our entire annual Overseas Development Assistance .
Two weeks ago , I was in Toronto with Oxfam Canada for their national assembly and for the lead up to the G20 meetings .
On June 18 , I took part in a peaceful protest rallying against Canada ’s imposition of the “ Gag Rule ” which bars funding to groups in the third world which provide safe abortions .
( The Global Gag Rule prohibits U.S. family planning assistance to foreign nongovernmental organizations that provide abortion - related information or services , even if these services are legal in their own countries and are funded with their own money .
The rule prevents NGOs from even participating in public debates or speaking out on issues concerning abortion . )
Our rally featured a few hundred activists taking to the streets and participating in a rally .
We were met by dozens of police on bicycles who did not let us take one step on the road .
After participating in a Gaza solidarity march in Vancouver a few days earlier , I was shocked at how overbearing these police were .
The events that took place the following weekend , however , are the reason I was not wearing a Maple Leaf on my chest this Canada Day .
I was back on the West Coast for the Vancouver Peoples ’ Summit , so I was fortunately spared the baton and the substandard detention cells .
With Canada having spent $ 1 billion on security for the G20 summit , $ 12 million per hour , French prime minister Nicolas Sarkozy was quick to announce that he will do next year ’s G8 / G20 for one - tenth the cost .
Amidst so many recent cuts to social spending , a billion dollars on security is not only a slap in the face , but an indicator as to what kind of a society our government is looking to create .
A police state that makes no attempt to tackle the underlying causes of poverty and crime is not the type of Canada I want to be a part of .
To dig a little further into what exactly happened last weekend on the streets of Toronto , a few inconsistencies begin to emerge .
The mainstream media has been repeating the images of the “ black bloc ” protesters who lit two police cars on fire and broke several windows in the financial district of Toronto .
For those of you unfamiliar , black bloc protesting is a tactic ( not a group ) which entails wearing black clothing and balaclavas to hide your identity , often with violent intent .
It goes without saying that violent protest at the G8/ G20 is counter - productive and absolutely unacceptable .
Peaceful demonstrations on the other hand have been pivotal in turning the tides in the civil rights movements , women ’s emancipation , and in the ongoing struggle for universal human rights .
From the actions of the Toronto police during this monumental summit , the target was undoubtedly the peaceful activists .
With 20,000 police and a $ 1 - billion budget , it would seem that stopping the violence that was taking place should n’t have been too much of an issue .
This rings especially true when we consider the violence happened right in the middle of the financial district in downtown Toronto .
Joe Wenkoff , a photojournalist recounts his firsthand experience in a video posted on - line :
As the end of the protest reached Queen and Spadina at around three o’clock , somewhere between 75 and 100 black bloc members rallied .
They left the main protest and started quickly back down Queen Street heading east .
On the way they encountered two police cars , with the police in them , which they attacked — broke windows .
There were riot police at the intersections at each street that went south from Queen Street into the financial district , but they did not engage the protesters , they just watched them go smashing windows and spray painting .
From there they turned south on Bay Street and started into the financial district .
There were three police cars abandoned in the intersection and King and Bay .
The black bloc started smashing the police cars and set one of them on fire .
After around 15 minutes they walked north on Yonge Street smashing windows along the way .
There were no police to be seen anywhere .
The streets were full of people just doing normal things .
At 4:20 they reached College where they smashed more windows on their way back to Queen ’s Park .
They also smashed some windows at a police station .
When they arrived back at Queen ’s , they had all huddled in a circle to remove their black clothing and then after I lost track of them — they all blended into the crowd with the peaceful protesters .
After about half an hour , the riot police began moving into the protest zone in Queen ’s Park .
Another group of riot police came from behind Queen ’s Park and surrounded the protesters .
They squeezed the bystanders and protesters as they pushed us back , hitting us with batons .
They hit me in the back and my field producer in the hand , breaking his finger .
They were also pepper spraying the protesters at that time .
We knew we were going to follow the black bloc , so we wore helmets for protection .
But we ended up needing them for protection from police more so .
After only short reflection , it is very clear that police were not interested in stopping the violence .
From Joe ’s videos it is very clear that the riot police waited at the intersections and watched the protesters smash the police cars that were strangely abandoned in the middle of the road .
Nine hundred people were arrested , but consider the fact that the police allowed the black bloc to disperse into the crowd .
Having witnessed the police set up a week prior to the G20 summits and bearing witness to the security during the Olympic Games in Vancouver , I am outraged .
Outraged at a very strategic and political display of force that aims to subvert and discredit civil society .
This Canada Day I took the day to reflect on the fact that I cannot take for granted that my country respects the rule of law and values human rights .
In this situation of manufactured chaos and panic we forget that an active civil society strengthens democracy .
If you have taken the time to see past the 30 - second clip brought to your familiar media conglomerate and pieced together the puzzle , please speak up and lend your voice to the chorus that is calling for accountability for what happened June 26 on the streets of Toronto .
To quickly take action , join the Facebook group and sign the petition on Amnesty International ’s Web site demanding a public Inquiry into the Toronto G20 .

Within weeks of the disturbing discovery of 11 decomposing women at the home of convicted sex offender Anthony Sowell -- the suspected serial killer had inspired new statewide legislation .
A law , proposed by State Sen. Nina Turner , called for stepped - up registration and monitoring of sex offenders convicted of committing the most serious crimes .
At least four other proposed laws already were being considered to tweak aspects of Ohio 's sex offender registration and notification laws .
But many now question whether the piling on of laws -- which cost taxpayers millions of dollars each year -- make communities any safer , or just lull them into feeling so .
And they wonder whether real predators become lost in the swelling ranks of registering offenders .
Some in law enforcement , such as Cuyahoga County Sheriff Bob Reid , insist that registration and notification laws deter sex offenders .
Reid said they raise awareness and can help investigators solve new crimes committed by known offenders more swiftly .
Attorney General Richard Cordray said the registries , which have had consistent bipartisan political and popular support , have been a useful tool to help the public track where sex offenders reside .
Cordray said he understands why people use tragedies , such as the Sowell case , as springboards for lawmaking .

MORE ON SEX - OFFENDER LAWS
" People want to have the satisfaction of responding to things , " he said .
" There is always pressure to have Joe Smith 's Law or Becky Jones ' law to help make sense out of a tragedy . "
Is that a useful approach ?
" The answer is , sometimes , " Cordray said .
However , when it comes to sex crimes , recent long - range studies have concluded that the costly registration and monitoring laws do not reduce the number of new crimes or new victims .
A separate Plain Dealer analysis found many local sex offenders ignore residency restrictions or lie about where they are living .
And sex offenders on the registry convicted of new sex crimes during the time period reviewed most often did not re-offend near where they were registered as living .
Those types of revelations and concerns about the overall impact of sex offender laws have spurred a divergent coalition of sexual assault victim advocates , public defenders and local officials to call for Ohio to rethink its approach to the complicated issue .
" We think that these type of laws are well intended , but they are misguided and very limiting , " Cleveland Rape Crisis Center President and CEO Megan O'Bryan said .
O'Bryan said laws create a false sense of security for the public and concentrate a vast amount of resources and attention toward a small number of offenders -- the very few who are caught and prosecuted .
The concept also capitalizes on the fear of stranger attacks , when family members , friends or acquaintances commit most sex crimes .
" Just like the public needs to be educated about these issues , so do the lawmakers , " O'Bryan said .
Lawmakers need to support prevention , education and treatment for both victims and perpetrators of sexual assault , she said .
Policy driven by anger
It has been more than 15 years since vivid details of the rape and strangulation of a 7 - year - old New Jersey girl ignited a much - publicized national crusade to protect the public from sex offenders living among us .
Megan Kanka 's parent 's anguish turned to anger when they became aware that Megan 's killer -- a man who moved in 30 yards from their doorstep -- already had been convicted of sexually assaulting another child .
The emotion fueled a wave of state and federal legislation in the mid-1990s aimed at convicted sex offenders .
The laws were intended to make the public safer by forcing those convicted of sex crimes to register their addresses with local police and , in cases of serious or repeat offenders , to notify their neighbors .
At the time , many states and localities -- including Ohio -- already had laws on the books forcing certain sex criminals to register with the police .
Ohio's law , originally passed in 1963 , called for " habitual sex offenders " to register their addresses for a decade .
Those registries included fingerprints and photographs .
But the information was not public , and enforcement was haphazard .
And the cost and effectiveness of the sweeping laws were a secondary consideration .
Program costs become burden
A year ago , a federally funded study by the New Jersey Department of Corrections and Rutgers University examined the impact of " Megan 's Law " in the state .
The study found the registries and notification did not reduce the number of new offenses or new victims .
Numbers of reported sex offenses have dropped nationwide in recent years .
But that decline started before the laws were in place .
The researchers concluded that " given the lack of demonstrated effect of Megan 's law on sexual offenses , the growing costs may not be justifiable . "
They estimated the statewide cost in New Jersey to be at least $ 5.1 million a year .
Cuyahoga County Sheriff Reid , whose office is required to register , verify and publish where sex offenders live , said he could not say how much the department pays for the efforts .
But he said to comply with the laws , he has to pay salaries for deputies to register offenders , cars for them to drive and verify addresses , to update the office 's website identifying offenders , and postage for sending out notification .
The entire cost falls to the department .
SEX OFFENDER TIERS
The Adam Walsh Act and Ohio Senate Bill 10 organize sex offender classification into three Tiers .
The Tier a person is placed in is based solely on the offense they are convicted of ; a person 's likelihood to reoffend will no longer be considered .
A chart explains which offenses fall under each tier : Offesetiers.pdf
Registration and verification rules :
Tier I : registration duties last 15 years for adults , 10 years for juveniles ; in - person verification at the county sheriff 's office is required annually .
Tier II : registration duties last 25 years for adults , 20 years for juveniles ; in - person verification is required every 180 days .
Tier III : registration duties last a lifetime for adults and for juveniles ; in - person verification is required every 90 days .
Click here for a chart of which Ohio offenses fall into which Tier .
In 2008 , Ohio trumpeted its accomplishment of becoming the first state to comply with a sweeping set of federal laws that sought to standardize how sex offenders are categorized and registered across the country , called the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act .
Only two other states have complied with the federal mandate so far and some have declined to do so even though they stand to lose some federal funding .
Before 2008 , Ohio had a system that judged the risk of sex offenders to the community on a case - by - case basis , through psychological assessments and a hearing in front of a judge .
Now offenders are classified based solely on their offense .
The majority of offenders are in the " most - serious " category , which forces them into more rigorous registration for life .
The Ohio Supreme Court last week pushed slightly back on the Adam Walsh system in a decision that erased the retroactive nature of the law .
So thousands of sex offenders who were reclassified for crimes committed before 2008 will go back to their previous court - ordered sex offender classifications .
Those convicted of sex crimes in 2008 or after will register with the new system .
Some think the new , more stringent rules work .
Sue DeChant , an investigator with the Cuyahoga County Sex Crimes Unit , said they make sense because they are consistent -- all rapists are treated the same and subject to the same reporting requirements .
Others think slapping the same label on people based on their offense and not the likelihood to re-offend is a waste of resources .
" I think we took a huge step backward when we threw out our risk - based system and implemented this offense system , " said Amy Borror , spokeswoman for the state public defender 's office .
It makes more sense to center attention on offenders that mental health experts deemed most likely to commit new crimes , she said .
" The folks that are more likely to re-offend will now get lost in the masses , " she said .
Falling through the cracks
Anthony Sowell still awaits trial on charges that he killed the 11 women found in his home on Imperial Avenue and raped or attacked several others .
He has pleaded not guilty .
Sowell 's trial may answer some questions for the community .
But what it probably wo n't reveal is whether any specific laws would have prevented the tragedy .
Sowell was a registered sex offender from the time he stepped out of prison in 2005 , where he had been for attempted rape .
At the time , he was seen as a low risk to re-offend , and his neighbors were n't notified when he moved in .
Even when the law changed in 2008 and he was classified as a higher - risk offender , his neighbors still were n't notified because he had n't moved to a new address .
But sheriff 's deputies knocked on his door periodically , and he chatted them up as the women 's bodies were in his home and buried in his yard .
Deputies , in fact , paid a surprise visit to his home on the same day he is accused of raping one woman .
Cordray said he thinks law enforcement still needs more leeway in monitoring sex offenders considered the most serious , such as allowing officers to enter the offenders ' homes .
" Nobody went into the Sowell house because they did n't have the authority to , " Cordray said .
But will continuing to change the laws make a difference ?
" We just have to be realistic , " Borror said .
" We are never going to create a completely air - tight system .
I would just hope that at some point Ohio would be willing to pull back from this reactionary way of making sex offender policy and go about it in a more deliberate way . "

The cover for Sam Harris ‘ new book has just been revealed :
Nice .
Plain .
Powerful .
If this were a Christian book , we ’d see Harris ’ face right there on the cover …
In any case , it ’s better than the Christopher Hitchens yellow - themed books , I say .
The Moral Landscape will be published October 5th .
This will revolutionize tech support and business customer service on both ends of the call .
The customer seeing a live face will feel more accommodated and less like they 're talking to a robot ( which all too often is the case these days ) - that in itself would definitely ease my angst .
And the tech / cs can ask the person to switch to the back camera and see if their customer is actually performing the procedure being asked of them correctly .
Even in a non-computer field this would be incredibly useful .
So many people see facetime and its equivalent as a gimmick that most would n't need without thinking outside of dating / chat uses .
But when it comes to “ why , ” the answers are less clear .
The easy culprits — the allure of the Internet ( Facebook ! ) , the advent of new technologies ( dude , what ’s a card catalog ? ) , and the changing demographics of college campuses — do n’t appear to be driving the change , Babcock and Marks found .
What might be causing it , they suggest , is the growing power of students and professors ’ unwillingness to challenge them .
The research , accepted to be published in the Review of Economics and Statistics , has already sparked discussions in faculty lounges and classrooms across the country .
Some question whether college students ever could have studied 24 hours a week — roughly three and a half hours a night .
But even if you dispute the historical decline , there is still plenty of reason for concern over the state of 21st - century study practices .
In survey after survey since 2000 , college and high school students are alarmingly candid that they are simply not studying very much at all .
Some longtime professors have noted the trend , which rarely gets mentioned by college admissions officials when prospective students visit campus .
“ It ’s not just limited to bad schools , ” Babcock said .
“ We ’re seeing it at liberal arts colleges , doctoral research colleges , masters colleges .
Every different type , every different size .
It ’s just across the spectrum .
It ’s very robust .
This is just a huge change in every category . ”
SAT scores of the people enrolled there , the results are the same : Students of all ability levels are studying less .
The decline , Babcock and Marks found , infects students of all demographics .
No matter the student ’s major , gender , or race , no matter the size of the school or the quality of the
It is a fundamental part of college education : the idea that young people do n’t just learn from lectures , but on their own , holed up in the library with books and , perhaps , a trusty yellow highlighter .
But new research , conducted by two California economics professors , shows that over the past five decades , the number of hours that the average college student studies each week has been steadily dropping .
According to time - use surveys analyzed by professors Philip Babcock , at the University of California Santa Barbara , and Mindy Marks , at the University of California Riverside , the average student at a four - year college in 1961 studied about 24 hours a week .
Today ’s average student hits the books for just 14 hours .
They come with polished resumes and perfect SAT scores .
Their grades are often impeccable .
Some elite universities will deny thousands of high school seniors with 4.0 grade point averages in search of an elusive quality that one provost called “ intellectual vitality . ”
The perception is that today ’s over - achieving , college - driven kids have it — whatever it is .
They ’re not just groomed ; they ’re ready .
There ’s just one problem .
“ Are students just that much more efficient that more than 60 percent of students study less than 15 hours a week and still earn As and Bs ? ” Kinzie asked .
“ Or are we really preparing students for the world of work if they ’re able to get by spending that many hours studying and preparing for class ? ”
Once they get to college , the figure improves , but there are many students today who appear to be doing very little whatsoever .
In one CIRP survey subset last year , analyzing predominantly private institutions considered to be mid-level or high - achieving colleges , some 32 percent of college freshmen somehow managed to study less than six hours a week — not even an hour a day .
Seniors studied only slightly more , with nearly 28 percent studying less than six hours a week .
And other surveys of today ’s students report similarly alarming results .
The National Survey of Student Engagement found in 2009 that 62 percent of college students studied 15 hours a week or less — even as they took home primarily As and Bs on their report cards .
One problem is that they ’re arriving in college with increasingly troubled study habits .
According to survey data gathered by the Cooperative Institutional Research Program , or CIRP , the largest and longest - running study of higher education in the United States , incoming college freshmen have reported declining study habits for at least two decades .
By 2009 , nearly two - thirds of them failed to study even six hours a week while seniors in high school — a figure that has risen steadily since 1987 .
“ So if students are taking a full load of 15 credit hours , they should be studying for 30 hours , ” said Jillian Kinzie , the associate director of the National Survey of Student Engagement , a nonprofit at Indiana University .
“ Clearly , that ’s not happening . ”
Studying has long been considered a key part of a college student ’s growth , both as a means to an end — a deeper understanding of the subject matter — and as a valuable habit in its own right .
A person who can self - motivate to learn , academics argue , is not only more likely to be a productive worker , but more fulfilled citizen .
As a result , universities for decades have stated — sometimes officially — that for every hour students spend in class each week they are expected to be studying for two hours on their own .
Whatever the reason , one thing is clear :
The central bargain of a college education — that students have fairly light classloads because they ’re independent enough to be learning outside the classroom — can no longer be taken for granted .
And some institutions of higher learning have yet to grapple with , or even accept , the possibility that something dramatic has happened .
But one sign that studying still has value is that students themselves are concerned about it .
In a 2008 survey of more than 160,000 undergraduates enrolled in the University of California system , students were asked to list what interferes most with their academic success .
Some blamed family responsibilities , some blamed jobs .
The second most common obstacle to success , according to the students , was that they were depressed , stressed , or upset .
And then came the number one reason , agreed upon by 33 percent of students , who said they struggled with one particular problem “ frequently ” or “ all the time ” :
They simply did not know how to sit down and study .
Hours spent studying is not the end goal of an education , of course , nor the only way to determine if someone is learning or will land a job after college .
Marks herself points out that employers do n’t generally care about the content of job applicants ’ classes ; they ’re more interested in whether an applicant graduated , was able to meet deadlines , and work within a bureaucracy .
That ’s true , Babcock and Marks agree .
But according to their research , the greatest decline in student studying took place before computers swept through colleges : Between 1961 and 1981 , study times fell from 24.4 to 16.8 hours per week ( and then , ultimately , to 14 ) .
Nor do they believe student employment or changing demographics to be the root cause .
While they acknowledge that students are working more and campuses attract students who would n’t have bothered attending college a generation ago , the researchers point out that study times are dropping for everyone regardless of employment or personal characteristics .
“ A student does n’t need to retype a paper three times before handing it in , ” said Heather Rowan - Kenyon , an assistant professor of higher education at Boston College .
“ And a student today can sit on their bed and go to the library , instead of going to the library and going to the card catalog . ”
According to the skeptics of the findings , there is one other notable change : Today ’s students are working with more efficient tools when they do finally sit down to study .
They do n’t have to bang out a term paper on a typewriter ; nor do they need to wander the stacks at the library for hours , tracking down some dusty tome .
“ Much busier , ” Bravman said , describing the “ on - demand ” world that students work in today .
“ I was a student here from ’ 75 to ’ 79 .
I was reasonably engaged in things .
But I had so much free time compared to students today .
They do so many things — it ’s amazing . ”
John Bravman , vice provost for undergraduate education at Stanford University , said that what he worries about these days is not that students are lazy , but that they are too busy — busier than previous generations of Stanford students .
Critics say it ’s misleading to measure today ’s students by the number of hours they spend studying .
Students live very different lives than they once did .
They are more likely to hold down jobs while attending classes .
So what now ?
Given Babcock and Marks ’s findings , what should universities be doing to improve study habits ?
It ’s an answer that depends , first , on understanding why students are studying so little these days .
And on this point , there is little agreement .
One theory , offered by Babcock and Marks , suggests that the cause , or at least one of them , is a breakdown in the professor - student relationship .
Instead of a dynamic where a professor sets standards and students try to meet them , the more common scenario these days , they suggest , is one in which both sides hope to do as little as possible .
“ No one really has an incentive to make a demanding class , ” Marks said .
“ To make a tough assignment , you have to write it , grade it .
Kids come into office hours and want help on it .
If you make it too hard , they complain .
Other than the sheer love for knowledge and the desire to pass it on to the next generation , there is no incentive in the system to encourage effort . ”
The problem dates back to the 1960s , said Murray Sperber , a visiting professor in the graduate school of education at the University of California Berkeley .
Sperber , at the time , was a graduate student at Berkeley and was part of an upstart movement pushing for students to rate their professors .
The idea , Sperber said , was to give students a chance to express their opinions about their classes — a noble thought , but one that has backfired , according to many professors .
Course evaluations have created a sort of “ nonaggression pact , ” Sperber said , where professors — especially ones seeking tenure — go easy on the homework and students , in turn , give glowing course evaluations .
In response to these concerns over course evaluations — and the state of collegiate studying in general — some universities are making changes .
Some administrators in recent years have been putting less weight on course evaluations when making tenure decisions .
Professors are being told to give explicit tasks to students .
Just telling them to read these days is often considered “ too generic , too general of a request , ” said Kinzie .
And many professors today are using Internet - based systems , like Blackboard , where students are required to log on and write about the assigned reading for all of their classmates to see .
Dan Bernstein , director of the Center for Teaching Excellence at Kansas University , said such assignments can help ensure that students are reading and will come prepared for class .
But as the Babcock / Marks survey shows , universities are n’t coming close to meeting their own expectations for what should be happening on campus .
“ That , ” said Bernstein , “ is one of our dirty little secrets . ”
It ’s possible that college administrators simply do n’t know what ’s happening — or rather , not happening — in their dormitories , libraries , and classrooms .
The decline in study hours , according to the new research , has happened gradually over decades .
Perhaps , some professors argue , colleges simply do n’t know the extent of the problem — and perhaps a discussion of the new research will lead to positive changes .
But there is also a more troubling reason why the study habits of today ’s students remain a discussion held in private , or not at all .
“ If we let it be known that they ’re not doing their part , that they ’re not the students of yore , that makes everybody uncomfortable , ” said Bernstein , a professor of psychology who ’s been teaching for 35 years .
“ Our constituents — our stakeholders , as they call them — would be unhappy .
They like to prefer that we ’re doing our jobs well . ”

New Orleans , Louisiana ( CNN ) -- BP has put off crucial " integrity tests " on the new stacking cap on its ruptured Gulf oil well so it can review testing procedures , a review expected to take place through the night and into Wednesday .
The oil giant had expected the tests -- to check pressure in the well and determine if it can be sealed once and for all -- to get under way Tuesday afternoon .
But late Tuesday night , BP announced that additional analysis of the well testing procedure was needed .
The move following a meeting with Energy Secretary Steven Chu and his team of advisers .
A source informed about BP operations told CNN's John King that , " There were some potential complications that might cause a delay -- some bad , some in the better to be safe than sorry category . "
It had been hoped that the integrity tests would show whether an end is in sight to the environmental disaster that has been unfolding for the last 12 weeks .
But throughout the evening , cameras some 5,000 feet below the surface showed oil gushing from the well 's capping stack , indicating that valves had not been closed to begin the pressure tests .
The massive custom - designed cap , which has a better seal than the last cap placed on the well , is some 30 feet high and weighs 160,000 pounds .
It 's hoped that it might seal the well completely .
But if it 's unable to contain all the oil , some could be diverted through riser pipes to ships on the surface .
Under a worst - case scenario , however , tests might show there 's more damage to the well 's casing , meaning that capping the well would not stop the oil from flowing .
Retired Adm .
Thad Allen , who is leading the federal response to the oil disaster , says the well cap placement is part a " very complex , nuanced and broad - based response " to the rupture of the underwater well in April , an accident that killed 11 oil workers and caused worst environmental disaster in U.S. history .
When they do take place , the integrity tests will measure pressure inside the well and will last anywhere from six to 48 hours .
They will involve incrementally closing three valves on the new cap , a process that would allow BP to do its pressure measurements .
Higher pressure readings would mean the leak is being stopped , while lower pressure indications would mean oil is escaping from other parts of the well .
" In this exercise , high pressure is good , " Allen said .
" We are looking for somewhere between eight and nine thousand psi ( pounds per square inch ) inside the capping stack , which would indicate to us that the hydrocarbons are being forced up and the well bore 's being able to withstand that pressure . "
Allen was asked what he thought the odds were to the success of being able to shut the well with the new cap .
" I think we are very confident we can take control of this hydrocarbon stream and then slowly close all these valves and stop the emission of hydrocarbons .
What we can't tell is the current condition of the well bore below the sea floor and the implication of the pressure readings , " he said .
" That is in fact why we 're doing a well integrity test . "
The latest containment cap , while seeming to offer the best odds of success , was n't ready earlier .
In addition , BP has learned from previous , unsuccessful containment efforts , CNN's Ed Lavandera reported on " The Situation Room . "
Allen said that if low pressure readings persist for around a six - hour time frame , that could signal problems with the new cap
If it 's determined that the cap can't seal the well completely , and some crude must be sent to the surface , the oil - gathering ship , the Helix Producer , in now in place .
On Monday it joined the Q4000 , which was already active .
And more vessels are planned .
Allen said a four - vessel system that could recover 80,000 barrels a day could be ready by the end of the month .
Meanwhile , in another development Tuesday , the Obama administration sent BP and other responsible parties a fourth bill relating to the oil spill .
The new bill is for $ 99.7 million .
It comes on top of a total of $ 122.3 million in the first three bills .
The government says the parties are responsible for all costs associated with the spill , including stopping the leak , protecting the shoreline and long - term recovery efforts .
The money will help replenish a $ 1.5 billion federal trust fund established to pay for damages associated with oil spills .
Among those costs is skimming oil on the surface of the Gulf .
Allen said authorities are on pace to have around 1,000 skimmers available by the end of the month .
At this point , there are fewer than 600 .
Work also has been continuing on the ultimate solution to fixing the problem , drilling two relief wells .
But BP does n't expect the first relief well work to be completed until August .
Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil have spewed daily from BP 's breached well and Allen cautions that even if the engineering containment efforts work , there is still a lot to be done in a disaster that has affected the environment and the livelihoods of people from Louisiana to Florida .
" There 's still a significant amount of oil out there , and the oil recovery and the impacts of this oil will probably extend well into the fall in terms of oil coming ashore , tar balls , beach cleanup , and then we will be moving of course at that point of the natural resources damage assessment trying to understand the long - term environmental ecological impact of the event , " Allen said .
And the presidential commission tasked with investigating the Gulf oil gusher and making recommendations about the future of offshore drilling continued its public meetings Tuesday .
The National Oil Spill Commission has six months to determine what happened when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded April 20 -- and how to prevent something similar from ever happening again .
A new moratorium on deepwater drilling issued by the U.S. Interior Department Monday has already played a prominent role in the hearings .

Last night , Anne and I went to watch Roller Derby ( which does n't , by the rules of English grammar , need to be capitalized , but by the rules of capitalizing Things What Are Awesome does ) live for the very first time .
I used to watch it on TV when I was a kid , and grew out of it the same time I grew out of wrestling , for pretty much the same reasons , so each time my friend Burns , who is a referee at the Doll Factory , told me to come watch a derby , I always had something else to do .
About a week ago , Burns told us that he'd get us VIP tickets if we wanted to come out .
He promised us that we'd have a good time .
Anne and I have been looking for excuses to get out of goddamn fucking suburbia lately , so it seemed like a perfect opportunity to see something our friend loves , experience something new , and get out of goddamn fucking suburbia all at once .
We fought through horrible are - you - fucking - kidding - me - it 's - 7 pm - on - a- Saturday traffic ( we can't move away from Los Angeles soon enough ) and walked into the Doll Factory just before 7:30 .
I instantly fell in love with the scene : an incredibly diverse crowd of enthusiastic , interesting people mingled around The Doll Mall , a room off to one side of the main building where artists and vendors had all sorts of cool stuff for sale .
Skaters from both teams cruised around , talking to fans and each other , and the vibe was overwhelmingly positive .
We found Burns , found our seats , paid way too much for two Newcastles ( not the Dolls ' fault , apparently , but come on , vendors : $ 7 for one can of beer is bullshit ) and got ready for the derby to start .
Checking Twitter , I learned that the people sitting next to me were friends of @ Mickipedia , putting them one degree from me through a bunch of different friends , including Sean Bonner , who I 've concluded is the nexus of awesome in Los Angeles .
( Fun fact : About two weeks ago , I taunted Paul F. Tompkins during his hilarious #verifypft efforts that I 'd get reverified before he got verified .
I did n't think it would actually happen , but I sat next to @trammell who works for Twitter , and he was able to speed up my process .
I got reverified this morning .
Your move , @PFTompkins . )
Just before 8 , the derby started .
The Dolls ' fielded an all - star team called the After Shockers , while Arizona brought the Derby Dames .
The match was a blowout - LA won by something like 80 points - but it did n't seem to bother either team , because it was obvious that everyone was having a hell of a good time .
All the girls skated like they meant it , and I 'm pretty sure most of them are feeling it today , because they beat the shit out of each other for every point .
Unlike the televised stuff I watched in the late 70s and early 80s , this was not scripted or planned or faked or stupid , and by the end of the first quarter , the only thing I regretted about coming to the derby was waiting so long .
The entire experience was amazing , from beginning to end , and did I mention that the girls are incredibly sexy ?
Because holy shit , you guys .
Now that our kids are grown and becoming more independent , Anne and I finally have time for ourselves that we have n't had for over a decade .
In the absence of being full - time parents , we 're starting to miss all the art and culture that we used to experience before we moved out here for the schools .
We both feel like we 've been trapped in a Suburban world bounded by responsibility , yard work and the mall , and the only road out is so choked with traffic , taking it is an aggravating ordeal that 's barely worth the effort ... but I keep thinking about the quote from Ferris Bueller 's Day Off about life moving by pretty fast , and I 'm not quite ready to resign myself to missing it .
Going to the Roller Derby last night , and being around all the non-suburbanized people there felt foreign and familiar and inspiring , all at once .
It viscerally reminded me of all the things I 've been missing , and I can't wait to go back .
Seriously , guys , if you live anywhere near roller derby , it 's really worth making the effort to go and see it in person , at least once .
Unless , as I said on Twitter last night , you hate things that are awesome .

Ever since the release of Battlefield : Bad Company 2 , I 've spent a majority of my free time blowing up vehicles and getting shot to death .
Unfortunately , I 've also spent a majority of my free time cursing EA and Dice 's lack of quality control in their latest bug - filled mess .
A mere few minutes ago , I was forwarded an email from an anonymous tipster working at EA , and my heart nearly stopped once I read the title .
Let me present this incredible news to you in full .
From : David Goldfarb < XXXXX@dice.ce >
To : EA Dice Staff < XXXXX@dice.ce >
Subject : Woooo !
Patch 1.1 is ready to go LIVE !!!
Awesome news everybody !
We just got the big " thumbs up " from the guys at EA , and we 're ready to roll out PATCH 1.1 for the consoles !!!
Hell yeah !
Now I 'm well aware you guys have been working overtime to address all the difficulties our users have experienced trying to play Battlefield : Bad Company 2 online .
With that in mind , I 'd like to personally congratulate each and every one of you for successfully ignoring all complaints and issues raised by the BC2 community .
This act alone provided us with additional time to work on patching the hole in the drywall near the snack machine .
Once we finished that , we were able to concentrate on patching BC2 for the remainder of yesterday .
Just so we 're all on the same page , here 's the comprehensive list of bug fixes , changes , and new additions 1.1 will bring !
Battlefield : Bad Company 2 - Patch 1.1 DETAILS
1. BUG FIXES
Image caption A number of Lexus models are affected by the recall
Toyota is to recall 270,000 cars worldwide - including 138,000 vehicles in the US - because of an engine fault .
Toyota said the recall included seven luxury Lexus models - some of them in the UK - and the popular Toyota Crown .
The latest quality problem follows the recall of more than 8 m vehicles which had problems with sticking accelerator pedals earlier this year .
The company was fined $ 16 m ( £ 10.6 m ) in the United States for its slow response to the accelerator fault .
The company is still facing more than 200 lawsuits tied to accelerator accidents .

A spokeswoman for the firm said some vehicles might have a problem with the valve spring in their engines , which could cause the car to stall while being driven .
" Due to slight variations during the manufacturing process , some foreign material may have contaminated a small number of the valve springs , " the firm said in a statement .
" If a vehicle is affected , there is a remote possibility that abnormal engine noise or idling may occur .
In extremely rare instances , the engine may stop while the vehicle is in operation . "
The defective 4.6 - litre V8 and 3.5 - litre V6 engines had been installed in eight top - line models including some hybrids - the Lexus GS350 , GS450h , GS460 , IS350 , LS460 , LS600h and LS600hL as well as the Crown sedan .
No accidents had been reported , the spokeswoman said .
Some 90,000 of the affected cars were sold in Japan .
Another 180,000 on the roads elsewhere in the world will also be recalled .
Some 3,200 Lexus vehicles in the UK were involved , a spokesperson said , but no Toyotas .
" Lexus will do whatever it can to ensure that our customers ' inconvenience is minimised as much as possible , decide on the details of any action , and inform our customers promptly , " a company statement said .
Owners with concerns should contact their local dealer .
Car recalls are not uncommon in the car industry , with 227 in the UK alone last year , according to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency .

Image caption June has been the deadliest month for Nato forces so far
The Taliban in Afghanistan have told the BBC that there is no question of their entering into any kind of negotiations with Nato forces .
It comes after US commanders and the British army chief of staff , Gen David Richards , suggested that it might be useful to talk to the Taliban .
The Taliban statement is uncompromising , almost contemptuous .
They believe they are winning the war , and cannot see why they should help Nato by talking to them .
They assume , perhaps wrongly , that the Americans are in disarray after the sacking of the Nato commander Gen Stanley McChrystal last week , and regard any suggestion that they should enter negotiations with them as a sign of Nato 's own weakness .
June , they point out , has seen the highest number of Nato deaths in Afghanistan : 102 , an average of more than three a day .
' Differences '
Nowadays it is extremely hard for Westerners to meet Taliban leaders face to face , either in Afghanistan or in Pakistan .
Why should we talk if we have the upper hand , and the foreign troops are considering withdrawal , and there are differences in the ranks of our enemies ?
Zabiullah Mujahedd , Taliban spokesman New US chief briefs Nato allies
But a trusted intermediary conveyed a series of questions to Zabiullah Mujahid , the acknowledged spokesman for the Afghan Taliban leadership , and gave us his answers .
The text runs as follows :
" We do not want to talk to anyone - not to [ President Hamid ] Karzai , nor to any foreigners - till the foreign forces withdraw from Afghanistan .
" We are certain that we are winning .
Why should we talk if we have the upper hand , and the foreign troops are considering withdrawal , and there are differences in the ranks of our enemies ? "
This is propaganda , of course - yet many Afghans , even those who hate and fear the Taliban , are coming round to exactly the same view .
The Taliban are still deeply unpopular in many parts of the country .
Memories are still vivid of the brutal and extreme way they governed from 1996 to 2001 .
They , together with their supporters , certainly do not represent anything near a majority of the Afghan people .
' Instinctive dislike '
They are still predominantly a Pashtun faction , and when they were in power they caused much anger by imposing Pashtun cultural norms on the complex and varied peoples of Afghanistan .
Nevertheless , there is an instinctive and widespread dislike of having foreign troops , and especially non-Muslim ones , based in Afghanistan .
Image caption Many Afghans do not support the Taliban
People who do not support the Taliban know that the Nato - led force is preventing the Taliban from returning to power .
But the dislike of occupying forces goes very deep .
The key to the Taliban 's remarkable success in capturing Kabul from the more moderate mujahideen leadership in 1996 was their ability to convince dozens of uncommitted warlords that they were bound to win .
Many of these warlords were not themselves Pashtun , and often were not extreme Muslims .
They joined the Taliban simply to be on the winning side .
The Taliban have not forgotten this .
If they can convince people that they are beating the British and Americans , more and more local warlords will join their cause .
Petraeus ' challenge
The difficult job facing Gen Petraeus , who takes over control of the Nato forces in Afghanistan , will be to change this perception .
When he was in charge of coalition forces in Iraq he managed to change the widespread perception that the war there was unwinnable .
He presented the draw - down of US forces as a victory : they had , he said , done the job they had come to do , and succeeded .
Therefore they could leave Iraq as victors .
Image caption Gen Petraeus has warned of an escalation of violence
Cynics may point out that the number of deaths from terrorism in Iraq is still appallingly high , and that the fragile Iraqi government is struggling to do anything about it .
But since most American news organisations have pulled out of Baghdad , little news of what is happening in Iraq seeps through to the United States .
Gen Petraeus will no doubt try to replicate his remarkable Iraqi success in Afghanistan .
Yet it will be harder , and doubts about the value of the operation are already growing in every Nato country .
His main aim will be to reverse the growing belief in Afghanistan that the Americans , the British and the others will pull out soon , and leave the country to fight out its own war - with the Taliban the likely winners .
It is likely to be the hardest fight of his career .
Scientists have discovered the part of the brain that tracks the position of our limbs as we move through space .
When a mosquito lands on your hand , you can rapidly and effortlessly make a movement of the other hand to brush it away , even in darkness .
But performing this seemingly simple action involves a surprisingly complex coordination of different types of sensory information in order for your brain to construct a constantly updated ' map ' of the body in space .
Now , scientists from UCL ( University College London ) and Barcelona ( Pompeu Fabra University , ICREA and University of Barcelona ) have identified an area of the human brain called the parietal cortex that constructs this body model from the combination of tactile information from your skin ( for example , where the mosquito is on your hand ) with " proprioceptive " information about the position of your hand relative to your body .
In an experiment they found that impairing the parietal cortex , using a brief pulse of magnetic stimulation , significantly impaired volunteers ' judgements about the spatial relationship between their face and arms , but not their perception of touch or location alone .
The research is published in the journal Current Biology , and was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) .
Professor Patrick Haggard , UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience , who led the UCL team , said " Our brain constantly keeps track of the movements of the limbs , so that we always know the posture of our body , even with our eyes closed .
Our results show , for the first time , how the brain updates this ' body space ' .
" Our findings may be particularly relevant to children with developmental coordination disorder : these children have difficulty in coordinating their movements , but recent evidence suggests that one underlying problem is their poor sense of where their limbs are in space .
Our result identifies the specific part of the parietal cortex needed to construct this map of body space . "
In the experiment volunteers ' forearms were placed in a sling which could be raised and lowered .
Researchers then applied a brief tap at one of many locations on the forearm of volunteers , shortly followed by a brief tap at one of many locations on the face .
Participants were asked to judge if the location of the arm tap was above or below the face tap , a judgement that could only be done by combining information about the tap location on the skin , and about the position of the arm relative to the body .
Researchers then disrupted the activity of the posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) in the right hemisphere of the brain by delivering a brief pulse of magnetic stimulation after the arm tap and before the face tap .
The stimulation was delivered through a coil placed on the scalp just over the location of the posterior parietal cortex indicated on a brain scan taken of each participant .
The stimulation significantly impaired volunteers ' judgements about the spatial relation between the arm tap and the face tap .
Crucially , when the volunteers just judged arm position alone , or touch location alone , the same stimulation had no effect .
The scientists concluded that the posterior parietal cortex is the key brain area that combines touch and limb position , to produce a map of where the tap is in egocentric space .

Background :
The prevalence rate of Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) appears to be steadily increasing .
The latest report from the Center for Disease Control estimates the rate of ASD is 1 in 91 children ( Kogan , 2009 ) , up from 1 in 150 in 2007 .
Understanding the seeming changes in ASD prevalence require careful exploration of genetic and environmental factors .
A method that has proven useful in dissecting the etiology of complex diseases is the study of isolated populations .
One population isolate that has been studied extensively is the Amish , with well over 250 genetic studies .
Expanding studies of autism to the Amish may provide important information about etiology .
A crucial first step in this process is a feasibility study to determine ASD prevalence rates in this population .
Objectives :
This study presents preliminary data on the estimated prevalence of ASD among the Amish in two Amish dominant counties as part of a larger epidemiological study .
All children between ages 3 to 21 in those counties will be screened for the presence of an ASD .
Methods :
Screening occurred in Holmes County , Ohio and Elkhart - Lagrange County , Indiana , two of the largest Amish communities in the United States .
Trained clinicians ascertained door to door using a published Amish Directory as a guide .
Families were approached and asked to participate in a brief interview regarding their children .
Two primary screening instruments were used : the Social Communication Questionnaire ( SCQ ) and the DSM - IV - TR Checklist ( a tool created by the authors ) .
A Vaccination History and a brief family history including questions specific to the ASD phenotype were also taken .
Children screening positive on either the SCQ or DSM - IV - TR Checklist were seen for a more comprehensive clinical evaluation by two licensed psychologists .
This evaluation included the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule ( ADOS ) and Autism Diagnostic Interview ( ADI ) .
Results :
From September 2008 to October 2009 , 1899 Amish children were screened in the two Amish communities .
A total of 25 children screened positive for ASD on either the SCQ or the DSM - IV - TR checklist .
A total of 14 screened positive for ASD on both screeners .
Of those 25 children , 14 were evaluated and seven children were confirmed as having a diagnosis of ASD using the ADI and / or ADOS , and clinical judgment .
Interestingly , four of the seven only met ASD criteria on the ADOS but not the ADI .
Three of the four who were not diagnosed by the ADI only missed criteria on the Behavioral Domain , which may be attributable to the reporting style of Amish caregivers .
Conclusions :
Preliminary data have identified the presence of ASD in the Amish community at a rate of approximately 1 in 271 children using standard ASD screening and diagnostic tools although some modifications may be in order .
Further studies are underway to address the cultural norms and customs that may be playing a role in the reporting style of caregivers , as observed by the ADI .
Accurate determination of the ASD phenotype in the Amish is a first step in the design of genetic studies of ASD in this population .
A couple of years ago , I wrote about the collapse of decentralized / open decision making in Western societies .
Here 's a snippet from the article :
The 20th Century 's central struggle was between the ideological systems that advocated governmental control of the economy and those that relied on market control .
The market - based systems won .
Why ?
In short , market - based systems made better investments , over the long term , than government managed systems .
The lesson : systems with large numbers of decision makers , each with capital to invest , make better decisions .
As is often the case , the emerging victory of the market - based system created yet another problem / struggle .
Specifically : is it better to trust that individuals empowered with growing salaries / wages will make the best investments for future economic success -- or -- is it better to grow corporate profits ( at the expense of wages / salaries ) and let capital markets invest the excess ?
Between WW2 and 1974 , while still engaged in a bitter struggle with Communism , the US hedged its bets on that question .
Both individuals and the capital markets received an equal share of the benefits of productivity growth .
Incomes rose mightily and we became broadly wealthy , mirrored by generous growth in the capital markets , relative to the start of the century .
As a result of this shared decision - making system , smart investments in infrastructure , industry , education , and much more made America the economic powerhouse of the world .
In short , we prospered .
However , the shared decision making system ended .
From 1974 onwards , the rewards of productivity growth ( economic expansion ) went exclusively to the capital markets and not into income growth for individuals .
In short , this change led to economic ( and by extension political ) decision making to become extremely concentrated , and therefore precarious / unstable / stagnant .
At the time , I left open the precise " conventional " reason for why this happened .
Yves over at Naked Capitalism ( channeling Thomas Palley and Raghuram Rajan ) sums up a cogent rationale for why it happened .
She blames the economic theocracy at the Fed :
What led to the change in the deal was the stagflationary 1970 , which was driven both by a commodity prices ( most notably the oil crisis ) AND labor baragaining power ( workers were able to demand that wages keep pace with inflation , which when inflation got beyond a modest level , meant it started to become self - reinforcing ) .
So the new program was to reduce workers ’ bargaining power , both by combating unions , and by tolerating un and underemployment .
Rising worker wages had been seen as crucial to greater prosperity ; it was quietly abandoned as a policy goal .
But this has profound implications .
As rising income inequality demonstrates , the benefits of growth accrued substantially to those at the very top ...
Reducing worker bargaining power led to disinflation , lower interest rates led to rising asset prices , which in combination with financial innovation , created an until - recently reinforcing cycle whereby rising asset prices [ and the substitution of debt for income ] funded consumption .
If Mr. Hyde says “ block , ” the dog will stand perpendicularly in front of him to keep other people at a distance .
If he asks Mya to “ get his back , ” the dog will sit facing backward by his side .
The dogs are trained to jolt a soldier from a flashback , dial 911 on a phone and even sense a panic attack before it starts .
And , perhaps most important , the veterans ’ sense of responsibility , optimism and self - awareness is renewed by caring for the dogs .
The dogs help soldiers understand “ what ’s happening as it ’s happening , what to do about it , and then doing it , ” said Joan Esnayra , a geneticist whose research team has received $ 300,000 from the Defense Department to study the issue .
“ You can use your dog kind of like a mirror to reflect back your emotional tenor . ”
The dog is also often the first visible manifestation of a former soldier ’s disability .
Because people are curious about the animal , the veteran gets an opportunity to talk about his condition and his war experiences , discussions that can contribute to recovery .
More broadly , the dogs help increase public awareness of P.T.S.D. , which the Veterans Affairs Department said affects about one quarter of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with whom it has worked .

Under a bill written by Senator Al Franken , Democrat of Minnesota , veterans with P.T.S.D. will get service dogs as part of a pilot program run by the Department of Veterans Affairs .
Training a psychiatric service dog and pairing it with a client costs more than $ 20,000 .
The government already helps provide dogs to soldiers who lost their sight or were severely wounded in combat , but had never considered placing dogs for emotional damage .
But there is debate within the emergent field about the appropriate time to pair a veteran with a dog .
Sara Meisinger , the chief of occupational therapy at the warrior transition unit at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , said a service dog should be used only in the final stage of treatment , after a soldier has accomplished as much as possible with traditional therapy .
Many experts say the veterans should be living on their own for at least a year before they receive a dog .
Yeah , so we have n't been the biggest proponents of motion sensing laptops -- it 's sort of hard to see the point when you 've usually got your hands on the keyboard or touchpad to control the screen -- but apparently Pointgrab 's software is gaining some traction .
The software , which works with any 2D webcam , is currently being shipped on Fujitsu Lifebook AH laptops in Japan , but it 'll be expanding to other markets soon .
In addition , we were told another laptop maker would be preloading it " before the end of the year . "
Interesting .
We got to spend some time with the Lifebook AH500 , and we have to say the software / webcam combo does work quite fluidly -- all we had to do was wave at the screen to bring up the company 's menu for opening programs or controlling media .
And it was super responsive to our wax - on / wax - off movements to control the volume .
But regardless , it 's still really hard to imagine when we 'd actually use this on a laptop ... though , get it on a nettop , HTPC or all - in - one and we 'll be all ears ( or hands in the air ! ) .
It 'll be interesting to see which laptop manufacturer feels differently and snatches up Pointgrab 's tech soon , but until then check out the gallery and video after the break to see us ( awkwardly ) wave at a 15.6 - inch screen .
Judging from the recent polls , if the Democrats do n't figure out a way to either get people employed or at least extend unemployment benefits for the people who can't find jobs , this year 's midterms will be a tsunami that washes the Democrats into the sea :
As the nation contends with a long and sustained labor market recession , a new study from the Center for Economic and Policy Research demonstrates that the current unemployment rate is higher than the conventional measure shows .
" An unemployment rate that has hovered above 9 percent for several months is striking , but the jobs picture is even worse than it looks , " said report author and CEPR Economist David Rosnick .
The study , " The Adult Recession : Age - Adjusted Unemployment at Post - War Highs , " adjusts the current unemployment rate to account for demographic differences and finds that the unemployment rate has not fallen below 10.8 percent in the last 12 months .
During the worst episode of the recession of the 1980s -- the second half of 1982 and the first half of 1983 -- unemployment passed 10 percent for 7 months .
The analysis notes that the population is older today than it was in the 1980s , which has the effect of lowering today 's unemployment rate relative to the past .
Since they change jobs more frequently and are more likely to move in and out of the labor market , Young people have a higher unemployment rate than older workers .
Adjusting for this older workforce shows that the United States is experiencing the weakest labor market since the Great Depression .
The severity of the current unemployment situation suggests that policy makers should consider measures that would slow or reverse this trend .
Additional stimulus such as work sharing or the extension of unemployment benefits by Congress would go far in addressing the plight of the millions of unemployed Americans suffering as a result of this downturn .
UNITED Nations data sources estimated the population of Bangladesh as 158.7 million approx .
( UN , 2007 ) in 2007 , and Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics ( BBS , 2008 ) estimated it as 144.5 million in July , 2008 .
According to UN sources , the present figure is more than 160 million ( also used for population projection in this article ) .
Bangladesh has long been acknowledged as a success for family planning ( UN , 2007 ) .
Yet , population growth has remained one of the prime focuses of national policy discourse and intellectual discussions .
The recent government initiative to introduce " Single Child Policy " has been appreciated by most people .
Following the Chinese example , it is thought that the population can be controlled or decreased in the near future by adopting this policy .
The announcement of " Single Child per Couple " policy and its implementation by 2015 is considered as an immediate solution to this problem .
Considering the geometric population growth , there is a long way to go before the population declines in Bangladesh ( see Figure 1 ) .
According to the expectation of the " Single Child per Couple " policy , and considering the Total Fertility Rate ( TFR ) as 1.0 by 2015 , the population will still be growing .
At the same time , if the target is achieved by 2025 , the situation will be worse , as projected by the upper curved line ( see Figure 1 ) .
Even with the expectation of the policy of TFR=1.0 population will keep growing , and will not experience a decline before 2033 .
Thus it is quite clear that , in the near future , the population will keep growing inspite of the " Single Child per Couple " policy .
According to the Bangladesh Labour Force Survey 2005 - 06 , the number of unemployed persons above 15 years of age is 2.1 million .
Considering the effectiveness of the current policy , and TFR= 1.0 by 2015 , the total population in the age - group 15 - 50 years will be 110 million ( approx . ) in 2033 .
As mentioned before , population will not decline before 2033 , and a huge shift of age - group distribution is percievable by 2033 ( see Figure 2 ) .
Thus , the employment situation may get worse .
So far , government initiatives have been limited to providing general education and technical expertise for only a small portion of this population .
According to government sources , 45,000 people are being provided training facilities in 38 traning centres on 45 subjects , which is obviously a very small portion of the present unemployed population .
With growing educational status , a large portion of this age group ( 15 - 50 ) will be educated enough to take advantage of the skilled labour market .
So far , our foreign exchange income has been dominated by un-skilled labour income .
Countries like India and Philippines are taking advantage of skilled labour forces in their home countries and abroad through call - centres , nursing , etc .
Very few initiatives have been taken in Bangladesh to facilitate skilled labour force marketing .
By 2050 , a major shift of age - group is also perceivable , based on the success of the policy ( see Figure 3 ) .
About 51 million people will be more than 50 years of age , which will result in huge demand for medical services , unemployment benefit or old - age benefits .
Acute shortage in medical service facilities is already perceivable , and extra emphasis should be given in these sectors to meet the future demand .
From the above discussion , it can be concluded that the population of Bangladesh will be growing in near future in spite on the national policy of " Single Child per Couple . "
The national policy is appreciable in terms of long - run effect , but the government should be prepared to tackle the population growth , employment of above 15 years , and social services in near future .

Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) -- A 9 - year - old boy fatally shot his 2 - year - old brother while playing with a gun in Los Angeles , authorities said late Saturday .
The boy found the gun in his house , said Sgt. Tim Walters of the Los Angeles Police Department .
While playing with it , he accidentally shot the toddler , Walters said .
No charges will be filed , according to Walters .
Police said they responded to a call Friday and found the toddler suffering from a single gunshot wound to the torso .
Paramedics took him to a hospital , where he died later that night .
" Homicide detectives interviewed family members and determined that the gun had gone off while the 9 - year - old was playing with it , " police said in a statement .
The victim's name was withheld pending notification of next of kin , authorities said .
83 - year - old televangelist Robert H. Schuller has handed the reins of Southern California 's Crystal Cathedral mega church to his daughter , Sheila .
She will inherit a church with a $ 55 million budget deficit , and $ 2 million worth of lawsuits .
Glory be !
Reverend Schuller is famous for hosting the " Hour of Power " television show , which at one time boasted 1.3 million viewers in 156 countries and saved countless people from eternal damnation .
But a tough economy has forced the business church to cancel events like the " Glory of Easter " pageant and trim operational costs .
That , and the $ 2 million worth of lawsuits for allegedly stiffing over 100 vendors on " electrical equipment " purchases .
But seriously , a $ 55 million budget deficit for a church ?!
Christ Almighty , that 's a lot of cash .

Ultra-Act Ultraman Review
| By
Probably the highlight and genesis of Ultraman Week is today ’s review .
It ’s also one of the most photo intensive reviews I ’ve done in recent memory , with close to 40 different photos making the cut out of a total of over 200 pictures taken .
I ’m one of the first American websites covering this figure so I definitely wanted to do it justice .
I hope you enjoy reading the review and looking at the pictures , as much as I enjoyed writing and taking them .
Ultra-Act
Ultraman
6 Inch Scale
By : Bandai
$ 29.99
Ultraman made his television debut on July 17 , 1966 , 44 years ago nearly to the date .
Ultraman was actually a follow up to Ultra Q , which had debuted previously that same year .
Ultra Q had essentially been X - Files meets Twilight Zone , while Ultraman changed the formula by adding a superhero element to the show .
Ultraman , although not the first real tokusatsu show , can arguably be called the forefather of the genre .
At least within the usage of tokusatsu as a catch - all for Japanese superhero / scifi .
Within months of Ultraman ’s TV debut , toys began to appear .
First made by a company in Japan called , MARUSAN .
The sculpts were n’t particularly good , but the vinyl versions of the characters were surprisingly articulated and detailed for their time period .
Since those humble beginnings , Ultraman has went on to spawn a Guinness World Record setting number of spinoff shows , with over 25 television series and incredibly , around 25 films as well .
The original Ultraman has n’t always appeared in these programs , but remarkably the character and actor portraying his human host counterpart appeared as recently asin feature film .
In the future , sinister aliens and giant monsters constantly threaten civilization .
The only Earth organization equipped to handle these disasters is the Science Special Search Party , a special police force with branches all over the world , and equipped with high - tech weapons and vehicles , as well as extensive scientific and engineering facilities .
The Science Patrol is always ready to protect the Earth from rampaging monsters , but sometimes finds itself outclassed .
When the situation becomes desperate , Hayata , the Patrol ’s most capable member , holds the key to salvation in the form of a power - object called a “ beta capsule , ” which , when activated , allows him to transform secretly into the amazing , super - humanoid - powered giant from space , who soon becomes known to the people of Earth by the name of Ultraman .
Along the way have come a litany of figures , each of varying qualities .
Ultraman has aired in dozens of countries , including the United States and is in many ways the forefather to so many American phenomenon like the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers .
Yet , despite all that , there has never been a particularly definitive Ultraman figure …
Until now !
While active as Ultraman , Hayata ’s human body goes into a type of deep coma , reviving only after the threat has been neutralized and Ultraman willingly departs .
Victory is never assured , however , as Ultraman ’s powers –his very life force–comes from rapidly depleted , stored solar energy .
At the beginning of each transformation from Hayata - to - Ultraman , the warning light on the giant ’s chest begins as a steady blue color .
Yet as Ultraman exerts himself , the Color Timer changes to red , then blinks -— slowly at first , then with increasing rapidity — - as his energy reserves get closer to exhaustion .
As the voice - over narration reminds the viewer — beginning with episode 2 and for each episode thereafter — - if Ultraman ever reaches the point of total energy depletion , he “ will never rise again . ”
For over 30 years Bandai has been making Ultraman figures .
Mostly of the limited articulation , vinyl variety .
This year they have created a new line , to compliment their popular S.H. Figurarts lines and to compete with other lines like Revoltech , called Ultra - Act .
Ultraman , as he appeared in the most recent film is , fittingly , the first figure in this line .
Packaging :
Japan has a different market than America , as toys are regularly marketed for adults .
Unlike most toy companies here in the states , “ adult collector ” is n’t a hush - hush word in the land of the rising sun .
As such , these toys are packaged and marketed more towards that demographic .
Of course , these are likely popular with children as well .
The box for Ultraman is beautiful , with a nice almost vintage looking design for the Ultraman face “ scribbled ” on the front .
Beyond that , it ’s a pretty standard window box with some nice posing pictures on the back .
Surprisingly pretty much all the text on the front is in English .
Inside Ultraman is encased in a double plastic tray .
Simple tape holds the tray down with the figure safely protected inside .
Remove the top tray , to reveal an additional tray underneath with a couple more accessories , like Ultraman ’s cape .
“ I ’m free !
I ’m free !
Wait …
Who ’s that ?
Quick put me back in the package ! ”
Sculpt
Despite largely keeping the same design for 40 years , Ultraman has underwent a few cosmetic changes .
Most of those happened during his original run and there are three distinct Ultraman costumes , known as Type A , B and C by fans of the series .
Type A was more paper mache - esque , with almost an acne appearance on the face mask .
Type B was known for it ’s bigger eyes , defined lower and up lip and pointy elf shoes .
Type C , is the most iconic version of the character , ditching the elf shoes and refining the features on the face .
Bandai ’s Ultra -Act Ultraman , thankfully replicates the Type C version of the character .
Upon first glance , Ultraman may appear a bit spindly to some American fans .
That ’s true to form though .
Ultraman has never been a pumped up , steroid bodied superhero like we traditionally see in the West .
He has moderate muscle tone , but is mostly thin .
Although an import toy in America , this is a mass market toy in Japan .
As such , there may be some bleed on lines in the paint job .
However , I found mine to be painted very well .
Parts of the figure are molded in red plastic and silver painted on , and other parts in reverse .
The eyes are a particularly nice touch , with clear plastic over a jagged paint design .
Even the suit ’s eye holes are replicated .
This might seem odd to fans unfamiliar with the character , but even though technology in special effects has improved , this has remained a consistent part of the character ’s design .
Scale wise he fits in pretty good with the classic Bandai vinyls , as he ’s intended , but he ’s considerably taller than S.H. Figurarts Kamen Rider toys .
This is a separate line , make no mistake about it .
There should be no confusion between the two lines .
Ultraman ’s trademark suit fin is also present , running down the head , neck and back , despite being five separate pieces .
There are a fair amount of cuts breaking up the sculpt , which could take away some of the aesthetic , but they are needed for the articulation .
Ultraman figures for decades have been limited to 2 - 5 points of articulation , so the cuts are hardly a nuisance .
The sculpt works seamlessly with the articulation and accessories to replicate every one of Ultraman ’s trademark poses .
Something that despite valiant attempts , has never been realized before to this level in plastic .
Articulation
Articulation is a big selling point for this figure .
Although a few Chogokins have come out through the years with decent articulation for Ultraman , few have been cost efficient and none have reached this level .
Ultraman has tons of cuts , joints , pivots , hinges and the like .
Many of the points of articulation are completely different than the range typically seen on American toys and are almost hard to describe .
The shoulder and thigh / leg joints are similar , but constructed slightly different .
The shoulders have two separate hinge joints .
One allows the figure to move it ’s arms inward , similar to the recent Jakks UFC figures .
The other acts more like a traditional ball joint .
That secondary shoulder hinge is also where the figure ’s shoulder swivel is cut and I ’ve labeled them as one joint , but they could be considered separate .
One of the most impressive joints comes at the wrists .
When you pop the hands off you ’ll see a ball hinge with complete range of motion .
This allows the wrists to not only swivel , but pivot back and fourth as well as move in nearly 360 degrees , while at a 90 degree angle .
The head and neck are broke into two different joints .
The neck is a ball joint , but that ’s at the lower portion of the neck where it connects to the torso .
This gives the neck a realistic movement .
The head however , is on a simpler hinge joint .
This means that Ultraman can’t quite tilt his head to the side the same way a DCUC would , but he can look nearly straight up , at angles that a traditional ball joint wo n’t allow .
The amount of posing opportunities with this figure are nearly limitless .
In addition to hitting complex poses , the simple things also come smoothly and gracefully to this figure .
I often find that a figure with tons of articulation points , ca n’t do simple things like stand up straight or sit down completely .
Ultraman can !
He can even sit down Indian style .
UP , UP AND AW - SHUWATCH !
Recreating classic battle scenes , or devising new ones are available at a level never before reached in the 40 + years of Ultraman toys .
There really is n’t a pose you ca n’t put Ultraman reasonably in .
His articulation is likely unmatched not only by all previous efforts , but by 99 % of the other toys on the market entirely .
Accessories :
On the surface it might seem as though Ultraman would n’t need much in the way of accessories .
He does n’t use guns or swords .
Yet Bandai has found a wealth of accessories to include that are not only logical , but now almost seem necessary and make every figure before this terribly lacking as a result .
Chaiyo ’s terriblecame with three pairs of hands , which seemed quite innovative at the time , but Bandai blows that out of the water .
Ultra -Act Ultraman comes with four pairs of hands .
A pair of chop hands , a pair of fist hands , a pair of wide open hands and a pair of medium open hands .
He also comes with an “ Ultra Slash ” hand , which depicts his saw - like Spacium - energy halo .
The ring is cast in translucent smoky plastic , with addition white paint applications .
Ultraman also includes a hand that ’s projecting his full Spacium energy ray .
This is how Ultraman typically dispatches of his foes and it ’s considered his most powerful weapon .
It ’s created the same way the Ultra Slash is , but is particularly impressive do to it ’s size .
His regal cape is also included and is made out of a pretty hard vinyl .
If you ’re wondering why you ’ve never seen Ultraman in this particular mantle , it ’s because it ’s a newer concept introduced in the most recent Ultraman films .
These were created to help make the more classic Ultra characters look like royalty on their home planet .
There is also a strange little plastic stand included .
Do n’t throw that away .
This stand is designed to be a counter balance to the heavy cape .
The cape plugs into that ridged area along the top and keeps the figure standing proud when he ’s wearing his mantle .
Finally , the absolute coolest and simplest accessory : Ultraman ’s color timer .
Both cast in their appropriate color of translucent plastic .
They can be simply plugged into his chest to replicate Ultraman ’s stage of battle .
Just do n’t let him stay in the red for more than 3 minutes , or he may never “ rise again ” .
Additional Notes
Ultraman fans have waited decades to have a figure like this .
I personally have waited almost 30 years and this figure is a considerable upgrade from my first .
It improves upon it in every conceivable notion .
This toy offers so much playability that there is little doubt in my mind that I will be continuing to collect this toyline .
I have spent the last several days posing and reposing this guy , far more than I normally do with my toys .
Some fans have reported some issues with the figures , but I find that most of those are folks who expected this to be exactly like the S.H. Figurarts toys .
The Ultra - Act line uses a different plastic , has no metal parts and it ’s joints are somewhat looser in construction .
You should know that , going in .
My only flaw with this figure is that one shoulder is starting to get a bit loose .
However , the overall toy is of pretty great quality in my experience .
Tighter joints would definitely make it better , but it ’s like saying Double D cups would be better if they were F’s .
Ya know ?
Value :
SHOP AROUND !
One of the bigger US online toy retailers is selling this guy for $ 40 .
You might be less impressed with him at that price .
I paid around $ 25 .
I listed him at $ 30 because with shipping , that ’s about what you ’ll pay even if you find him cheap .
I still think he ’s an incredible value at that price .
So what if a couple of the joints get a little loose ?
A lot of that comes from swapping hands and constantly posing this guy in every pose that ’s imaginable to mankind !
Score Recap
Packaging – 8 Sculpting – 10 Articulation – 10 Accessories – 11 Hands , 2 Color Timers , Cape , StandValue – 9
One of the rare , coveted 10 out of 10 figures here at Infinite Hollywood .
While in general , I may score some toys higher than most , I only give out the 10 out of 10 when I feel a toy is so good , it deserves epic praise .
This is that toy .
ULTRA SLASH !
Could it be better ?
Sure .
Everything could be better .
This is the best Ultraman toy in nearly 45 years , though .
Think about that for a minute !
There have been hundreds of Ultraman figures made and this one is the best .
Maybe in a few years something better will come along and I can retroactively downgrade this , but for now , sorry , it ’s as close to plastic perfection as we ’ve ever gotten of this Japanese superhero .
This is one of those rare toys that makes me wish I could be a kid again to play with it .
Posing with him is fun , as is taking pictures , but this is the kind of plastic crack that makes me want to get on the floor and PLAY with him .
Disappearing into a world of monsters and judo throws .
Any toy that can make you get that feeling in the pit of your stomach , is a great product .
Slick , clean and evocative of the Ultraman mythos , overall it ’s an incredible toy .
Or , as Google so helpfully translated for me from a Japanese review : “ I fly at Mach giant sky , I would furious romance . ”
Indeed , I would furious romance .

The Grand Theft Auto series has maintained its quality up through the fourth release , including the chapters used to flesh out the world of Liberty City .
Red Dead Redemption takes the wide - open , living - world formula , shoots it back in time to the early 20th century , and places it in the world of the Western .
You play as John Marston , a man who used to run with a band of outlaws until the US government sent him out west to bring some men to justice .
Some men who used to be his friends .
Why is he doing this ?
Simple .
The government has his family .
If you 've ever watched Deadwood you know this setting .
The West is n't quite as wild as it once was : the rule of law is beginning to crush the spirit of the land , bringing everyone under the thumb of society .
The Native Americans may not have their land , we 're told in the game 's introduction , but in exchange they have been given the gift of Christianity .
Our hero does n't seem to think this is a fair trade .

There is enough flavor in the settings , missions , and firearms to keep this from feeling like a retread of Grand Theft Auto .
That said , the way in which you meet characters , take missions from them , and extend your range and the story is going to feel very familiar .
You 'll befriend a family with a ranch , a man who is a little too attached to the dead , and a snake - oil salesman , among other colorful characters .
They all want something , and more to the point , they all want something from you .
The combat is simple — use cover and move slowly — but enjoyable
Rockstar is simply ahead of the game when it comes to both writing and voice acting .
While games like Alan Wake have good stories , and titles like Heavy Rain excel at cinematic presentation , Rockstar titles stand alone when it comes to professional voice actors , and they 're all given interesting things to say .
In Red Dead Redemption you 're riding horses , not driving cars , and the conversations you have traveling from place to place all work to explain these characters , move the story along , or maybe just make you laugh .
The irony of an old gangster trying to clean up the West is n't lost on those around Marston ; a character notes that no one is more judgmental of drunks than someone who has given up the bottle .
This world is far from the drug deals and hits you 're used to from previous Rockstar games .
You 'll be herding cows , racing horses , and laying siege to a remote house to grab ammunition for a very specific gun .
You 'll steal entire trains .
You 'll ride your horse from place to place .
Travel takes a while , but you are given hunting and sharpshooting challenges — not to mention the ability to search for treasure — to keep you busy out in the wild , so you 'll always have something to do .
There are also situations you can either jump in on or simply watch , but remember that your reputation is hard to get and easy to lose .
Picking out the bad guys in the heat of battle can be a frustrating experience , and a misplaced shot can turn the good guys against you and put a bounty on your head .
Tread carefully .
Your horse is your life
Rockstar claims they had motion capture sessions just for the horses ... and I believe them .
The horses are characters in themselves .
You tap the A button to sprint , but your horse has a finite amount of stamina and will throw you if you push the animal too far .
By staying with one horse for a long time , traveling with it and keeping it safe , you 'll gain a loyalty bonus and extra stamina .
Yes , your horse can die .
You can take a tumble , your horse can be shot ( and you can shoot the horses out from under other characters ) and it can be spooked .
Riding the horse has a different feel than driving a car .
Sometimes there is a slight delay in its movements and it does feel like something that 's working with you , not a brainless machine .
The downside is there is very little information about which horses are stronger than others , outside of the buying prices and star rating in the general store , so it may not be immediately clear if you 're riding the best horse in your environment .
You 'll also ride in or take control of horse - drawn carriages , and things will get violent .
The controls and rhythms of these vehicles take a little while to get used to , but they feel great .
Be sure to keep control of the speed and power of your animal though , as we 've blown missions by running headlong into other characters .
The horses in the game are n't perfect , but they add a ton of character and help make the setting come to life .
The best horse in a game previously was arguably Agro from Shadow of the Colossus , and the horses here are much more satisfying .
Online is a mixed bag
You can join a posse of your friends and explore the world , shooting at other groups you meet or joining them in the expected game modes .
It 's an oddly thin experience compared to the offline game , although DLC featuring co-op missions is on the way .
In the story you can pass your time playing Poker , or Liar 's Dice .
There is a game of horseshoes .
There is a sort of rhythm game that involves a knife and your splayed hand .
You can arm - wrestle other characters .
None of these great minigames , which you may spend hours with in the main game , have made it into multiplayer .
What has made it into multiplayer is a mess of glitches and unreliable connections , which can be frustrating .
Online is a wonderful time with a full posse , but it 's not quite stable or full - featured enough to be a huge selling point .
Combined with the epic story and single - player , it 's a very happy addition to the game .
In conclusion
You can fairly say that Red Dead Redemption is filled with missions where you ride someplace , kill a bunch of dudes , and then ride someplace else .
That 's a completely valid criticism .
What Rockstar has done is make the mechanic of riding horses so satisfying and filled the journey with so many opportunities for excitement or side missions that you wo n't mind .
The characters are nicely fleshed out and acted , and you can easily move the story along with a 30 - minute session , or lose yourself for hours .
This is a game that offers an impressive amount of things to do , including tracking down new outfits and possibly even running from the law , and to the developer 's credit the vast majority of these things are fun .
Go bounty hunting , save a damsel in distress , become a master hunter , or simply run through the mission to enjoy the story ... the choice is yours .
This is a wonderful video game take on the classic Western , showing how far you can take what seems to be a thin story by filling it with interesting characters .
It can take a while to get to where you 're going in the game ; the amazing thing is that you 'll want to enjoy every second of the ride .
Verdict : Buy
I was discussing with my brother the new law in Missouri that bans strip clubs from being located within 1,000 feet of schools , churches , parks or homes .
My brother posed the question , “ Why are n’t there any laws banning churches within a thousand feet of a strip club ? ”
I was embarrassed I had n’t thought to ask the same question myself .
In assessing any legislation , it ’s a good rule to ask how would this law work if the roles were reversed .
Evidently I need to remind myself to ask the question more often .
My response at the time was , “ Strip clubs are n’t as popular as churches , and that ’s how laws like that get passed . ”
I failed to consider what would happen if the majority view changed –what would happen if someday strip clubs become more popular than churches ?
These types of zoning laws are the modern day version of segregation of what the majority finds morally repugnant .
The laws are akin to the early colonies laws which fined , banished , and imprisoned those who did not follow the religious tenants of the colony .
The more I thought about it , the more I began to see more of these domes and bubbles of moral purity .
The FDA ’s thousand feet ban on cigarette advertising near schools .
Firearms within a thousand feet of a school .
Smoking bans near the entrances to buildings .
Sex offenders banned from most of the city .
Needle exchanges within a thousand feet of schools .
Medical Marijuana dispensaries withing a thousand feet of schools .
College campus bans which have included military recruiters , medical marijuana , hate speech , and credit card offers .
The zoning bubbles are all around us and , the bans are rarely questioned for having the ability to ban a legal activity from within ones eyesight .
As an individual I do not have the right to ban what I find offensive or fear from my field of vision or near to my home , so why should some groups have this right ?
I can understand a parents desire to protect their children from dangerous influences , as in banning the Jonas Brothers and or Britney Spears concerts from within 10,000 feet of their children , if simply to protect children from crappy music .
As individuals , we do not have the right to ban what we find offensive , because an individual ’s rights ends where another rights begins .
The group for the liberty minded / libertarian / non- authoritarians to fear the most is not among smokers , gun-owners , sex offenders , drug addicts or even racists .
Underlying all these laws is the same tyrannical group –the majority .
They ’re the ones you ’ve got to watch out for .
Battlefield : Bad Company 2 is a better game than Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 .
Yup , I went there .
I ’m not taking refuge in nuances .
Unlike many critics , I ’m not weaseling out of making a tough call by saying that they are both great games .
Of course they are both great games , but no one can honestly reply , “ I do n’t care ” when asked if you should pull into Burger King or McDonald’s .
( Other suitable analogies : Toscanini versus von Karajan , Red Sox versus Yankees , Ginger versus Mary Ann . )
When it comes to these global mass - market products , everyone has a favorite .
And when it comes to the latest generation of hard - core first - person combat shooters , I find Bad Company 2 , released recently by Electronic Arts for Windows PCs , the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 , more sophisticated , more immersive , a boatload funnier and simply more interesting than Modern Warfare 2 .
I think that phone ringing is Bobby Kotick , chief executive of Activision Blizzard , publisher of the Call of Duty series , calling to tell me that he ’s going to eat my heart for breakfast tomorrow while he enjoys his world - class art collection .
O.K. , I ’m just joking about the threatened ventricle roasting .
But those are the sorts of passions involved in the fight between E.A. and Activision for the loyalty ( and money ) of the serious shooter fans who collectively spend millions of hours every day playing these games .
The Military Advocate General on Monday ordered the army 's criminal investigations unit to investigate the death of a Palestinian protester who was killed by a tear gas canister at a demonstration in Bil'in in April 2009 .

The Military Advocate General had refused to open a criminal investigation into the death of Bassem Abu - Rahma , but on Monday changed its mind after expert testimony showed that the tear gas canister was aimed directly at Abu - Rahma and was fired in violation of military orders .
The Military Advocate General notified Abu -Rahma 's family and human rights lawyer Michael Sfard , who had planned to petition the High Court of Justice over the case .
The Israel Defense Forces first said Abu - Rahma was in a group of Palestinians hurling rocks at troops .
But video footage showed him shouting , not throwing rocks , when he was shot .
Video footage filmed during the April 2009 protest against the separation fence in the Palestinian village of Bil 'in also showed IDF troops firing tear gas canisters directly at demonstrators while in the presence of commanding officers .

Abu - Rahma 's family welcomed the decision .
" We are extremely happy that an investigation is finally being opened , " said Ahmed Abu - Rahma , the victim 's brother .
" This should have happened on the day [ he was killed ] , and it is clear that the army opened the investigation because it was forced to , and that in the past year and a quarter it has tried to cover up the shooting of a non-violent protester that it had no reason to harm , let alone kill , " Ahmed Abu - Rahma continued .
The original decision not to investigate Abu - Rahma 's death ignored the video footage and relied on IDF solders ' testimony that the tear gas canister hit wire along the separation fence and then ricocheted , striking Abu - Rahma .
However , experts said that had the soldier who fired the canister followed IDF instructions , it would have landed hundreds of meters past where Abu - Rahma was standing .
Rights groups B'Tselem and Yesh Din said they were satisfied by the decision to probe the events surrounding Abu Rahma 's death , but stressed that the delay in reaching the decision was unjustified .
" We hope the amount of time that has passed since the event wo n't affect the effectiveness of the investigation , and that today 's decision by the Military Advocate General will bring justice to Abu - Rahma 's family and the village of Bil'in , " the groups said in a statement .
Sarit Michaeli of B'Tselem said the military informed the group on Monday of the decision .
The military had no immediate comment .
Michaeli said there was no justification for the army taking 15 months to investigate the death , which she said was recorded on three video cameras .
Physicians for Human Rights ( PHR ) this week released a shocking and damning report ( Experiments in Torture ) that implicates psychologists and medical practitioners in human experimentation , under CIA leadership , to calibrate and design torture techniques applied to detainees held by the U.S. as part of its so - called “ war on terror . ”
This is illegal activity that violates the Nuremberg Code , the Geneva Conventions , the U.S. government ’s own “ Common Rule , ” and a number of other international and domestic prohibitions against illegal human subject research and experimentation .
“ If health professionals participated in unethical human subject research and experimentation they should be held to account .
Any health professional who violates their ethical codes by employing their professional expertise to calibrate and study the infliction of harm disgraces the health profession and makes a mockery of the practice of medicine . ” — Scott A. Allen , MD , medical advisor to PHR , lead medical author of the report
These practices also open the door to prosecution of the officials and practitioners involved .
However , since the Obama administration has refused to investigate and prosecute those involved , the PHR itself will file a complaint today with the federal Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) seeking an investigation into human experimentation on detainees by the CIA .
The OHRP , part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , “ is responsible for ensuring that federally funded research by federal agencies including the CIA involving human subjects complies with regulations collectively known as the Common Rule ” ( source ) Moreover , the CIA itself cannot obstruct an OHRP investigation simply on the basis that evidence may be “ classified ” .
The OHRP has “ previously taken actions to suspend research activities at major research universities for violation of the Common Rule ” ( source ) .
As PHR states , “ since the Obama administration has not responded to the request to investigate possible incidents of human experimentation on detainees , the groups are seeking an official investigation by the OHRP ” .
Indeed , if anything the Obama administration and Congress have facilitated the continuation of suspect interrogation practices and the employment of those involved in developing torture techniques .
For example , as PHR reports , “ as recently as February , 2010 , President Obama ’s then director of national intelligence , Admiral Dennis Blair , disclosed that the U.S. had established an elite interrogation unit that will conduct ‘ scientific research ’ to improve the questioning of suspected terrorists .
Admiral Blair declined to provide important details about this effort . ”
Congress has also continued distortion of the War Crimes Act ( WCA ) , as changed in 2006 by the Bush Administration in order to “ allow a more permissive definition of the crime of illegal experimentation on detainees in US custody ” ( source ) .
Also , as has been recently reported by the BBC , detainees are still being abused at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan :
“ The abuses are all said to have taken place since US President Barack Obama was elected , promising to end torture . ”
Several months ago , a New York Times report , which also references the Washington Post , spoke of the “ Black Jail ” at Bagram , where detainees are held incommunicado .
Furthermore , an Obama administration official herself , Dr. Susan Brandon , a psychologist and Chief for Research in the Defense Intelligence Agency ’s ( DIA ) , Defense Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Center ( DCHC ) Behavioral Science Program , is linked to the use of psychology in various torture techniques applied to detainees , including mind control , sensory deprivation , sensory overload , and sleep deprivation .
( See also : Field Evaluation in the Intelligence and Counterintelligence Context : Workshop Summary [ 2010 ] ; the APA ’s “ Making psychological research a priority for countering terrorism ” ; National Science and Technology Council , “ Combating Terrorism : Research Priorities in the Social , Behavioral and Economic Sciences ” ; but note also that the American Psychological Association has taken to airbrushing its site to remove all links , and all mentions , of “ deception scenarios ” workshops that were part of a conference it conducted with the CIA and Rand Corporation on 17 - 18 July 2003 ) .
The DIA , for which Brandon works , operates the notorious black site at Bagram Air Base which , as we now know , continues to be the major source of reports of torture and abuse from prisoners released from U.S. custody in Afghanistan ( see : “ DIA and the Black Jail at Bagram , ” Harper ’s Magazine , May 2010 , and “ Inside the Secret Interrogation Facility at Bagram , ” The Atlantic , 14 May 2010 ) .
Detainees are still being “ interrogated ” in line with the provisions of “ the notorious Appendix M to the Army Field Manual , which the Pentagon itself acknowledges is not compliant with the Geneva Conventions standards for prisoners of war ” ( source ) .
As Scott Horton asks in his Harper ’s article :
“ it ’s time to ask Secretary Gates why he ’s decided to put DIA in charge of a prison operation that looks almost identical to the one that President Obama outlawed back on January 22 , 2009 , and why he ’s giving them free rein to employ the non-Geneva compliant techniques found in Appendix M. ”
The program first took shape under the administration of President George W. Bush .
However , while legal memos were drafted to justify the use of “ enhanced interrogation techniques , ” PHR finds that “ there is no publicly available evidence that the Department of Justice ’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the alleged experimentation and research performed on detainees was lawful ” .
In other words , the use of the techniques was sanctioned , but not the performance of human experimentation , or research for developing such techniques .
“ The CIA appears to have broken all accepted legal and ethical standards put in place since the Second World War to protect prisoners from being the subjects of experimentation .
Not only are these alleged acts gross violations of human rights law , they are a grave affront to America ’s core values . ” — Frank Donaghue , PHR ’s Chief Executive Officer
“ In their attempt to justify the war crime of torture , the CIA appears to have committed another alleged war crime — illegal experimentation on prisoners .
Justice Department lawyers appear to never have assessed the lawfulness of the alleged research on detainees in CIA custody , despite how essential it appears to have been to their legal cover for torture . ” — Nathaniel A. Raymond , Director of PHR ’s Campaign Against Torture and lead report author
PHR ’s report , released on Monday ( 7 June 2010 ) , provides new evidence that health professionals on the CIA payroll performed experiments on detainees captured and held by the U.S. since 11 September 2001 , to apparently provide legal cover for torture .
Knowledge about psychologists , doctors and other health professionals being involved in interrogations conducted by the CIA and the Defense Department had been previously by the International Committee of the Red Cross , based on interviews with several high - value detainees held by the CIA — a confidential report that was subsequently leaked and is available here and here .
As PHR summarized about their new findings , “ research and medical experimentation on detainees was used to measure the effects of large - volume waterboarding and adjust the procedure according to the results .
After medical monitoring and advice , the CIA experimentally added saline , in an attempt to prevent putting detainees in a coma or killing them through over - ingestion of large amounts of plain water ” .
“ Waterboarding 2.0 , ” was thus the product of the “ CIA ’s developing and field - testing an intentionally harmful practice , using systematic medical monitoring and the application of subsequent generalizable knowledge ” ( source ) .
According to the same PHR summary , “ health professionals monitored sleep deprivation on more than a dozen detainees in 48- , 96 - and 180 - hour increments .
This research was apparently used to monitor and assess the effects of varying levels of sleep deprivation to support legal definitions of torture and to plan future sleep deprivation techniques ” .
In addition , “ health professionals appear to have analyzed data , based on their observations of 25 detainees who were subjected to individual and combined applications of ‘ enhanced ’ interrogation techniques , to determine whether one type of application over another would increase the subject ’s ‘ susceptibility to severe pain . ’
The alleged research appears to have been undertaken only to assess the legality of the ‘ enhanced ’ interrogation tactics and to guide future application of the techniques ” ( source ) .
In a letter sent by PHR to President Obama , the organization says the purposes of this unethical and illegal research were threefold :
First , because the EITs had previously been considered torture , there was little scientific evidence prior to Sept. 11 , 2001 , about their effects on detainees and questions about their impact and effectiveness were arising as the program proceeded .
Only experiments on detainees would be likely to determine the effects of more prolonged and intense application of the techniques in a non-simulated interrogation setting , although it is clear such experimentation would be illegal and unethical .
A second purpose of collecting generalizable medical data was to attempt to calibrate the level of pain caused by the techniques in a misguided effort to keep the pain from crossing the threshold deemed by the Department of Justice to constitute torture .
A third purpose to which the results of the experimentation were put was to create a basis for legal defenses for those engaging in acts that arguably constituted torture .
Department of Justice lawyers argued that efforts to refine and improve the application of techniques would provide a potential “ good faith ” defense for interrogators against charges of torture .
Physicians for Human Rights calls on the Obama administration to offer compensation , health care , and a formal apology to the victims of research and experimentation perpetrated by the U.S. PHR also calls for a criminal investigation into the CIA and other government agencies , for illegal human experimentation and research on detainees .
PHR also calls on Obama to “ issue an executive order immediately suspending any federally - funded human subject research currently occurring in secret . ”
They also call for “ a presidential task force to restore the integrity of the US regime of protections for human subjects of research . ”
In what is a paragraph that will be of especial interest to anthropologists , debating the ethics of research engagement with the U.S. military to support counterinsurgency and intelligence , especially those who think that medical analogies support such endevours ( “ after all , ” the argument by false analogy goes , “ doctors also serve in war zones ” ) , PHR states the following to Obama :
“ The use of doctors to monitor intentionally harmful interrogation techniques places them in the service of national security objectives which are in conflict with the best therapeutic interest of those they are monitoring .
The result has been a cooptation of health professionals by the national security apparatus and a violation of the highest medical admonition to ‘ do no harm . ’
The misuse of scientific expertise for expedient and exploratory goals leads to a corrosion of the high standards of the profession . ”
Kaye says the following about both psychologists and anthropologists in the “ war on terror ” and its scandals , such as the Human Terrain System :
“ As for psychologists , Dr. Soldz rightly notes , ‘ Psychology as a profession is at a crossroads . ’
The same holds true for other professions involved with this abusive and criminal history , including the activities of anthropologists in the military ’s Human Terrain System teams in Afghanistan , researchers in numerous academic departments across the country , and the many reports of doctors and other medical personnel involved in the monitoring of torture activities for the CIA and Defense Department .
The use of torture has suborned U.S. civil society as a whole in activities that are dark and evil , and the society as a whole must make a tremendous effort if it is to extirpate such evil from its midst . ” — Jeffrey Kaye , The Public Record , 25 May 2010

Scientists Baffled by Prahlad Jani , Man Who Does n't Eat or Drink Doctors hope to find survival secret to help people during disasters .
June 1 , 2010 --
In a country remarkable for tales powerful deities and exotic mystics , an 82 - year - old man who claims he can survive without food or drink has baffled doctors who studied him and did not see him eat or drink anything for more than two weeks .
Prahlad Jani said that he has lived for more than 70 years by absorbing water through a hole in his palate .
He is regarded as a holy man by some and a fraud by many .
Jani spent more than two weeks in April and May under the observation of doctors at Sterling Hospital in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad .
" We studied him for 15 days with him taking no water or food , " Dr. Sudhir Shah told ABC News .
Shah said that Jani gargled water and took baths , but consumed nothing .
While thin , Jani is healthy , doctors said .
" Somebody does n't take water for seven or eight days he surely dies , " Shah said .
Perhaps as equally interesting for the doctors was the fact that Jani passed no urine or stool during the time period .
Shah said the normally when someone has no stool or urine , they need dialysis .
Jani has confounded the scientists .
" We are studying the phenomenon , " Shah said .
The scientific research may be able to help soldiers or disaster victims live without food or water for longer stretches of time .
Despite having doctors study Jani , there are skeptics .
" The bottom line is that even fasting for more than a day can be dangerous , " said Keri Gans , a registered dietician practicing in New York City and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association .
" You need food to function . "
Assuming Jani was consuming some sort of water , Gans thought he might be able to survive , but not healthily .
" He might psychologically be able to handle this , but it does n't matter if you 've done it once or done it 20 times .
Every time he 's doing it he 's setting himself up for nutritional deficiencies , " said Gans .
" How can anyone expect to ingest their vitamin and mineral needs if they 're not ingesting food ? "
That is a question Indian scientists hope to find out .
" We realized that , if this whole phenomenon really exists in a human being even for 15 days , it would have immense application in unraveling secrets of medical science and its application for human welfare , " a statement from a scientific group , that included the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences , said .
" Instead of ignoring this case , we selected to investigate further , in a rational and scientific way .
We again make it clear that the purpose of this study was not to prove or disprove a person , but to explore a possibility in science and study a new phenomenon , " the statement said .
Eli Rabett , that ever - curious but lovable lagomorph , has noticed the appearance of an apparent annual cycle in the Arctic sea ice area anomaly chart at the excellent Cryosphere Today .
I mentioned the same thing in a post on Arctic sea ice back in April , and hinted that I might look at it “ another day ” .
Well , that day has come , not least because the ice “ experts ” at ÂµWatts have been suggesting it might be a satellite problem ( it is n’t ) .
Here ’s the relevant chart from Cryosphere Today .
I downloaded it last night , and added the crude red circle round the interesting bit ( click the image to see the current version of CT ’s graph — it updates daily ) .
It covers the entire satellite record , and shows the anomaly — that is , the difference between the actual ice area for a given day and the average ice area for that day over the entire period .
Looking at the anomaly should remove the annual cycle , because that ’s accounted for in the average that forms the baseline .
Nevertheless , from 2007 onwards it looks very much like the anomaly is itself showing an annual cycle .
Here ’s a close up .
The first big drop occurs in 2007 , the year of the record summer minimum area , but it ’s there again in 2008 and 2009 — and shows every sign of happening again this year .
If you look closely , you ’ll see something just as interesting as the cycle itself .
The maximum anomaly occurs after the summer sea ice minimum .
This is obvious on CT ’s graph of area over last two years .
The red line at the bottom is the anomaly , and you can see that the maximum anomaly occurs after the ice area has started to regrow — which means that the freeze - up has begun later than the 30 - year average .
However , once the ice starts refreezing , the anomaly decreases rapidly and gets up towards the zero line over winter .
So what ’s going on ?
Why is the late summer anomaly so much greater than the winter anomaly , and why have we only started seeing the cycle in the last few years ?
Here ’s my stab at an explanation …
Consider the geography of the Arctic sea ice .
You can divide it very roughly into two regions — the ice in the Arctic basin , that is the ocean around the pole , north of Canada , Alaska , Siberia , Svalbard and Greenland , and the sea ice that forms outside the Arctic basin ( Barents Sea , Bering Strait , Kamchatka , etc ) .
Every winter the Arctic basin freezes up .
That happens every year without fail ( so far ) .
The winter anomaly therefore depends on the amount of sea ice that grows outside the central Arctic .
But all that ice melts long before we get anywhere near the late - summer ice minimum — in other words , it ’s irrelevant to prospects for the summer .
Summer anomalies are determined by the ice melt in the central Arctic .
Up to 2007 , the summer melt mainly took place around the Canadian and Siberian shores , and in the Barents Sea .
That ’s why the Northwest and Northeast Passages were / are a tricky proposition — they depend on the fringes of the polar sea ice cap melting .
In 2007 , however , ice over a large chunk of the central Arctic basin melted away , setting a new record minimum by a 25 % margin .
That delayed the start of the freeze - up significantly , and so the anomaly increased to more than 2.5 m km2 below average .
But this is the central Arctic we ’re talking about , and still a very chilly place , so even though the freeze - up was delayed , the sea ice regrew as autumn turned into winter and covered the entire basin .
The emergence of an annual cycle in the anomaly therefore occurs because there ’s now more variability in summer area / extent than there is winter area / extent , and because there is , in absolute terms , more central Arctic ice to lose .
2007 ’s record melt triggered the appearance of the cycle .
And as and when we hit new record minima , we ’re likely to see even bigger swings in the cycle as long as the entire central Arctic freezes up every winter .
[ This is not news to real ice scientists , by the way , because model runs show similar sea ice behaviour as the ice declines — though it ’s being seen rather sooner than modelling suggested .
This post at Primaklima at Scienceblogs .de shows some examples .
H/t to Georg himself in comments at ÂµWatts ]
There is another tantalising hint to be discerned in the new cycle .
In each of the last three winters , the anomaly has approached zero — and sceptics have been keen to trumpet the ice as being back to normal .
As we ’ve seen , this is because of the growth of sea ice outside the Arctic basin , and so it is irrelevant to the state of the ice that will melt the following summer .
The slightly reduced winter anomalies ( compared to the four or five years prior to 2007 , though not earlier ) might be related to changes in weather patterns outside the central Arctic ( which has been warmer than average throughout recent winters , while parts of Siberia have been colder ) , or perhaps to reductions in salinity caused by greater run-off of fresh water ( making it easier to freeze ) — but that ’s highly speculative .
It ’s interesting to note that the annual area anomaly cycle is to a certain extent mirrored in the PIOMAS ice volume data .
Here ’s the last few years snipped from their latest chart .
There was a record volume anomaly in summer 2007 , as you might expect , followed by a recovery over winter as the ice cover regrew .
Another minimum occurred in summer 2008 , followed by a smaller regrowth , and then another drop to a record minimum in summer 2009 .
Not much new ice since , though , and in the last couple of months the volume anomaly has plummeted .
They ’ve had to add another section to the bottom of the chart since I last posted it here …
Talk of betting on the summer minimum is underway at the mustelid ’s place , and I am on record there as suggesting that this summer will see a greater melt than the last couple of years .
A new record ?
Perhaps , but I ’m not betting on it .
Meanwhile , the SEARCH forecasting exercise has posted its first “ pre-release ” ice forecast : Adrienne Tivy , a post - doctoral fellow at the International Arctic Research Center ( IARC ) has developed a statistical model that projects a 4.539 m km2 Sept average , “ below normal ” but way above the last three years .
Still , when you look down on the top of the world ( or bottom , from my perspective ) from the vantage of NASA ’s Terra and Aqua satellites , the eyeballs in the sky ( there is life beyond the pooliverse ! ) make the sea ice look very broken up and mobile .

Animated Title Editor " .
Using
The wait is over !
One of the big features I have been secretly working on over the past few months is a new feature which I 'm calling the " " .
Using Blender 2.5 + behind the scenes , OpenShot can now easily generate animated 3D title sequences .
This feature has been in my dreams since I started working on OpenShot .
I have always enjoyed working with Blender to create animations , but I also realized that most users will never have the time to learn a professional 3D animation package .
Blender is simply too complicated for most users , which is why you do n't see more 3D titles on videos created with Linux .
My goal is to bring the power of Blender , the creativity of the Blender community ( in the form of templates ) to OpenShot in the most intuitive interface possible .
I really feel like I 've accomplished that , which is why I 'm so excited about this feature . =)
Here are some pictures to explain how it works :
Step 1 : Choose a template .
Step 2 : Change some settings , such as the text , color , size , and font .
Preview any frame in the animation by moving the slider .
Step 3 : Click the ' Render ' button ( and wait for a few minutes while your title is being generated ) .
A preview of each rendered frame is shown , so you can watch the animation as it's created .
Step 4 : The new animation is then added to your OpenShot project as a clip .
It will have the same height , width , and fps ( frames per second ) as your OpenShot project .
Drag your new clip onto the timeline and enjoy !
This feature will not be available until our next version is released , which we are all working on , so please be patient .
Soon enough everyone can test it out .
But please do n't mess up your current install of OpenShot trying to install this " alpha " feature . =)
More news soon , so stay tuned .
This new animated title sequence is created as a RGBA image sequence .
That means that each frame has full alpha ( i.e. transparency ) , and can be composited on top of any other video , such as the screenshot above of the chimpanzee .
As far as I know , OpenShot is the first FOSS video editor to incorporate 3D title animations ( not including Blender of course ) .
Hopefully this feature ( along with a few more we are working on ) will start to differentiate OpenShot from the pack of FOSS video editors .
Zimbabwe has been accused of hoarding long - lost episodes of Doctor Who , reports The Sun .
The BBC destroyed several early editions of the cult show in the 1960s and 1970s in order to make room for new programming .
However , the African nation is believed to have bought the first season of the programme , which ran from 1963 until 1966 and starred William Hartnell .
" We have looked all over the world for missing Doctor Who episodes but there are still some broadcasters we have not spoken to , " revealed an unnamed BBC source .
" Zimbabwe could prove a problem as there is so much red tape . "
President Robert Mugabe has banned BBC personnel from entering the country , which has reportedly led the corporation to fear that they might never retrieve the missing serials .
Around 108 out of 752 episodes are believed to be missing .
The most famous and sought - after is episode four of The Tenth Planet , which depicts Hartnell transforming into the second Doctor , Patrick Troughton .
Previously forgotten episodes have been uncovered in New Zealand , Hong Kong and through private collections .
In 1983 , two early outings were found at a car boot sale being sold for £ 8 each .

The head of the investigation that said Israel made some mistakes but basically did the right thing in raiding the Mavi Marmara on May 31 is General Giora Eiland .
A note from Norman Finkelstein :
It ’s useful to remember who Giora Eiland is .
The Goldstone Report listed Eiland as one of the ideological architects of the Gaza massacre :
[ Paragraph ] 1196 .
After the war in southern Lebanon in 2006 , a number of senior former military figures appeared to develop the thinking that underlay the strategy set out by Gen. Eiskenot .
In particular Major General ( Ret. ) Giora Eiland has argued that , in the event of another war with Hizbullah , the target must not be the defeat of Hizbullah but “ the elimination of the Lebanese military , the destruction of the national infrastructure and intense suffering among the population …
Serious damage to the Republic of Lebanon , the destruction of homes and infrastructure , and the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people are consequences that can influence Hizbollah ’s behaviour more than anything else ” .
[ Giora Eiland , " The Third Lebanon War : Target Lebanon , " Strategic Assessment ( November 2008 ) ]
Update from Finkelstein on the central issue here :
Israeli philosopher Asa Kasher , despite doing his utmost to defend the Gaza massacre , nonetheless said that “ a democratic state … cannot use human beings as mere tools to create deterrence .
Human beings are not tools to be used , ” and that “ killing for the sake of deterrence is something akin to terrorism . ”

It may be just sport .
But recriminations here over the French soccer team meltdown – the losses , plus everything else – have begun in fury , and are spilling into politics , culture , and race divides .
Two weeks of rancor in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa by Les Bleus – and no goals scored – is being taken as a mirror on French society by philosophers and analysts : some call it a metaphor for President Nicolas Sarkozy 's ruling party ostentation , wealth , and individualism – others blame a new generation of “ crude and vulgar ” players from minority French suburbs .
France is sensitive about its world image in the best of times .
But when its team self - destructs on the World Cup stage , when it ties Uruguay and loses to Mexico , when its star forward hurls epithets at the coach and is sent packing , when the team then goes on strike , when some players wo n’t dress to play against host South Africa today , when the team director resigns in tears , when the French public shouts “ shame ” in the streets and the sports minister is pushed to the cameras by President Sarkozy to call for team dignity , when the world press snickers , when bank Credit Agricole drops ad sponsorship , and the far right blames “ blacks ” and the far left blames “ millionaire athletes ” – it all amounts to a national crisis , a moment of bitter societal soul - searching .

Just a game ?
Not here .
Jean - Francois Kahn , founder of the weekly Marianne , among others , sees collapse as part of the Sarkozy era : " Listen to sports commentaries … analyzing the cause of our battering in the World Cup … .
one could think they are describing the state of our society or stigmatizing the way we are governed … depicting the Sarkozian power system…arrogance …vanity …contempt . "
Philosopher Alain Finkielkraut however raised the usually taboo French subject of race , bluntly saying , " The French team suffers from ethnic and religious divisions … it is a team of hoodlums ... with mafia ethics … a team of people who do n't " care about France .
In 1998 , France won the World Cup on the strength of its racially diverse team .
A phrase , “ black , blond , buerre [ for Arab ] , ” was coined to represent a model of French social integration , and the image of Zinedine Zidane , the World Cup hero of Algerian parents , got plastered across the Arc de Triomphe .
“ Now we are at the exact opposite of ‘ 98 , when there were hopes that soccer could have a positive social effect , ” says Pap N’diaye of the School for Advanced Studies of the Social Sciences in Paris .
“ Now in France a sense of decline is exacerbated by economics , the fall of the euro…a betrayal by elites felt in some places , and in the midst of this the French national soccer team is in disarray .
Now you hear the words ‘ black , black , black ’ about the team .
Unfortunately , this will spark our ‘ cultural ’ divide ' discussion . ”
France 's participation in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa started badly and has n’t gotten better .
There was guilt over a qualifying win over Ireland when a final goal appeared to involve an illegal helping “ hand ” by player Thierry Henry .
This was followed by a series of scandals involving players moved on and off the team , five - star luxury hotel accommodations , and even charges of sex with a child prostitute by the only white star who happens to be a Muslim convert .
The team practiced and bickered in isolation and there ’s a sense that it never connected with the larger public .
Typically , the coach bears responsibility for the success or failure of a national soccer team .
But in Paris , the suburbs blame the coach , while the city blames the team .
And the tone is bitter .
In Paris today a huge viewing screen set beneath the Eiffel Tower at the Trocadéro is attended by a thunderous drum beat on a cool , cloudless day .
At 4 p.m. ( 10 am EST ) France plays South Africa in a must - win match for each team to stay in the tournament .
As the crowds gather , the atmosphere is one of despair .
“ I feel a little strange about it , ” says Thomas Fourquet who has blogged on the World Cup for British newspapers .
“ It ’s unprecedented , because we do n’t know if we have a team ; will they play or throw it ?
I hope they go for it , but a lot of my friends just hope they crash and we start over . ”

World Cup 101 :
You have to hand it to China for the way it played Obama like a violin .
On Thursday and Friday China Warned Against Finger - Pointing while announcing the " yuan exchange rate of no concern to others " setting a confrontational tone for the G - 20 .
Today , China says Dollar peg is dead and vows yuan flexibility .
China on Saturday said it would gradually make the yuan more flexible , in a gesture that may deflect foreign criticism at next week 's G20 summit , but will not quickly yield a big move by its currency .
" This is an important move as it signals recognition by Chinese officials that a more flexible exchange rate is in China 's own interest and also acknowledges its responsibility to the international community , " said Eswar Prasad , a former head of the IMF 's China division .
" We believe this is a positive gesture , suggesting the yuan will soon resume its appreciation against the dollar , " Goldman Sachs economists Yu Song and Helen Qiao said .
" The global economy is gradually recovering .
The recovery and upturn of the Chinese economy has become more solid with enhanced economic stability , " the Chinese central bank said in a statement on its website .
" It is desirable to proceed further with reform of RMB exchange rate regime and increase the RMB exchange rate flexibility , " it said .
Europe Welcomes China's Move
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the move was " encouraging " and the European Union 's executive said the expected reforms to the exchange rate of the yuan ( also known as the renminbi or RMB ) should have positive repercussions for the euro zone .
" The European Commission welcomes The People 's Bank of China decision to proceed further with the reform of the RMB exchange rate regime and to resume the RMB exchange rate flexibility , " it said in a statement .
" It considers that such a move will be beneficial for both the Chinese economy and the global economy .
The European Commission looks forward to work closely with the Chinese authorities bilaterally and in the G20 to address successfully the current challenges to the global recovery . "
Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin also welcomed the move but said that it would not have much impact on Russia 's economy or trade between the two emerging economies .
Geithner Urges ‘ Vigorous ’ Action
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner called for “ vigorous ” action on China ’s pledge today to allow more currency flexibility , and a leading Senate Democrat demanded more details within days to prevent Congress from pursuing trade sanctions .
“ This is an important step , but the test will be how far and how fast they let the currency appreciate , ” Geithner said in a statement today in Washington .
“ Vigorous implementation would make a positive contribution to strong and balanced global growth . ”
China signaled an end to a 23 - month peg to the dollar that has drawn international criticism and fueled threats of retaliation from U.S. lawmakers including Senator Charles Schumer , who argue that holding down the yuan ’s value unfairly favors Chinese exports .
Geithner has urged China to allow the yuan to appreciate , saying the peg is an impediment to the global recovery .
Schumer , vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress and co-sponsor of legislation that would allow for duties on Chinese imports , said he was dissatisfied with a Chinese statement that did n’t indicate the timing or amount of a yuan adjustment .
“ We hope the Chinese will get more specific in the next few days , ” Schumer said .
“ If not , then for the sake of American jobs and wealth , which are hurt every day by China ’s practices , we will have no choice but to move forward with our legislation . ”

Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu recently announced that " drug cartels " control the area in his county where deputy Louie Puroll was allegedly shot at , and where two men were recently gunned down .
Now Babeu may be getting some assistance from an unwelcome and unsavory source : Vigilantes led by National Socialist Movement member J.T. Ready .
As I blogged back in May , Ready and fellow neo -Nazi Harry Hughes have been going on illegal alien " patrols " in Pinal County 's Vekol Valley , dressed in camouflage and armed with assault rifles .
Now Ready has announced a " Border Ops " alert for this Saturday via his profile on the white supremacist New Saxon site , inviting participants to " bring plenty of firearms and ammo . "
" Camouflage or earth tone clothing [ is ] preferred , " according to the announcement .
" Bandanas , balaclavas , or other identity concealing items are permissible and encouraged . "
Ready 's statement promises that , " This is the Minuteman Project on steroids !
THE INVASION STOPS HERE ! "
I called Ready to ask him if he had informed law enforcement about his operation , which he says will involve other NSM members and include an " incursion " into Mexico .
He said his group has a law enforcement liaison flying in , but it did n't sound like he'd run any of this stunt past the local gendarmes .
" Our statement to law enforcement is to support us , " said Ready .
" With choppers ... with SWAT teams and so forth .
We 're telling them to come down . "
But Ready seemed to think it was time for he and his folks to take matters into their own hands .
" They 're still waiting for the federal government to come in , " scoffed the East Valley Ernst Rohm of the cops and county sheriffs .
" We 're not holding our breaths for that .
We 're exercising our rights .
If they want to step on board with that , they 're welcome to .
If the federal government wants us to stop doing patrols , all they got to do is secure the border . "
Through his press spokesperson , Sheriff Babeu issued a statement that noted , " People from across America are calling and writing to offer their support and even want to come patrol remote areas of the our Pinal County . "
He continued , basically saying to anyone who might want to help -- including Hitler - lovers -- thanks , but no thanks .
" I do not ask or encourage them to come here , " stated Babeu of armed volunteers .
" Securing our international border and fighting these heavily armed smugglers is the responsibility of the federal government .
Local law enforcement can't handle this on our own , yet it will only complicate our concerns to have untrained and armed citizens , who are not from Pinal County - patrolling our desert areas .
We currently have operations that are ongoing and advised to not take law enforcement matter into their own hands . "
Babeu did not specifically address the willingness of neo -Nazis to patrol Pinal County with assault rifles while wearing items to conceal their identities .
Ready claimed that there will be active military involved , which is why they would want to mask themselves .
In his announcement , he says the neo - Nazis will be targeting " armed narco - terrorists ... bringing in loads of chemical warfare into our nation . "
The concern should be that Ready and any others who might participate in this little adventure could end up harming someone on the risible pretense of helping to secure the border .
Ready has a criminal record .
He was twice court - martialed and drummed out of the Marines .
And he has swallowed whole and fully digested the rhetoric of the right - wing lunatic fringe .
The idea of him running around the desert with a high - powered rifle on the hunt for " narco - terrorists " is not a comforting one , to say the least .
The Arizona Anti-Defamation League 's Regional Director Bill Straus also found Ready 's announcement unsettling .
" Number one , it 's one more example of the mainstream and the extreme giving the appearance of moving closer together , " he said .
" Number two , in a volatile environment like we have in Arizona right now , with a volatile issue like this one is , I 'm afraid every day of the possibility of violence occurring .
When J.T. Ready or his ilk want to lead the charge and lead the way on the issue that possibility ramps up immeasurably . "
In other words , let 's hope Sheriff Paul Babeu , the FBI or someone is paying close attention to Ready 's neo -Nazi treks in the desert .
Writing Ready off as a clown is not an option , especially as long as he 's armed .

For those individuals who are morbidly obese , there are multiple types of bariatric procedures available for weight loss .
One general type is known as restrictive bariatric surgery .
This procedure reduces the size of your stomach but does not change your digestive process .
Another category is called malabsorption or malabsorptive procedures .
This type of weight loss surgery shrinks the stomach and also bypass the duodenum and sometimes the jejunum .
The resulting “ malabsorption ” means fewer calories are taken in by your body .
Fewer calories absorbed = greater weight loss .
Restrictive Bariatric Surgery
Restrictive bariatric surgeries include Adjustable Gastric Banding ( AGB ) and Vertical Banded Gastroplasty ( VBG ) .
These procedures do not alter your digestive system ; however they do reduce the amount of food you can ingest .
After the surgery , a person can only eat about one cup of food at a sitting .
If you eat more than the recommended amount you will probably throw up and might also stretch your new stomach , causing the surgery to fail .
Vertical Banded Gastroplasty is also known as stomach staple surgery .
Adjustable Gastric Banding is familiar to many as the Lap Band .
The advantages of the lap banding are fewer complications than other bariatric procedures .
The drawbacks to this procedure are slower weight loss and also the fact that you cannot have other health complications present in order to be approved for lap - banding .
But the process is less invasive than other surgeries , and the lap band can be removed later if the patient so chooses .
Malabsorptive Bariatric Surgery
Malabsorptive bariatric procedures work by reducing the size of the stomach and effectively bypassing the duodenum and sometimes also the jejunum .
Malabsorption weight loss surgery includes Roux - en - Y , commonly called gastric bypass surgery , the Duodenal Switch , the Fobi Pouch , and Biliopancreatic Diversion .
In the Duodenal Switch procedure , the surgeon blocks off part of the stomach , making it smaller .
This reduces the amount of food that can be ingested and also limits calorie absorption .
However , within a few months , a patient can resume eating the same food as they did before ( with certain limitations , of course ) .
New Bariatric Procedures
The latest bariatric procedures are focused on minimally - invasive techniques .
Laparoscopic bariatric surgery was the first of these newer techniques , and the past couple of years have seen the introduction of an improved technique in which endoscopic surgical instruments are inserted through the patient ’s mouth .
Known as StomaphyX™ , a hose - like surgical device is inserted through the mouth , allowing the bariatric surgeon to grasp the stomach tissue and employ suture anchors .
The physician creates several tissue folds in the stomach wall , thereby reducing its capacity to hold food .
In most cases , the StomaphyX procedure can be performed as outpatient surgery .
Potential Risks and Complications of Bariatric Surgery
Surgery for weight loss is a significant even that will change your life .
If you are considering bariatic surgery , you need to fully understand what the operation involves .
Prior to having a procedure done , patients should carefully consider the following benefits and risks .
As with any major surgery , bariatric procedures carry potential risks like bleeding and infection in the incision , bowel blockage caused by scar tissue , hernia through the incision and adverse reactions to anesthesia .
In the case of the Roux - en - Y procedure , the most serious potential risk is fluid leaking from the stomach or intestines , which can result in abdominal infection and the need for follow - up surgery .
There is also a slight possibility of injury to the spleen , leading to its removal if bleeding cannot be controlled .
Some additional risks for Roux - en - Y are directly related to being obese , and include blood clots in the legs or lungs , cardiac problems and pneumonia .
In restrictive / malabsorptive operations , such as the Roux - en -Y and Duodenal Switch with Biliopancreatic Diversion , there is an increased risk for nutritional deficiencies .
This occurs because food bypasses the duodenum and jejunum where calcium , iron and other important vitamins and minerals are primarily absorbed .
Certain women may develop anemia because insufficient vitamin B12 and iron are absorbed .
Furthermore , decreased absorption of calcium can lead to osteoporosis .
It will be necessary for the patient to take vitamins and supplements post - op to prevent these nutritional deficiencies .
For individuals who have Duodenal Switch with Biliopancreatic Diversion surgery , they will also have to take Vitamins A , D , E and K .
Before your weight loss surgery , the doctor will also ask you to lose weight through a medically - supervised diet plan like Optifast .
Another risk of gastric bypass surgery is formation of ulcers in the stomach or small intestine .
There is also the phenomenon called “ dumping syndrome , ” which manifests itself in diarrhea , cramps , sweating , palpitations and vertigo as a result of eating foods high in sugar content .
A small percentage of individuals who have bariatric weight loss surgery end up developing gallstones .
As a matter of fact , during rapid weight loss , the risk of developing gallstones increases .
This can usually prevented by taking a medication which serves as a supplemental source of bile in the initial months after surgery .
Restrictive - only operations , such as the laparoscopic adjustable band , can lead to vomiting .
This is caused when the new , smaller stomach is “ overstretched ” by food that has not been chewed thoroughly .
Although restrictive operations result in weight loss in the vast majority of patients , they are less successful than combined restrictive / malabsorptive operations in achieving significant and lasting weight loss .
Does Insurance Cover Bariatric Surgery ?
Medicare currently reimburses for bariatric procedures on a regional basis and is the primary payer for approximately 20 % of all procedures performed .
There are procedure reimbursement codes for bariatric surgery with prior authorization .
Insurance companies involved in weight loss surgery include Aetna , Blue Cross , Blue Shield , Cigna , First Health , Humana , Principal Financial Group and United Health Care .
Bariatic coverage depends on factors like BMI , related co-morbidities and participation in supervised nutrition programs .
However , some weight loss surgeries are considered cosmetic and likely wo n’t be covered by your insurance .
Be sure to research and thoroughly understand the insurance issues involved before going ahead with any type of bariatric surgery for weight loss .

Recently Mike Karlesky and I spent a week in the Baltimore area leading up a workshop - style training course .
The intent of the workshop was to demonstrate Agile techniques applied in the embedded domain .
As part of the workshop , I created a small GTK application to demonstrate Presenter First and Model - View - Presenter .
( Although a GUI application may not seem particularly embedded , the principle is the same : the view walls off some untestable library ; the presenter and model allow us to test around it . )
GTK turned out to be a good choice , since the events flying out of its widgets were much like the asynchronous events that come out of other windowing toolkits or hardware devices .
And here it is : the aptly named PF Calculator .
Guess what ?
It ’s a calculator .
The calculator ’s functionality is quite limited , in that it can only divide integers , but it still demonstrates Presenter First concepts quite well :
The ApplicationPresenter responds to events from the ApplicationModel and ApplicationView .
responds to events from the and .
The ApplicationView fires events roughly corresponding to events coming from GTK widgets .
Along the way , it does some translation to only relay the relevant information and remove traces of GTK in the event .

The ApplicationModel is used to compute the “ business logic ” ( haha , I love that term , especially when applied in such a silly context ) .
The Model delegates to the NumberValidator to get some help when needed .

The Model delegates to the to get some help when needed .
And last ( but not least ) , all of the above code was written Presenter First .
Everything is implemented in C .
Here are a few notes about the implementation :
In a language with automatic object construction , I ’d have the Presenters wire up their events in their constructor methods .
Since that strategy is n’t available here , I ’ve instead implemented a Presenters_RegisterForEvents function .
The purpose of the function is to rip through all of the Presenters and tell them to RegisterEvents .
It would be trivial to have the build system automatically generate this file in a project with many Presenters .

I only support one subscriptor to any single event .
This is because I did n’t feel like implementing a bounded array or linked list to hold the function pointers .
I did see something about a GSList data structure available in the GLib documentation , but I never got around to trying it out .

I call the gtk_init function in main before firing up the application .
I ’m not wild about this GTK - specific knowledge leaking outside of the view , but for this very simple example , it was the cleanest way to handle this detail .
In a real project I ’d strive to keep GTK specifics confined to views .
I depend on a number of libraries and tools to get them job done .
More notes :
I ’m using the Ceedling build and test harness developed by Mike Karlesky , Greg Williams , and Mark VanderVoord .
Ceedling gives me easy access to unit testing via Unity , C mock generation via CMock , and C exceptions via CException .
Ceedling also weaves everything together to create the executables .
Ceedling has n’t had a 1.0 release yet , but the code available from the Sourceforge project is quite functional .
I used this project as an excuse to monkey around with the PCRE library .
I did n’t use it extensively , but it was enough to get a taste .
It turns out PCRE is tasty .

I did n’t use it extensively , but it was enough to get a taste .
It turns out is tasty .
I also recently heard about bstring and tried it out .
Again , I did n’t use it for much , but enough such that I ’m sold on it .
Warning : I have n’t tried to build this code on anything other than my personal Linux system , so I ca n’t say how portable it is .
Here are some details about my system :
The Linux distribution is Ubuntu 10.04 .
The GTK development files have been installed via the libgtk2.0 - dev package .
development files have been installed via the libgtk2.0 - dev package .
The PCRE development files have been installed via the libpcre3 - dev package .
development files have been installed via the libpcre3 - dev package .
bstring is bundled with the project .
The build system relies on Ruby and Rake .
The build system uses pkg-config commands to gather the build flags for PCRE and GTK .
Hopefully this means it will be easier to build the project on an arbitrary system .
To build and run the application , type rake .
To run all the tests , type rake test : all .
To test an individual module , like ApplicationModel , type rake test : ApplicationModel.c .
Big thanks to Mike Karlesky for assisting with Ceedling , CMock , and Unity .
Also thanks to Greg Williams and Mark VanderVoord for helping develop this great software .

The decision comes amid anti-Israeli protests after Israeli raids on aid ships
A court in Cairo has upheld a ruling urging the government to consider stripping Egyptian men who are married to Israeli women of their citizenship .
The ruling requires officials to send all such cases to the cabinet , to be decided on an individual basis .
The interior ministry had appealed against the original ruling , made by a lower court last year .
The new decision is seen as a sign of negative feeling towards Israel in Egypt , despite a 1979 peace treaty .
Anti-Israeli sentiment is high in the country in the aftermath of Israeli raids on Gaza aid ships - but the long - scheduled court decision was not connected .
It calls on the cabinet to determine whether to remove the nationality of the men concerned , as well as that of their children .
The court said the government should consider whether the Israeli woman was an Arab or a Jew .
It is estimated that about 30,000 Egyptians are married to Israeli women .
' Disloyal '
The lawyer who brought the case , Nabih el - Wahsh , said it was aimed at protecting Egyptian youth and Egypt 's national security .
He says that offspring of marriages between Egyptian men and Israeli women should not be allowed to perform military service .
There should not be a new generation " disloyal to Egypt and the Arab world " , he said .
The appeal was sent by the government after a verdict last year stated the 1976 article of citizenship law should be implemented .
That law requires the stripping of citizenship of those who married Israelis who have served in the army or embraced Zionism .
Negad al - Borai , an Egyptian lawyer and a human rights activist , said he was " surprised " by the verdict and that the government was sending out mixed messages about Israel .
" The president congratulates Israel 's president in national holidays yet it punishes the people for having relationships with Israel , " he told Reuters news agency .
" Egyptian law says citizenship can only be revoked if the citizen is proven to be spying on his country , and this verdict considers marrying an Israeli an act of spying " .
It was a decision that some believe helped set the table for this year ’s transportation - focused city elections and proved a turning point for Toronto ’s cycling community .
With the installation of bike lanes on Jarvis St. , beginning on Friday , motorists and cyclists will be able to gauge the impact of last year ’s hard - fought battle to remove the reversible centre lane in favour of bikes .
Partial road closures and lane reductions between Queen and Charles Sts. through the week of July 26 , will inevitably stoke the anger of motorists who waged a loud battle against the scheme .
The paint and the dismantling of the signals over the centre lane will only cost about $ 65,000 .
But Daniel Egan , Toronto ’s manager of pedestrian and cycling infrastructure , says the 2009 controversy over the bike lanes “ was overblown . ”
“ It was pitched as a war against cars — quite frankly it ’s going to be a four - lane arterial road like every other street downtown .
That ( reversible ) centre lane did cause a lot of confusion , ” he said .
The summer is a good time to install the lanes because there ’s less traffic .
But once the traffic flow returns and people have had a chance to get used to the new lanes in the fall the city will be assessing the impact on bike and car traffic , said Egan .
The Jarvis bike lanes were a significant victory for the newly formed Toronto Cyclists Union and a turning point for the city ’s cycling community , said Yvonne Bambrick , executive director .
Council ’s vote on the issue happened on the first day of Bike Month so there were many cyclists at Nathan Phillips Square that day , who went inside to watch council .
“ We were engaging cyclists and everyday citizens in how city politics functions which was a big step and also it showed just how interested all kinds of different cyclists from all different parts of Toronto are in seeing the streets become more bike friendly , ” Bambrick said .
Since then there have been more victories for the cycling movement including the introduction next year of a bike sharing program like the one in Montreal .
Advocates are working to persuade 1,000 Torontonians to commit to the $ 95 annual membership fee that will enable them to access 1,000 bikes at 80 downtown Toronto stations .
Getting that many people to sign up in advance will be the city ’s biggest challenge , said Egan , who has no doubt that it will be over - subscribed once it ’s underway .
Montreal ’s Bixie program started with 2,400 bikes and expanded to 5,000 this year .
Where cycling in Toronto goes from here will depend on the outcome of the election .
Mayoral candidate Rocco Rossi restated his intention Thursday to take bike lanes off Jarvis if he ’s elected .

“ The math does n’t work .
There are almost 30,000 cars a day that use Jarvis , rain or shine , winter or summer , ” he said .
Bikes , now scarce on Jarvis , could go one block over to Sherbourne and use the lanes there to travel north - south .
Not every city street can accommodate every user , he said .
Wagah border ceremony aggression toned down Published duration 22 July 2010
media caption BBC archive footage of the Wagah border ceremony
Indian and Pakistani border guards have done away with aggressive gestures during the daily ceremonial " retreat " ceremony on the border at Wagah .
For 45 minutes every day at sunset the guards high - kick , stamp , speed march and bawl their way through a choreographed routine .
It ends in the lowering of both flags and the slamming of the border gates .
The display has become a huge tourist attraction , drawing thousands of spectators every evening .
' Leg injuries '
The border guards in the ceremony , which began in 1959 , belong to India 's Border Security Force ( BSF ) and Pakistan Rangers .
Now both sides have decided to water down the belligerent tone after a request by India two months ago , according to a spokesman of Pakistan Rangers .
Nadim Raza told the BBC : " India 's BSF had requested the toning down of aggression in the ceremony at Wagah , and started practising it a couple of months ago .
We have decided to respond . "
" But we will only change the ' fist gesture ' .
No thumb would be shown and aggressive looks will be replaced with a proper handshake and a smile . "
He said the Pakistani guards would " continue with foot - pressing and leg - stretching drill because it is the pride of a soldier and a symbol of his fitness " .
A senior BSF officer said India had made several earlier attempts to tone down the " hostility " in the drill but the Pakistan Rangers had refused to alter their routine , too , until recently .
image caption Crowds of onlookers cheer every warlike strut and goose - step
" We have finally agreed to reduce much of the aggressive posturing that had been part of the retreat ceremony up until now , " Himmat Singh told the BBC .
India has also deployed women guards to participate in the ceremony .
The retreat has been made a much more cordial affair with the exclusion of key gestures like the dramatically extended arm , the clenched fist with the thumb held skywards .
Some reports say that the Indians decide to tone down the aggressive moves as it was affecting the health of their guards .
But Nadim Raza said that the drill " never causes leg injuries in soldiers " .
Peace talks between Delhi and Islamabad froze after the 2008 militant attacks on Mumbai - which Pakistan later admitted were partly planned on its soil .
Dialogue has resumed over recent months , although with little progress .
" We were all slightly surprised when it did .
Since then we ’ve done several rehearsals with the cows .
It saves us having to book rehearsal space and the farmer ’s very pleased to get more milk . ”
Federal campaign contributions from lobbyists are slightly down this election cycle compared to the same time period before the last midterm election .
But Democrats are pulling in more lobbyist cash — just as Republicans did when they held the majority in both houses of Congress .
Twenty - eight members of Congress and congressional candidates have received at least $ 100,000 from lobbyists during the first five quarters of the 2010 election cycle , a Center for Responsive Politics analysis shows .
The six - figure recipients include more Democrats than Republicans — 18 to 10 — but regardless of party , almost all of these recipients hold a leadership position in the House or Senate .
The rest were long - tenured members of Congress or , like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D - N.Y. ) , came from large states where it ’s more expensive to run for office .
The numbers include both donations from individual lobbyists and political action committees of lobbying firms .
During the last midterm election cycle in 2006 — just before the Democrats took back control of the House and Senate — 36 members of Congress and congressional challengers received at least $ 100,000 from lobbyists during the first five quarters of the cycle .
Sen. Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) and Sen. Blanche Lincoln ( D - Ark. ) — both facing tough re-election battles — rank first and third among recipients of lobbyist money this cycle .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) and both parties ’
House leaders and whips have received at least $ 100,000 as well .
Dave Wenhold , president of the American League of Lobbyists , said it ’s not surprising that well - established politicians dominate the list .
“ That ’s just kind of the way it goes , ” he said .
“ Some of these younger people … a lot of them have n’t really made their positions known .
They ’re kind of going along with party lines so you need to figure out where they are . ”
Wenhold said lawmakers frequently invite lobbyists to fundraisers .
“ We ’re not out there actively soliciting to give this money away .
The members of Congress are asking for it , ” he said .
“ Of course , you ca n’t ban anybody from donating , but members of congress could simply stop asking registered lobbyists for donations . ”
Melanie Sloan of the watchdog organization Citizens for Responsible Ethics in Washington disagreed .
“ Without the money you do n’t have the access , ” Sloan said .
“ Without the money , no one ’s listening to you in the first place . ”
Sloan said lobbyists are important to crafting good legislation , but she suggested that lobbyists could simply decide to stop making donations .
During the first five quarters of the 2006 election cycle , candidates collected slightly more campaign cash from lobbyists — $ 16.7 million , compared to just under $ 15 million this cycle .
The party with the majority in Congress also collected more campaign contributions at both times .
Republicans had collected more than $ 10 million during the first five quarters of the 2006 cycle , but they have managed a little more than half that sum this cycle .
Democrats upped their take by about $ 3 million compared to the first five quarters of the 2006 cycle to $ 9.3 million .
Party 2006 # of
Candidates 2010 # of
Candidates Republicans $ 10,279,315 346 $ 5,500,003 325 Democrats $ 6,358,265 336 $ 9,319,944 361 Independents $ 80,785 2 $ 167,783 1
Some say those numbers could change in the last two quarters of this year as Republicans hoping to take back the House attempt to use their potential majority power as leverage .
The lawmakers with at least $ 100,000 in lobbyist contributions are notable for their clout .
Lincoln , for instance , chairs the Senate Committee on Agriculture , Nutrition and Forestry and included language restricting trading in derivatives in financial reform legislation originating from her committee .
The derivatives language became a target for lobbyists of the banking industry this year as Congress debated financial reform legislation .
Nonetheless , the senator ranks third among recipients of lobbyist contributions in Congress this cycle .
She ranks seventeenth overall among all members of Congress since the 1990 election cycle .
Lincoln has served in the Senate since 1998 and before that served two terms in the House of Representatives .
She became the chair of the agricultural committee in September 2009 and sat on the conference committee for financial regulation legislation this summer .
“ Sen . Lincoln ’s public policy decisions are not influenced by campaign contributions , ” Lincoln spokesman Charlie Gocio told OpenSecrets Blog in a written statement .
“ She has proven that she is an independent voice who stands up to special interests on behalf of Arkansans . ”
With such power can come riches from lobbyists , said Craig Holman , legislative representative for Public Citizen .
“ They ’re giving money for influence , ” Holman said .
“ They ’re not giving money for ideology or party ID . ”
Both Sloan and Holman named the Fair Elections Now Act as the only concrete alternative to the current campaign finance system under consideration .
This legislation would create a voluntary system of public financing for congressional races .
Holman said some lobbying firms have endorsed the legislation , but they are among the minority .
“ Many lobbyists are not actually sincere when they say they would favor a different system like public financing , ” Holman said .
“ Their clout comes from their money and they actually work hard to throw their money at the feet of candidates . ”
Employees of lobbying firms rank among the top 10 contributors for eight lawmakers : Sen. Richard Burr ( R - N.C. ) , Rep. Roy Blunt ( R - Mo. ) , Rep. Kendrick Meek ( D - Fla. ) , Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R - Alaska ) , Sen. Bob Bennett ( R - Utah ) , Rep. James Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) , Sen. Patty Murray ( D - Wa. ) , Sen. Daniel Inouye ( D - Hawaii ) and Sen. Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) .
One firm stood out above the rest .
WPP Group has given more money to federal candidates and committees this cycle than any other lobbying shop — with more than $ 850,000 in contributions .
During the 2008 election cycle , the firm contributed nearly $ 1.9 million overall to federal candidates , parties and committees .
WPP Group ranked among the top 10 contributors of five of the 28 lawmakers who have received six - figures or more from lobbyists this cycle .
Its subsidiary Prime Policy Group represents entities such as AT&T , the American Medical Association , the American Petroleum Institute and Boeing .
Lobbyists from Prime Policy have been active in donating and fundraising for federal candidates of both parties as documented by the Center for Responsive Politics and the Sunlight Foundation ’s Political Party Time blog .
Gabe Rozsa , a Prime Policy lobbyist , hosted a fundraiser for Utah ’s Bennett in July of 2009 with a suggested donation for hosts of $ 2,000 per PAC at the headquarters of the firm .
Prime Policy ’s Marty Paone , similarly , hosted a breakfast fundraiser for Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) at the Monocle seafood and steak restaurant near the Senate in April of last year .
The suggested contribution for hosts was $ 4,800 from individuals or $ 5,000 from a PAC .
Despite the lavish locations of some fundraisers , Wenhold of the American League of Lobbyists insists many lobbyists would drop the current campaign finance system if they could .
“ They [ members of Congress ] do n’t want to be at three fundraisers on Wednesday night , ” he said .
“ They should be doing something with their family or in the House passing good legislation .
The lobbyists do n’t want to be at a fundraiser either .
It ’s bad food , bad beer and you ’re missing your kid ’s football game . ”
Here is the full list of the federal politicians who have raised more than $ 100,000 from lobbyists between January 1 , 2009 , and March 30 , 2010 .

* Baidu to hire software engineers from U.S. in July
* First such overseas hires ( Adds quotes , background )
SHANGHAI , June 29 ( Reuters ) - Baidu Inc , China ’s leading search engine , will start hiring software engineers directly from the United States early next month , as it seeks to expand its technological capabilities and raise its global profile .
Baidu BIDU.O stands to be the biggest beneficiary in China 's search sector after Google Inc GOOG .
O relocated its China servers to Hong Kong following a high - profile spat with Beijing over censorship and hacking .
Baidu would hire 30 mid-to senior - level software engineers from Silicon Valley at a job fair on July 10 to drive new technology projects , its first direct hiring from the United States , a Baidu spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday .
“ Baidu believes that talent is the key to our success as a company , and we go where ever the best talent can be found , whether here in China or in Silicon Valley , ” Zheng Bin , Baidu ’s human resources director said in a statement to Reuters .
“ As we develop more and more advanced search technologies , our need for world - class talent will only continue to increase . ”
Baidu is a household name in China but not well known overseas .
Baidu Japan , the firm ’s venture into the Japanese search market , has been loss - making ever since its inception .
The hiring is significant as it shows that Baidu , traditionally domestically focused , is eager to raise its profile overseas and plug into talent outside China .
The move also comes as other Chinese Internet firms , such as Tencent Holdings 0700 .HK , China 's largest Internet firm by market value , are starting to invest overseas .
Analysts expect Baidu to win as much as half of Google China ’s search revenue , which could add as much as $ 330 million annually to Baidu ’s top line , representing a more than 50 percent increase on 2009 revenue of 4.45 billion yuan ( $ 654.8 million ) .
[ ID : nTOE60C026 ]
The migration to a new search keyword system has also fuelled revenue growth , leading to the need for more software engineers , said a Baidu spokesman .
In an archetypal rags - to - riches tech story , Baidu was founded by Robin Li , who started the firm in a 3 - star hotel room in Beijing .
The search giant , whose name is taken from an ancient poem , now dominates the world ’s biggest Internet market , with more than 60 percent market share by revenue and about 75 percent by traffic .
Baidu shares are up 80 percent since the start of the year compared with the Nasdaq ’s 2 percent fall .
It now trades at a rich forward 2010 price earnings ratio of 61 times , more than triple that of Google .

How careless , we ’d forgotten to configure log rotation .
So our application had gone with a default designed for a less verbose age , rotating files as soon as they exceeded a megabyte in size , and never throwing any of them away .
Oh , and it was putting these log files at the root of the file system where they ’d somehow gone unnoticed for some time .
As a consequence , the file system had become clogged up with squillions of files .
$ cd / $ ls ... server.log.736624 server.log.736625 server.log.736626 server.log.736627 ...
How many files , exactly ?
$ ls | wc -l ^C
No time to wait .
Too many !
We had to act fast .
We changed the log rotate configuration to something more appropriate , restarted the application , and set about cleaning up .
Now , this is when you do n’t want to open a file browser and drag files into trash can , not unless you like watching egg - timers .
The desktop metaphor fails when you have squillions of files on your desk .
Alarmingly , the shell complains too .
$ rm server.log .* - bash : / bin/rm : Argument list too long
At this point , a clear head and a steady hand is needed .
I use pathname expansion and rm all the time and I ’m confident the commands I type will have the right effect .
But in my current situation — as root user , in the root directory , on a machine running an unfamiliar flavour of Unix , about to combine find with xargs and rm — I grow nervous .
How to stop find from descending ?
- Maxdepth , I think , but level 0 or 1 ?
Is - print required ?
Should I create a scratch directory and practise .
Enough questions already !
Are you a man or a man ( 1 ) reader ?
$ find / - maxdepth 1 - name ' server.log .*' | xargs rm -f
Done !
Now that Helen Hitler Thomas has been forcibly retired , more video of the interview miraculously has become available for viewing :
Here ’s the “ appalling ” transcript :
Q : Any advice for these young people over here for starting out in the press corps ?
Thomas :
Go for it .
You ’ll never be unhappy .
You ’ll always keep people informed , you ’ll always keep learning .
The greatest thing of the profession is you ’ll never stop learning .
Q : Today they are covering the Jewish Heritage Month .
Thomas : … and meet the President .
A : Any comments on Israel ?
We ’re asking everyone today , any comments on ..
Thomas :
Tell them to get the hell out of Palestine .
Q : Oooh .
Any better comments ?
Thomas : Remember , these people are occupied , and it ’s their land .
It ’s not German and it ’s not Poland .
Q : So where should they go , what should they do ?
Thomas :
They can go home .
Q : Where is home ?
Thomas : Poland .
Germany .
Q : So you are saying Jews should go back to Poland ?
Thomas : And America and everywhere else .
Why push people out who have lived their for centuries ?
See ?
Q : Now , are you familiar with the history of that region and what took place ?
Thomas :
Very much .
I ’m of Arab background .
{ It goes on for a little while with friendly banter about languages they both speak with words I can not even begin to spell .} Q : Thank you .
Thomas :
All the best to you ( directed at the Jewish students ) .
Go for it - go for journalism , you ’ll never regret it .
Clearly , this woman is evil beyond words .
The way she smiled at those Jewish kids while giving them friendly advice to enter careers in journalism so they can have fulfilling lives of learning and accomplishment when secretly , I have been assured by liberals and others , what she really wants is to transport them back to the gas ovens of the Holocaust ( for the morons - see the update ) .
You guys got played .
And by this jackass , running around doing Mexican impressions in his spare time .
Does anyone still want to try to pretend she was suggesting people be time - warped back to Auschwitz ?
Or that her pleasantly offering advice to Jewish students was horrifying anti-Semitism at work ?
Anyone ?
On the upside , no one is talking about the unpleasantness with the flotilla anymore .
*** Update ***
For the folks with comprehension problems , the sarcasm employed regarding her chatting with the students is directed at the foolish notion she was implying folks should head off to the ovens , not to deflect from what I have repeatedly stated were her idiotic and obnoxious remarks .
There seems to be some desire in every one of these pile - ons to turn stupid remarks by someone into something altogether unforgivable .
I ’m reminded of the time I spent days arguing that no , Republican Bill Bennett was n’t actually suggesting that all black babies be aborted in order to lower the crime rate .
Grow up .
What Thomas said was stupid enough .
She ’s lost her job .
There is no reason to pretend she was implying people should be sent off to Nazi Germany or Poland and be exterminated .
Quit making things up and impugning those who are n’t into playing your games .
I think ( again , as I have stated repeatedly ) , the state of Israel and her citizens have every right to exist .
I do n’t think , however , that criticism of policies of the state of Israel are somehow verboten .
Other things have changed notably for the better in American - Israeli relations since Mr. Netanyahu called off his last visit to the White House to rush home to deal with the crisis after Israel ’s deadly attack on a humanitarian aid flotilla sailing to Gaza in late May .
His agreement to ease the land blockade on Gaza , which came at the request of the United States , has helped thaw the chill between the governments , American and Israeli officials said .
Meanwhile , the raft of new sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program , after the passage of the United Nations resolution , has reassured Israelis , who viewed Mr. Obama ’s attempts to engage Iran with unease .
Mr. Obama signed the American sanctions into law on Thursday .
“ The overall tone is more of a feel - good visit than we ’ve seen in the past , ” said David Makovsky , director of the Project on the Middle East Peace Process at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
“ It has been more focused on making sure that the Ides of March have passed . ”
He was referring to the dispute during a visit to Israel by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in March , when Israel approved plans for Jewish housing in East Jerusalem .
Mr. Obama was enraged by what he perceived as a slight to Mr. Biden , and when Mr. Netanyahu visited a few weeks later , the White House showed its displeasure by banning cameras from recording the visit .
But despite the better atmospherics , some analysts said the nuclear nonproliferation issue symbolizes why Israel remains insecure about the intentions of the Obama administration .
In addition to singling out Israel , the document , which has captured relatively little public attention , calls for a regional conference in 2012 to lay the groundwork for a nuclear - free zone in the Middle East .
Israel , whose nuclear arsenal is one of the world ’s worst - kept secrets , would be on the hot seat at such a meeting .
Gail Warrior planned to use the Russian she studied in college to help her open an accounting firm in the former Soviet Union .
Instead , she is chief executive and president of the Warrior Group , a company with $ 124 million in revenue and 58 employees that is based in DeSoto , Tex. , and handles modular construction projects in 30 states .
“ Life happens , ” said Ms. Warrior , 42 .
She recently discussed the deal that almost put her out of business , the nuances of winning government contracts and the balancing act of being a newly divorced parent to a 10 - year - old son .
A condensed version of the conversation follows .
Q. Why construction ?
A. I know how to run a successful business , and this one happens to be in construction .
I always wanted to be an entrepreneur and grew up working in my dad ’s business .
He was an ex-Army man who had one of the first African - American - owned insurance agencies in Dallas and was very successful .
That ’s how I learned the ins and outs of running a business  how to treat employees , how to deal with disappointments .
I saw a lot at an early age .
It toughened me up .
Q. What led you to start Warrior Group ?
A . My husband at the time and I were looking for our next big adventure .
Our friends owned a manufacturer of modular buildings .
Over dinner one night , they suggested that we start selling modular construction services to the federal government .
In 1997 , we opened our first Warrior Group office inside their manufacturing plant .
Q. What was it like to work with your spouse ?
A . My ex-husband and I always worked well together because we had different strengths and clearly defined roles .
He handled business development  he could sell a pair of glasses to a blind man .
I ’m better at long - term strategy and keeping costs down .
I ’m all over that .
Federal Communications Minister Stephen Conroy has given a pre-election undertaking not to broaden the Government 's proposed level of internet censorship .
Senator Conroy says the scope of the content covered by the Government 's proposed mandatory filter will not be widened by a future Labor government .
" We 're making it very clear , this is our policy : refused classification only , " Mr Conroy told the ABC's Four Corners program .
" If a majority of the Parliament in the future want to broaden the classification , well then , Australians should stand up and say ' just a minute ' , and I 'll be one of them . "
Eighteen months ago Senator Conroy galvanised his critics by suggesting that the scope of a mandatory internet filter would include any online material that was deemed to be " prohibited content " by the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) .
" You ca n't opt in or out of the prohibited material , " he said at the time .
Prohibited material includes not just Refused Classification and X - rated content , but also any R - 18 + and MA - 15 + content that is not protected by an ACMA - approved age - verification gateway restricting access to underage users .
However , last December , Senator Conroy announced the revised secret blacklist of material to be censored by internet service providers ( ISPs ) would be limited to individual webpages that had been refused classification by the Classification Board .
Refused classification material includes child pornography and detailed instruction in crime or drug use .
But it also includes any material that the Classification Board judges will " offend against the standards of morality , decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults " .
Critics of the mandatory filter say the category is far too broad .
Polarised debate
Jim Wallace of the Australian Christian Lobby says he finds it " quite amazing " that anyone would oppose the filter plans .
" The material that the Government is looking to block is illegal material , " he told Four Corners .
" I think if people believe that they should be using child pornography , bestiality material , sexual violence or instructions to crime , then really somebody somewhere should be raising a file on them .
" The bigger principle here is to establish the principle that the internet is not a free zone and I think that given the movement of technology and given the expectation of society that what the Government is proposing is therefore a good solution . "
On the other side of the debate , Google Australia 's head of policy , Iarla Flynn , says the proposed mandatory filter goes too far .
" It 's a heavy - handed measure , " he said .
" Our primary concern is that the scope of content which the Government is seeking to block is too wide .
Remember , this would apply to every internet user in Australia , whether they like it or not . "
Legislation to introduce a mandatory internet filter is unlikely to come before Parliament before the next election .
But Senator Conroy has made it clear he remains committed to its introduction .
Blacklist concerns
Critics of the filter point to several examples of web content that they say could be blocked under a mandatory filter .
Pages about safe injecting and sites giving tips on how to create graffiti are among those that could be blocked .
Senator Conroy told Four Corners he will not be deciding what is on the list .
" Individual pages will be determined by - at arm 's length from government - by the Classification Board , as it should be , " he said .
" Stephen Conroy and the Government do not make the individual decisions . "
Also liable to be blocked are web pages giving advice on assisted suicide .
The online version of the Peaceful Pill Handbook , written by euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke , has been refused classification .
It can be accessed online from Australia now because the website is hosted overseas .
Under a mandatory filter however , it will be blocked from view here , but remain visible to internet users overseas .
Critics of the filter say elements of some extremely popular adult websites may also be censored in future .
The vast majority of adult material on the internet is hosted overseas , and is not directly regulated by ACMA .
One adult film which could be blocked online is called Pirates II : Stagnetti's Revenge .
Fiona Patten of the Australian Sex Party describes it as " a very mainstream adult film " .
This film , which is hosted on websites across the world , is sold in Australian sex shops in two separate parts because it depicts sexual acts , and because there is also violence in the film .
But Ms Patten argues the violence is not sexual violence .
" We 're talking cartoon ghosts , cartoon skeletons fighting and pirates having sword - fights , " she said .
" So all of that sort of action and adventure scenes had to be put into one disc , and all of the sex scenes put into another disc .
This is the only country in the world where this film is split like this and has to be seen separately . "
Ms Patten says that if attempts had been made to sell the film unedited it would have been refused classification .
The Classification Board confirmed this view .
" Within the context of actual sex , violence cannot be accommodated , and therefore the film , if it contained actual sex and violence , would have been refused classification , " it said .
In future Ms Patten argues every website where the film can be viewed will be liable to be blocked by the Government 's mandatory filter .
Election promises
Other critics of the policy , speaking on Four Corners , point to the policy changes that have occurred since Labor announced a family - friendly cyber - safety policy before the last election .
That policy promised that : " A Rudd Labor Government will require ISPs to offer a clean feed internet service to all homes , schools and public internet points accessible by children , such as public libraries .
" Labor 's ISP policy will prevent Australian children from accessing any content that has been identified as prohibited by ACMA , including sites such as those containing child pornography and X - rated material . "
The Government has now accepted that it will not be possible to mandate ISPs to provide a broad - brush clean feed internet service in this way .
In defending its current policy to limit the scope of censored online material to content which has been refused classification , Senator Conroy concedes that " if you try and do a broader range of things at the mandatory level , then you are likely to have a serious impact on the speed of the internet " .
Colin Jacobs , vice - chair of Electronic Frontiers Australia , says the current plan has no cyber - safety benefit and is a clear move away from the policy Labor originally promised .
Chief executive of the Internet Industry Association Peter Coroneos agrees .
" A lot of the content that families really are concerned about for their children - things like violent material , racial hatred material , material which promotes race hate , maybe even just adult content that you would n't want your children to see - none of that will be picked up by this filtering solution , " he said .
Voluntary scheme ruled out
The Government has also conceded that it will not be able to censor high - traffic websites like YouTube and that the filter will be possible to circumvent .
Even so , Senator Conroy is refusing to follow the example of other countries , such as the UK , Canada and New Zealand , by agreeing to limit the scope of the filter to child pornography and by allowing ISPs to filter out child pornography on a voluntary basis .
Mr Coroneos told Four Corners he has approached the Minister offering a voluntary scheme .
" We 've actually approached the government on several occasions to propose a solution that would be consistent with best practice in other jurisdictions , " he said .
" But for whatever reasons , the government is intent on pursuing a legislative course here . "
Senator Conroy is determined to legislate .
" They do n't need me to invite them , firstly , they could just do it , " he said .
" They could have announced it five years ago .
They could have announced it 10 years ago .
They could have announced it yesterday .
They 've got a policy opposing any form of voluntary ISP filtering of anything . "
Senator Conroy told Four Corners he and the United States Government are " going to agree to disagree " on the issue of a mandatory internet filter .
The US State Department has raised concerns about the proposal with the Australian Government .
While standing firm on his intent to legislate , Senator Conroy does concede that he has been troubled by the secrecy of the blacklist which will contain the list of webpages to be blocked if a mandatory filter is introduced .
" One of the things I 've really struggled with , genuinely struggled with , is this argument that you should publish the list , " he said .
" Because unlike with books or movie titles , when you publish those you do n't give access to the material .
" The problem is if you publish a webpage address , you give direct access to the material . "

There has been a lot of talk about digital forms of payment replacing cash and even credit cards .
But MasterCard intends to stay in the middle of the technological innovation .
On Tuesday , MasterCard announced that it would let software developers use its technology in their own online apps and on mobile phones .
“ A big part of the strategy is to be able to harness the innovation of others in the developer community to really push our business forward , ” said Josh Peirez , MasterCard ’s chief innovation officer .
E-commerce and mobile payments are changing the way we use money , Mr. Peirez said .
Though MasterCard , Visa and other payment companies have experimented with building their own apps for things like mobile money transfers , MasterCard wants to see what other people can come up with for paying online and in the real world .
“ You ’re seeing quite different ways people are paying for digital goods , but you have n’t really seen that translate into physical goods , ” he said .
“ It ’s still really hard to buy a physical item from your phone . ”
MasterCard has already built a few apps , including the MasterCard ATM Hunter iPhone app .
But if outside developers wanted to use its payment technology , they have had to get a merchant agreement , set up the payment system and make the consumer enter data each time .
No one wants to do that .
Developers could use the new open platform to embed a payment feature in virtual games or in e-commerce apps on Twitter or Facebook , or to build an app that sends a text message to the card ’s owner before a purchase is made , for instance .
But the most creative uses of MasterCard ’s technology will be those that MasterCard has n’t even thought of , Mr. Peirez said .
MasterCard is following in the footsteps of PayPal , which opened its platform late last year .
Developers have built apps like MyHomie , a Web app for roommates and families with to - do lists , calendars and a bill payment system , and GoSqueesh , a group buying service like Groupon .
So far , MasterCard has identified about 20 of its services that developers will be able to use in their applications .
They include payment technology , bill payment systems and data streams like consumer spending patterns , which could be used to send coupons .
This is the first project to come out of MasterCard Labs , the research and development group that the company started in April .
Developers will be able to tap into the platform by the end of the year .
MasterCard is also working on a way to share the revenue that developers get from payments .
We hear gasps that grow more and more frequent , as our protagonist finds it progressively difficult to breathe .
Unbearable and steadily increasing anxiety suffuses the air .
As we contemplate the nervewracking spectacle , goosebumps speckle our soul .
Finally , the unanswerable question of the ages bursts forth from frothing lips :
" Why , dear God , oh , why , why , why are we in Afghanistan ? "
Our protagonist presses the back of one hand to his forehead as he casts his eyes beseechingly toward heaven , in the classic pose from melodrama denoting the futility of all man 's efforts when faced with an implacably hostile universe .
The other hand grasps his chest , vainly attempting to provide succor and strength to his faltering heart .
After a few moments , he weakly extends his arms toward us , as if to beg for deliverance from his intellectual torments .
Finally , he slowly collapses to the floor , his body lifeless , his soul shattered , defeated by life 's excruciating burden , undone by the question that forbids satisfactory response .
Being There .
( I ) : Introduction , and Numerous Errors on the First Level of Analysis Our first episode ended with an intolerably suspenseful cliffhanger :
Why is the United States in Afghanistan ?
No , no .
That simply wo n't do .
It 's far too dry and detached in presentation .
Let 's try to bring it closer in spirit to the form in which we commonly encounter this damnably vexing question .
It usually goes more like this ( I 've provided detailed stage directions , to help make what is always an especially charming moment comefor you , dear reader ) :
Are we able to provide assistance to this beleaguered soul ?
To judge from most commentary , we are not .
( Numerous examples of such commentary will soon be offered ; many of them are remarkably akin to this profoundly unnerving scene , one surely destined for inclusion among classic horror vignettes . )
Our protagonist must perish !
Woe , woe unto us .
Or untoat least .
Ah , butare not " most commentary . "
Yes , we are also arrogant .
Most unfortunately for you , our insufferability shall not prevent us from proceeding .
To answer this question of questions , one which the vast majority of writers and commentators repeatedly insist is perhaps the most impenetrable mystery in the entire universe ( and undoubtedly not justuniverse ) , let 's begin with a simple maxim : Geography is your friend .
Take a look at this map .
Consider it for a minute or two .
It 's a close - up view of Afghanistan and the surrounding area , showing just that country and its immediate neighbors .
Who are those neighbors ?
Immediately to the south and east ( and sharing a very long border ) is Pakistan , with India just beyond .
Also to the east , and sharing a short border with Afghanistan , is China .
To the north are three of the ' Stans : Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan and Tajikistan .
Beyond the ' Stans ( take a look at a wider view ) are Russia to the north , and China once again to the northeast .
Directly to the west , and also sharing a long border with Afghanistan , is Iran .
We recapitulate for emphasis and clarity : Pakistan , India , the three ' Stans , Russia , China and Iran .
Perhaps your torment begins to ease .
In terms of Afghanistan is a critical gateway to almost all the countries that are of greatest concern to the United States government today .
If you look again at the wider view , you 'll see that Afghanistan is right smack in the middle of everything .
This geographical fact about Afghanistan has placed that unfortunate region right smack in the middle of campaigns of conquest throughout history .
Alexander the Great spent time in Afghanistan , as undoubtedly did other lesser - known leaders who predated him .
If you come by land from Europe , Africa or the Middle East and you wish to get to the major part of the Asian land mass or the Indian subcontinent , chances are you 'll go directly through Afghanistan .
It 'sSo I repeat : means that Afghanistan is going to be of immense importance to those bent on dominion and control over large portions of the globe .
Please note that this is quite apart from any natural resources that might be found in Afghanistan .
Indeed , throughout much of history and long before the region was called Afghanistan , no resources were known to be there ( except perhaps for human resources , but there were n't many of those either , certainly not compared to other parts of the world ) .
And still , Afghanistan was tragically often a key part of the route followed by those who would subdue certain parts of the globe .
I 'll return to the question of resources a bit later ; for now , think of those resources as a side dish to the main course -- a very lovely side dish , to be sure , especially for those bent on power and but still in the nature of a supplement .
If it turns out to be a valuable supplement , so much the better .
The main course is Afghanistan isof much that is of great importance to those who seek power and dominion .
As noted , Afghanistan was very familiar to leaders of ancient times because of its strategic location .
Most of us know at least a bit about more recent history and the era of The Great Game .
You can read more about that as your time and interest indicate .
The foundational point remains the same .
As it is sometimes expressed , and here it is all too accurate : geography is destiny .
A related point is crucial to the discussion to come in this series : because of the critical nature of Afghanistan 's location for those in pursuit of power and control , the primary goal throughout history and continuing today , for Britain , for Russia , for the United States , for others , can be expressed in two words :
That 's the whole thing .
Full stop .
Being there -- because Afghanistan is the strategic gateway to further destinations of immense importance , because a presence in Afghanistan serves to shore up expeditions to other countries , because securing Afghanistan is necessary to a continuing power base in Central Asia .
When we understand this , we can see that all the other purported goals -- building a stable democratic government , securing Afghanistan for the Afghans , defeating alleged terrorists , ensuring regional stability for the benefit of all humankind ( never solely for the sake of the U.S. , or Russia , or Britain or anyone else , may the heavens forfend , but only and always forhumankind , such is the nobility and remarkable lack of self - interest of the ruling class ) -- of that isand
The ruling class offers those justifications because they sound so much nicer and more pleasant .
Besides , the public gobbles them up with eager ignorance .
Sometimes a few members of the public will behave with astonishing impertinence and point out that the marketing ploys do n't seem to comport with facts on the ground .
The ruling class does n't care about any of that .
Shred the PR all you wish : it 's It does n't matter .
Theyyou spend all your time demonstrating in great detail how threadbare and senseless the marketing is .
And many of you oblige them .
Silly , silly you .
The marketing They 're primarily interested in only one objective :
And guess what : the United States The very strong likelihood is that the U.S. will continue to be there for decades to come .
Afghanistan 's geographical and therefore strategic importance is painfully obvious .
So , too , are the ruling class 's goals .
They 've announced them thousands of times .
On this occasion , I do n't exaggerate : the ruling class has unambiguously declared its purposes time and again .
It would appear many people were n't listening -- or they heard , but chose not to believe what the ruling class repeatedly stated with admirable clarity .
Some will object that there is noto pursue power and control in this manner .
Why do n't the various powers simply mind their own business ?
Above all , especially today , why doesn' tsimply mind its own business ?
Ah , but the ruling class emphatically believes itminding its own business .
It all depends on how we define our terms , does n't it ?
And they 've explained all that to you , as well .
In fact , the ruling class of the United States , so astonishingly noble and devoted only to the betterment of all mankind as they insistently declare , has explained it numerous times for over a century .
There 's that listening and / or comprehension problem again .
So next time , we 'll take a little historical survey , and there is still more to be said about Afghanistan in particular .
In terms of the U.S. ruling class 's objectives , being there in Afghanistan is only the beginning of the story .
The next installment will focus on the broader concern : " ... and BeingOur ruling class does not lack for ambition .
Madness , you insist ?
Such plans must fail ?
Such goals can only lead to great suffering and endless death ?
I have n't noticed the ruling class suffering all that much , or dying in substantial numbers .
In fact , they seem to be doing quite remarkably well .
They would appear to be positively What is madness , failure and death to countless millions of " ordinary " people isfor the ruling class .
For decades and even centuries , it 's been a verybusiness plan .
It all depends on your perspective .
As I 've regularly noted recently , many of us do love the marketing .
But you should seriously consider not discussing it as if it matters .
It does n't .
To the extent you treat the marketing as important , you do the ruling class 's bidding , and you provide them a gift of inestimable value .
Now would n't you agree that 's very silly ?
I should think you might at this late date .

Today I found out the iconic “ live long and prosper ” hand gesture was originally a Jewish sign .
The hand gesture itself is a slight modification of the Hebrew gesture forming the letter “ Shin ” , which represents the name “ Shaddai ” meaning “ Almighty ” ( God ) .
This gesture is still used today by orthodox Jews of the Kohanim , which are priests descended from Ahron by the patrilineal line .
These Kohanim form a subset of the descendants of the priestly Levite tribe .
The Kohanim use the Shin gesture during a blessing ceremony , the nesiat kapayim or the “ Priestly Blessing ” , that accompanies the prayer service .
The actual Jewish blessing is done with both hands , not just one , extended outward .
In this gesture , the arms are then held at a roughly 45 degree angle , level with the shoulders , as opposed to the completely vertical salute fashion in the “ live long in prosper ” version of the gesture .
This modified gesture used by Star Trek ’s Vulcan ’s was originally Leonard Nimoy ’s idea .
Though Nimoy was not an orthodox
Jew himself , when he was a child , his grandfather would take him to the synagogue .
During his time there , he observed this blessing and subsequent gesture and , according to his autobiography , was very impressed by the ceremony ; remembering it later while filming “ Amok Time ” , which is the first place the now iconic gesture appeared in Star Trek .
In “ Amok Time ” , Spock was originally supposed to kneel before the Vulcan matriarch , with the matriarch placing her hands on his shoulders in a knighting type gesture .
Nimoy did n’t like this as Vulcan ’s were touch telepaths .
Thus , he felt this original gesture would be an invasion of privacy for a Vulcan .
He then drew on his Jewish roots to come up with an alternate gesture .
The hand gesture itself was n’t the only part that was borrowed from Jewish tradition .
The “ live long and prosper ” and the lesser known Vulcan traditional response of “ peace and long life ” was based on the Jewish “ Shalom Aleichem ” ( peace be upon you ) and the traditional reply of “ Aleichem Shalom ” ( upon you be peace ) .

Bonus Facts :
The Hebrew Priestly Blessing itself can be found in the Bible in Numbers 6:22 : “ May the Lord bless you and keep you .
May the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you .
May the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace . ”
Nimoy also was the one to come up with the Vulcan nerve pinch .
In the first episode this pinch showed up , Spock was originally supposed to club evil Kirk over the head , knocking him out .
Nimoy thought this was inconsistent with Spock ’s personality .
He felt a non-violent nerve pinch would be more fitting with Vulcan ’s being able to emit energy from their fingertips ; this energy when applied to the correct nerves of a human would then render the human unconscious .
Jewish worshipers are not supposed to look at the Kohanim while the blessing is being given as this would distract them from the words of the blessing itself .
As a child , Nimoy could n’t contain himself however and snuck a peak .
As he said , “ The special moment when the Kohanim blessed the assembly moved me deeply , for it possessed a great sense of magic and theatricality …
I had heard that this indwelling Spirit of God was too powerful , too beautiful , too awesome for any mortal to look upon and survive , and so I obediently covered my face with my hands .
But of course , I had to peek . ”
( From his autobiography , I am Spock . )
In Act 5 Scene 3 line 42 of Shakespeare ’s Romeo and Juliet , Romeo says to Balthasar , “ Live and be prosperous , and farewell good fellow . ”
The actress who played T’Pau , Celia Lovsky , could n’t do the salute , which was a problem in the filming of “ Amok Time ” .
In order to get around this issue , they simply filmed with her hands starting below the camera frame ; she ’d then use her other hand to get the one hand into the proper position , which she could then hold for a couple seconds before losing it .
Ancient Egyptians had a common phrase that is properly translated today to , “ May he live long , prosper , and be in health . ”
After Star Trek was canceled , Nimoy immediately joined the cast of Mission Impossible as an IMF agent .
He played this role in the fourth and fifth seasons of the show .
Nimoy officially retired in April of 2010 , his reasons being his age and his hope that by bowing out , Zachary Quinto would be able to better enjoy the full media attention of being Spock .

Faced with serious salary cap issues , the Chicago Blackhawks traded away another contributor to the Stanley Cup title team , shipping Kris Versteeg to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday .
" Obviously , like I said earlier this year , we 're not looking to trade anybody but that 's the game we 're in today , " Blackhawks general manager Stan Bowman said .
" You look at the trades that are made , most of them are related around the salary cap , but that 's just a reality everybody is facing , "
The Leafs also received forward Bill Sweatt , a second - round pick in 2007 who played four seasons at Colorado College , for forwards Viktor Stalberg , Chris DiDomenico and Philippe Paradis .
" We 're always looking to acquire good young players , " Bowman told ESPNChicago.com .
" We 're trying to continue this great run .
We 're very high on these three players we acquired .
Obviously , [ Viktor ] Stalberg is an NHL player .
He 's got some size .
He 's going to complement the playmakers on our team . "
Versteeg , 24 , had 20 goals and 24 assists in 79 regular - season games for Chicago .
He had six goals and eight assists in the playoffs .
Versteeg completed his third season in the league , all with Chicago .
" Kris is a young player who came into our lineup on a full - time basis a year ago and he kind of blossomed as a guy who a year ago was just trying to make the team , " Bowman said .
" He 's a versatile guy , he played some center for us this year when we had some injuries .
He 's able to play left wing or right wing , got a high skill level , can play across the board in terms of penalty killing and power play . "
Versteeg signed a three - year , $ 9.25 million contract with the Hawks last summer .
Cap concerns already forced Chicago to unload playoff hero Dustin Byfuglien in a deal with Atlanta this offseason .
Stars Patrick Kane , Jonathan Toews and Duncan Keith have new long - term deals to go with the huge contract Marian Hossa signed before last season .
Cup winning goalie Antti Niemi and young defenseman Niklas Hjalmarsson are restricted free agents and will likely receive raises .
Bowman had said after the Byfuglien deal that the team did n't have to make any more moves .
" I guess that 's always debatable in terms of need and want , " he told ESPNChicago.com on Wednesday night .
" The important thing is we 're always trying to improve our team .
I 've been trying to warn our fans that this team we fell in love with is n't going to stay the same . "
Bowman said the deal could make the team a player when free agency starts Thursday .
" We have some more flexibility to look at some [ unrestricted free agents ] which we probably did n't have as of yesterday . "
And the general manager is not concerned about other teams grabbing their restricted free agents .
" They [ offer sheets ] do n't concern me , " he said .
" These guys are going to remain with the Blackhawks .
We have plenty of flexibility to make things work . "
The 24 - year - old Stalberg , from Sweden , had nine goals and five assists in 40 games for Toronto last season , his first in the NHL .
The 19 - year - old Paradis was selected by Carolina in the first round of the 2009 draft , then traded to Toronto in December .
He had 24 goals in 63 games last season for Shawinigan in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League .
The 21 - year - old DiDomenico had seven goals in 12 regular - season games for Drummondville in the QMJHL .
He also had seven goals in 14 playoff games .

Image caption Sir Mick Jagger says The Rolling Stones did not always make a lot of money
Among the alumni of the London School of Economics , many have gone on to earn vast fortunes .
The illustrious list includes Easyjet founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou , French billionaire Delphine Arnault , and financier George Soros .
One of its less conventional former students is Sir Mick Jagger , whose estimated £ 190 m stash looks measly compared to the wealth of those above .
But while those riches are ultimately down to his song writing , singing and guitar playing - business nous has undeniably played a part .
His band , The Rolling Stones , have released about 90 singles and more than two dozen studio albums .
There was a small period from 1970 to 1997 where people did get paid and they got paid very handsomely Sir Mick Jagger
And still selling out huge arenas and stadia , they also control the touring , the merchandise and sponsorship side of the business .
But in a rare interview , Sir Mick admitted to the BBC that he was lucky in the timing of his career .
" When the Stones started out they did n't make any money out of records because record companies did n't pay you , " he said .
" Nobody got paid .
I always wonder if Frank Sinatra got paid .
" Your royalty was so low .
If you sold a million records you got a million pennies .
It was all very nice , but not what you imagined you were going to get . "
Rich lists
However things changed as musicians became more adept at controlling their creations .
This came at about the time the Stones hit what many see as their peak , which included the 1972 release of the critically acclaimed Exile on Main Street .
Later the boom in music sales through the development of the compact disc bolstered the earnings of those on lucrative royalty deals .
" There was a small period from 1970 to 1997 where people did get paid and they got paid very handsomely , " Sir Mick said .
The introduction of the CD meant a lot of established artists with good royalties deals did well and of course a lot of the record companies did incredibly well Horace Trubridge , British Musicians ' Union
" They did make money but now that period 's done .
If you look at the history of recorded music from , say , 1900 to now , there was that period where artists did very well but the rest of the time they did n't . "
A quick glance at this year 's Sunday Times UK Music Rich List confirms the thinking .
All the artists in the Top 20 were prominent in the 1970s or 1980s and include Sir Paul McCartney , Ringo Starr and the family of fellow Beatle George Harrison .
Also on the list are Sir Elton John , Sir Tom Jones , Eric Clapton and Robin and Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees .
Sir Mick 's fellow Rolling Stone Keith Richards also makes the cut with £ 175m .
The rest are not performers but those in the wider music industry , ranging from Sir Andrew Lloyd Weber and Sir Cameron McIntosh - who made their fortunes on Broadway and in the West End - to the music management moguls of Simon Cowell and Simon Fuller .
And the list is topped by record company executives Edgar Bronfman and Clive Calder .
Internet impact
We tend to treat each of our artists as their own little individual global business , with multiple revenue streams and multiple territories Brian Message , Music manager
Before recorded music , incomes depended largely on the whim of patrons - meaning even Mozart and Schubert died destitute .
And in the first half - century of recorded music , rip - offs and uncertain copyright rules meant some of the great blues artists died with barely a penny in their pockets .
Most of today 's musicians also have it tough - with the development of the internet in particular blamed as many choose to download almost any song or album they like , for free .
And while there has been some success in selling legal downloads , many industry figures say the technology has also opened up many more opportunities , forcing artists to become more creative about how they make money .
Brian Message co-manages , among others , Radiohead and Kate Nash , but said that in many ways , " music manager " was a term which belonged in the pre-internet days .
When you are one of the really valuable artists that 's actually selling tickets for a festival , you 'll be paid handsomely Nick Matthews , Booking agent , Coda
" We tend to treat each of our artists as their own little individual global business , with multiple revenue streams and multiple territories , " he added , saying the internet allowed it to access about 200 markets and cheaply be able to sell music digitally .
" It 's a question of how do you grow that business .
The mix of recorded music to ticket sales or merchandise or signed photos or whatever .
And we do n't differentiate . "
' Crown jewels '
Today , those ticket sales for concerts are the primary way for musicians to make money .
But getting a plum slot at one of the larger music festivals is potentially more lucrative , said booking agent Nick Matthews , whose clients include urban pop artist Chipmunk .
Over a pint of cider at this year 's Glastonbury Festival , Mr Matthews said that such big events were " the crown jewels of the live music business every summer " .
" A really good set time or good slot proves you are one of the top calibre artists of that time , it 's something agents and artists very tactically work towards , making sure they have a good presence at festivals , " he added .
But is it all about the marketing potential of such events , or rather the fees artists can command to play ?
It depends , argued Mr Matthews , on the stage of a performer 's career .
For me it 's more about the music and people listening to new music Coco Sumner , I Blame Coco
" If you have someone who is n't a household name yet , putting them on a big stage at a festival really does promote them to a new audience and allow them to recruit new fans .
" The money comes into it when you are a headliner one of the really valuable artists that 's actually selling tickets for a festival .
" That 's when you 're really paid handsomely and you 'll be paid much more than you could be for any arena or venue - style show . "
Of course all this supposes that making money is the most important thing to a musician .
UK band I Blame Coco is set to release its debut album later this year .
And lead singer Coco Sumner is all too aware of the trappings that a successful career can bring , as the daughter of Gordon Sumner , better known as Sting of 1980s group The Police .
She agreed changes in the music industry meant her band was likely to depend more on live music to make money but said this was not their main focus .
If you do well , you have a chunk of money that lands .
Then no money comes for a couple of months or a couple of years Mika
" It 's more about getting new fans , " she told the BBC , after playing one of Glastonbury 's smaller stages at the un-rock n' roll time of 11am .
" For me it 's more about the music and people listening to new music . "
' Privileged '
All of which is perhaps just as well , given that even fairly successful musicians find making money difficult .
Mika has had hits on both sides of the Atlantic , but said this had not translated into fabulous wealth .
" Of course you make money sometimes , and the money comes in bursts , " he told the BBC .
" You have no money forever then suddenly , if you do well , you have a chunk of money that lands .
Then no money comes for a couple of months or couple of years . "
It is a sentiment heard all too often by Horace Trubridge assistant general secretary of the UK's Musicians ' Union , who argued that nobody ever became a musician to make money .
" You do it because you love it and it's what you want to do , " he added .
" But you need good musicians to create the music we all love and unless they are not rewarded , unless they can't pay the bills , they 'll drift out of it . "
It may be a worrying prospect .
However with the Rolling Stones saying another tour next year is " very likely " , there seems little chance of Sir Mick and company drifting away from the spotlight just yet .
Jacob Heilbrunn has an interesting essay up at Foreign Policy that 's about how nutty and extreme the GOP has become on foreign policy , which we all knew , but he adds a lot of historical texture and makes this interesting observation :
Perhaps [ Mitt ]
Romney truly thinks that the new START is a sellout to Moscow , but he appears to be less an avatar of the right than its most prominent hostage .
He might even be suffering from a kind of Stockholm syndrome .
The treaty , after all , has won the enthusiastic endorsement of a host of Republican foreign - policy eminences , including Brent Scowcroft , Henry Kissinger , George Shultz , and James Baker .
Much of President Barack Obama 's foreign policy , in fact , adheres to the prescriptions laid out by that generation of Republican realists -- relying on diplomacy in dealing with Russia and Iran , cultivating good relations with China , and recognizing the limits of U.S. power .
But these moderate conservatives all have one big thing in common :
They 're in their dotage .
Nor is there a successor generation in sight to uphold their legacy .
The result is that despite the bungled Iraq war , the right remains on the offensive .
An insurrectionist movement , it not only opposes liberal elites , but also the quisling patricians in its own ranks .
In other words , in significant measure , Obama 's foreign policy is indeed reminiscent of a centrist - realist kind of foreign policy one would have associated with Republicans from , say , Arthur Vandenberg to George H.W. Bush .
And with Democrats in the Dean Acheson mold .
Heilbrunn describes the history well .
Vandenberg , for those of you across the sea , was a crucial figure in US foreign policy history .
The GOP chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after the war , he was well to the right of Truman and Acheson , but he decided to work with them and support the Truman Doctrine for Greece and Turkey and help get it through Congress .
It was he who coined the famous phrase that politics " stops at the water 's edge . "
I will not , Lord knows , defend everything done in the name of that bipartisan consensus .
Or even maybe most things .
The build - up of the national security state .
Vietnam .
Iran , Guatemala , Congo , et cetera .
I will say , however , that at least we often had occasions in this country when there were cross-party coalitions in Congress on foreign policy , and an understanding that prevailed more often than not that partisanship should be muted when discussing foreign policy .
Of course , the GOP insisted on that in 2001 - 2002 , when if you opposed the Bush - Cheney - Rumsfeld agenda you were against America , but now we have the Cheneys hurling partisan Molotov cocktails and ensuring that in the event of an attack or some kind of crisis , the country will tear itself apart .
Which would be one thing if Obama 's foreign policy were out of Chomsky .
But as Heilbrunn shows it 's more like Jim Baker .

Reflections by comrade Fidel
KNOWING THE TRUTH TIMELY
As I was writing every one of my previous Reflections , and a catastrophe was quickly zeroing in on humanity , my major concern was to fulfill the primary duty to inform our people .
Today , I feel more relax than 26 days ago .
As the situation evolves , I can reiterate and expand on the information to the national and international public .
Obama has committed to attend the quarterfinals match on July 2 , if his country ’s team makes it to that stage .
He supposedly knows better than anyone that the quarterfinals will not be contested because very serious developments will take place before that ; or at least he should know .
Last Friday , June 25 , an international press agency known for the attention to details in its reports , published a statement by the “ … Navy Commander of the elite Corps of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution General Ali Fadavi … , ” warning “ … that if the United States and its allies inspect Iranian ships in international waters ‘ they will have their response in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz . ’ ”
The information was taken from the local news agency Mehr of Iran .
According to the press dispatch , said news agency reported that “ Fadavi added that ‘ the Navy of the Revolutionary Guardians currently has hundreds of vessels equipped with missile launchers . ’ ”
The information , produced approximately at the same time of what Granma published or perhaps before , seemed at some points an exact copy of the Reflections elaborated on Thursday June 24th and ran by that paper on Friday 25th .
The coincidence can be explained by the simple use of a logical reasoning .
I was completely unaware of what the Iranian local agency had published .
I have absolutely no doubt that as soon as the American and Israeli warships are deployed –alongside the rest of the American military vessels positioned off the Iranian coasts -- and they try to inspect the first merchant ship from that country , there will be a massive launching of missiles in both directions .
At that moment exactly the terrible war will begin .
It ’s not possible to estimate how many vessels will be sunk or from what country .
Knowing the truth timely is the most important thing for our people .
It does n’t matter if almost everybody , I ’d dare say 99.9 % or more of my compatriots , instinctively cling to hopes and agree with my sincere wishes to be wrong .
I have talked to people close to me , and I have also received news from many noble , selfless and hardworking people who have read my Reflections and do not challenge my considerations in the least but rather absorb , believe and swallow my reasoning through a dry throat ; however , they immediately go back to the tasks to which they devote their energies .
That is precisely what we expect of our compatriots .
But it would be worse to suddenly become aware of extremely gave events without having heard as much as a news about such possibility .
Then there would be confusion and panic , and that would be unworthy of our heroic Cuban people , which was very close to becoming the target of a massive nuclear strike on October 1962 , and still did not hesitate for a second in discharging its duty .
Our brave combatants and the military chiefs of our Revolutionary Armed Forces taking part in heroic internationalist missions were close to becoming the victims of nuclear strikes against the Cuban troops deployed close to the Angolan south border from where the South African racist forces -- at the time positioned on the Namibian border -- had been expelled after the battle of Cuito Cuanavale .
The Pentagon , with the consent of the President of the United States , supplied the South African racists through Israel with about 14 nuclear bombs , more powerful than those dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , as we have indicated in previous Reflections .
I am neither a prophet nor a fortune teller .
Nobody told me a word of what was to happen .
It has all been the result of what I today describe as a logical reasoning .
We are neither new to this complicated issue nor are we meddlesome .
It is possible to predict what will happen in the rest of the Portuguese and Spanish speaking Americas during the nuclear post crisis .
Under such circumstances , it will not be possible to talk of capitalism or socialism .
A stage will open that will see the management of the available goods and services in this part of the continent .
Certainly , every country will continue being ruled by those who head the governments today , some very close to socialism and others euphoric over the opening of the world market to fuels , uranium , copper , lithium , aluminum , iron and other metals being sent to the developed and rich countries today that will suddenly disappear .
An abundance of food exported now to that world market will also disappear abruptly .
In these circumstances , the most basic products needed for life : food , water , fuels , and the resources found in the hemisphere south of the United States will suffice to preserve some of the civilization whose unbridled advance has led humanity into such a disaster .
Nevertheless , there are still some uncertainties .
Will the two mightiest nuclear powers , the United States and Russia , be able to refrain from using their nuclear weapons against each other ?
There is no doubt , however , that from Europe the nuclear weapons of Great Britain and France , allied with the United States and Israel , -- the same that enthusiastically imposed the resolution that will inevitably unleash the war , which for the abovementioned reasons will immediately become nuclear -- are threatening the Russian territory even though this country and China have done everything within their capabilities to prevent the conflict .
The economy of the superpower will fall to pieces like a house of cards .
The American society is the least prepared to endure a catastrophe like the one the empire has created in the same territory where it started .
We do n’t know which will be the effect on the environment of the nuclear weapons that will unavoidably explode in various parts of the world , and that in the least serious variant will happen in abundance .
As for me , to advance a hypothesis would be pure science fiction .

I managed to put together a wireless accelerometer the other night using my two new XBees , an Arduino XBee shield , an XBee Explorer USB , an ADXL330 , and some Python .
I struggled a bit with some of it , so here 's what I learned : First , a parts list .
Arduino XBee XBee 2 mW Series 2.5 Chip Antenna ( with XBee Series 2.5 module ) XBee Explorer USB ADXL330 I 'm not sure exactly what the specs are on the XBee that comes with the Arduino shield .
But , it is definitely a series 2.5 .
The first thing to do is to configure and upgrade the firmware on your XBees .
To do that , you 'll need X - CTU ( for the firmware upgrade at least , but it 's also nice for configuration ) which , unfortunately , is only available for Windows .
But , it works fine from VMware .
First up , the XBee we 'll hook up to the computer to read incoming data from the accelerometer :
Plug one of the XBees into the Explorer ( it 's also possible to do this from the Arduino shield by shifting the two XBee / USB jumpers to USB and remo …
Maytag recalls 1.7 million dishwashers
( CNN ) --
This ought to keep the Maytag repairman busy for a while .
The appliance manufacturer along with the Consumer Product Safety Commission on Thursday announced the recall of about 1.7 million dishwashers made by the company between February 2006 and April of 2010 .
" An electrical failure in the dishwasher 's heating element can pose a serious fire hazard , " said the recall notice issued by the CPSC .
" Maytag has received 12 reports of dishwasher heating element fires that have resulted in fires and dishwasher damage , including one report of extensive kitchen damage from a fire , " the CPSC said .
There have no reports of injuries .
The recall includes select Maytag , Amana , Jenn - Air , Admiral , Magic Chef , Performa and Crosley brands manufactured by Maytag .
The company has set up a website where customers can check their unit 's serial number to see if it is included in the recall -- www.repair.maytag.com.
Consumers will be able to choose between having their dishwasher repaired or accepting a rebate toward the purchase of a new dishwasher .
The Maytag repairman has been a staple of the company 's corporate image .
Since 1967 , Maytag has touted its quality by showing a bored repairman with nothing to do .
FBI linguist Shamai Leibowitz has been sentenced to 20 months for leaking classified information .
Justice Dept. cracks down on leaks
The Obama administration ’s crackdown on leaks to the press has snared a high - profile conviction of an FBI linguist , who was sentenced to 20 months in prison Monday after pleading guilty to giving classified information to a blogger .
The sentence for Shamai Leibowitz is likely to become the longest ever served by a government employee accused of passing national security secrets to a member of the media .
His case represents only the third known conviction in U.S. history for a government official or contractor providing classified information to the press .

And it reflects a surprising development : President Barack Obama ’s Justice Department has taken a hard line against leakers , and Obama himself has expressed anger about disclosures of national security deliberations in the press .
“ I think it ’s remarkable , ” said Gabriel Schoenfeld , a fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute who urged prosecution of The New York Times for publishing details of the Bush administration ’s warrantless wiretapping program in 2005 .
“ This is the administration that came in pledging maximum transparency .
Plugging leaks is ... traditionally not associated with openness . ”
“ They ’re going after this at every opportunity and with unmatched vigor , ” said Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists , a critic of government classification policy .
Last month , the Justice Department reissued a Bush - era grand jury subpoena against New York Times reporter James Risen for the sources he relied on in a chapter of his 2006 book , “ State of War , ” which focuses on a CIA - led ruse to disrupt Iranian nuclear weapons research .
Risen has vowed to fight the subpoena but might face the possibility of jail time for contempt if a judge refuses to step in .
“ I was extremely surprised that the Risen subpoena was reinstituted .
That struck me as a battle that no one needed to have , ” said Hearst Corp. general counsel Eve Burton , a veteran of legal battles over press sources .
“ I thought Eric Holder would be a more moderating force in that regard . ”
The Justice Department also obtained an indictment last month of former National Security Agency official Thomas Drake in connection with leaks that apparently led to a Baltimore Sun series on alleged mismanagement of an NSA program to process large volumes of intercepted data .
Drake has pleaded not guilty .
“ If Thomas Drake is convicted and sentenced to jail , this will be the first president to send two leakers to prison in his term in office .
That ’s never happened before , ” said Schoenfeld , author of the book “ Necessary Secrets . ”
“ You would n’t have expected the Holder Justice Department to be particularly hawkish in these matters . ”
No one has suggested that the moves were directed by the White House , but Obama has repeatedly let subordinates know that he is deeply troubled by leaks on sensitive national security matters like Afghanistan and Pakistan , as well as administration infighting on more mundane issues .
“ Obama had one pet peeve that could make him lose his cool ... leaks , ” Newsweek ’s Jonathan Alter wrote in his new book , “ The Promise . ” According to Alter , Obama was “ fearsome ” on the subject and went on an “ anti- leak jihad ” over some disclosures .
In November , after leaks of a key Pentagon strategy memo and classified State Department cables on Afghanistan , top administration officials said the nation ’s counterintelligence czar , Robert Bear Bryant , had been tasked with drafting a new strategy to combat classified leaks .
Some experts said the administration and the Justice Department may be trying to appease the intelligence community after angering many by releasing the so - called torture memos and by reopening inquiries into alleged torture by CIA personnel .
Others said intelligence personnel are terrified by outlets like Wikileaks , on which classified information can be posted without any meaningful chance for officials to argue for the withholding of details that could damage U.S. intelligence efforts .
“ We are in a new world , ” said Lucy Dalglish of The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press .
“ At least when you have a leak to the mainstream media , you know there ’s a little judgment and training there .
...
You have some opportunity to try to talk people out of revealing information that shows sources or methods . ”
Asked about the series of cases , one official said Monday : “ The Justice Department has always taken these matters seriously . ”
At Wednesday ’s hearing , U.S. District Court Judge Alexander Williams Jr. imposed the 20 - month sentence that had been agreed on as part of a plea bargain between prosecutors and Leibowitz ’s defense .
“ It was a very , very serious offense , ” Williams said .
However , in an unusual admission , Williams went on to say that while he assumed that the disclosures had a serious impact on national security , he really did n’t know because he was n’t privy to what information was disclosed and what impact it had .
“ The court is in the dark , ” the judge said .
“ I ’m not a part and parcel of the intricacies of that .
... I do n’t know what was divulged , other than some documents . ”
In his statement at the sentencing , Leibowitz also shed little light on what he leaked , though he said he was trying to bring to light something he considered illegal .
“ This was a one - time mistake that happened to me when I worked at the FBI and saw things that I considered a violation of the law , ” said Leibowitz , who has also worked as a lawyer in the U.S. and Israel but has now been suspended from the New York bar .
“ I should not have told a reporter about this , ” he said , adding that he instead should have reported the matter to an agency inspector general .
Assistant U.S Attorney Steven Dunne defended the sentence at a brief sentencing hearing Monday afternoon in federal court in Greenbelt , Md. “ The government felt that a significant period of incarceration was proper and appropriate .
Mr. Leibowitz worked for the FBI , and he betrayed the FBI when he worked there , ” Dunne said .
But such cases are relatively rare .
In 1985 , Navy analyst Samuel Morison was convicted of providing spy satellite photos to Jane ’s Defence Weekly .
Media organizations strongly protested , but an appeals court upheld the conviction .
Morison was sentenced to two years in prison but was paroled after eight months .
In 2005 , Pentagon analyst Larry Franklin pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to disclose classified information about Iran and other matters to pro-Israel lobbyists , foreign officials and the press .
Franklin was initially sentenced to more than 12 years in prison , but a judge later cut the term to 10 months of community confinement .
In an unprecedented twist , two employees of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee who allegedly received some of the leaks were also charged criminally , but the Justice Department eventually dropped the case .

SYDNEY ( AFP ) Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ Climate change could make much of the world too hot for human habitation within just three centuries , research released Tuesday showed .
Scientists from Australia ’s University of New South Wales and Purdue University in the United States found that rising temperatures in some places could mean humans would be unable to adapt or survive .

“ It would begin to occur with global - mean warming of about seven degrees Celsius ( 13 Fahrenheit ) , calling the habitability of some regions into question , ” the researchers said in a paper .
“ With 11 - 12 degrees Celsius warming , such regions would spread to encompass the majority of the human population as currently distributed . ”
Researcher Professor Steven Sherwood said there was no chance of the earth heating up to seven degrees this century , but there was a serious risk that the continued burning of fossil fuels could create the problem by 2300 .
“ There ’s something like a 50/50 chance of that over the long term , ” he said .
The study — which examined climate change over a longer period than most other research — looked at the “ heat stress ” produced by combining the impact of rising temperatures and increased humidity .

Sherwood said climate change research had been “ short - sighted ” not to probe the long - term consequences of the impact of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
“ It needs to be looked at , ” he told AFP .
“ There ’s not much we can do about climate change over the next two decades but there ’s still a lot we can do about the longer term changes . ”
In a commentary on the paper , published in the US - based Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Australian National University academics said climate change would not stop in 2100 .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ And under realistic scenarios out to 2300 , we may be faced with temperature increases of 12 degrees ( Celsius ) or even more , ” Professor Tony McMichael said .
“ If this happens , our current worries about sea level rise , occasional heatwaves and bushfires , biodiversity loss and agricultural difficulties will pale into insignificance beside a major threat — as much as half the currently inhabited globe may simply become too hot for people to live there . ”
Care for some more specificity on when exactly to expect the Droid X to become even awesomer ?
Well , according to one " very reliable " source over at Droid Forums , we can look forward to a late August landing for Android 2.2 on the X , which will be preceded by a late July delivery on the venerable Droid .
Both dates are caveated with an ominous " currently planned " proviso , so do n't consider them carved in ( Mile ) stone , but we 're liking the idea of Motorola having both its flagship devices tasting of Froyo by summer 's end .
There 's no mention of the Droid 2 , however , which may mean nothing or might suggest that handset 's still a fair way away from its release .
We shall see .

In our regular series about makers and hackers , BBC News meets the rocket men .
Rain is the mortal enemy of the amateur rocketeer .
That regard for the weather is one of the many things setting rocketeers apart from makers , hackers and other hi-tech hobbyists who typically practise their pastime indoors .
Image caption A sight to stiffen the sinews of any red- blooded geek
It is not just dampness that causes the problem , though that can short out delicate electronics and make rocket engines go phut instead of whoosh .
To begin with , the low cloud might conceal an aircraft that did not read the warning notice rocketeers must lodge every time they fly .
Also , the atmospheric conditions preceding a shower or storm can scupper a launch before a single raindrop falls from the heavens .
One of the rarer ways that the weather can catch out a rocketeer was witnessed during the most recent two - day launch festival run by the East Anglian Rocketry Society - an event known as Big Ears .
The society uses the fields of a farmer close to the village of Elsworth in Cambridgeshire .
These have the advantage of being flat , which aids rocket recovery , and far enough from habitation to limit the risks for man , beast or home .
At the Big Ears gathering , veteran rocketeer Rod Stevenson had his I Class , four - foot tall , two - stage rocket on the launch stand , and was walking back to the control point where he would connect the wires to trigger its engine and launch it .
Suddenly , boom , a black powder charge in the rocket went off .
As it was meant to do , the explosion popped off the nose cone and pulled the parachute open .
Perfect .
All to no good as the craft still sat serene on the pad .
An inspection showed the altimeter inside the rocket registering a height of 852 feet - hence it firing the charge .
The cause was not the rocket reaching its apogee but , he speculated , a change in air pressure caused by a storm front moving in .
Subsequent investigation showed , said Mr Stevenson , that all the electronics checked out fine .
He blamed the misfire on a " freak accident " .
On the day , strolling back to the preparation area as the rain began to fall with the rocket across his shoulder , Mr Stevenson looked up at the gathering clouds and remarked : " Every day is a new day in rocketry . "
That , perhaps , explains some of its attraction .
It is , like many other hi-tech hobbies , easy to get started with but hard to master .
Boom or thrust
Image caption Rocketeers need to be competent craftsmen
It 's likely that fans of the home - made and the hi-tech took their first steps in rocketry as youngsters .
Perhaps they made rockets by sticking fins and a foam nosecone on to a plastic pop bottle , half - filling it with water and then pumping in air to send it flying high .
And soaking themselves in the process .
Others might have made smaller spacecraft from paper , film pots , Vitamin C tablets and water .
And soaked themselves in the process .
For some it did not stop there .
" Many rocketeers messed around with things they should n't before finding out they could do it legally , " said Ray Wilkinson , a longtime member of EARS and an engineering lecturer in his professional life .
Moving on to fuelled rockets is easy , thanks to the growing number of kits available that mean those keen to take rocketry to new heights can go from unboxing to countdown and launch in an hour or two .
To any tinkerer worth his or her salt , a kit is an unsatisfactory way to get going .
It 's a start and nothing else .
They do have their uses because a kit , at the very least , is the beginning of a crate of spares that might come in useful for future projects .
Motors come in power bands labelled A - Z , with each one defined by the amount of thrust they deliver .
Engines up to band G can be used without the need for an explosives licence .
Then there are hybrid engines that combine a solid fuel with a liquid oxidiser .
Some rocketeers even turn to even more exotic fuels such as toffee .
The range of engines and fuels produce very different characteristics that encourage tinkering .
" They are very different in the way they deliver the thrust , " said Mr Wilkinson .
This depends on how the fuel burns and where the thrust is delivered .
" Some motors are suited to altitude attempts rather than more general use , " he said .
Rocketeers need to be competent craftsmen if they want to go beyond the kits to put together their own rocket from parts .
They also need a decent grasp of electronics to ensure that the altimeters trigger black powder or pyrodex charges at the right height to deploy parachutes that smooth a craft 's return to the ground .
That knowledge could also be used to trick out a rocket with a video camera to record its flight from a unique vantage point .
Software simulators exist to help rocketeers model how their rocket , be it assembled from parts or scratch built , might behave on launch day .
Simulation , however , can only take you so far .
" There 's no simulator like real life , " said Mr Wilkinson .
And that is probably the ultimate lure of rocketry .
Getting it wrong is almost as much fun as getting it right .
If it goes wrong , then that means trying again , fixing the problem that cropped up , investigating , refining and returning .
A perfect launch will stir the sinews of every red-blooded geek .
After all , who cannot help but be enthralled by a launch in which the craft reaches speeds in excess of 50 mph in its own length , will exceed 250 mph on its way up and generate five to ten times the force of gravity as it arcs into the heavens and hit apogee a kilometre or so above the Earth .
Even better , anyone who manages it can also reasonably claim to have conquered what has become the byword for the most complicated thing people can do - rocket science .
Lech Poznań are celebrating their sixth Polish title , and first since 1992/93 , after finishing three points ahead of Wisła Kraków thanks to a 2 - 0 defeat of Zagłębie Lubin on the final day of the season .
One point clear going into the last fixture , Lech were awarded new suits by one of their sponsors on Wednesday in anticipation of their title win , but there was no question of the players taking anything for granted .
They took the lead courtesy of Wojciech Kędziora 's own goal on 22 minutes and made sure of the result when Robert Lewandowski fired in his 18th of the campaign two minutes shy of the hour mark .
Undoubtedly Lech 's finest player this term , the 21 - year - old striker topped the scoring charts in what may well prove to be his last season with the club .
" We knew we would have to be focused until the end , " defender Manuel Arboleda told UEFA.com .
" We were aware that Lubin could be dangerous until the last second as they played very well in the second half of the season .
We stayed focused and finished the job .
I feel so happy .
This reminds me of 2004 , when I won the Recopa Sudamericana with my Peruvian team , Club Cienciano .
I was the happiest man on the planet then and today I feel the same way .
" I 'm proud to be a member of this unique Lech Poznań team , " he added .
" It 's the beginning of a new era ; the club has a sensible transfer policy and the team has been carefully put together .
We made history today and we can do it again if we qualify for the Champions League . "
Lech will enter next season 's UEFA Champions League in the second qualifying round , with Wisła − who could only draw 1 - 1 with lowly MKS Odra Wodzisław Śląski − due for the second qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League .
Third - placed KS Ruch Chorzów will enter that same competition a round earlier , while at the bottom Odra Wodzisław and GKS Piast Gliwice have both been relegated .
The Polish Cup final between MKS Pogoń Szczecin and Jagiellonia Białystok will draw the season to a close next Saturday .
Microsoft is well known for Windows , Office , . NET , Xbox , Zune and a long list of other products and technologies .
Less discussed however , is a group at Microsoft that is n’t necessarily focused on ship dates , packaging , or competing products .
Instead they think about how computers and technology can make life easier , with an eye towards developing new technologies that can improve all our lives and often in cooperation with product team , but also working with people in academia , governments and industry .
The name of this group is Microsoft Research .
Eric Horvitz , today ’s guest , joined Microsoft Research with two colleagues in 1993 to form the Decision Theory and Adaptive Systems group .
Since then he has been at the center of a variety of projects focused on machine intelligence and adaptation , and the related tasks of information discovery , collection , and delivery
We live in an age of carefree subway riding .
It may not seem carefree when you ’re sweating on the platform waiting for a train that may or may not be coming because of service changes , and the nearby homeless guy is singing very off - key .
But one thing owners of an unlimited MetroCard never have to worry about is what it will cost them to take another subway trip .
Ride around the city all day ?
Sure .
Pop out on the way home from work to get some groceries at Whole Foods because the concept of organic food has n’t yet reached the supermarket near your apartment ?
Why not ?
It does n’t matter !
You already paid for as many rides as you could ever possibly want .
Well , do n’t get too comfortable , there .
The MTA , in its perpetual state of budget crisis , is considering a proposal to cap monthly unlimited cards at 90 rides , and weekly unlimited cards at 21 rides — about three swipes per day .
Depending on your level of subway activity , this may not matter much ; the MTA expects it to affect only about 10 percent of riders , like those who work as messengers or have active social lives .
Oh , and there could also be a $ 1 fee on new MetroCards .
And the price of a monthly MetroCard could shoot up $ 10 to $ 99 a month .
Also , there will be a 50 - cent fine for swiping the MetroCard too slowly .
Nah , that last one wo n’t happen .
It does n’t seem that implausible anymore , though .
MTA eyes up 90 - trip limit on unlimited monthly MetroCards , 21 - ride limit on weekly cards [ NYDN ]
There ’s an eerie silence settling over our Forward Operating Base .
The generators are shutting down one by one , and every night there are fewer lights .
The hundreds of people that made the base a cozy , bustling , American outpost have left , taking their equipment with them , leaving only abandoned buildings .
Our unit is the last out , manning the guard towers , defending a quiet shell .
In a few days , we ’ll turn the lights out at our command post , our battalion commander will make a short speech and shake hands with an Iraqi general , and we ’ll get in our waiting trucks and drive away .
Khalid Mohammed / Associated Press
Until that time , we have the place to ourselves .
Or we would , if it were n’t for the imagined presences that haunt any place that was once alive , but is now deserted and quiet .
The F.O.B. has long been a military place .
The buildings at its core were built by the British , and after that it was used and enlarged by the Iraqi Army .
They both left their mark , but for reasons of historical analogy the British remnants are more poignant .
For in this moment of stillness at the end of our tour , there is a natural opportunity for reflection on our collective mark here .
In a strange way , the process of withdrawal seems calculated to erase all traces of our presence .
For months , earth movers filled the excavations that supplied the earth for our HESCO barrier ramparts and leveled the berms that compartmentalized the base into sheltered portions , resulting in flattened , featureless expanses .
Crews of Iraqis and American soldiers subsequently went foot by foot , picking up every piece of garbage .
We ’ve been directed to paint over any English words , and years of obscene scrawls , meticulous artwork , utilitarian signs , and forgotten meanings have dutifully been spray - painted .
The smell of burning garbage , part of the normal sensory background of Iraqi life , is now in the pungent forefront as maps , CDs , and generally every last scrap of paper is burnt en masse .
Entire buildings have been deconstructed down to their concrete pad foundations , put in shipping containers and driven away .
The Army term for this is “ sterilization , ” which is fairly apt .
The running , pessimistic assumption is that the Iraqis will loot and despoil the place when we hand it over , but we are bound and determined that no one will be able to say that we left the mess .
This self - erasure seems like an instinctive part of American “ imperialism . ”
For most of our soldiers , the gulf between Iraqi and American has been too wide to bridge ; there is distaste for the Iraqi way of doing things , and all to often the corruption and self - interest of Iraqi leadership disappoints an institution built on stronger values .
The military has been reluctant to implant and implicate itself into the often hostile culture , and at the lower levels our relationships with Iraqis are superficial and mercantile , to the mutual appreciation of both sides .
The ambivalence is now manifested physically as we scrape away at our material traces , relieving the Iraqis of American contamination just as we scrupulously clean our own equipment and inspect our baggage to defend against Iraqi impurities .
Our aspirations were never to integrate and settle , but rather to separate and leave .
We ’ve staked no claims , built no enduring monuments .
A thousand years hence , archaeologists will know of our presence only by a few blast wall monoliths and a thin strata of M.R.E. wrappers , as prosaic as pottery shards .
What have we done here ?
The frustration for soldiers on patrol is that success is often defined by what has n’t happened .
What violence has n’t occurred , what bomb did not go off .
Which often comes down to , the more boring things are , the more successful we are .
Which is not why young men volunteer to join the infantry at a time of war .
Frustration aside , our unit has been successful .
Violence has been sporadic , the elections were quiet and well - attended .
Those elections might be our most lasting impact ; Iraqi democracy the greatest improvement that we have presided over .
If it persists , it will be worth more than any architectural remnants , any quantity of graffiti , or any amount of landscaping .
The accomplishment is tenuous , however , as the dusty and deserted British buildings quietly remind us of the latest attempt to foster some sort of democracy .
I hope that the analogy does not hold .
At the entrance to our headquarters there hung pictures of the dozens of soldiers who died in the surrounding area over the years .
The wall is blank and painted over now , but their presence , mixed with all the other echos of sacrifice and activity , demands that what they gave was worth it .
It is unfortunate that we often turn to consider our legacy at the end , when it is difficult to change it .
Our unit ’s die is cast in Iraq ; our ability to influence the outcome has dissolved away .
We have done our best ; the future will tell if the cost was worth the expenditure .
The only unsettling thought is that the future is almost entirely in Iraqi hands .
This evening , as I walked to my barracks , I noticed another generator had shut down .
And in the resulting quiet , the sunset call to prayer seemed that much louder , insistent , and haunting .

Hackage GSoC : Feature graphs and URI trees
Hello Haskellers !
I ’ve made lengthy strides in the internal structure of the new Hackage server .
Amidst implementing features , I ’ve also implemented a reasonably solid top - level organization for them .
I ’ll describe some of the technical details of the structure here .
Feature graphs
Each feature has a listing of the URIs it provides , the user groups it needs to authenticate , and the data it needs to store with methods to back up and restore that data .
A feature might also define caches for its pages , IO hooks to execute on certain events ( like uploading a package ) , and pretty much anything else : features are arbitary datatypes that implement a HackageFeature typeclass .
If feature A depends on feature B , then feature A can extend B’s URIs with new formats and HTTP methods , use B ’s data and user groups , and register for any of B ’s hooks .
The barebones features are :
core : the central functionality set for something to reasonably be called a Hackage server .
This serves tarballs , cabal files , and basic listings .
The data it maintains are the user database and a map from PackageName to [ PkgInfo ] ( see previous post ) .
It is possible to create a core - only server with an archive .
tar , but it ’s effectively immutable after initialization .
to ( see previous post ) .
It is possible to create a core - only server with an archive .
tar , but it ’s effectively immutable after initialization .
mirror : this allows tarballs to be uploaded directly by special clients , and it is intended for use by secondary Hackages ( if any ) which need to stay up to date without having to support a userbase .
This does n’t use its own data , instead manipulating the core’s .
Now , take a look at the packages , upload , check , users , distros , and build features .
Some of then depend on each other .
They all depend on core .
html depends on all of them .
One way to look at the organization is that they provide the model and controller for data and html provides a view .
They are interfaces which provide their own data in a way which html / json / xml / yaml / whichever other features can render in their particular format with a minimal amount of effort .
For example , the packages feature does n’t define any of its own URIs , but has a function , Package Id -> IO ( Maybe PackageRender ) , which the HTML package page calls .
The PackageRender type is essentially the One True Resource Representation of a package , and it looks like this :
data PackageRender = PackageRender { -- using the most recently uploaded package as of now rendPkgId :: PackageIdentifier , -- Vec - 0.9.8 rendAllVersions :: [ Version ] , -- [ 0.9.0 , 0.9.1 , 0.9.2 , 0.9.3 , 0.9.4 , 0.9.5 , 0.9.6 , 0.9.7 , 0.9.8 ] rendDepends :: [ [ Dependency ] ] , -- [ [ array , base ( ≤5 ) , ghc - prim , QuickCheck ( 2. * ) ] ]
rendExecNames :: [ String ] , -- [ ] ( no executables ) rendLicenseName :: String , -- BSD 3 rendMaintainer :: Maybe String , -- Just " Scott " rendCategory :: [ String ] , -- [ " Data " , " Math " ] rendRepoHeads :: [( RepoType , String , SourceRepo ) ] , -- [ ] ( no repository ) rendModules :: Maybe ModuleForest , -- Just a tree containing Data.
Vec. * rendHasTarball :: Bool , -- True rendUploadInfo :: ( UTCTime , String ) , -- ( Jun 17 2010 , " Scott " ) rendOther :: PackageDescription -- the package description }
From this , the html feature can make a package page that looks like the current one , where 95 % of its work is HTML formatting via Text .
XHtml .
Strict .
A json feature could use the same information to make a data - rich nest of curly braces .
Now , a paragraph or two about a failed approach .
I also considered having each feature provide its own HTML .
This is perhaps the simplest approach on the face of it .
However , it gets tricky to , say , define a package page and then later append to it for newer features .
I considered HTML hooks where a feature could provide an interface to anyone who wants to inject Html blocks into its pages .
For example , a build reports feature would have to register for a hook so that the main package page can link to the reports page .
This has several disadvantages , the most prominent of which is that it makes it cumbersome to switch to a different HTML - generating library or add new formats .
I just accepted that HTML was an exceptionally unmodular thing .
Instead , what the HTML feature now does is depend on both the build reports feature and the packages feature , and this also allows free - form HTML instead of copy + paste amalgamations , which I ’ve heard can be rather ugly .
The metric to go by here is “ out of all modifications one could imagine making to the server , how can I make them implementable modifying the minimum number of modules ? ”
( I have n’t considered using partial derivatives to optimize the minimum … yet . )
Here is a brief description of the middle features :
packages : just package pages
upload : authenticated users can upload new packages , with some checking in place : ca n’t overwrite packages , can only upload a new version if a maintainer , and so on .
Adds a maintainer / author group for each package .
By contrast , the mirror feature overwrites packages without question .
check : checking packages before indexing them and providing candidate packages ( see previous post )
users : user pages , password - changing , currently using core and not storing any data of its own
distros : linking Hackage with Arch , Debian , and any other distribution with package repositories with Haskell binaries .
These distributions can PUT and DELETE to Hackage to indicate the addition and removal of these packages .
build : submission of build reports , both anonymous and with full compilation logs
And finally , an ad hoc but nonetheless important feature :
legacy : a pile of 301 redirects so that old URIs can mostly work ( in particular , links to / cgi - bin / hackage - scripts / package / foobar posted on mailing lists 4 years ago will still work )
Features each have their own particular init functions .
For instance , the function to initialize the HTML module is currently :
initHtmlFeature :: CoreFeature -> PackagesFeature -> IO HtmlFeature
URI trees
I would have written this up yesterday but I ’ve spent the last 24 hours implementing a new and improved routing system .
All of the magic happens in impl , the ServerPart Response which is given to Happstack ’s simpleHTTP .
impl :: Server -> ServerPart Response impl server = renderServerTree ( serverConfig server ) [ ]
-- ServerTree ServerResponse . fmap serveResource -- ServerTree Resource . foldl ' ( \acc res -> addServerNode ( resourceLocation res ) res acc ) serverTreeEmpty -- [ Resource ] $ concatMap resources ( serverFeatures server )
This seems pretty terse for what ’s effectively the server ’s main method , but complexity lurks just beneath the surface .
It all starts with lists of resources , each server feature providing its own list , which are concatenated into a [ Resource ] .
A Resource contains a URI , and how to respond when that URI is visited for certain combinations of HTTP methods and content - types .
Although I ’ve never coded a line of Ruby in my life , I stole some of Rails ’ routing syntax for this task ( also stolen by the Pylons web framework , apparently ) .
Here ’s how it works :
A resource at “ / users / login ” will be run only when /users / login is visited , assuming it ’s a GET request .
A resource at “ / package / : package ” will be run when / package / HDBC is visited , but also when / package / nonexistent - 1.0 is entered .
It ’s passed [ ( " package " , " HDBC " ) ] in the former case , and there are combinators to turn assoc lists into data values ( type DynamicPath = [ ( String , String ) ] and a combinator withPackagePath :: DynamicPath -> ( PackageId -> PkgInfo -> ServerPart Response ) -> ServerPart Response ) .
It ’s up to the resource to return a 404 if it ca n’t abide by the URI .
in the former case , and there are combinators to turn assoc lists into data values ( and a combinator ) .
It ’s up to the resource to return a 404 if it ca n’t abide by the URI .
A resource at “ / package / : package / doc / … ” will be run when / package / uvector / doc / or any subdirectory is visited , and it ’s likewise passed an appropriate assoc list .
I can specify “ / package / : package/:cabal.cabal ” , and when / package / parsec - 3.1.0 / parsec.cabal is visited , the resource is given [ ( " package " , " parsec - 3.1.0 " ) , ( " cabal " , " parsec " ) ] ( the extension is stripped off ) .
( the extension is stripped off ) .
And the most complicated one : “ / package /:package. : format ” .
This works for / package / QuickCheck ( [ ( " package " , " QuickCheck " ) , ( " format " , " " ) ] ) , or / package / llvm - 0.8.0.2.json ( [ ( " package " , " llvm - 0.8.0.2 " ) , ( " format " , " json " ) ] ) .
An empty format means to go for the default , in this case HTML .
Server trees provide a way for efficiently serving an entire tree of URIs .
Starting from an empty server tree , resources are incrementally added , and when two share the same URI format they are combined .
For example , the simplified Hackage URI tree is :
The relevant types are :
data ServerTree a = ServerTree { nodeResponse :: Maybe a , nodeForest :: Map BranchComponent ( ServerTree a ) }
data BranchComponent = StaticBranch String -- / foo | DynamicBranch String -- /:bar | TrailingBranch -- /...
addServerNode :: Monoid a => [ BranchComponent ] -> a -> ServerTree a -> ServerTree a
Finally , I have a 100 - line function for converting resources into something Happstack can read ( to be broken up shortly , I hope ) .
It ’s called serveResource , and it ’s how I convert a ServerTree Resource into a ServerTree ServerResponse via ServerTree ‘s Functor instance .
Then the tree is converted to its final flat form , using Happstack ’s path - munching combinators to traverse each node ’s forest .
serveResource :: Resource -> ServerResponse
renderServerTree :: Config -> DynamicPath -> ServerTree ServerResponse -> ServerPart Response
If this effort is a success , I wo n’t have to deal with the ServerTree type in any great detail for the rest of the summer .
I ’ve pushed all of the above code to the hackage - server repository .
Thanks for perusing my run-through of some of the internal server design and my exploration of the problem domain .
I ’ve also been reading the other GSOC blogs , including Marco ’s progress on Immix .
I had idly considered applying for that , but given my near - total unfamiliarity with the GHC RTS , I think it would ’ve been more than a bit difficult for me .
I can see he ’s doing a great job , too .
Still , there are some things I appreciate about using Haskell and not C in my project .
Not only does the type system prevent a host of runtime errors , it also forces me to consider all possible sorts of values which can inhabit a given type and write a case for each one .
This is something that ’s come in handy a lot in the past few days .
Well , now on to actually implementing features in detail .
I ’ll keep you all posted .
The Webby Awards were held Monday night in the posh Cipriani ballroom ( once the lobby of the bank that would become Citi ) on Wall Street .
Truthdig Editor Robert Scheer took the opportunity to stick it to the neighborhood .
For the uninitiated , Webby winners are held to a strict five - word limit for their speeches .
It ’s pretty difficult to say something profound , relevant or even just funny in that space , but we think Bob did a great job .
You can watch all the winners , including Arianna Huffington , Roger Ebert and Buzz Aldrin , here .
Once again , big thanks to the Webbys for honoring us as the best political blog and to all our writers , readers and staff members who make it possible .

Yiazmat ヤズマット ( Yazumatto ?
Gameplay details Location(s ) Stage 98 ( Zodiac versions ) Ridorana Cataract ( Colosseum ) ; Trial Mode versions ) Type Ultimate Mark Data Stats Yiazmat is the ultimate Elite Mark in Final Fantasy XII .
He is not only the ultimate mark , but also the ultimate boss .
Defeating Yiazmat takes at least an hour at high levels and player skill , but usually takes longer .
Yiazmat has well over 50 million hit points .
This astronomically high number is the main reason he takes so long to kill , since regular attacks break the damage limit only in the Zodiac versions .
In Hard Mode of Lightning Returns : Final Fantasy XIII , Aeronite fought in a Chaos infusion can have nearly 58,000,000 HP , surpassing Yiazmat , though it does not take as long to defeat .
The player can accept the hunt for Yiazmat after vanquishing the optional boss Hell Wyrm and all Rank VII Marks except Shadowseer .
In the Zodiac versions , Yiazmat is also fought at Trial Mode on Stage 98 ( with much less HP at 3.7M ) .
Yagyu Darkblade ( uncommon ) and Mesa ( rare ) can be stolen from it .

Linking Attacks Pursuit
Yiazmat is found at the Colosseum at the Ridorana Cataract where the arena is covered in traps .
It is possible to defeat it at around level 50 or even lower with the right strategy , but levels 70 and above are preferable .
Its total health is made up of fifty individual bars consisting of one million HP each .
Yiazmat 's battle tactics change as its HP is depleted , but most of its attacks either involve attacking the whole team at once or using Instant Death attacks should the party get out of its reach .
Yiazmat can KO the party 's best character with a couple of hits , regardless of the kind of equipment they are wearing , as all of its physical attacks have a 5 % chance of inflicting Instant Death .
When its HP drops below 50 % the total damage Yiazmat takes is reduced by 1/3 .
This means that in the original version , all attacks against Yiazmat are capped at 6,999 damage , so the battle becomes about using combo weapons rather than damage dealers .
In the Zodiac versions , the damage cap is removed , but combo weapons remain useful , albeit ultimate weapons like the Tournesol and Zodiac Spear are now better .
If the party wanders too far from its reach , Yiazmat will start buffing itself , starting with Protect , then Bravery , Faith and Regen .
It 's possible to leave the area to use the Save Crystal and to buy more items and return and continue the battle , but the player must make their exit fast ; if Yiazmat has time to cast Regen before the party has left the area , it will continue gaining HP even while the party is away .
If the player walks too far away from Yiazmat while still in its area , Yiazmat will regain health like other enemies .
When Yiazmat 's HP is about at 9 - 10 bars left , it will use Growing Threat to boost its damage output even further .
When it has about 4 - 5 bars of health left , it will start using Reflectga , but it is a once per stage cast .
If the player is not careful , a Renew spell could be reflected off the party , fully healing Yiazmat .
Yiazmat is susceptible to the Expose Technick , which allows even weak characters to deal maximum damage .
Yiazmat combos more often as its life goes down .
In the Zodiac versions , Yiazmat is susceptible to all stat - lowering attacks ( Expose , Wither , Shear , and Addle ) , which allows the player to defeat the beast even with a low level party .
The battle will easily take over an hour , with completion in two hours being considered fast for the average player .
The player can leave the area at any time and upon return Yiazmat 's HP will be the same ( assuming it was unable to cast Regen ) .
There is a round indicator in the upper right part of the screen , showing how often the party fled the battle .
It has no bearing on the reward the player receives for winning the battle .
Yiazmat uses physical attacks with each having 5 % chance of inflicting Instant Death .
The lower Yiazmat is on HP , the more combos it will get , up to 12 - hit - combos .
Rake is the wyrms ' special move that Yiazmat also uses .
It deals 1.5 x normal damage and also has a 5 % chance of inflicting Instant Death .
Cyclone is Yiazmat 's special move and hits all characters .
It is Wind-elemental and has a chance of inflicting the party with Sap .
Yiazmat uses Cyclone once every 40 actions ( more often if the party is out of its reach , attacking with ranged attacks ) and as the first move when the player returns to the battle after leaving ( Stage 2 onwards ) .
The damage can be halved if equipped with Windbreaker armor .
Death Strike casts Instant Death on a party member .
It has a 50 % chance of missing if the character is under Shell .
Yiazmat uses it always when its target is out of the range of its physical attack , and less commonly to a target that is close .
Stone Breath deals damage and has 30 % chance to inflict the characters in - range with Petrify .
White Breath deals ice damage and has 30 % chance to inflict the characters in - range with Stop .
Yiazmat 's attacks ignore vitality .
Yiazmat will stop using its breath attacks during the battle 's last stage .
Yiazmat absorbs Holy and is weak against Dark .
Yiazmat 's attacks have no charge time .
Yiazmat has Ignore Evade making most shields pointless .
Ninja swords are good weapons , as in the original version all of them are Dark - elemental and have high chance of comboing .
The Yagyu Darkblade is of extreme usefulness in all versions ( as it remains Dark - elemental in the Zodiac versions ) .
If the ninja sword user wears the Black Robes ( which boosts Dark damage ) and the Genji Gloves , they will get an additional 50 % damage bonus against Yiazmat ( weakness to Dark ) , dealing 300 % damage , and with the Genji Gloves the player will combo more often .
Weapons with high combo rate often make better weapons than ones with sheer attack power .
With maximum stacks of Expose used on Yiazmat , a level 70 party can already hit 9999 in the non-capped phase on Yiazmat constantly in the original version with only a Koga Blade or Iga Blade , if they equip a Black Robe .
If they also equip a Black Mask , it is possible to set a gambit for the characters to attack themselves if they are below 100 % HP , and they should be able to heal themselves fully in four hits from critical HP with Bubble status on , even outhealing Yiazmat 's damage to them .
The only shield one might want to use is the Shell Shield for the mage ( they can then equip a one - handed weapon , but it might not matter if they only cast magick ) .
It 's a good idea to purchase six Bubble Belts and wear them at all times , even for the back - up party .
The party can buy Windbreakers from Rabanastre to switch to when Yiazmat is readying Cyclone to take half - damage , but by the end of the battle Cyclone is cast so fast there may be no time to do the switch anymore .
Battle Speed should be kept at the fastest , as Yiazmat 's attacks have no charge time , thus using slow battle speed only slows down the player 's party .
Yiazmat is too big to fit down the narrow stairwells .
Even a low - level party can defeat it by using ranged weapons and standing far enough down the stairs forcing Yiazmat to only use Death Strike .
With Shell , it has a chance of missing .
However , the player might opt to using one character as the mage , and placing him / her at the stairs with a Shell Shield granting them Auto - Shell , keeping them away from harm 's way ( Cyclone will still hit except under the stairs ) .
The mage can then heal and buff the other party members who hack away on Yiazmat 's massive HP .
Alternatively , the bottom - of - the - stairs character can wield a ranged weapon , such as Fomalhaut / Mithuna with Dark Shot , and chip away at Yiazmat 's HP while it concentrates its attacks on the characters closer to it .
This tactic might be useful near the end of the battle when Yiazmat is stronger and faster .
The player can set one character as the tank and have the other two characters cast Decoy , Berserk and Reverse on him / her .
This wo n't help against the Instant Death chance , but the chance is still only 5 % , allowing the character to endure most attacks .
Yiazmat will mainly concentrate on the decoyed character with its Rake and physical attacks , while the berserked character attacks Yiazmat .
If using the above method of using ninja swords and Dark - absorbing for healing by hitting oneself , the " tank " character can heal off the Reverse instead .
The player characters can have more than 9999 HP , despite the number being capped at 9999 on the screen .
As Yiazmat 's attacks are capped at 9999 damage , it is possible for the party to survive the Cyclone even after taking the full 9999 HP damage .
The player can wear equipment , such as light armor hats ( such as Renewing Morion that also has Auto Regen , or Dueling Mask ) that increase the party 's HP over the capped 9999 figure displayed on - screen .
The player can use the Technick Infuse to set a character 's HP critically low .
In low health the character can perform long hit combos , especially when equipped with the Genji Gloves and a ninja sword or a katana .
The augment Adrenaline doubles attack power while in critical health .
Yiazmat defeated in 50 minutes [ edit | edit source ]
Final Fantasy XII Ultimania Omega guide has a strategy that shows how Yiazmat can be defeated in 50 minutes and 54 seconds .
It includes having two damage dealers ( the guide suggests using Basch and Balthier due to having low MP and Magick ) who are always in critical health to continually deal double damage with long combos .
The two should always be under Berserk and use a high - combo weapon while also being equipped with the Brave Suit .
The third character should be the leader who casts Reverse and Decoy on themself and controls the fight with Yiazmat .
If the leader dies , the player should switch a new leader from a reserve party member .
All characters should be level 99 and have all licenses purchased .
This strategy can defeat Yiazmat at lower levels , but it will be nigh impossible to do so within 50 minutes .
The leader should have the statuses Reverse , Lure , Regen , Bubble , Protect , Libra and Haste , be equipped with the Staff of the Magi , Crown of Laurels ( Vaan and Fran ) or Dueling Mask ( Ashe and Penelo ) , Lordly Robes and a Power Armlet or Ribbon to grant immunity to Stop .
The leader 's gambits should be as follows :
Foe : HP < 100000 → Dark Matter Ally : Any → Chronos Tear Ally : Status = Reflect → Dispel Self : → Reverse Ally : Any → Arise Self : → Decoy Self : → Bubble Self : MP < 50 % → Hi-Ether Ally : MP < 10 % → Berserk Ally : MP < 10 % → Haste Ally : Any → Gold Needle Foe : Any → Dispel
The damage dealers should always have the statuses HP Critical , Berserk , Float and Haste ( Basch ) and be equipped with Masamune .
Celebrant 's Miter ( gives Magick and Speed ) , Brave Suit ( increased damage ) and Genji Gloves for Basch and Hermes Sandals for Balthier .
Their gambits should be as follows :
Ally : Any → Chronos Tear Self : HP < 10 % → Berserk Foe : Character HP < 10 % → Attack Self : HP < 10 % → Bacchus 's Wine Self : → Infuse ( Changes MP to HP and is used to put the damage dealers into critical HP after two casts )
The items needed are :
x1 Dark Matter ( charged to full with Knot of Rust to deal 60 k damage )
Masamune / Yagyu Darkblade ( though Yagyu Darkblade does more damage initially , Masamune has a higher combo chance and will do more damage in the long run )
Staff of the Magi ( for each leader )
Shell Shield
Bubble Belts
Plenty of Hi-Ether , Remedy , Gold Needle , Chronos Tear , and Bacchus 's Wine
The battle config should be in active mode with the fastest battle speed and cursor set to memorized .
It 's recommended to start the battle by using two leaders ; the " trap walker " leader , whose only purpose is to get rid of the traps in the arena , and the " main leader " who will initially heal the " trap walker " when necessary , use the Expose Technick on Yiazmat five times successfully to halve its Defense , and try to hold Yiazmat for the remainder of the battle .
Once the traps are gone the player should switch out the " trap walker " and bring in both damage - dealers .
When the damage dealers begin to use Infuse the player must manually attack with both damage dealers in - between their Infuses , or they will kill themselves with the second .
The player must be wary of this any time a damage dealer is revived , otherwise everything else the damage dealers do is automatic .
The player will use the leader character (s ) to control the fight by running around Yiazmat by chasing Yiazmat 's tail from its side , so that Yiazmat is following the leader at all times , and yet not actually hitting , while using to enter flee mode in - between casts to help with keeping distance .
While running from Yiazmat the player must keep in mind the distance between the leader and damage dealers , as when Yiazmat readies Cyclone , the leader must be as far away from them as possible or it will kill them .
When Yiazmat readies Death Strike , the player should equip a Shell Shield on the leader and then switch back to Staff of Magi afterward , to help mitigate the chances of instant KO .
Whenever a leader does get knocked out , the player must open the menu and switch out Balthier ( or whoever is weaker of the two damage dealers ) for a second leader .
The priority in reviving / rebuffing is Arise → Reverse → Lure → Bubble ( if not using Bubble Belt already ) .
Only after the buffs are ready should the player switch back in the damage dealer .
After Yiazmat uses Growing
Threat the team leaders should consider using Bubble Belts , as it is critical at this point that any leaders who get KO'd are revived with double HP .
It is even recommended to hold a fresh character specifically for Yiazmat 's last HP bar .
Trial Mode [ edit | edit source ]
There are treasures on the arena and one of them is on a fusillade trap ( deals heavy damage when stepped on ) .
The treasures only contain gil .
The main area of the arena does n't have traps like in the main game .
The player may steal a Yagyu Darkblade or Mesa from Yiazmat on this round .
It has only a fraction of the health it has in the main game , but remains a formidable opponent .
Yiazmat simply waits for the player to engage it , and thus the player has time to gather their bearings from the last round .
As soon as the player approaches it Yiazmat uses Cyclone .
It continues to use it periodically .
It then starts to use Rake with a chance of Instant Death and breath attacks that can inflict Stop and Petrify .
After losing ~ 40 % of its health , Yiazmat doubles its level by using Growing Threat ( as opposed to in the main game when it uses it with only 20 % health remaining ) .
It does n't use Reflectga on the party like in the main game .
The same general strategy can be used to take it down .

30,000 gil
The Godslayer 's Badge
The Godslayer 's Badge , along with the Omega Badge ( earned by defeating Omega Mark XII ) and Lu Shang 's Badge ( earned from the fishing minigame ) , is needed to acquire the Wyrmhero Blade , one of the strongest weapons .
Defeating Yiazmat unlocks his sprite in the Sky Pirate 's Den and awards the " Hunter Extraordinaire " trophy / achievement in The Zodiac Age .
Etymology and allusion [ edit | edit source ]
Yiazmat 's name alludes to director Yasumi Matsuno 's nickname ( Yazumi Matsuno ) .
The additional " i " in Yiazmat 's name is not present in the Japanese version , likely being a localization decision to associate it closer to " Tiamat . "
The title of the hunt is " Farewell to a Legend , " a reference to how Matsuno left the company before the game was completed , and the story Montblanc tells refers to how the development team felt about him , albeit with a different end .
Yiazmat bears many similarities to the recurring boss Shinryu .
Like Shinryu , Yiazmat is a holy dragon spoken of like a deity , is said in its bestiary entry to be the guardian of a powerful sword , and accepting the hunt for Yiazmat allows the party to fight Omega Mark XII ; Shinryu and Omega are often depicted as hunting one another .
As Shinryu does not appear in any games set in Ivalice , Yiazmat may serve as Shinryu 's substitute among the enemy roster .

WASHINGTON , June 4 ( UPI ) --
He speaks nine languages , taught himself Icelandic in a week and invented his own language he calls Manti .
The 31 - year - old autistic savant does complex celestial computations in seconds , sees hundreds of numbers on a blackboard once and can recite them in the correct sequence minutes later .
Daniel Tammet possesses synesthesia .
Not only does he see numbers but also feels them .
He is one in hundreds of millions , as he demonstrated on ABC's " 20/20 " this week .
But when the " singularity " arrives -- that moment in history when the supercomputer capable of trillions of moves per second will have reached parity with the human brain , capable of feelings , from bereavement to passionate to anger -- countless millions of people will be like Tammet

" The Singularity is Near : A True Story about the Future , " a documentary film by inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil , will make its world premiere debut June 12 at the Breckenridge Film Festival in Colorado .
Kurzweil predicts that with the ever - accelerating rate of technological change , " humanity is fast approaching an era in which our intelligence will become trillions of times more powerful and increasingly merged with computers . "
Kurzweil sees " the dawning of a new civilization , enabling us to transcend our biological limitations . "
Boundaries blur between human and machine , real and virtual .
Human aging and illness are reversed , he says , world hunger and poverty are solved , and " we cure death . "
Too late for BP and the untold billions it will have to shell ( no pun intended ) out to compensate hundreds of thousands of resort operators , condominium owners robbed of their beachfront retirement , men and women deprived of their livelihood at sea .
But when the singularity arrives , such human miscalculations will be a thing of the past .

Bill Gates says " Kurzweil is the best person I know at predicting the future , in which information technologies have advanced so far and fast that they enable humanity to transcend its biological limitations -- transforming our lives in ways we can only imagine " unless we have a connection at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .
Already , banks of coupled supercomputers have managed 1 quadrillion -- 1,000 trillion -- operations per second .
The Breckenridge documentary features Kurzweil examining the social and philosophical implications of these " profound changes and the potential threats they pose to human civilization in dialogues with big thinkers , " including former White House counter - terrorism chief Richard A. Clarke ; technologists Bill Joy , Mitch Kapor , Marvin Minsky , Eric Drexler , Sherry Turkle and Cynthia Breazeal ; " Future Shock " author Alvin Toffler ; civil liberties lawyer Alan Dershowitz ; venture capitalist Vinod Khosla and environmentalist Bill McKibben .
Kurzweil enjoys a 20 - year track record of accurate predictions .
Forbes magazine described him as the " rightful heir to Thomas Edison " and " the ultimate thinking machine . "
He holds 19 honorary doctorates and is also the recipient of awards from three U.S. presidents .
Getting from here to where Kurzweil sees us in 20 to 30 years is a formidable obstacle course with still faulty human judgment .

The $ 1 trillion Iraq War proved a huge distraction from the real problems of the United States , e.g. , a collapsing infrastructure , from airports to air traffic control to schools to roads to bridges to water and sewage pipes ( more than 100 years old in the nation 's capital ) .
With a little luck , the United States and its allies may move Afghanistan from a medieval tribal society to a more recent century but is that worth another trillion dollars ?
In the mid-1990s , the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( where this reporter toils ) published a monograph titled " Cybercrime , Cyberterrorism , Cyberwarfare : Averting an Electronic Waterloo . "
The handwriting was on the electronic wall .
China was already actively developing and refining the tools of 21st - century warfare .
Beijing knew it could never compete with U.S. military hardware .
But it also recognized the United States could n't function as a superpower without the satellites in orbit around the planet that today pilot drones and drop bombs and missiles over enemy positions thousands of miles away -- and eavesdrops on electronic communications the world over .
Last year , the Pentagon was " attacked " or probed electronically 6 million times in one day .
One of the Pentagon cybernauts said privately , " It was like a perpetual hail storm on the Pentagon cocoon . "
The technology still cannot pinpoint the origin of the would - be intruders .
They range from a 14 - year - old computer game wizard to China 's military cybercommand flexing its electronic muscles , or the old Soviet FAPSI now modernized courtesy of Western high - tech firms .
Last month , better late than never , the Defense Department stood up its first cybercommand that now ranks with the other major commands at home and abroad .
Taking over as the new four - star cyber uber is the old three - star NSA chief U.S. Army Gen. Keith B. Alexander who now wears both caps -- a blend of the global vacuum cleaner that can intercept and analyze the current global total of 247 billion e-mail messages a day ( and whose spam detector rejects 200 billion ) and both defend all government networks against intrusion and launch electronic counterattacks .

Denial of service attacks organized by FAPSI demonstrated their electronic arsenal by zapping Estonia and Georgia into electronic paralysis .
Similar attacks across frontiers would have been unilateral declarations of war .
International law is yet to catch up .
And it wo n't be soon enough now that the United States has developed Star Wars technology ; super lasers that can zap 50,000 - watt blasts from an aircraft or satellite against ships , tanks , headquarters , enemy electronic capabilities .
Ray Kurweil 's second coming still has to get from here to there .
Narrative media is undergoing a shift from the traditional model of
single , linear story lines to much broader explorations of the story
world .
Narratives are developed within larger contexts where even
tertiary characters can act as launch points for new stories that
flesh out the fictional universe .
These bleed into the physical world
through alternate reality gaming and transmedia cross-platform
experiences that directly engage the audience , drawing them into the
story through real - world challenges .
ARG 's may not be especially new
but they 're being more commonly integrated into franchise productions
through transmedia campaigns across web sites , mobile engagement ,
shorts , graphic novels , video games , music , and any other possible
medium that can extend the story .
While much of this shift has been driven by the entertainment
industry , typically around run-up advertising campaigns , transmedia
experiences are perhaps most compelling as native expressions of a
fully - articulated narrative universe .
This is transmedia world
building : creating a fictional universe so rich and complete that a
multitude of interweaving stories can emerge from it , taking form
through the social and technological spaces we share .
The video game
spin -off becomes an opportunity to extend the narrative and create a
new experience .
The web site becomes a breadcrumb in the story arc
offering a phone number that conveys a meeting place .
The graphic
novel picks up the life of a tertiary character from the original
story .
The audience is asked to participate in the unfolding
narrative .
The pieces here are n't particularly new but they 're all starting to
converge with the technologies that enable these experiences .
Most
importantly ( and disruptively ) they are converging in a way that
radically empowers independent content creators at exactly the moment
when they 've been completely abandoned by the industry giants of
yesteryear .
The majors have ditched or shelved their independent film
houses and now focus solely on tent - pole blockbusters .
Premiers at
Cannes , Sundance , and other indie fests are barely selling to the
studios .
Yet , independent creators can set up powerful home studios
and score a RED camera or even a Canon 5D mk2 to shoot & produce
exceptional , authentic work .
And very soon the audience will control
access to this massive Long Tail of content right from their living
room ( and from their mobiles , and laptops , and kiosks , and car
stereos , etc … )
Indeed , the near - simultaneous announcement of both Google TV and the
new iteration of Apple TV herald the final arrival of truly integrated
internet TV .
This is the enxt major wave of convergence .
These devices
will fully legitimize web video – the pre-eminent domain of
independent film , tv , and short - format creators – and bring it
directly into the living room for mass consumption .
Viewers will be
able to open chat streams , web browsers , interactive content , and
feedback polling while watching content from YouTube , Hulu , Vimeo and
anyone else uploading to the cloud .
Content providers will grab
analytics off the back - end , manage ad placement , and push interactive
challenges directly to the viewers .
Internet TV convergence will be
radically disruptive .
The majors are fighting hard to control this space .
They 'll continue
to defend the old models & limp box office gimmicks like " 3D " movies
while new media innovators will be figuring out how to use Microsoft's
Kinect and augmented reality and geolocation to extend the reach &
impact of their content .
New models of crowdfunding & collaboration
will bring the audience into the production , and creators will push
out distribution through iTunes , Netflix , torrents , and the emerging
array of independent web hosts .
Whatever the role of Old Media may be
in the future , independent creators will play a much larger role in
the new media landscape .

The number of U.S. households with a net worth of at least $ 1 million jumped 16 percent last year after dipping sharply during the financial crisis , an industry consulting group said on Tuesday .
Households with a net worth of $ 1 million or more , excluding their primary residence , totaled 7.8 million in 2009 , up from 6.7 million in 2008 , according to Spectrem Group .
The number of millionaire households shrank by 27 percent in 2008 , it said .
The current total is still well below the record 9.2 million millionaire households reported in 2007 , Spectrem said .
Last year ’s spike came as U.S. stock markets rallied .
The S&P 500 Index rose 28 percent , and the largest wealth management firms reported strong earnings as their clients ’ accounts recovered from the 2008 meltdown .
The study also found ultra high net worth families -- those with at least $ 5 million -- grew 17 percent last year to 980,000 , Spectrem said .
Households with $ 500,000 or more topped 12.7 million , up 12 percent .
Spectrem said its study was based on surveys of 3,000 affluent households and online surveys of roughly 2,600 families .

The World Cup starts this weekend , and many of the matches will be determined by the cruelest facet of the beautiful game : the penalty kick .
A hopeful kick , a simultaneous leap , and 0.2 seconds later , you have a goal or a goat .
Freakonomics economist Steve Levitt co-wrote a paper on penalty kick strategy , and it 's pretty cool .
Conventional wisdom says kickers are best at pulling with their strong leg , so you 'd expect most kickers to be right - footed and aim left ( the goalie 's right ) .
Goalies know that , so you 'd expect most keepers to guess the kicker 's left .
But about 75 % of all shots are scores .
So what strategies are working ?
Levitt and his co-authors made some surprising finds .
First , check out these two charts of shots taken and goals scored as percentage of shots taken in French and Italian leagues .
(1) Both goalies and kickers go left more than right ( left - left is the most common observation ) .
(2) Kicking to the right had the lowest payoff of any decision , of either goalie or kicker .
(3) Kicking middle had the highest pay - off of any decision , of either goalie or kicker .
The paper 's economic conclusion is interesting , but it wo n't be satisfying for fans who derive morbid pleasure from screaming at their goalie or penalty kicker for being irrational .
The authors write : " We cannot reject that players optimally choose strategies , conditional on the opponent 's behavior . "
Good penalty kickers and goalies are also good at randomization of strategy .
* Update : It 's also notable that the success probabilities of Left , Middle , and Right for goalies are practically identical .

Spain 's football federation says the Liverpool and World Cup - winning Spain striker Fernando Torres has ruptured a muscle in his left thigh .
In a statement on its website the federation said Torres had a magnetic resonance scan yesterday at the Centro de Madrid Clinic and evidence was found of " a grade one muscle fibre rupture in the left thigh " .
However the injury appears to be not as severe as first feared – suggesting Torres could be fit to play early in the season .
Torres had struggled to make the World Cup after missing the end of Liverpool 's season with injuries to his right knee and looked sluggish in South Africa .
He pulled up shortly after coming on during extra-time of Sunday 's 1 - 0 win over Holland in the final .
Torres seems likely to miss at least Liverpool 's opening three games .
They open their campaign at home against Arsenal before travelling to Manchester City then hosting West Bromwich Albion .
If the injury proves to be more serious , the striker could miss Liverpool 's fixture away at Manchester United on Sunday , 19 September .
The club have yet to comment on the Spanish federation 's diagnosis .

I know I ’m headed toward burnout when I start to consider a career change .
The most common fantasy is becoming a construction site stop / slow sign holder .
When I think about my awesome new job , I think about standing in the sunshine ( but not the humidity ) , doing work that is not especially taxing , and at which I am very unlikely to fail .
In contrast , when I think about real job , I can only remember the suck –the writing that is falling flat , the grant that was rejected , the volunteers I ’ve failed to inspire , the programs ideas going no where –failure in all directions .
Of course , these stories are all about the burnout state of mind and not about reality .
When I ’m stuck in this place , I do not think about how fast the cars drive through construction sites , or the noise , or the fumes , or the rain , or about how difficult it would be to stand on the road all day , or any of the myriad of stresses that , as a person with no knowledge at all of the construction industry , I can not even imagine .
I also fail to remember that I hate standing around with nothing to think about and that the challenge of solving difficult problems and making a visible impact on the world is a key element to my personal happiness .
What ’s up with that ?
Resetting your Brain
It ’s hard to keep the great parts of your real job at the top of your mind and easy to imagine how happy you would be doing something else , primarily because of your point of view .
From the inside of an organization you see all the dirty laundry , know about all the plans that fell through , and are intimately aware of the spectacular failures that the public never sees .
Since you rarely see that side of other organizations , they seem totally put together and awesome , while you feel like you are teetering on the edge of total disaster .
To reset your view , remind yourself of how others see your work .
For arts people and other organizations that serve the general public , this is pretty easy .
Get out of your office and become a patron .
Spend some time in the petting zoo , catch the Wednesday matinee , tag - along on a museum tour .
Do n’t check the crowd for donors , do n’t count empty seats , do n’t try to fix anything .
Just soak in the public experience of your work .
Then , when it ’s done , go back to your office and see if you do n’t feel a bit better .
The concept is similar for other nonprofit organizations –spend some time as close to the public value of your work as possible .
Swing a hammer .
Serve the soup .
Wash the birds .
Get onto the front lines and re-experience your connection to the work in a visceral way .
Why it works
As a leader in your organization , a big part of your calling is to fix what ’s broken .
Success stories do n’t require your attention , and so you let them go .
It ’s a great time management technique , but it ’s not so great for your motivation .
Judy Brown explains it another way :
Seconds *
She sells the perfect ones ,
the cups and bowls without
a flaw , the ones that
with a potter ’s eye and hand
she knows will likely
never chip nor break ,
will stand the heat and cold ,
weather a thousand washings
and remain as new
The seconds ?
Those she keeps and uses ,
lives with day to day .
Some have a flaw
that even I can see ;
others look perfect
to my untrained eye ,
but she ’s aware
they wo n’t withstand
the challenge
of a stranger ’s
daily use .
“ Incomplete ideas ” she calls
the ones she keeps
just for herself .
“ Unfinished thoughts , ”
The seconds , plates and bowls ,
not flawed but incomplete .
Perhaps it ’s true for
all of us who craft a thing ,
who write a poem ,
build a boat
shape an idea
or an enterprise .
The perfect ones ,
the ones that work ,
we sell or give away .
We move beyond them ,
on to something new .
They pass out of our minds .
The yet unfinished thoughts ,
ideas incomplete ,
things that wo n’t work ,
we look at every day .
We live more with the
flaws of craft
than with its perfect form
Perhaps that ’s why
it ’s difficult to see
the grace of our own artistry ,
to bring to mind the gifts
we ’ve shipped away from us ,
to recollect the beauty of
a plate that someone
else can touch
from day to day ,
while we ourselves
thrice daily
take our nourishment
from pieces that
we know are flawed .

Apartments • Suita - shi , Japan Architects : Matsunami Mitsutomo
Area Area of this architecture project Area : 1190 m²
Year Completion year of this architecture project Year : 2007
Photographs Photographs : Matsunami Mitsutomo
Text description provided by the architects .
As the apartment has ‘ A room arrangement matching that of the window pattern ’ , the part that was once unavoidable has now become a large subject of the design .
Taking the challenge of a small apartment within those conditions , whilst dealing with a strict budget , the Katayama apartment was born .
The Katayama Apartment is a small apartment block built on a site of 110 m ² and consists of 7 stories , 2 apartments per floor and a total of 10 apartments .
On the north side is located the elevator , stairs and the passage with the basis being a flat plan .
However , in part there is a high - ceiling maisonette covering 2 floors incorporated like stacked blocks .
The layout is quite apparent when viewed from the façade of the south side .
The sectional structure is reflected as it is in the outline of the façade .
In other words , the lifestyle inside the apartment itself designed the façade , reflecting the intent to let the vitality of life spread out into the landscape of the homogenous rows of houses in Katayama .
For the external finish a distinct black and white colour was chosen , in order to show the strong presence of a simple box against the surrounding dull buildings of beige , grey or brick shades .
In order to realise this façade design , restrictions due to the evacuation plan had to be overcome .
Various patterns that would not impose on the balcony standard for emergency evacuation were considered and resulted in this design .
The variation to the cross-sectional design was brought about by the strategy of the business proprietor of ‘ How can additional value be achieved ’ .
Since supply of article for lease affair in this area meets the demand , distinction from other properties and elevated value was an absolute necessity .
Since legal height restrictions permitted , a high ceiling room was integrated and , bringing together 3 plan types and finishing materials , a combination of 10 patterns was fashioned .
By these means , a space offering both diversity and economic efficiency was obtained .
It is these elements which makes the characteristic façade and maintains no apartment vacancies to date .
When there 's rain , line your containers underneath the points of heaviest rainfall to collect water .
Since my balcony has a cover , the rain falls mostly near the railing .
Wait for your container to fill up , then cover tightly with lid .
You need to cover the water because still water is a breeding ground for mosquitoes .
This page will explain much better than I can .
And as for algae growing in the clear plastic containers , I 've been using this rain water collection for the past month and have not encountered any problems .
Since my collection is at such a small quantity , I use the water relatively quickly .
Also , my northern - facing balcony gets little sun , and the water is kept in the corner , so this is probably why algae does n't pose a problem for me .
If your balcony has no sunshade covering , or receives a lot of sun , you might have to either use dark colored containers , or keep them stored under a tarp , in a storage box , or even inside your apartment .
* Note : I also lined my plastic watering can under the sunshade to collect rain water .
It 's great because it can hold more water , but you do need to find something to cover the opening once it 's filled .
Or , if you 're going to able to use all the water up right away , then go ahead and leave it uncovered .
Either way , I 'd suggest you try to use the water from the watering can before you use the container - stored water .
Oakland police are undergoing refreshers on crowd - control .
Businesses are boarding up storefronts and removing dumpsters .
City officials are calling for cool heads .
Bloggers and columnists are pleading for public calm .
Anxious anticipation reigns as the city of Oakland awaits the verdict in the trial of Johannes Mehserle , a former Bay Area Rapid Transit ( BART ) police officer charged with murdering passenger Oscar Grant on a train platform in January 2009 .
Closing arguments Thursday and Friday have officials worried over a possible repeat of the clashes that occurred after Mr. Grant 's death , when businesses were vandalized , cars and dumpsters set ablaze .
“ The city and police have been very proactive in reaching out to businesses and residents to make sure they have up to date information and are aware of police support from other jurisdictions , ” says Scott Peterson , Public Policy Director for the Oakland Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce .
“ We had riots following the incident itself and no one is taking any chances , ” he says
But several community groups are also going on the offensive – for peace .
A YouTube video produced by the Oakland group “ Youth Uprising ” has a long list of local activists , poets , rappers , police , district attorneys and regular Joes admonishing watchers to “ denounce all forms of violence . ”
The not - for - profit organization , supported by Alameda County and the City of Oakland , helps give underprivileged youth options .
The group is holding broad meetings to train young people to understand the US legal system , the economic costs of rioting , and to identify outside agitators .
The city Chamber of Commerce announced Thursday an Oscar Grant Memorial Fund for after - school centers for youth .
And the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights is announcing forums for youth leaders to be educated about the history of successful social movements .
The tone of this movement is one of healing , understanding , and progress .
“ In all the media hype surrounding the trial and the cops vs. protester coverage , something is lost .
That something is healing , transformative justice , ” writes Ella Baker Center Executive Director Jakada Imani in a statement to media , schools , churches and clerics .
“ How do we build a powerful social movement and not just participate in one - off flash mobs ? ”
In a phone conversation , Mr. Imani is openly upset with the media portrayal of events since the Mehserle shooting .
Yes , midnight crowds overturned and burned cars , broke windows and caused violence , he says .
But months later , thousands of people in the streets held vigils and speeches for hours without incident .
Hours after the peaceful crowds dispersed , a few small groups broke some windows , and “ suddenly all the media attention was directed at ' another violent protest , ' ” says Imani .
“ This town is perfectly capable of dealing with this peacefully and moving forward even wiser . ”
His story is confirmed by Youth Uprising 's executive director , Olis Simmons .
“ If you look at the videos of that coverage , you find that this violence was clearly led by outside agitators because they were wearing Muslim scarves and beanies that our kids simply do n’t wear , ” says Ms. Simmons .
She says a group of outside agitators showed up at a youth , education and training workshop Thursday and were told to leave by the Oakland teenagers who were there .
“ This is why we are trying to train our teens what outside infiltrators look like and why it ’s not advisable to follow them , ” says Simmons .
She says 75 percent of those on the streets that second night were not from Oakland .
“ We are teaching teens that they have choices at times like these . ”
Part of their exercise Thursday was to review the Watts riots of 1965 and those that followed the acquittal of Rodney King in 1992 – which were the most deadly and costly in American history .
“ Kids need to understand that these incidents only harmed the communities themselves , while putting out a very negative image nationally that is hard to overcome , ” says Simmons .
Imani says he can’t believe that justice will not be served in the first verdict , but that several organizations , including his and Youth Uprising , are emphasizing legal recourses that can follow instead of violence .
“ Another trial of Mehserle would violate the US Constitutional protection of ‘ double jeopardy ’ , ” says Simmons .
“ But these teens do n’t really understand that the US Department of Justice can institute another trial for violations of civil rights , which is what happened after O.J. Simpson was originally acquitted . ”

Religious liberty campaigners have condemned a vote by the French National Assembly in favour of banning face coverings in public .
The proposed law is aimed at preventing Muslim women from wearing a veil , known as a niqab .
Although there are around five million Muslims in France , only about 2,000 cover their faces .
The decision was strongly criticised by Amnesty International , who described it as an assault on free expression .
There are predictions that religious and racial tensions will rise in France if the ban goes ahead .
The Socialist opposition had been planning to vote against the ban , but decided at the last moment to abstain , apparently due to internal disagreement over the issue .
The bill thus passed the National Assembly by 335 votes to one , with 221 abstentions .
The law will now go to the French senate , who are expected to vote on it in September .
If approved by the French Constitutional Court , it will come into effect six months later .
But there are already predictions that it will face a challenge in the European Court of Human Rights .
The new law would levy a fine of 150 euros ( currently around £ 119 ) on someone who covers her face .
In addition , there would be a one - year jail term and a fine of 30,000 euros for a man who forces a woman to cover her face .
The French Justice Minister , Michele Alliot - Marie , described today 's vote as a victory for democracy and for “ French values ” of “ freedom against all the oppressions which try to humiliate individuals ” and “ equality between men and women ” .
But Jean Glavany , a Socialist MP who maintained his opposition to the ban , said that the propsoal was based on " nothing more than the fear of those who are different , who come from abroad , who are n't like us , who do n't share our values ” .
Opponents of the measure agree that it is wrong for someone to be forced to cover her face , but say that it is equally wrong to force her not to .
Amnesty 's John Dalhuisen said that French politicians should “ focus on empowering women to make their own choices , rather than limiting the range of choices available to them ” .
He added , “ the rights to freedom of religion and expression entail that all people should be free to choose what - and what not - to wear .
These rights cannot be restricted simply because some - even a majority – find a form of dress objectionable or offensive . ”
Alliot - Marie claimed that the bill is not aimed at “ stigmatising or singling out a religion " .
But it is widely opposed amongst France 's five million Muslims , only about 2,000 of whom cover their faces .
For example , Mohammed Moussaoui , the head of the French Council of the Muslim Faith , said he wishes to discourage women from wearing the niqab , but that it is wrong to make it illegal .
Meanwhile , a French businessman , Rachid Nekkaz , is already arguing that the ban would be unconstitutional .
He said he would set up a fund of one million euros to help woman pay the fines .
If the bill becomes law there is a possibility that Muslim women who currently do not cover their faces , and even some supportive non-Muslims , may begin to wear the niqab as a form of protest .

Image caption A state of emergency will remain in the Thai capital for a further three months
The Thai government has extended a state of emergency in 19 provinces , including the capital Bangkok , because of fears of renewed violence .
The emergency decree was revoked in five other provinces , after a three - month deadline expired .
The law was imposed during mass anti-government protests earlier this year in which 90 people were killed .
Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva told the BBC on Monday that there would be a gradual lifting of emergency law .
Under emergency rule , public gatherings of more than five people are banned and security forces have the right to detain suspects for 30 days without charge .
More than 400 people have been arrested .
There have been calls by human rights organisations to lift what they describe as a " draconian " law , saying it risks driving opposition underground .
The five provinces where emergency rule has been lifted are Si Sa Ket , Kalasin , Nan , Nakhon Sawan and Nakhon Pathom , located in north , north - east and central Thailand .
There are 76 provinces in Thailand .
' Legitimate frustrations '
The BBC's Alastair Leithead in Bangkok said things appear to have largely returned to normal after anti-government protesters took over part of the capital demanding new elections .
But the government said there were still fears of instability as weapons taken from security forces during a riot in April had not been recovered .
ANALYSIS
Bangkok has largely returned to normal after weeks of anti-government protests were ended by the military , but the government has decided to extend the State of Emergency in the capital and 18 other provinces because of fears of further demonstrations and possible violence .
There is still considerable anger in the north - east of the country where the so - called red - shirt movement originates , and weapons abandoned by troops during riots in April have not been recovered .
Those calling for new elections say the emergency decree is stopping them from continuing their demonstrations , and the government 's position has been criticised by human rights groups and academics who argue stifling the voice of opposition could drive it underground and provoke violence .
Stark warnings over laws
" We have been informed there are people who continue to try to spread false information to spur hatred and instigate unrest , " said Ongart Klampaiboon , minister to the prime minister 's office , after the ruling .
The Centre for the Resolution of Emergency Situations ( Cres ) had recommended that emergency rule be extended across all affected provinces .
The Cres is made up of representatives from the armed forces , police and government ministries ; key roles are held by military nominees .
It was set up to manage the government 's response to the so - called red-shirt anti-government protests in April and May .
The demonstrations were broken up by the military after violent clashes which left 90 dead and more than 2,000 injured .
Mr Abhisit has said he is beginning a process of reconciliation .
The International Crisis Group has warned that the " legitimate frustrations " of the anti-government movement were " being forced underground and possibly towards illegal and violent actions " .
The think tank called for the release of all those detained , and for an end to the " sweeping ban " on opposition media outlets .
A member of the " red- shirt " movement , currently in hiding in Thailand , has warned an underground group is already training in bomb - making .
As the flames of anti-Semitism continue to be fanned across much of the Islamic world , there is a risk that today 's youth will grow up believing that Arabs and Jews were simply not meant to coexist , let alone thrive together .
That idea conflicts with history – and is a falsehood today .
My country , Morocco , illustrates the viability and vitality of a Jewish community – my community – in an Arab country .
It 's a model of harmony other Muslim nations should follow .
The Jewish people have been a presence in Africa 's Maghreb region for more than 2,000 years .
North African Jews and Muslims traveled north and thrived together in southern Europe for more than 700 years .
In 1492 , when we refused to convert to Christianity , we were expelled – together – from Spain .
And together we successfully sought refuge in Morocco , which accepted us into its society and institutions .
A history of defending Jews
Morocco 's leaders have always made the well - being of the Jewish people a top priority .
During World War II , when the Vichy government of occupied France announced that it had prepared 200,000 yellow stars for the Jews of Morocco , King Mohammed V replied that he would need 50 more for him and his family .
He refused to make any distinction between his citizens .
The importance of a nation 's leader setting the tone for recognition , respect , and treatment of minority faiths can - not be overstated .
Today , King Mohammed VI has declared his religious , historical , and constitutional obligation to protect the rights , liberties , and sacred values of the Jews in Morocco .
This commitment dramatically affected Morocco 's reaction at moments of great challenge .
After May 16 , 2003 – the Moroccan 9/11 , when five terrorist bombs exploded , three directed at Jewish targets – King Mohammed VI expressed condolences at a Jewish Center , condemning the criminal acts and reaffirming his determination to protect Jews and all Moroccan citizens .
In doing so , he defined the attack as one upon all Moroccan society , awakening the national conscience and strengthening the bonds between us .
Moroccans of all faiths responded with candlelight vigils at bombing sites and demonstrations attended by nearly 1 million participants .
Many Moroccan Jews have emigrated to Israel and elsewhere , but the attachments to our homeland are unique .
" Morocco never loses a Jewish citizen – we gain an ambassador , " Mohammed VI 's predecessor , King Hassan II , once said .
Today , there are 1 million such " ambassadors " all over the world and 600,000 in Israel alone .
We Jews who call Morocco home have a vibrant community that includes 30 functioning synagogues and three school networks , which many influential Muslim families choose for their own children .
Moroccan Jews serve as counselors to the king , ministers , colonels , members of parliament , judges , and ambassadors .
On Jewish holy days , Muslim authorities , out of respect , attend our services .
With help from the Moroccan government , we started a foundation to preserve Jewish historical sites .
And we support research on our community – including 30 doctoral dissertations presently under way by Muslim candidates .
Muting the extremists ' call
Are we an isolated society ?
Hardly : Moroccans young and old have access to as wide an array of media and ideological diversity as anywhere in the Islamic world .
Yes , the extremists ' call is heard here , too , but make no mistake – it's the response that differs .
The tones of tolerance , trumpeted by a government that believes that Moroccan Judaism is an intrinsic and permanent part of the national culture , overwhelm the extremists ' siren song .
Are we a historical accident or the path forward ?
Perhaps the answer is that our historical good fortune now has to be transformed into a model for others .
We are more relevant outside our border than ever before .
Other world leaders must realize that the path forward lies not in fanning the fires of the moment , but in setting a tone of authentic coexistence that will endure .

A group of researchers camped out on a hillside in Wiltshire with an array of high - tech equipment , hoping to record the formation of a crop circle ( presumably by a UFO ) .
On the second night , their equipment recorded flashing orange lights in an adjacent field .
The next morning , the researchers were excited to see that two large circles had formed .
But their hopes were dashed when they found a horoscope chart and wooden crucifix in the middle of one of the circles — evidently the calling card of a hoaxer .
The flashing lights on their equipment , the researchers admitted , had probably been the heat signature of humans running around .

DALLAS --
The end of an era was made complete Wednesday when Dallas Stars center and icon Mike Modano said he was no longer coming back to the only NHL team he 's known for 22 years .
Modano , who thanked the organization , the fans and the city of Dallas , said he 's not sure yet if he will retire , adding that he still has the hunger to keep playing .
He said he wants to take a few weeks before deciding if he wants to continue playing and could decide around the time the free - agency period begins .
" In some ways I expected something of this nature to unfold , " Modano said of the Stars ' decision Tuesday not to bring him back .
" I knew it was coming to be that time , that decision , and that hard choice [ needed ] to be made , obviously from a GM standpoint .
Eventually , you need to go in a direction that 's going to be best for the team and I feel for the future .
So I know there 's a lot of 'he said , she said ' things about the rumors about me playing or not playing , but those decisions will be made in the next couple of weeks when the free - agent market opens up . "
Modano was no longer a front - line player in his last two seasons with the Stars .
He was a fourth - line center who saw time on the power play , a disappointing descent for one of the NHL 's premier American - born hockey players .
Modano was drafted by the Minnesota North Stars in 1988 , made his NHL debut during the 1989 playoffs and has become the all - time leader among U.S. - born players in points and goals , collecting all of them in a Stars uniform .
He moved with the organization to Dallas in 1993 and has been the face of the franchise since .
If he decides to return to the ice , he would spend the remaining years of his career in another city with a reduced role -- much like it was in Dallas -- and that would suit Modano just fine .
" I think my role does n't have a major impact in that decision , " he said .
" I want to have a successful team [ to play for ] and a team that could go deep in the playoffs .
That 's one factor in it to make one last run at it . "
Modano does n't have a particular team he 's interested in but noted that he was familiar with Western Conference franchises .
He 's talked to former teammates over the last few days about what to do and plans on talking with players who have competed in the NHL into their late 30s and early 40s .
" It 's hard to say any particular team , " he said .
" There 's tons that you see that could be real easy to play in some of those situations .
I 'm very familiar with the west , those cites and those personnels .
I 've been there enough the last dozen years or so after the lockout when our schedules were rearranged .
" Just being 22 years around , you know personnel and teams , there 's something I think about that that could be fun to be a part of . "

Since this era of financial austerity began , newspapers and magazines have hurried to publish advice on how to get by on a straitened budget .
So here is one to beat all others .
Today we offer a guide to surviving on under £ 10 a week .
Without a roof over your head !
Without a bed to lie on !
With no support from family or friends !
It 's quite possible , and here 's how .
These helpful tips come from four failed asylum seekers in Birmingham , who remain in this country , preparing to appeal the Home Office decision , sleeping meanwhile in hedges , doorways , old garages and staircases .
Abdi , 34 Somalia
It would be wrong to describe Abdi as poor because this suggests he does n't have enough money to survive on , which would be to put a rather optimistic spin on his situation .
He is n't poor , he just does n't have any money at all , and has n't done for the last six months since his asylum claim was rejected in December .
He is pragmatic and uncomplaining as he explains how he manages to subsist beyond the fringes of society , hand to mouth , on meals of bread and tuna bought with Red Cross food vouchers .
He has noticed , however , that the longer he lives like this , the heavier the toll on his health .
The Red Cross today publishes an uncharacteristically hard - hitting report attacking the " shameful " way the British immigration system treats those whose claims for asylum have been denied , and who have yet to return home .
Once an application is turned down , the asylum seeker loses all eligibility for accommodation and financial support .
Estimates suggest that there are about 200,000 asylum seekers who receive no state support , of whom perhaps 20,000 are surviving on food provided by the Red Cross or other charities .
The organisation compares this emergency aid distribution to the work it does in Sudan , and is calling for the government to adopt a more " humane " approach .
Once you lose your home and financial support , the priority is to find somewhere safe to sleep .
Abdi has three places he sleeps regularly , and he rotates them according to weather conditions .
The first is in a mosque in a suburb of Birmingham , particularly useful when there was heavy snow .
To stay there , you need to go to last prayers , join the worshippers for a while and then slip away and shut yourself in a toilet cubicle .
Shortly afterwards the lights are switched off and the building locked up , and there is a secure place for the night .
Anxious to avoid suspicion , he does n't risk staying there too often .
So he has also been sleeping intermittently on a flattened cardboard box at the top of a concrete stairway to a block of flats nearby .
This place is sheltered from the rain , and it has the added advantage of a light bulb that can be left on or unscrewed when he wants darkness , but the neighbours are not tremendously welcoming , and he tries not to get there until he calculates they will all be asleep .
When they see him , they are generally abusive and threaten to call the police .
Someone has scratched " Your Dead " into the side of his cardboard container , which he has left leaning against the wall .
" They 're just joking with me , " he says amiably .
The third place is in a narrow alleyway between park railings and a row of back yards , a few streets away .
He has hidden his sleeping bag ( marked " Do n't take it .
Please .
Homeless " ) underneath a heap of discarded building materials , wooden planks with protruding nails , and broken mirrored glass .
The adjoining section of park is a place where teenagers hang out to take drugs in the evening , so most people prefer to avoid the area , which means he is mostly left undisturbed .
For food he goes to the Red Cross every Tuesday , where he queues up for £ 10 worth of Morrison 's vouchers , usually alongside up to 100 other failed asylum seekers .
Volunteers here used to distribute emergency handouts of £ 15 , but funding shortages forced them to reduce this to £ 10 .
The recipients did not protest , says Joseph Nibizi , manager at the destitution clinic ; they are desperately grateful for whatever help they can get .
' People say " Go home " or " Get a job " .
I ca n't do either '
Although Birmingham has a large number of destitute asylum seekers they are not very visible .
They do not sit at train stations or by cashpoints ; instead they linger in the shadows , afraid of attracting attention from officials .
Abdi cultivates invisibility .
He spends his day pacing from one spot to another , afraid to loiter too long , worried that people will think he is a criminal .
He does n't approve of begging .
He is prohibited from working , and does not want to try working illegally – washing cars at the traffic lights – for fear of jeopardising the fresh claim for asylum he is preparing .
Existing without any money naturally causes logistical problems .
Tomorrow he has to travel to Solihull on the outskirts of Birmingham for his monthly registration with the Home Office , and the bus fare will cost £ 3.50 .
He visits Morrison 's to see if he can get change from his vouchers , but he knows from previous visits that the cashiers are not very well disposed to asylum seekers , and will only give change if at least half the value of the voucher is spent .
It seems a trifling point , but since the change from the Morrison 's voucher represents the only coins that pass through his hands during the week , it is of critical importance .
As he walks through the 14 aisles of the vast supermarket , he waves towards the shelves full of food and says : " I pass everything by because of my budget . "
He buys some discounted sliced bread , four tins of tuna chunks , four small tins of baked beans , and a litre of milk .
He does n't own a tin opener , but a nearby cafe owner usually agrees to lend him one , and he eats whatever he buys cold .
( At the till there seems to be some inconsistency about the policy on giving change from tokens .
A cashier is happy to give me £ 4.50 change when I give her one of the £ 5 tokens to buy the 50 p loaf of bread .
A manager I check with smiles and says I can spend as much or as little of the £ 5 gift token as I like .
When Abdi asks another cashier , he is told he must spend at least £ 2.50 . )
Abdi pours out stories from his existence on the streets ; they are not very cheerful , but he tells them with a sense of humour , outlining the absurdity of his situation .
He has a story about a young woman who befriended him on a bench ; after several days of sympathetic visits from her , it transpired that she was merely attempting to recruit him to deal drugs in the park .
He has another story , told equally cheerfully , about a family who set their dogs loose on him in the alleyway where he was sleeping .
It is a bleak existence , but he is not inclined to return to Somalia .
He wo n't say much about what prompted him to flee through Africa and then Europe hidden in cars and lorries , commenting only : " If you understand that it is a choice between living here in this way and going back to be slaughtered , then you understand that there is no choice . "
His original asylum claim was refused by a judge who described it as " not credible " .
Campaigners point out that the asylum system is not wholly reliable , characterised by a " culture of disbelief " , the onus being on asylum seekers to prove that they are not lying .
Last year , 28 % of people who appealed against refused asylum cases were granted leave to remain , a figure that campaigners say reflects serious flaws in the initial decision - making process .
Besides , whether or not someone 's claim is legitimate is not relevant to the question of whether they should be forced to live on the streets , campaigners argue .
The Red Cross is responding to the humanitarian needs of people who have nothing and nowhere to live , and staff members do not attempt to judge whether their clients ' claims are solid or not .
" We are a humanitarian organisation , and we believe that people run away from persecution .
It is for the government to decide whether they have good cases or bad cases , " Nibizi says .
Abdi has a meeting with a Home Office official later this month to go through his appeal submission .
It is increasingly hard to find a solicitor , especially if you have no money .
The UK's leading asylum charity , Refugee and Migrant Justice , announced yesterday that it was going into administration because of funding shortages , due to government delays in the payment of legal aid .
If he submits an appeal , and it is accepted by the Home Office as potentially viable , then he will be eligible for hardship support payments and housing , but it is difficult to secure that status .
Until then , he exists in limbo .
It is a confusing situation to understand .
Abdi is not here illegally , since he is going through all the correct legal hoops , registering his presence with the Home Office every month , and until he gets served a removal notice he is not breaking the law by staying .
He is at pains to do everything correctly , abiding by the stipulation not to work , determined not to break the law , even if that means surviving in a gutter on ad hoc charity handouts .
" Criminals in your prisons still get their basic needs .
What about people who come here searching for safety ? " he asks .
" If they deny these things , do they want us to die ?
Or do they want us to break the law ?
When people see me sleeping in the stairway , they say ' Go home ' or ' Get a job ' .
I can't do either . "
Abdi is careful not to express any hostility towards the government for its policy , but Nibizi is angry .
" You can remove people back to their home country , or you can keep them here .
But you have to give people food .
It is inhumane not to give people food .
You can not starve people out of the country , " he says .
" Nowhere else is providing the kind of support [ the Red Cross does ] .
Ten pounds is not enough to live on , but it can sustain them until someone else can help them .
Our service is meant to be an emergency response , but the government is not dealing with them .
We can't leave them to die outside . "
Haile , 32 Ethiopia
These attitudes towards asylum seekers are on display among a group of 40 or so homeless people sheltering from the rain on the ground floor of a multi-storey car park in the city centre , waiting for soup and sandwiches to be distributed by volunteers from a Baptist church .
One tall , white man in his 40s is expressing loud anger about the decline of the country .
A few years ago , he remarks , there would have been no foreigners queueing up at these soup kitchens .
" It was just the English , " he laments , adding that the outsiders should be sent home .
" If they try to come back , their passports should be taken away and they should be sent to prison . "
Haile , who has been living homeless in central Birmingham for five years , since being released from an immigration detention centre , does not respond .
" He 's always like that .
He says , ' English first for food . '
I do n't pay any attention to him .
He drinks , " Haile says .
On the whole , he avoids telling people about his background .
" If they knew I was an asylum seeker , " he says , gesturing to the group , made up mainly of local drug addicts , alcoholics and the mentally ill , " and that I do n't have papers to be in this country , I think I would be dead now .
I do n't make friendships with anyone ; I do n't know who is good or bad . "
He lives alone , in conditions similar to those we see in news reports highlighting the plight of survivors whose lives have been torn up by faraway natural disasters before the major aid agencies have arrived – no electricity , no shelter from the elements , no sanitation , no water , no food , no mattress etc .
For over a year now , he has been living in a fenced - off doorway , at the back of an expensive hotel in the city centre , by the entrance to a now defunct car park .
Local authorities have tried to block the way in , erecting a sheet of chipboard marked " Trespassers will be prosecuted " over the gap he used to squeeze through .
Now he has to climb a 10ft metal fence with flattened prongs at the top , and slide down on the other side , where there is a space in the old doorway , covered from the rain .
It has been raining a lot , so it is difficult to get over the fence which ( since he is a little short ) is over twice his height .
He puts his trainers on two black - painted railings , legs apart , and tries pull himself up .
There is a slipping noise of wet rubber from his shoes and he fails to get over .
He slips down the railings and tries again .
It is painful to watch .
" This is my sleeping bag , my table , bed , blanket , " he says through the fence , once he has made it to the other side .
" My toilet , " he says , pointing to a dank corner .
" My clothes , " he adds , nodding towards a heap of crumpled clothes and shoes .
Piles of rubbish have been thrown through the railings by passersby - McDonald 's yellow polystyrene containers , Sprite and Quavers packets , KFC and Red Bull , cigarette packets .
Haile says he has rat problems and fox problems , but is upbeat about the place he has found .
The difficulty of getting in gives him a sense of security once he is inside .
" Sometimes I look and think it 's like a prison , it 's like a cage .
But no one can throw stones at me here , " he says .
" This is my mansion .
I 'm a rich man .
I own this hotel .
If you want a room , I 'll rent it to you cheap , cheap . "
The strain of living in these conditions has taken a toll and Haile is clearly struggling to cope with life .
Immigration letters in brown envelopes ( delivered to the Red Cross and passed on to him ) lie strewn in between the clothes .
Taken by his parents from Ethiopia to Tanzania as a baby , he came here as a stowaway on a boat in 2000 .
Several asylum applications have been refused , and he is under instructions to return to Tanzania .
But he is not clear whether he would be accepted there , since it is not his original home .
He has no capacity to get himself there , and one attempt to deport him forcibly was cancelled at the last moment several years ago , since when he has been left to forage for survival in central Birmingham .
" My life is wasted .
My parents died .
I do n't have parents .
I do n't have a country .
I do n't feel like a human any more , " he says .
A large proportion of failed asylum seekers have some kind of mental health problem , charities say , the result of the stress through which they are living .
Haile probably needs some kind of medical help , but in his limbo status it is hard to access .
" They live on paracetamol , " Nibizi says .
Last year , Haile broke an index finger but , alarmed by the questions he was asked when he went to casualty , left the hospital without getting it treated ; the bone has mended but the finger no longer bends , and juts out at an awkward angle .

Sleeping on the streets , as Mimi puts it , is " not easy for ladies " , so she has been sleeping on the floor of three Ethiopian families , two days here , two days there , for the last two months , since her asylum claim was refused .
The families help her because they know she would otherwise be on the streets , but she can see she is a burden they cannot afford .
Each morning she wakes up , dresses and gets ready to leave the house before she gets in the way , pausing at the doorway to see whether they will invite her to sleep another night .
" It 's not easy living like this .
It makes you go mad .
It makes you want to kill yourself , " she says .
She uses the £ 10 vouchers from the Red Cross to help contribute to the food supplies of the families that she visits ; she has lost her own appetite , she says .
There are no night shelters that failed asylum seekers can go to in Birmingham ( the Salvation Army hostel is not allowed to accept them ) , but the Red Cross has told her about a place in Coventry , 20 miles away , which offers emergency shelter to destitute migrants .
She calls but there are only men staying at the centre , and the woman who runs the centre suggests it might be not be ideal for her .
Mimi will continue sleeping on sofas .
The majority of destitute asylum seekers live in similar conditions , sharing rooms with other asylum seekers who are still receiving state support – housing and a basic weekly allowance – as their first asylum claim goes through .
Because there are no accurate sources of data , it is impossible to know how many people are sleeping rough and how many on sofas .
" It is a hidden problem , " says Penny Walker , who runs the night shelter in Coventry as part of a housing co-operative .
" As a rule , they do n't beg , they do n't commit crime .
These people try to remain invisible all day .
They do n't want to be loitering ; they do n't want anyone to see them and wonder whether they are about to rob them .
There is this huge emptiness , huge uncertainty . "
She regrets not being able to offer Mimi a space to sleep , but the living space at the housing co-operative she runs with fellow environmental and peace activists is already full .
Between 14 and 16 destitute migrants arrive each night at 9 pm , receive a hot meal and sleep together in one room , on camp beds lined up , side - by - side , about a foot between each bed .
The atmosphere tonight is cheerful , but it is n't always .
A few years ago , a failed asylum seeker gave up and hanged himself from a tree in the garden .
" They come here exhausted once they have run out of friends on whose floors they can sleep .
Often they 've been sleeping in friends ' cars .
They would n't come here unless they were desperate , " says Walker .
" People think we should give asylum only to those who have a genuine need , not to those who have a so - called bogus claim , " she says .
" But what people do n't understand is that the system is not fair .
People do n't flee their country unless they have a very good reason for doing so , and it is difficult to prove what happened to you unless you have scars from torture up your arms .
The fact that you failed in your asylum claim does not mean that you are not a genuine asylum seeker . "
Walker argues that their determination to remain in these conditions is a reflection of the seriousness of their difficulties at home .
" Who would choose this sort of life ? " she asks .
" Nobody . "
Muhammad , 27 Somalia
Muhammad is unsmiling and guarded , very troubled by the 18 months he has been sleeping in Birmingham 's parks .
He came here in 2008 , helped by an uncle who bought him a plane ticket to Heathrow , where he was immediately arrested .
He claimed asylum , giving details of the murder of both his parents in 2006 , shot dead by al - Shabab militants as they were minding their vegetable stall in the village market .
The gunmen were raiding the stalls ; when his parents tried to protect their stock of bananas and tomatoes , they were killed .
His claim for asylum was refused 18 months ago .
Shortly afterwards , he had to hand over the keys to the hostel where he was staying ; that was the last time he had a shower or slept in a bed .
He hopes to appeal against the decision but has not yet managed to put together a new case .
Everything he owns he carries in his backpack – one shirt , one sheet , one T - shirt , one pair of shorts , two heavy files of documents relating to his case , letters , photographs .
He sleeps with his head on the bag to be sure it is never stolen .
He does n't have a sleeping bag , so he relies instead on old cardboard boxes as protection against the wind .
He speaks almost no English , but explains through the translator that he has learned to understand " Move " and " Back home " from the refuse collectors who sometimes find him still asleep by the hedge or at the edge of the outdoors baseball court , where he usually spends the night .
Sometimes some west Africans sleep there too , but he can't speak to them , because they have no common language .
He admits he has become very lonely .
Another Somalian whom he met occasionally at the Red Cross recently disappeared , leaving his cardboard boxes behind .
Muhammad wonders if he was taken to a detention centre but is not sure .
With his Morrison 's vouchers he has bought a pot of Nutella ( £ 1.21 ) , a long baguette ( 60 p ) and a bottle of Highland Spring water ( 78 p ) , because he has no access to a tap .
He will cut the baguette into small sections and that way it should last for three days , when he will return and spend the second £ 5 voucher .
" My ambition is to live in peace .
My ambition is to get peace .
I would like to work and contribute to the community where I live , which I can not do now .
There is no peace in Somalia . "
He is not optimistic that an appeal to the Home Office would succeed .
" The last letter they sent me , they said I should go back to Somalia .
I will be killed in Somalia . "
All names have been changed .
• This article was amended on 16 June 2010 .
The word straitened was mis-spelt in the original .
This has now been corrected .
For nearly a century , a formidable presence has cast its shadow over horror publishing .
As protean as it is pervasive , it has insinuated itself into virtually all aspects of the genre 's publishing platform : trade publishing , specialty press , comics and graphic novels , role - playing game scenarios , movie novelizations , audiobooks , Web zines , and now e-books .
It 's the spirit — or , if you will , the shade — of H.P. Lovecraft , and every decade it looms larger and darker .
Once the private worship of a small but dedicated congregation of devotees , Lovecraft has hit the big time in the first decade of the new millennium .
In 1997 , Ecco Press brought out Tales of H.P. Lovecraft , a selection of Lovecraft 's tales of horror chosen and introduced by literary legend Joyce Carol Oates .
It was followed , between 1999 and 2004 , by three collections — The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories , The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories , and The Dreams in the Witch House and Other Weird Stories — all assembled by leading Lovecraft scholar S.T. Joshi for the prestigious Penguin Classics imprint .
In 2008 , Barnes & Noble brought out as part of its Library of Essential Writers series , H.P. Lovecraft : The Fiction , the first single - volume collection to feature all of Lovecraft 's fiction .
Any doubt these books may have left that Lovecraft , who was once demonized as a pulp writer of passing fancy , is anything less than a leading figure in American letters , was dispelled in 2005 when McSweeney 's brought out H.P. Lovecraft : Against the World , Against Life , a study of the philosophy underlying Lovecraft 's fiction by renowned French cultural critic Michel Houellebecq , with an introduction by Stephen King .
An even greater laurel , to some , is the Library of America 's publication in 2005 of H.P. Lovecraft : Tales , a selection of Lovecraft 's best fiction assembled by best - selling horror writer Peter Straub that now shares shelf space with books by other LoA icons , among them Henry James , Edith Wharton , John Cheever , William Faulkner , and F.

To many , the LoA volume of Lovecraft officially signaled his induction into the American literary canon , although LoA editor - in - chief Geoffrey O'Brien notes that Lovecraft 's literary credentials already were well established .
" Lovecraft was a genuine original , with a rigorous sense of narrative form at the service of a coherent vision of the universe — a vision that happens to embody the most extreme paranoia and unblinking pessimism .
He will , I think , figure as unavoidable mythologist of the 20th century . "
Lovecraft 's fiction is now enjoying the same broad dissemination through trade publishing houses and their classics imprints that was once reserved , as American horror fiction goes , for Lovecraft 's main inspiration , Edgar Allan Poe .
To the minds of many , that 's as it should be .
" I think Lovecraft has a permanent place in American writing , " says Peter Straub .
" He stands next to Poe as the high - water mark in 19th - and 20th - century American gothic .
His influence on other writers , which was immediate , has proved to be unending and fruitful . "
In some ways , though , Lovecraft 's reach is more encompassing than Poe's .
The Cthulhu Mythos , a myth cycle distilled from his fiction that is to the Lovecraft universe what Middle - earth is to Tolkien 's fiction , has been a fertile and fecund subgenre of horror fiction since before Lovecraft 's death in 1937 , and hundreds of writers over the decades have contributed tales written in Lovecraft 's style , infused with its philosophy of cosmic pessimism , or full of references to the entities , books of occult lore , and unhallowed smalltowns that are its signifiers — among them Straub , Stephen King , Ramsey Campbell , Poppy Z. Brite , Neil Gaiman , Caitlín Kiernan , and Brian Lumley .
Last year , Dark Horse brought out Lovecraft Unbound , an anthology of original stories , edited by Ellen Datlow , penned by leading writers of fantasy and science fiction , all of which evoke the spirit , if not the specifics , of Lovecraft 's writings , and capture what Datlow refers to as " the deep dread and fear of the unknown " that distinguishes Lovecraft 's tales of horror for her .
And P.S. Publishing , the U.K.'s premier specialty press for fantasy , horror , and science fiction , has just released Black Wings : New Tales of Lovecraftian Horror , another compilation of original stories in the Lovecraftian vein , edited by Joshi .
These books form the tip of an iceberg made from scores of similar anthology excursions into Lovecraft - land that began building back in 1969 when Arkham House , once the exclusive publisher of all things Lovecraftian , released Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos , a compilation of horror stories by Lovecraft 's pulp colleagues put together by Lovecraft 's disciple August Derleth .
A revised version of this volume is still in print , in paperback , under the Del Rey imprint .
Lovecraft 's presence is proliferating not only in the field of fiction but in graphic arts publications as well .
Last year , Centipede Press 's oversized art tribute , Artists Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft , earned a nomination for the World Fantasy Award .
The book is an exhaustive exploration of artistic interpretations of Lovecraft 's fiction , from the earliest renderings that accompanied Lovecraft 's stories in the pulp magazines of the 1920s and ' 30s , through the postwar comics and paperback explosion and up to contemporary times , with reproductions of work by Lovecraft - inspired luminaries including Frank Frazetta , Bernie Wrightson , Mike Mignola ( of Hellboy fame ) , H.R. Giger , and Gahan Wilson , among others .
Several artists sampled in that volume have produced portfolios devoted exclusively to Lovecraft 's work , among them John Coulthart 's The Haunter of the Dark and Other Grotesque Visions ( Creation Oneiros ; with an introduction by Alan Moore ) and Richard Corben 's Haunt of Horror : Lovecraft Premiere ( Marvel Comics ) .
In 2007 , Lovecraft merited his own volume of multiartist interpretations of his fiction in Eureka Publications ' Graphic Classics series .
This month , The Fall of Cthulhu : Nemesis , the sixth volume in a graphic novel series from Boom !
Studios that extrapolates Lovecraftian themes into an apocalyptic horror saga , hits stores .
Lovecraft has been referenced in Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez 's Locke and Key comic book series , and is a fixture in numerous independent comic book series both in America and abroad .
His presence in graphic media , and in Chaosium 's Call of Cthulhu , a bestselling fantasy role - playing game now almost three decades old , ensures that Lovecraft will find a foothold with a younger generation raised on graphic novels , manga , computer games , YouTube clips , and Twitter feeds , and who may discover Lovecraft through extraliterary media before they even know he wrote fiction .
Cthulhu Calling
Lovecraft 's name is so ubiquitous in publishing these days that almost no one thinks it necessary , as it once was , to give his backstory — an attitude that might leave those still not familiar with him or his achievements in the dark .
So , who exactly is H.P. Lovecraft ?
To some , he was a writer who lived a life that would have made him the perfect character in an H.P. Lovecraft story — and , not surprisingly , there is a well - established subgenre of fantastic fiction in which Lovecraft figures as a character , ranging from PW Reviews editor Peter Cannon 's The Lovecraft Chronicles ( Mythos Books , 2004 ) , which speculates about the books Lovecraft might have written and the literary associations he would have forged had he not died prematurely in 1937 , to David Barbour and Richard Raleigh 's Shadows Bend ( Ace , 2000 ) , one of many novels that situate Lovecraft in a world where the supernatural horrors he imagined are real .
Born in 1890 in Providence , R.I. , the city where he spent most of his life , Lovecraft made the most of a sickly childhood by reading omnivorously and largely educating himself in such areas as astronomy , history , science , and the classics .
At an early age he discovered Poe 's fiction and cultivated a taste for tales of the macabre .
He began writing fiction in his adolescence and placed some of his earliest work with amateur publications .
Lovecraft 's early years coincide with the explosion of the pulp fiction magazine market , which provided inexpensive escapist reading for mass consumption in the first half of the 20th century .
By the 1920s and '30s , there were genre - specific pulps to suit just about every taste , and , given his passion , Lovecraft gravitated toward Weird Tales , the long - lived magazine that shaped the modern American horror tale .
Lovecraft cracked Weird Tales with his first professional sale in 1923 , and though he would sell to other pulp markets , it became the magazine with which he and his work were most closely associated .
From the start , Lovecraft 's stories were noticeably devoid of vampires , werewolves , ghosts , and other traditional supernatural monsters appearing in the work of his pulp contemporaries .
Though written in a somewhat mannered gothic style and prose empurpled with words like " eldritch " and " squamous , " his atmospheric tales strove to express a horror rooted in humanity 's limited understanding of the universe and humankind 's arrogant overconfidence in its significance in the cosmic scheme .
In 1928 , Weird Tales published " The Call of Cthulhu , " his tale of an extradimensional monster whose unpronounceable name suggested its incomprehensible alienness , and whose devastating emergence in our world overwhelms the humans who encounter it with an awareness of humanity 's puniness and powerlessness against such threats .
The story is recognized today as the work that most clearly articulated Lovecraft 's concept of " cosmic horror , " and it is this aspect of his writing , says Pete Crowther , the publisher of PS Publishing , that is Lovecraft 's unique contribution to horror .
" There are few writers who embrace such scope and such size to their ‘ monsters ' or their monsters ' domain .
It 's the sheer size of the horrors that separates Lovecraft from everyone else . "
Lovecraft 's original approach to horror proved infectious , with many of the best and brightest of his pulp colleagues , among them Robert E. Howard ( creator of Conan the Barbarian ) , Clark Ashton Smith , and younger admirers including Robert Bloch ( later the author of Psycho ) , Henry Kuttner , and Fritz Leiber .
With Lovecraft 's encouragement they began referencing in their own fiction some of the superficial signifiers in Lovecraft 's work — imaginary New England backwaters like Arkham , Dunwich , and Innsmouth ; Cthulhu-ish monsters with names like Yog - Sothtoth , Azathoth , and Shub Niggurath ; and rare books of occult lore , of which the dreaded Necronomicon by the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred ranked supreme .
They also created their own to add to the mythic melting pot .
What began as an in - joke to suggest a common and pervasive mythology verified by references in the work of many different writers became the basis for what was named years after Lovecraft 's death the Cthulhu Mythos , arguably the first " shared world " in fantastic fiction .
In addition to redrawing the map of modern horror through his fiction , Lovecraft authored the landmark essay " Supernatural Horror in Literature , " considered to be one of the first comprehensive treatises on horror fiction , and wrote an estimated 100,000 letters , many of which touch on his ideas concerning horror fiction .
( To date , only a few thousand of the 20,000 letters of his thought to be extant have been collected . )
Lovecraft 's Legacy
Lovecraft died of cancer and its complications in 1937 .
The publishing phenomenon that was to evolve from his legacy began two years later , when Lovecraft protégés August Derleth and Donald Wandrei founded Arkham House , a specialty press created initially to rescue his work from oblivion in the pulps when trade publishers turned up their noses at it .
Arkham House 's initial self - limited agenda to bring out Lovecraft 's fiction and several volumes of his letters eventually expanded to a more ambitious program to publish the work of other important fantasists , including first books by Ray Bradbury , Fritz Leiber , Ramsey Campbell , and Brian Lumley .
Between 1963 and 1965 Arkham House published three standardized volumes — The Dunwich Horror and Others , At the Mountains of Madness and Other Novels , and Dagon and Other Macabre Tales — that reprinted Lovecraft 's complete fantastic fiction .
The books have never been out of print since , and have provided texts for virtually all other editions of Lovecraft 's stories since , notably Del Rey 's trade paperback The Best of H.P. Lovecraft : Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre , which has gone through more than 30 printings since 1982 .
Seventy - one years later , Arkham House is still publishing , and " The House that Lovecraft Built , " as it might be called , is both the longest - lived specialty fantasy press and the publisher that paved the way for Night Shade Books , Subterranean Press , Cemetery Dance Publications , and other leading specialty presses of today — all of which , it should be noted , have produced Lovecraft - inspired titles .
Taking the lead from Necronomicon Press , which launched in 1976 to bring rare Lovecraftiana and critical writing on Lovecraft into print , some presses have devoted themselves almost exclusively to Lovecraft - themed publications , key among them Hippocampus Press .
In addition to publishing five volumes of Lovecraft 's complete collected essays , several volumes of Lovecraft 's collected letters , and numerous titles on Lovecraft and his circle , this August Hippocampus will be publishing I Am Providence , S.T. Joshi's exhaustive and definitive two - volume biography of Lovecraft .
It is hard to estimate the impact Lovecraft and Lovecraft - related publications have had on horror publishing , but it should be pointed out that the modern horror boom was ignited in the 1970s and ' 80s in the pages of specialty press magazines such as Weirdbook , Whispers , and Nyctalops , all of which initially tapped the ferment of interest in Lovecraftian horror then percolating through horror 's fan base .
The sprawling Cthulhu Mythos that has evolved out of Lovecraft 's fiction each year attracts new contributors , many happy to till ground first broken by Lovecraft until they develop into professionals who write confidently in styles all their own .
And as the abundance of new books of Lovecraft - themed materials each year indicates , Lovecraft is an inexhaustible reservoir who has yet to run dry nearly three - quarters of a century since his death .
Ultimately , the originality of Lovecraft 's contribution to horror is what ensures enduring interest in his work .
Says current Arkham House editor Robert Weinberg , " Lovecraft was the first and the best writer to tap into people 's fear of the unknown .
Stories like ‘ The Colour Out of Space , ' ‘ At the Mountains of Madness , ' and ‘ The Call of Cthulhu ' are still chilling , and I suspect they will remain so even a hundred years after publication .
If Hammett and Chandler took the mystery story out of the English drawing room and back to the street , then Lovecraft took horror out of the English drawing room and put it into outer space and prehistory .
No one has matched that achievement in horror since , and to be honest I doubt that they ever will . "
Stefan Dziemianowicz has edited more than 30 anthologies of horror , fantasy , and science fiction ; he reviews regularly for Locus and Publishers Weekly .
It would be easy to say my bf is a " typical male " and I 'm a " typical female " in the long tradition of women doing more housework .
We 've lived together for the last year and he has literally not once , cleaned anything voluntarily ( his , mine or ours ) .
But for us , it 's not a sexist issue , just an incompatibility of cleanliness thresholds .
We used to get into fights about it , but the truth I 've just come to face that he is a slob .
And his mother agrees .
( I remember in his old apt he had maggots under his bed from an old plate of food - which I told him he should move , to which he responded , " later " , then promptly forgot until the consequential and unavoidable smell alerted us to its presence . )
We do n't fight a whole lot but when we do it is often about cleaning .
Our routine goes something like this : I vacuum , do laundry and clean / organize ( his , mine and our stuff ) once a week on the weekend , make the bed / tidy up everyday , and he promptly throws a pair of dirty socks on the floor .
I pick up his dirty dishes / glasses with curdling milk that sit on his desk .
I organize his important papers and financial paperwork .
Yes , I baby him .
But what 's the alternative ?
Yes I get resentful sometimes though I 've just given up at this point .
The thing is , he truly does not mind living like a slob .
Days old milk , crusty plates , unopened mail and dirty sheets literally do not register .
What I 've come to realize is that yes , in an ideal world he should pull his weight , and at the very least pick up after himself .
BUT .
We share a room .
The only person NOT cleaning hurts , is me .
He does n't care .
If the room is neat and tidy , yes he 's happy but it 's not expected .
And there 's the rub .
He never , ever expects me to clean up after him .
And he 's very appreciative .
I just do it because I can't stand to live like a slob .
I hate clutter .
And I love him .
If I do n't open his mail or sort his papers , come tax time , he 's frantically sorting through his papers stressing both of us out , asking me me if I 've seen form this or that .
So for my sanity and peace of mind , I do it .
And being a total type - A personality , I actually enjoy organizing so the actual deed is really not that torturous .
But I 'm making him pay for the maid in the future .
I do n't think it really matters what gender you are ; many many couples face the " how to split household chores " evenly dilemma .
And I wish there was more practical advice out there on how to solve this issue ; it 's a huge bone of contention if you can't co-exist peacefully because someone left the dishes in the sink .
For complete coverage of Afghanistan , go to the Afghanistan Crossroads blog .
Washington ( CNN ) -- Gen. David Petraeus told CNN on Thursday that he supports President Barack Obama 's July 2011 deadline to start withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan , a key point of contention between the president and many of his Republican critics in Congress .
Petraeus -- tapped to replace Gen. Stanley McChrystal as the U.S. commander in Afghanistan -- expressed his respect and appreciation for McChrystal 's work and said the circumstances surrounding the change in command are " sad . "
Obama relieved McChrystal of his duties Wednesday after the general and his staff were quoted in a Rolling Stone magazine article making comments that appear to mock top administration officials .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen endorsed Obama 's decision during a Pentagon news conference Thursday .
Mullen said he was nearly physically " sick " when he read the Rolling Stone story .
The comments in the article constituted an unacceptable challenge to civilian authority , the men said .
" We do not have the right , nor should we ever assume the prerogative to cast doubt upon the ability or mock the motives of our civilian leaders , elected or appointed , " Mullen said .
" We are and must remain a neutral instrument of the state . "
Petraeus ' remarks to CNN's Dana Bash and Ted Barrett were his first public comments since being chosen as the new U.S. military chief for the Afghan conflict .
The Senate Armed Services Committee is set to begin his confirmation hearings Tuesday morning .
" I support the president 's policy , and I will also provide the best professional military advice as we conduct assessments , " Petraeus said .
The general said it 's a privilege to serve .
" It 's obviously a hugely important mission , " he said .
" It 's very sad that I have to assume it in this manner , " he said .
We " all have enormous respect and gratitude to Gen. McChrystal for all that he did .
He 's played a key role in helping get the inputs right in Afghanistan . "
Petraeus declined to immediately say whether he would fire the unnamed officers on McChrystal 's staff who are quoted in Rolling Stone making disparaging remarks .
" You have to understand an officer -- a commander -- cannot prejudge a situation because that crosses the line into what is called ' command influence , ' " he said .
" So we 'll need to sort out the facts and take the appropriate action once we 've done that . "
Mullen emphasized that Petraeus will have the authority to make changes to McChrystal 's battle plans and tactics .
Obama also reinforced the notion of both tactical and strategic flexibility at the top levels of U.S. command , stressing Thursday that the July 2011 date is only for the start of the process under which U.S. forces will be removed from Afghanistan .
The decision to replace McChrystal with Petraeus was hotly debated by top administration officials .
While Gates and Mullen both publicly defended Obama 's decision to remove McChrystal , Gates initially backed keeping McChrystal on the job because top Pentagon brass considered the general vital to the Afghan war effort , a senior Pentagon official told CNN's Barbara Starr .
But in a 35 - minute meeting in the Oval Office on Tuesday , Obama said he wanted to replace McChrystal with Petraeus , Gates said .
" It was the president 's idea , " Gates told reporters Thursday .
" It was the president who first raised Petraeus ' name . "
The appointment of Petraeus is the " best possible outcome to an awful situation , " Gates said .
Military officers both in Washington and on the ground in Afghanistan have continually stressed Obama 's assertion that the switch in leadership does not represent a change in policy .
" Nothing changes about our strategy , " said Mullen , who is departing for Afghanistan and Pakistan on Thursday night .
" We remain absolutely focused on our tasks and the operational tempo will not miss a beat , " Lt. Gen. Sir Nick Parker said Thursday .
Parker , who is British , has assumed command pending Petraeus ' confirmation by the U.S. Senate .
Petraeus , who also led the U.S. military surge in Iraq , expressed gratitude toward his wife Thursday , saying he had asked about her feelings on his new assignment
" She 's a great wife , army daughter and army mother , " he said .
CNN 's Ted Barrett , Dana Bash , Barbara Starr and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .

Jobs Bill Bombs
In Senate , 45 - 52 : Deficit concerns trumped jobless aid in the Senate Wednesday as a key vote on a bill to reauthorize several expired programs , including extended unemployment benefits , failed 45 - 52 , with 12 Democrats voting against it .
" I 've said all along that we have to be able to pay for what we 're spending , " said Sen .
Ben Nelson , a Nebraska Democrat who voted against the bill .
" $ 77 billion or more of this is not paid for and that translates into deficit spending and adding to the debt , and the American people are right :
We 've got to stop doing that . "
Ms. Gomez added , “ I think if he had proper direction , he would n’t have done what he did . ”
Mr. Harris - Moore had a volatile childhood and was often in conflict with his mother , Pam Kohler .
His father appears to have been absent .
According to public documents , child protection officials had been referred to the family at least a dozen times by the time Mr. Harris - Moore was 15 .
Image Colton Harris - Moore in elementary school .
He dropped out after the ninth grade .
A social worker ’s report from the time he was first arrested , at 12 , drew a succinct conclusion , at least from the boy ’s point of view .
“ Colton wants Mom to stop drinking and smoking , get a job and have food in the house , ” the report said .
“ Mom refuses . ”
When Mr. Harris - Moore was 4 , someone reported Ms. Kohler after seeing “ a woman grab a small child by the hair and beat his head severely , ” according to a psychiatric summary 12 years later .
By the time he was 10 , an investigation involving “ negligent treatment or maltreatment ” had been initiated .
Ms. Kohler does not appear to have been prosecuted for a crime related to the complaints .
Ms. Kohler , 59 , declined to be interviewed .
A lawyer she has hired to handle news media inquiries and film and book proposals based on her son ’s story said he had not seen allegations of abuse against Ms. Kohler in public records .
Several neighbors on Haven Place , the gravel road on the southern end of Camano Island where Mr. Harris - Moore grew up and his mother still lives , recalled often hearing mother and son screaming at each other into the night .
All spoke on condition of anonymity because they said they feared Ms. Kohler .
A hand - painted sign at the end of her wooded driveway warns : “ If you go past this sign you will be shot . ”
Asked whether it was an empty threat , one neighbor said , “ She shoots . ”
The neighbor recalled a land surveyor telling how he had heard gunshots fired in his direction when he was surveying the property next door .
WASHINGTON ( JTA ) —
A new Iran sanctions bill in the U.S. Congress allows the president to waive penalties on countries cooperating with U.N. sanctions but denies the blanket exemption sought by the White House .
Rep. Howard Berman ( D - Calif. ) , chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee and co-chairman of the House - Senate conference committee that framed the new legislation posed to pass Congress in the next few days , said the White House had sought leeway to wholly exempt countries from the sanctions .
" They sought an exemption for any entity in any country that could be deemed cooperative , " Berman said Wednesday in a conference call with Jewish media .
Instead , the president may waive sanctions on companies for 12 months on a case - by - case basis as long as he certifies to Congress that the country where the company is based is cooperating with U.S. - led multilateral efforts to isolate Iran .
It ’s not clear if the waiver will satisfy the White House , which had sought an exemption to reward countries , such as China and Russia , that had facilitated the passage earlier this month of U.N. sanctions .
White House spokesmen referred only to earlier statements that suggested the Obama administration still hoped to tweak the bill .
The congressional sanctions , which Berman said he hopes to pass in the next week and then send to President Obama for his signature , are much tougher than the sanctions adopted by the United Nations .
The U.N. measures are confined to specified targets such as the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps , which is believed to control Iran ’s suspected nuclear weapons program .
The congressional proposal expands existing U.S. sanctions to include entities that trade with Iran ’s energy sector ; U.S. sanctions passed in 1996 targeted investment only .
The new sanctions also hit Iran ’s banking sector , codifying into law sanctions that a number of presidents already had implemented through executive order .
Additionally , the new sanctions would require the president to investigate and report to Congress any entity suspected of such activity ; the earlier bill only recommended such investigations .
The new bill also includes sanctions targeting Iranian violators of human rights .
24/7 Wall St. CEOs
Who Need to be Fired : Nine for 2010
Public companies dismiss CEOs all the time .
The firings can be due to incompetence , malfeasance , or tensions with boards of directors or founders .
24/7 Wall St. has chosen nine sitting CEOs who should be let go by their boards .
All the CEOs are on this list for simple reasons .
The first is that many have presided over ethical or legal lapses .
This is certainly an issue at Goldman Sachs , Dell , and Moody’s .
It is easy for observers to say that the chief executive of a large firm cannot be responsible for every action of every employee .
But when the trouble is repeated and widespread , it is senior management that must be blamed for refusing to set a strong moral tone .
Some candidates are on this list is because they have made strategic decisions that have cost their companies dearly .
Sprint - Nextel has decided to adopt a 4G format that is different from the one that AT&T and Verizon Wireless will use .
In coming to the market first , it hopes to steal subscribers from its two larger rivals .
Unfortunately for Sprint , both AT&T and Verizon have very strong products and competitive pricing to keep their customers where they are .
Sprint probably painted itself into a box – a box in which its technology is unsustainably in the minority .
The last reason that a CEO may have been chosen is a simple one : the exceedingly poor management of a large and previously highly successful business .
The best example of this is Boeing .
It has been one of the world ’s premier manufacturing companies .
The failure to deliver its flagship product on time has hurt the firm , as it has repeatedly put off the launch of the 787 Dreamliner .
What follows is a list of the CEOs and the case against them remaining in their current positions .
Each of these companies would be much better off with a new leader – customers , shareholders , and employees should expect that they will get them .
1. Wal - Mart Stores Inc .
* CEO : Michael Duke
* When He Started : February , 2009
Michael Duke became CEO of Wal - Mart on February 1 , 2009 .
Since then , the company ’s stock is up 5 % .
The shares of archrivals Target ( NYSE : TGT ) and Costco ( NASDAQ ) , are up 65 % and 22 % respectively .
Worse , even industry whipping boy Sears Holdings ( NASDAQ : SHLD ) shares are up 53 % during the same time frame .
Duke has far more resources than his competitors .
Walmart has sales of more than $ 400 billion and 2.1 million workers .
The company operates 803 discount stores , 2,747 supercenters , 158 neighborhood markets , and 596 Sam ’s Clubs in the United States alone .
The company also has a significant presence in China , Mexico , and Brazil .
Walmart ’s opportunities to expand overseas remain significant , though many of the problems that it faces existed before Duke ’s appointment .
Walmart ’s attempts to enter South Korea and Germany were failures , and it has struggled for years in Japan .
The world ’s largest retailer is only now starting to move into India .
In this regard , Duke has failed to correct the sins of his predecessors and has perpetuated many of them .
However , the most damning part of Walmart ’s performance in the last year - and - a - half has been its inability to increase its business in the US .
On March 19 , the company reported its fourth quarter in a row of disappointing same store sales in the US .
The Wall Street Journal reported that “ Wal - Mart ’s forecast was considerably gloomier than recent guidance from other retailers such as J.C. Penney Co. , Macy ’s Inc. and Kohl ’s Corp. , which this month reported that customers had regained confidence and slowly resumed discretionary spending . ”
Duke cannot be blamed for the recession , but he can be blamed for Walmart ’s inability to exit the downturn as quickly as its rivals .
It has resorted to aggressive discounting , but that does not appear to have done much to help its momentum .
Walmart ’s activity online also represents a notable failure .
According to comScore , Walmart websites had 35.5 million visitors in the US in May , making it the second largest e-commerce site .
Amazon.com , the number one operation , had 78 million visitors and brings $ 30 billion a year in revenue .
Despite its apparent success online , Walmart.com represents only a tiny fraction of Walmart ’s sales .
Given the firm ’s resources and brand , its share of the e-commerce market should be much greater and should represent a larger percentage of its revenue .
The biggest strike against Duke is that he has done so little to change the company .
The stores have not evolved to address the company ’s shortcomings or the changing face of the market .
As evidence , its online presence has not improved and the presence of the company in parts of the country , especially urban areas has remained largely static .
It is easy to say that there has been resistance to expansion .
However , good management is good because it can overcome those hurdles .
Walmart appears fated to have two or three more years like the last three .
With the company ’s resources , that is not even close to acceptable .
Twenty - five years ago this week ( mid- January 1977 ) , my future wife , Nanette , took a phone call in our Boulder , Colorado Mile High Comics store .
The call was from a friend of ours , who was a clerk at a Science Fiction bookstore down the street .
Nanette had worked at this bookstore until she came to work at Mile High Comics .
This bookstore was also the original home of the first Mile High Comics store , as I had rented their back room for two years .
This friend gave her the phone number of a Realtor who had called the bookstore looking to unload a " large " batch of old comics .
The bookstore did n't sell comics ( they mentioned comics in their phone book ad because of my previous association with them ) , so they were more than willing to give us this tip .
Nanette immediately turned the message over to me , and I called the guy back .
He seemed quite happy to hear from me , and explained that he was trying to sell a house for the heirs of an estate , but that the house was overflowing with " junk . "
Included in the junk was a closet full of old comics , which they desperately wanted to dispose of immediately .
His question to me was whether I would be willing to come to the house and look at the comics , to see if I had any interest in hauling them away .
I quizzed the Realtor for a while about the contents of the closet .
He indicated that there were a bunch of old cowboy and horror comics from the 1950's , which sure sounded good to me .
I then asked him if there were any super - hero comics , and he said he thought there might be some old Batman and Superman comics , but he was n't sure .
In any case , what he had described was more than enough for me to get very excited .
I asked him when we could get together at the house to look at the comics , and he indicated that he thought he could make arrangements with the sellers to be there on the following Saturday .
I agreed to be there at the appointed time , and hung up the phone .
Have you ever had a " feeling " about a deal ?
I knew , right from that first phone call , that I was on to something big .
The way the realtor had described the comics collection , it sounded huge !
If it was , indeed , from the 1950's , then this collection could be quite valuable .
I was cautious , however , because I had received many similar calls , and far too often sellers proved to be prone to gross exaggeration .
Even if this collection were only half of what had been described , however , it was still well worth chasing .
At the time this call came in , I had been selling comics for 8 years .
Starting with ads in the old Rocket 's Blast Comic - Collector in 1969 , and moving up to a stand at a monthly antiques show in 1970 , I gradually had accumulated a large inventory of old comics .
By 1972 , I had over 8,000 back issues in my inventory , and rented a booth at my first national comics convention ( Multi-con ' 72 in Oklahoma City ) .
I grossed $ 1,800 during that convention , which was a huge sum in those days !
I was only 17 years old at the time , but I knew from that moment onward that I wanted to be a comics dealer for the rest of my life .
During the years from 1972 through 1974 , I attended the University of Colorado Business School , while also selling comics at conventions during the summers .
In the Spring of 1974 , I was forced to make a momentous decision .
I could only afford to go to school because I had an Army ROTC scholarship .
The problem with that scholarship was that it required me to agree to enter the army for four years of active duty ( plus two years in the reserves ) after graduation .
I had until the end of my second semester of my second year to quit ROTC , or I was locked into serving in the army .
I thought about this for many months , and finally made the decision to quit ROTC to begin a life selling old comics .
Because I had lots of old comics , but absolutely no money , I had no choice but to live in a 1963 Chevy Impala , that I borrowed from my parents .
I put all my comics in the back , and drove from comics convention to comics convention for the entire Summer of 1974 .
I slept in the back of that old Chevy ( or in parks or apartment building hallways ) , on top of my inventory , for four months .
It was all worth it , however , because at the end I had even more old comics , plus enough to pay my own tuition for the Fall semester .
I even had $ 800 left over !
Right after I started school , I read in the newspaper that a Science Fiction bookstore had opened in Boulder .
I went to the store to ask if they would handle some of my comics on consignment during the school year , and was told that consignment was too much of a hassle .
The owner then offered me a different deal .
The store had a 1,000 square foot back room where she wanted to place her inventory of used books .
The problem with the room , however , was that it had no lights , bare brick walls ( this was in the basement of an 1890 's bank building ) , and an unsealed concrete floor that was covered in nearly a century of dust .
Her offer to me was that if I cleaned this room up , and gave her room for ten bookshelves of used science fiction paperbacks , she would let me have the rest of the space for only $ 95 per month !
When I agreed to that arrangement , the first Mile High Comics store was born .

Savage Love Sex at Dawn
My husband of eight years confessed to wanting to watch me with another man .
I found a guy , and he agreed to a full STD screening — at my husband 's suggestion and our expense — so that we would n't have to use condoms .
I was worried about how my husband would react to the reality , but he loved every minute — he loved it a little too much .
My husband had sex with me after our " guest " left .
I still had our guest 's semen inside me .
Is my husband gay ?
Is that what cuckolding is all about ?
He did n't touch the other guy , but what the fuck ?
Spouse Expressing Concern Over Newly Disclosed Sexuality
" Far from being an indication of homosexuality , your husband 's turn - on goes back to the roots of male heterosexual experience , " says Christopher Ryan , coauthor of Sex at Dawn : The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality .
Before Ryan walks us through what 's so straight about your husband dipping his dick in another man 's spunk , SECONDS , let me get this off my chest : Sex at Dawn is the single most important book about human sexuality since Alfred Kinsey unleashed Sexual Behavior in the Human Male on the American public in 1948 .
Want to understand why men married to supermodels cheat ?
Why so many marriages are sexless ?
Why paternity tests often reveal that the " father " is n't ?
Read Sex at Dawn .
Back to Ryan :
" Think about it , " says Ryan .
" Why would women have evolved the capacity for slow - building multiple orgasms while males evolved the orgasmic response of minutemen accompanied by a sudden disappearance of all interest in sex ? "
Because — as Ryan and his coauthor Cacilda Jethá lay out in Sex at Dawn — for countless generations , our male and female ancestors , like our closest primate relatives ( fuck - mad bonobos ) , engaged in multipartner sex .
Females mated with multiple males , while males — so easily stimulated visually to this day — watched and waited their turn .
" Almost all of us get off on watching other people having sex , " says Ryan .
" Even if our minds deny it , our bodies respond in many ways , ranging from increased genital blood flow ( in both sexes ) to stronger male ejaculations . "
By inviting another male into your bedroom , SECONDS , your husband — consciously or subconsciously — was inducing what 's known as " sperm competition . "
Watching you have sex with another male made him more excited to have sex with you , not with the other male , and treated him to a more intense orgasm in you , not in the other male .
" So your husband 's experience was very heterosexual , " says Ryan .
I am a 24 - year - old female .
I 've been in a relationship with a man for six years , on and off .
I think I could spend my life with him .
But I have a hard time being faithful .
I have cheated on him with other men and with women .
He and I are not together currently , but we maintain a long - distance sexual relationship .
We say that we are going to be together someday , but he has no trust in me .
I would love to be content , but I can't seem to go very long before I get distracted .
Please give me some insight !
Do n't Wanna Be A Heartbreaker
" Toward the end of Sex at Dawn , " says Ryan , " there 's a brief section called ' Everybody Out of the Closet . '
We argue that it 's not just gay people who have to go through the sort of brutally honest self - exploration involved in coming out .
We all need to go through this process — and the sooner the better . "
Here 's what you need to come out about , DWBAH :
You 'll never be content in a monogamous relationship .
" It 's time to stop bullshitting yourself , " says Ryan .
" You 're very young , so , with all due respect , a certain amount of bullshit is to be expected .
But you sound ready to move beyond this .
Before getting into a committed relationship , you owe it to yourself and to the other person to be honest about who you are , and for now at least , you 're clearly not sexually monogamous .
" And if you 'll pardon just a few words of old - guy wisdom while Dan shares his amazing platform , " Ryan continues , " many people your age misunderstand the odds of finding love in life .
Few young people really appreciate that by being open about who you really are , you end up wasting much less time on relationships that are doomed from the start .
In the long run , it 's much more efficient to fess up about who you are and what you 're really into from the get - go . "
Who are you , DWBAH ?
You 're a slut .
( I mean that in the sex - positive sense !
I 'm a slut , too ! ) .
And what are you really into ?
Variety .
And do n't feel bad :
You did n't fail monogamy , DWBAH , monogamy failed you — as it has failed so many others ( Clinton , Edwards , Spitzer , Vitter , Ensign , et al. ) , and will continue to , because monogamy is unrealistic and — this is not a word I toss around lightly — unnatural .
" Maybe half of the people you 're interested in will walk away when you fess up , " says Ryan .
" Let them walk !
Those who do n't walk away are a much better investment of your time and energy — both of which are more limited than you can possibly realize at age 24 . "
I 've been with my partner for 10 years .
I have lost all interest in sex , while my partner still has a healthy libido .
We 've agreed on a weekly " sex night . "
I dread it .
We could call it quits , but we have a child and we love each other .
I do n't want to break up our family , so I put up with " sex night . "
It sounds depressing , I know , but the alternative seems worse .
Wishes She Was Horny
" Lots of wonderful marriages are n't particularly sexual or exclusive , " says Ryan , hinting at another alternative .
" Sexual novelty was an important part of our evolution as a species .
But , as you and your partner demonstrate , we do n't all respond the same way to the absence of novelty .
" You do n't say if your loss of libido pertains only to sex with your partner or to anyone at all , " Ryan continues , " but it 's a good idea to eliminate possible medical and psychological causes before concluding that it's a purely sexual issue .
Assuming it 's just about libido , I 'd encourage you to find a middle ground that preserves your family and the love you share but incorporates a more comfortable sexual arrangement that does n't leave your partner frustrated and you dreading ' sex night . ' "
In other words , WSWH , ask yourself what 's more important : staying married or staying monogamous ?
" If you can find a way to take the pressure off both of you , you might find a deeper intimacy with each other and a return of your libido , " says Ryan .
I usually end with a plug for my podcast .
Not this week :
Anyone who 's ever struggled with monogamy — and any honest person who ever attempted it admits to struggling — needs to read Sex at Dawn .

Personal Injury Attorney : Broken Bones
Personal Injury Attorney : Broken Bones
Have you suffered a broken bone in an accident caused by the carelessness of others ?
There are many accidents in San Antonio , every single day , which results in broken bones .
A broken bone injury is one of the most severe non-life - threatening injuries a person can endure .
If treated incorrectly , the bone may not heal properly which can forever alter the ability of the victim ’s limb or that portion of their body .
Additionally , broken bones are extremely painful .
Types of fractures
The adult body has more than 200 bones all of which are subject to fracture under the right circumstances .
The types of breaks that the human skeleton may incur as quite varied as well , including Single Fracture , a single fracture occurs when a bone is broken in a single location .
Complete Fracture .
a complete fracture occurs when the bone breaks into two separate pieces .
Bending Fracture , a bending fracture occurs when the bone bends without actually cracking .
This rarely happens in adults because our bones become rigid and brittle .
However , children experience this quite often as their bones are more pliable .
Hairline Fracture , a hairline fracture occurs when the break is extremely thin and the bone has not broken all of the ways through .
More information here @
https://no1-lawyer.com/car-accident-lawyer-el-paso/
This is very similar to a teacup that has a noticeable crack but does not leak .
Greenstick Fracture ,
When the bone bent and the outer radius of the bend ( the side of the bone in tension ) is broken , but the inner radius ( the side of the bone in compression ) is only bent , but not to the point of breaking .
This is a common occurrence in child injuries , but not as common with adults as the bone usually breaks without as much bend .
Open Fracture
When the bone breaks and is misaligned as to punch through the skin .
This type of broken bone usually only occurs under conditions of tremendous stress such as those common in a car accident or falling accident .
If you or a loved one has suffered from a broken bone due to the negligence of others , our Texas attorneys can help you get all that you are entitled to .

I was in Weight Training class today
And when we were about to leave
This girl , whom I barely know
Walks up to me out of nowhere
And tries to grab my penis
Her fingers managed to touch it
But , I stopped her before she got her whole hand on it
Why would a girl be so bold as to do something like that ?
This situation bothers me somewhat
And makes me wonder if it'll happen again
I have a girlfriend
And she 's pissed
Real ale buff who spent five years checking out ALL 700 pubs in the Good Beer Guide ( ending with a pint at his local )
It was always going to be a challenge but it was not one real ale lover Stuart Ashby was going to shy away from .
After a five - year odyssey , he has finally made his way to every pub mentioned in the Good Beer Guide - at times hitch - hiking to the remotest corner of Britain to ensure he visited to every one of the 700 pubs listed .
The 60 - year - old retired railway worker , from Shoreham , West Sussex , downed a pint in each of the watering holes mentioned in the 1990 edition of the book , averaging three pub visits a week .
He finished his trek at the Lamb in Yapton , just a few miles from his home .
Stuart Ashby , 60 , downed a pint in each of the watering holes mentioned in the 1990 edition of Good Beer Guide , averaging three pub visits a week
He said after completing his milestone : ' I managed to keep going .
I thought by now I 'd be fed up with it or infirm . '
STUART'S GOOD BEER ODYSSEY
Time taken : Five years
Pubs visited : 700
Pub visit rate :
Three a week
Pints drunk :
One in each pub
Hardest pub to get to : On Lundy Island , off Devon coast .
Four - hour ferry to get there
Hardest pub : South Bermondsey where he was ' greeted ' at the door by man with shotgun
He estimates he has visited more than 17,000 different pubs since 1984 in his quest to find the perfect pint , and he is still looking .
His dedication is even more impressive given that he can not drive .
He said : ' When there is no public transport I hitch - hike .
I do n't think anything of it .
Enough people stop to get me from A to B and people are interested when they find out where I am going .
' I do a lot of walking , which stops me putting on more weight than I would otherwise . '
Mr Ashby is so dedicated to his hobby he even travelled four hours by ferry to enjoy a drink at an isolated pub on Lundy Island in Devon .
The retired 60 - year - old said : ' If it needs doing then I 'll travel as far as I have to by whatever means to make it to a pub on the guide . '
However he says he can not pick just one favourite watering hole out of the thousands he has tried .
He said : ' It 's hard because I have done so many to remember one to two .
But it is sad to see the decline of the traditional British pub .
' Fortunately , I do n't think it will decline to such an extent as to affect me but if I was to come back to Earth in 100 years , I would be sickened .
People used to go to the pub five or six times a week but now they only go twice a week . '
The real ale aficionado celebrated completing his impressive feat the only way he knew how - with a pint at his local .
Reflecting on his achievement , he said : ' I 've had some wonderful times and some scary times .
I once travelled to a pub in South Bermondsey and the place was shut at 5 pm so I banged on the door for a bit only to be greeted by a very angry man and his shotgun .
I left that one pretty quickly .
' I did go back later , very discreetly , because I had to have a pint from there so I could cross it off my list .
' Most of the time the people are a lot friendlier .
I 've met some real characters in pubs all across the UK - although people tend to think I am the character because of what I get up to .
' I always get chatting to the bar staff and the locals and they like to know if I think their pints are up to scratch .
' I 'll always order a pint of whatever The Good Beer Guide recommends but if I had to choose favourites then that has to be London Pride or Deuchers IPA .
But I 'm definitely not an ale expert - just a very willing connoisseur . '
Despite having drunk his way through the guide , Mr Ashby is not giving up his nomadic drinking .
' I have no plans to stop visiting pubs , ' he said .
' I love it too much .
' In fact , at the end of the month I 'm off to North Wales for eight days and I plan to visit 100 pubs . '
Enlarge By Justin Sullivan , Getty Images U.S. Army soldiers carry a wounded American soldier to a U.S. Army helicopter on June 28 near Kandahar , Afghanistan .
Coalition forces killed in Afghanistan topped 100 in June .
WASHINGTON  Coalition forces killed in Afghanistan topped 100 in June , the war 's highest monthly toll and approaching some of the deadliest months in the Iraq war The deaths of 102 servicemembers included a record 59 Americans .
Nine of the 46 nations in the U.S. - led coalition suffered fatalities , the most countries to lose troops since the conflict began nearly nine years ago .
The increase in deaths stems at least partly from an expansion in military operations against the Taliban , according to the Pentagon , and comes days after President Obama named Gen .
David Petraeus as the war 's new commander .
Addressing the rise in fatalities , Petraeus , who directed the turnaround in the Iraq war , warned that violence could escalate as coalition forces attempted to push insurgents from former strongholds .
" My sense is that the tough fighting will continue , " he said at his Senate confirmation hearing , after which he was approved in a 99 - 0 vote .
" It may get more intense in the next few months . "
DATABASE : American casualties in Iraq , Afghanistan , and beyond Already , U.S. forces have stepped up attacks as a surge of 30,000 troops ordered by Obama builds strength .
The Pentagon says hundreds of Taliban militants have been killed or captured in battles in the eastern and southern portions of the country in recent weeks .
The June death toll was also the most soldiers lost in battle by NATO nations other than the United States .
The United Kingdom , where liberal members of Parliament have been demanding a withdrawal of forces , lost 20 soldiers .
British Defense Minister Liam Fox , in Washington for talks with the U.S. military , said European coalition members must remain until al - Qaeda is no longer a threat in Afghanistan .
" We must hold our nerve … and have the resilience to see the job through , " he said .
Stephen Flanagan , an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said death statistics alone are not a good measure of how the war is going .
" They 're not an indicator of success or failure , " he said .
" It 's not a war of attrition . "

Brazil has proposed a broad update to its copyright law ( Portuguese ) and it contains a surprising idea : penalize anyone who " hinders or impedes " fair use rights or obstructs the use of work that has already fallen into the public domain .
A huge win for consumers ?
Sure , but it gets better .
A moment 's thought reminds us that most DRM schemes will eventually run afoul the above provisions , since they apply in perpetuity .
That DRMed music file will still be DRMed even after the song has fallen into the public domain .
So Brazil wants to ensure that DRM " has time - limited effects that correspond to the period of the economic rights over the work , performance , phonogram or broadcast . "
Once copyright has expired , DRM should , too .
As if that 's not enough , Brazil says that DRM can be bypassed in order to make any " fair " use of the work or in cases where the copyright has expired but the DRM has not .
Contrast this with the US approach to copyright in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , which said nothing about time - limited DRM and made circumvention illegal in nearly all cases , even when the intended use of the material would be legal .
Brazil 's proposal could be spun as something hostile to rightsholders , but it 's not that simple .
The law does provide protection for DRM ; in general , it is illegal to remove , modify , bypass , or impair such anti-copying technology .
It 's just that rightsholders can't use DRM as a digital lock to give themselves more control over a work through technology than they have under the law .
Treaties
While some content industry lobbyists like to make arguments about " living up to international norms " on DRM to suggest that countries need to take a hard line on anticircumvention , the " international norms " allow plenty of leeway .
The WIPO Internet Treaties , one of the key parts of this international consensus , require signatories to " provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that are used by authors in connection with the exercise of their rights under this Treaty or the Berne Convention and that restrict acts , in respect of their works , which are not authorized by the authors concerned or permitted by law . "
DRM must be defended only when it restricts acts that are " not permitted by law . "
Since the law in places like Brazil , the US , and many other countries contains fair use or fair dealing provisions , those countries are authorized to allow DRM circumvention for those uses as long as general bypassing is disallowed .
Given the nature of most fair use laws , plenty of murky cases will have to be examined by the courts .
That 's a slow , messy solution , but one that allows for flexibility and creativity ; the " clean " alternative of simply outlawing DRM circumvention almost completely leads to the absurd situation where A US citizen can legally rip a CD to an iPod but breaks the law when doing the same with a DVD .
Michael Geist , a Canadian law professor who highlighted the new proposal , sums it up as a properly balanced approach that does n't buy into the " more is better " approach to copyright protections .
" In other words , the Brazilian proposals recognizes what the Supreme Court of Canada stated several years ago , " he writes , " over - protection is just as harmful as under- protection . "
The president of Hull Paranormal Ghost Society , Robert Taylor , has been given three years in jail for having sex with a minor .
The pedophile Robert Taylor was using his “ ghost hunting team ” as a means to gaining the trust of parents and the children .
I ’ve previously wrote about some sex offenders as paranormal investigators , and it is no surprise that more and more of these cases are coming forward .
These subhuman pieces of trash pray on the vulnerable and sometimes gullible in guise of helping the families out or training the young as paranormal investigators .
Robert Taylor is not just a lousy excuse for a human , but also a moronic paranormal investigator .
We mentioned Robert Taylor on GhostTheory before when we tore apart the Daily Mail ‘s ‘ ghost boy ‘ photograph , in which Taylor was quoted saying :
“ I have never seen anything as clear and as distinctive as the boy in the picture . ”
So please , please make sure you know who you are inviting into your homes .
I just hope Taylor gets what ’s coming to him in jail .

A few minor tweaks to your recipe .
First you do not need hot water , warm or room temp water will do just fine and it helps keep the rise at a slower pace .
Remember time is our friend when making bread , but before cooking the dough heat is our enemy .
Second you should not add the salt right away when making your polish / sponge , the salt should be added after you mix everything together and let your dough rest for 20 minutes for the gluten form and bond then add the salt and mix again .
Third do n't look for doubled in size rather test you dough to see when it has finished rising , poke it with two fingers if the dough pushes back it is still rising , if the dough stays indented it has finished rising and if it falls it was over proofed .
Forth and just as a different way of kneading , I knead in three steps each have a 10 minute break in between , I fold the dough ten times and place it in an oiled bowl folded side down , each time I knead I flip it over and knead from the bottom .
after the last knead I give it 40 to 50 min to rise " when it tests right when poked " then form into loafs or what ever you are making and let rise until it tests as ready to bake .
hope this helps .
Note salt is a yeast killer but also adds to the flavor of bread .
That is why we delay putting the salt in !

Dartmouth researchers have discovered a potentially important piece of the quantum / classical puzzle -- learning how the rules of physics in the quantum world ( think smaller than microscopic ) change when applied to the classical world ( think every day items , like cars and trees ) .
In a study published in the July 1 issue of the journal Nature , Associate Professor of Physics and Astronomy Alex Rimberg and his colleagues describe one example of the microscopic quantum world influencing , even dominating they say , the behavior of something in the macroscopic classical world .
They used tiny semiconducting crystals that contain two separate reservoirs of electrons to explore the different influences of both classical and quantum physics .
" We found that the motion of the crystals is not dominated by something classical like thermal motion , but instead by random quantum fluctuations in the number of electrons tunneling through the barrier ; the fluctuations were the size of about 10,000 electrons , " says Rimberg .
" But the macroscopic world in this study also influences the quantum world , in that the vibrations of the crystal caused the electrons to tunnel in big bunches , more or less in sync with the vibrations of the crystal . "
One major question in quantum physics deals with the connection between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds .
Rimberg explains that scientists know that microscopic objects such as electrons obey the laws of quantum mechanics , while macroscopic objects obey Newton 's laws .
Researchers are still learning exactly how classical behavior emerges from quantum behavior as systems become larger and larger .
Rimberg says that the difference in size between the classical and quantum parts of thesystem described in this paper is really extreme .
" To give a sense of perspective , we could imagine that the 10,000 electrons correspond to something small like a flea .
To complete the analogy , the crystal would have to be the size of Mt. Everest .
If we imagine the flea jumping on Mt. Everest to make it move , then the resulting vibrations would be on the order of meters . "
Rimberg 's future work will use nonlinear superconducting systems , different from using the semiconducting crystals in this experiment , to make very strongly quantum mechanical systems .
Nonlinear classical systems can show unpredictable , chaotic behavior ; the behavior of the corresponding quantum systems is not well understood .
This effort will be a prelude to studying the quantum properties of mechanical resonators that are smaller than the crystals in this experiment , but definitely not microscopic either ; they are the things in the murky borderland between quantum and classical regimes .
Rimberg was worked on this study with colleagues at Dartmouth , Miles Blencowe , Joel Stettenheim , Feng Pan , Mustafa Bal , and Weiwei Zue .
They were joined by Madhu Thalakulam and Zhonquig Ji from Rice University ; and Loren Pfeiffer and K.W. West from Bell Laboratories .
The research was funded by the U.S. Army Research Office and the National Science Foundation .
Most people think that starting a medical centre , especially in Rockhampton , is an easy task , but it is demanding , especially when you are opening a medical centre as an individual .
This is because when you are starting a medical centre in Rockhampton , there is strict steps and procedures that you are supposed to follow .
Apart from following the rule of law in Rockhampton as an individual , the process of starting and running a medical centre in Rockhampton is also complicated .
For this reason , there are several things that you need to consider when you are beginning this business just as other business people take precautions before they start their businesses .
When you put the factors into consideration , you will be in a position to open your medical centre in Rockhampton and even run it smoothly .
The following are some of the things to consider when you are opening a medical centre in Rockhampton .
Do you have a clear business plan ?
A medical centre is also a business , and hence , when you are starting a medical centre in Rockhampton , you need to have a clear business plan .
This is the first consideration that you should make since the business plan speaks about your ideas , and the plan will help you find out whether the ideas you have in mind are worthy or not .
The business plan will also outline all the things that you need to achieve once you start your medical centre in Rockhampton .
For this reason , once you begin by having a clear business plan , you will be able to know precisely what you will need to do for you to make sure that you ruin your medical centre as required .
In your business plan , ensure that you have to state all your goals objectives and come up with reasonable ways that will help you achieve them .
Amount of capital required
Once you have your business plan in place , you can now go ahead and determine the number of funds that you will require to start your medical centre in Rockhampton and also to run it .
The amount of capital needed to run the medical centre in Rockhampton will be determined by the size of the medical centre , and even the kind of services that will provide g to your patients .
However , if you are you want to establish your medical centre in an existing medical centre in Rockhampton , it will be somehow more manageable for you unlike when you are starting a medical centre in Rockhampton from scratch .
You need to come up with smart ways on how you will finance your medical centre by choosing better sources of capital .
Although at the start you will need huge capitals , once you have set the medical centre , you will not be required to fund the medical centre as you need at the beginning .
When you are choosing on how to finance your medical centre in Rockhampton , you need to be very keen to ensure that you are always capable of providing that there is medicine , the required personnel , medical equipment and also the facilities to be used in the medical centre are available .
The location of the medical centre
Having a business plan and funds is not enough when you want to start your medical centre in Rockhampton .
This is because you will need to come up with a strategic position to establish your medical centre .
Ensure that the location can be easily accessed by the patients , is secure , and has an efficient lighting system .
Choose the best insurance policies
At times , there might be accidents in the medical centre , and your patients may be involved .
For this reason , you need to choose the best insurance policies to invest in so that you can protect your patients , doctors , and business .
Get the best team to work with
It is very unwise to decide that you will be running the medical centre alone .
For this reason , you need to take your time when you are hiring your workers .
Ensure that the doctors and nurses you will hire are qualified and experienced .
When it comes to the other persons , emphasise on their level of professionalism , so that your patients can be served correctly .
CQ Medicentre are a medical centre in Rockhampton that you can use as a model for your medical centre .
Iran has warned that it could send Revolutionary Guard naval units to escort humanitarian aid convoys seeking to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza – a move that would certainly be challenged by Israel .
Any such Iranian involvement , raised today by an aide to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , would constitute a serious escalation of already high tensions with Israel , which accuses Tehran of seeking to build a nuclear weapon and of backing Hamas , the Islamist movement that controls Gaza .
" Iran 's Revolutionary Guard naval forces are prepared to escort the peace and freedom convoys that carry humanitarian assistance for the defenceless and oppressed people of Gaza with all their strength , " pledged Hojjatoleslam Ali Shirazi , Khamenei 's personal representative to the guards corps .
The threat came as the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , dismissed a UN proposal for an international commission to investigate last week 's commando assault on aid ships , in which nine people died .
Another aid ship , the Rachel Corrie , carrying Irish and other peace activists , was boarded peacefully by Israeli forces on Saturday , escorted to the port of Ashdod , and its passengers deported .
Netanyahu has defended Israel 's right to maintain the blockade by arguing that without it Gaza would become an " Iranian port " and Hamas missiles would strike Tel Aviv and Jerusalem .
Israel 's undeclared aim is to weaken or bring down the Hamas government .
Iran continued to exploit the " freedom flotilla " affair to lambast Israel .
Its foreign minister , Manuchehr Mottaki , told the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in Jeddah on Sunday that Israel 's crime was " another instance of the Zionist regime 's brazen and merciless treatment of Muslims , especially the oppressed Palestinian people . "
Mottaki also called for a UN resolution condemning Israel .
The security council is discussing imposing new sanctions on Iran because of its failure to meet international demands over its nuclear programme .
Iran and Israel have had no diplomatic relations since the 1979 revolution and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad regularly predicts the disappearance of the Jewish state as well as denying the Holocaust .
Shirazi said Iran should encourage international efforts to break the blockade .
" We should expose our enemies to spontaneous global action and not let them achieve their heinous goals , " he was quoted as saying by the semi-official Mehr news agency .
Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , which have a command structure separate from the regular armed forces , are fiercely loyal to the supreme leader .
Khamenei has attacked the raid as a " mistake " that " showed how barbaric the Zionists are " .
Israel 's determination to strike at links between Iran and Hamas was dramatically demonstrated in January when presumed Mossad agents in Dubai assassinated Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , who was described as the Hamas official in charge of smuggling Iranian weapons into Gaza .
Israel 's no-compromise attitude to aid convoys could be tested again after two Lebanese organisations pledged to send boats to Gaza in the next few days .
Reporters Without Borders is attempting to assemble 25 European activists and 50 journalists for a boat leaving Beirut .
The Free Palestine Movement is planning a similar attempt .
George Galloway , the founder of Viva Palestina , announced in London that two simultaneous convoys " one by land via Egypt and the other by sea " would set out in September to break the Gaza blockade .
The sea convoy of up to 60 ships will travel around the Mediterranean gathering ships , cargo and volunteers .
Review : ' Matrix ' offers tales from the cryptic April 9 , 1999
Web posted at : 2:50 p.m. EDT ( 1850 GMT ) By Reviewer Paul Tatara ( CNN ) -- Keanu Reeves stinks .
We should establish that right at the start .
If you 're intending to see the new sci - fi extravaganza " The Matrix " because you think our boy is on the verge of wowing you with a sudden , unexpected leap to thespian competence , you might also consider making a stop at the golden arches on the way to the theater to pick up a McMignon burger .
You 're a lot more optimistic than I am .
MULTIMEDIA : Theatrical preview for " The Matrix " Real 28 K 80 K Windows Media 28 K 80 K Keanu -- Hawaiian for " Shouts Dialogue Phonetically " -- is so vehemently semi-talented he 's actually gotten to the point where he seems to be snickering at his own uncomprehending performances , right there in front of you .
Lots of actors talk about feeling like frauds , fearing that the next picture will be the one where everyone figures out that they do n't know what they 're doing .
Well , Reeves does n't have to worry about that ; if you can't tell that he 's faking it , you simply have n't seen him .
He 's like a cross between Patrick Swayze and Charlie McCarthy , minus the monocle .
Prudent script selection has allowed Reeves to establish a thriving career as an action star of sorts in recent years .
( Let 's face it , his most enjoyable work is in " Speed " because there 's lots of fast , dangerous things happening , and all he has to do is stoically chew gum while they happen . )
So he must 've had some inkling that he'd be quickly lost in the murky monologues and groovy special effects while reading the script to " The Matrix . "
Reminiscent of ' Dark City ' " The Matrix " is like last year 's " Dark City . "
It lets you know early on that it wo n't be making a bit of sense , then repeatedly tries to convince you that the nonsense is actually deep and meaningful .
It 's a riddle within a riddle within a riddle within a surprisingly sluggish movie , and anything can happen at any time because up is down and black is white .
Right .
For the most part , it 's actually just another reason to trot out the latest mind - boggling developments in special effects .
I 'm well aware that I 'm supposed to feel differently by now , but that simply is not enough for my dollar when I walk into a theater .
To my never - ending chagrin , however , not much of anybody else really seems to mind .
The film is making a ton of money , and that 's the only goal today , even in the eyes of most audience members .
" The Matrix " is an exhaustively conceived pinball machine that 's raking in the dough , so that means it 's a " movie . "
If you get technologically aroused three or more times as it unspools , and it makes over $ 100 million , it 's a " good movie . "
Character , intelligent dialogue , and that slippery quality called " heart " are relegated to the bleacher seats .
You can occasionally catch a glimpse of them waving in the distance .
Reeves plays a brilliant computer hacker who , through the use of an extremely ponderous Laurence Fishburne and some truly amazing digital effects , is being convinced that he 's actually some sort of cyber -Messiah .
( Ridiculous Roles for Keanu poker : " I 'll see your Buddha and raise you a brilliant cyber - Messiah . " )
ALSO : Meet the stars of ' Matrix , ' where myth meets the Internet Fishburne plays a guy named Morpheus who 's the prime generator of most of the movie 's cyber - philosophical horse manure .
Half the movie consists of Reeves asking Fishburne straight questions , only to have Fishburne respond as cryptically as possible , like the know - it - all blind guy in " Kung - Fu . "
There 's even an excitingly choreographed kung - fu sequence .
As I 'm sure you know by now ( what with TV commercials bombarding you with the idea every five minutes ) , " No one can tell you what the Matrix is ; you just have to see it for yourself . "
Well , that 's true .
But you probably wo n't know what it is after you see it either .
According to Fishburne 's character , the world that you and I inhabit is just a " world that 's been pulled over your eyes . "
The reality is much darker and twistier and ... um ... more complexer ( variations on up - is - down , left - is - right , blah - blah - blah . )

I could be wrong , but I think the gist is that we 're all actually living in a computer , and a superior race of some sort is trying to turn human beings into Duracell batteries .
You just do n't care after a while , but the effects compel you to keep watching .
That 's as safe as filmmakers can get when trying to sell a movie in the modern age .
There are generic bad guys who wear sunglasses and talk in a monotone , a la " Men in Black " and " The X - Files . "
There 's lots of womb imagery and space goo ( " Alien " ) .
There 's Fishburne leaping 100 feet in the air and landing on the building across the street ( basically , only this movie ) .
You 're damn right it looks cool .
Here 's the problem , though .
You have to look not only at this movie , but the movies that it 'll quickly spawn once the studios ' money men do a detailed autopsy on the specifics of those grosses .
" The Matrix " features that stroll - around - the - freeze - frame effect that 's so great in those boogie - woogie Gap commercials , and you see it several times .
Get ready for the same effect in every third movie you see for the next 18 months .
Beginning in about 4 months .
If all you want are effects , then , by golly , that 's what you 'll get .
And I thought the first hour drug on like a Calculus exam .
A drastically visual Calculus exam .
" The Matrix " is often more than a little gross .
Reeves is actually reborn out of some kind of bio-mechanical uterus .
It 's awful sticky - drippy in a bio-mechanical uterus .
( He said . )
Computers are plugged into bloody sockets in people 's heads .
Reeves is unfortunate enough to have a digitally generated info - lizard enter him through his belly - button .
If David Cronenberg had come up with " Star Wars , " we would have gotten this , only much better .
Rated R. 136 minutes .
Oh , it 's directed ( or refereed , depending on how you want to look at it ) by Larry and Andy Wachowski .

Behind the universe ’s odd spots ( Image : Lawrence Lawry / SPL )
A BUBBLE of space that expanded differently to the rest of the early universe could explain a strange “ cold spot ” in the afterglow of the big bang .
Such bubbles might have formed just fractions of a second after the universe came into existence , when it grew dramatically in size .
“ It would be an unexpected gift , because we would all of a sudden have a very good window on inflation , ” says Anže Slosar of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton , New York , part of the team that put forward the idea .

An environmental campaigner has swum 1 km ( 0.62 miles ) across a glacial lake on Mount Everest to highlight the impact of global warming .
Lewis Gordon Pugh , 40 , from Devon , wore only swimming trunks , goggles and a swimming hat to face the 2C waters of Pumori Lake at 17,000 ft ( 5,300 m ) .
He said he hoped to bring the " world 's attention " to the melting of glaciers and its effect on the region .
Mr Pugh has been nicknamed the " human polar bear " for his cold water swims .
He completed the swim near the Khumbu Glacier in 22 minutes and 51 seconds .
It is the first time a long distance swim has been completed under the summit of Everest , his campaign team said .
Mr Pugh said it had been one of his toughest swims
He has previously swum in Antarctica and across the North Pole to draw attention to melting sea ice .
On his latest trip , the lawyer battled altitude sickness as well as freezing conditions .
He said : " It 's one of the hardest swims I 've ever undertaken .
When I swam in Antarctica and across the North Pole I swam with speed and aggression but on Mount Everest you can't use the same tactics .
Because of the altitude you need to swim very slowly and deliberately .
" Swimming 20 metres at full speed in the test swim , I felt I was going to drown .
I was gasping for air and if I had swum any faster I would have gone under .
Glacier ' lifeline '
" I was deeply concerned that I would n't make 1 km and I 'm delighted that I 've finally achieved it . "
Mr Pugh said he had had to find a " delicate balance " between going too fast and too slowly , which could cause him to get hypothermia .
He trained on Dartmouth , where he grew up , for the challenge .
He urged governments to make tackling climate change a priority and said he was disappointed the issue did not feature more prominently in the UK election .
The campaigner said he had seen glaciers around the world and many were " melting away " .
" The glaciers in the Himalayas are not just ice .
They are a lifeline - they provide water to approximately two billion people , " he added .

Bon Jovi charges $ 1,875 for a front row seat and fan Jim Leaman bought a ticket .
“ I have money , ” Leaman told The New York Times , “ and I do n’t care if it costs $ 100 or $ 1,000 . ”
But is it his money ?
Leaman apparently makes his money from a propane distribution company that he owns .
Of course , Leaman does not produce propane .
By himself , he most likely does not produce anything else either .
Such a company no doubt employs workers who fill the propane bottles , phone operators who take orders , technicians who maintain the equipment , forklift operators who load the bottles on trucks , drivers who distribute them to customers , and a manager who coordinates these activities .
The bottling and distribution of propane is a team effort , as is the production of almost everything else .
A bus driver and a bus may deliver 40 passengers , but the driver without the bus would deliver no passengers , and neither would the bus without the driver .
A surgeon operates on a patient who was prepped for surgery by others ; she uses tools that were sterilized and are handed to her by nurses who also operate machines without which the surgery would not have been possible .
The team that produces a high - rise is bigger still .
How is the income that a team generates divided among the members ?
In 1776 , Adam Smith explained that the factor determining how income is shared is bargaining power , and that this power consists of the ability of each side to hold out for a better deal and to harness the support of the government .
On both accounts the employers are stronger : First , they are richer , and , therefore , “ in all such disputes , the masters can hold out much longer . ”
But the government also sides with them : “ The masters … never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil magistrate , and the rigorous execution of those laws which have been enacted with so much severity against [ the unions ] of servants , labourers , and journeymen . ”
A third factor that determines bargaining power is , of course , the availability of replacement workers .
When several workers compete for the same job , and these workers are not protected either by a minimum wage law or a union , masters once again have the upper hand .
If the owner of a business takes for himself a large enough share of the income of the team that he can afford $ 1,875 concert tickets without thinking twice , is n’t it fair to ask whether the money is justly his ?
In the latter part of the 19th century , workers raised this very question .
The government responded with violence : Workers were killed and labor leaders hanged — the Haymarket Massacre was one of those events .
John Bates Clark , a Columbia University economics professor , responded by denying the validity of the question itself .
Had the question been valid , Clark explained , workers would have been justified in rebelling :
The indictment that hangs over society is that of “ exploiting labor . ” …
If this charge were proved , every right - minded man should become a socialist . …
But the question was not valid , Clark argued , because production is not carried out by teams , and power does not determine rates of pay .
If not by teams , how is production carried out , then ?
Each worker and each machine produces all by itself a small quantity of product , Clark argued .
An employer adds workers one by one , each time comparing the value of the product of the additional worker to the wage .
The process of adding workers stops when the value of the additional product is just the same as the additional wage that this worker will earn .
Since workers are interchangeable , each worker can be regarded as the last worker hired , and hence each worker gets paid the value of what she adds to production .
The only problem with this description of the production process is reality .
A bus and its driver produce an income of $ 100,000 , and the wage of the bus driver is $ 25,000 .
Is it because the driver without the bus transported 10 passengers and the bus without the driver transported the other 30 ?
Production is carried out by teams , and this is why individual contributions , of either workers or machines , cannot be measured .
Finding an example of a production process that does not involve a team is nearly impossible .
Every restaurant , grocery store or construction site is an example of team production .
In the face of this obvious reality , how is it possible that generations of economists have been brainwashed into believing that each person is paid “ what she is worth ” ?
It has taken the current Great Recession to shake the hold that this view has had on both academic and public discourse about how wages and executive compensation are determined .
The opportunity is now here to have theories that are based on the real world .
In reality , production is carried out by teams , and the income that this production generates should be divided among the members fairly .
Two laws would facilitate this greatly :
One would set a ratio between the highest and lowest rate of pay in any firm or corporation , and the other would set a ratio between the pay of labor and the pay of the owners of the corporations who provides labor the machines and structures that it works with .
We need laws that help us fairly divide what we produce as teams .

The UN says young people are becoming sexually active later
The prevalence of HIV among young people in countries worst - affected by Aids , mainly in Africa , has fallen , new figures from the UN show .
In a report , UNAids says the incidence of HIV has decreased by up to 25 % as young people between the ages of 15 and 24 change their sexual behaviour .
The report says it is in response to Aids prevention campaigns .
But the UN says it is on the rise in Uganda , which had been praised for its HIV fight , because of " complacency " .
According to the UN , five million young people live with HIV worldwide , making up 40 % of new infections .
' Warning '
Uganda 's vigorous campaign against HIV / Aids had helped to reduce the prevalence of the virus - which reached 30 % in the 1990s - to single - digit figures .
Young people are not just perceiving themselves anymore as a passive beneficiaries of programmes , but they are making themselves actors of change Michel Sidibe , Executive director , UNAids
" After the reduction and introduction of treatment , most of the people were not feeling anymore of the same pressure for prevention programmes , " Michel Sidibe , the executive director of UNAids , told the BBC .
" So what we are experiencing today in Uganda is what we need to be scared about it - it 's progress , and not sustaining [ those ] results due to probably a complacency . "
However , the other data was a positive sign of change as young people in Africa were taking responsibility for their own health and well - being , he said .
" Young people are not just perceiving themselves anymore as a passive beneficiaries of programmes , but they are making themselves actors of change , " he said .
" For me , that is a major , major shift in our prevention programmes . "
Treatment problems
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the UN is releasing the figures ahead of this year 's international conference on Aids , which begins in Vienna on Sunday .
Case study : Kenya 60 % decline in HIV prevalence between 2000 and 2005
Urban areas : HIV prevalence dropped from 14.2 % to 5.4 %
Rural areas : HIV prevalence dropped from from 9.2 % to 3.6 % Source : UNAids
The Outlook report says young people in 16 of the world 's 25 worst - affected countries with HIV are becoming sexually active later and having fewer sexual partners .
In countries such as Botswana , Ethiopia , Kenya , Malawi and Zimbabwe the reduction in new HIV infections , measured among young pregnant women presenting for antenatal check - ups , indicates that these nations will achieve UN targets for reducing HIV rates among the young this year .
While the UN believes significant progress is being made , on treatment the picture is somewhat different , our reporter says .
Aids treatment remains complicated and expensive , and , worldwide , only a third of those who need anti-retrovirals are actually receiving them .
The UN says more resources are needed to develop simpler and cheaper Aids medicines , and to streamline diagnosis and treatment .

C'est sur son blog qu'Alain Joyandet , éclaboussé par plusieurs affaires , a annoncé dimanche 4 juillet sa démission .
AFP / BERTRAND GUAY
Ce sera finalement Alain Joyandet et Christian Blanc .
En pleine tourmente dans l'affaire Bettencourt - Woerth et après plusieurs polémiques sur les passe - droits et le train de vie dispendieux de certains ministres , ce sont le secrétaire d'Etat à la coopération et celui au Grand Paris qui quittent le gouvernement .
Ils ont tous les deux présenté leur démission dimanche 4 juillet ; démissions qui ont été acceptées , a précisé l'Elysée dans un communiqué .
Dans ce communiqué , l'Elysée ajoute que " les fonctions d'Alain Joyandet seront exercées par Bernard Kouchner [ ministre des affaires étrangères ] et celles de Christian Blanc par Michel Mercier [ ministre de l'aménagement du territoire ] " .
Les deux hommes ont été récemment mis en cause , dans la presse en raison de leur train de vie .
C'est sur son blog que M. Joyandet a annoncé sa démission .
" L'homme d'honneur que je suis ne peut accepter d'être victime d'un amalgame .
Après mûre réflexion , j'ai décidé de quitter le gouvernement " , explique - t - il .
Dimanche , en fin d'après - midi , son blog était inaccessible .
" PAS UN EURO PUBLIC N'A ÉTÉ DÉTOURNÉ "
M. Joyandet a été épinglé à deux reprises , ces derniers mois , par Le Canard enchaîné : une première fois en mars pour avoir eu recours à la location d'un avion privé pour 116 500 euros lors d'un déplacement ministériel en Martinique ( Antilles ) , et une autre en juin quand il a été soupçonné d'avoir bénéficié d'un permis de construire illégal pour agrandir la maison qu'il possède près de Saint - Tropez , dans le sud de la France .
" Pas un euro public n'a été détourné pour mon enrichissement personnel ou celui de mes proches " , a souligné M. Joyandet , en se félicitant d'avoir " œuvré pour les pays en voie de développement , le renforcement de nos liens avec l'Afrique et la promotion de la francophonie dans le monde " .

Quelques minutes plus tard , l'Elysée officialisait sa démission et annonçait celle de son collègue au Grand Paris , Christian Blanc .
En juin , ce dernier a été sévèrement critiqué pour avoir acheté pour 12 000 euros de cigares cubains sur des fonds publics .
Selon le ministre de l'éducation Luc Chatel , ce sont Nicolas Sarkozy et François Fillon qui ont demandé aux deux ministres de démissionner .
" Le président de la République et le premier ministre ont décidé de tirer les conséquences d'événements survenus ces derniers jours , que les Français n'ont ni compris ni acceptés .
Après mûre réflexion , ils ont demandé à MM .
Joyandet et Blanc , après avoir échangé avec eux , de démissionner " , a - t - il expliqué , en précisant que cette demande avait été formulée " dimanche " .
Christian Blanc assure lundi , dans un communiqué , avoir présenté sa démission du gouvernement pour " retrouver [ sa ] liberté et faire face à ce qu'[ il ] considère comme un lynchage sans preuve " l'atteignant lui ainsi que le gouvernement .
L'ex - secrétaire d'Etat au Grand Paris indique avoir " demandé au premier ministre de diligenter une enquête de l'Inspection générale de l'administration qui est en cours et qui permettra de mieux cerner les contours de cette ' histoire des cigares ' déclenchée par LeCanard enchaîné et reprise à l'unisson par les médias " .
" J'espère que les mêmes apporteront une force identique à rendre compte de ce que je pense avoir été un guet - apens " , affirme - t - il .
Ces deux départs s'inscrivent dans une série de polémiques autour du train de vie des ministres français et de leur implication présumée dans des affaires politico - judiciaires , qui ne cesse d'enfler depuis plusieurs semaines .
Le ministre du travail , Eric Woerth , fait figure de principal accusé : il est soupçonné de " conflit d'intérêts " pour avoir été ministre du budget ( 2007 à mars 2010 ) à une époque où son épouse gérait une partie de la fortune de l'héritière du géant des cosmétiques L'Oréal , Liliane Bettencourt , soupçonnée de possibles fraudes fiscales .
" LE SYSTÈME SARKOZY EST AUJOURD'HUI CORROMPU "
D'autres membres du gouvernement sont mis en cause pour avoir logé dans des hôtels hors de prix ou faire occuper leur logement de fonction par leur famille .
Ces révélations successives tombent au plus mal pour le président Nicolas Sarkozy , qui avait promis une République exemplaire , et alors que le gouvernement vient d'adopter des mesures de rigueur budgétaire , tout en affrontant l'impopularité de la réforme qui prévoit de repousser l'âge de départ à la retraite à 62 ans ( contre 60 ans actuellement ) .

Mercredi , en recevant les députés de son parti , le chef de l'Etat avait promis de tirer " sévèrement " les conséquences de ces affaires , et annoncé qu'il remanierait son gouvernement en octobre .
Mais le président de la République a été contraint d'agir plus vite que prévu , pour tenter de désamorcer les attaques de l'opposition .
Son ancienne adversaire socialiste à la présidentielle de 2007 , Ségolène Royal , a ainsi jugé que " le système Sarkozy est aujourd ' hui corrompu " , tandis que la dirigeante du Parti socialiste , Martine Aubry , a dénoncé " un entrelacs fâcheux entre le pouvoir politique et les intérêts de l'argent " .
Et selon un sondage Viavoice à paraître lundi dans le quotidien Libération , près de deux Français sur trois ( 64 % ) jugent leurs dirigeants politiques " plutôt corrompus " .

I ’ve always been a lover of cheese … every kind of cheese .
From the stinky stuff in French restaurants to the most mild mozzarella .
I found this recipe recently to make cheese at home and knew I had to try it .
I did n’t even know you could make cheese at home with such simple ingredients .
All you need for this recipe is buttermilk , milk and salt , no chemicals , rennet or anything else .
I used organic whole milk , but you can also make it with 1 % or 2 % .
So easy and amazingly delicious .
To fancy it up , I browned the cheese in a dry non -stick pan and it made a perfect appetizer .
It is also just as yummy eaten plain .
The recipe said salt was an optional item , but I think it is really necessary .
I only added a generous pinch of fleur de sel and it was extremely bland before brining .
It was fine after brining , but the exterior is definitely saltier than the interior when you brine .
The texture is similar to Queso Blanco .
It has a nice bite and mild flavor .
Next time I ’m going to experiment with some smoked sea salt and maybe even herbs .
It was so easy , I see myself making fresh cheese at home on a regular basis .

I have written a lot about the Cash for Clunkers law , and the fact that it was a hit with its beneficiaries because it bought cars that blue - booked for just under $ 1500 for two or three times that amount .
Other studies have shown that the program did abate some CO2 , but at ridiculously high prices per ton .
But I have found a reason to love the Cash for Clunkers program : it is a fabulous demonstration project for just how utterly pointless government stimulus programs can be .
Stimulus programs tend to be hard to evaluate in our complex economy -- sort of like trying to calculate the effect of a butterfly flapping its wings on world climate .
But since cash for clunkers only lasted a few weeks and hit only one industry , we can learn a lot about the effectiveness of government stimulus .
Here is the US Census data for auto dealer sales ( source ) .
Thanks to my friend Scott who first pointed me to the analysis :
The dotted line simply averages the sales for the month of the clunkers program and the month after .
I think it is pretty clear that we spent a few billion dollars making some used car owners happy ( by overpaying for their vehicles ) but did absolutely nothing to move the trend line in auto sales , as the program appears to have just pulled forward purchases rather than stimulated new ones .
Update : Welcome Instapundit readers .
This is all in the family blogging day , as my son just started up his own blog with a post ranking baseball players .
Feel free to give him grief for being a Yankees homer .
In 2003 , when Kobe Bryant was accused of raping a hotel employee–who later refused to testify after her name was dragged through the mud–I first contracted Kobe - Bryant - is - a - Rapist Tourette’s .
The condition consists of blurting out at inopportune times ( such as the current Lakers vs. Celtics NBA championship finals ) and to unsympathetic audiences ( such as the denizens of Los Angeles ) , “ But , um , does it bother you that Kobe probably raped someone ? ”
If you have a similar condition , you will be familiar with the following responses :
( steam - spewing - out - ears ) Who the F**K cares ??
( in a voice of exasperated reason ) Look , Kobe can sleep with whoever he wants .
Why would he need to rape someone ?
Plus she went to his room .
Clearly she wanted to sleep with him .
You know , those girls who want to sleep with celebrities –they ’re not like you or me .
They just want to be close to fame .
If they think they can get famous with a rape allegation , they do it .
I carefully crafted a counter - argument in a Salon.com comment seven years ago :
[ This is a ] sexy fairy - tale portrait of men who are given whatever they want .
…
Athletes who are constantly rewarded for aggressive , hyper - “ masculine ” behavior learn to cultivate and act on violent impulses , and as celebrities they learn that they can act without consequences .
I use a version of this as my retort .
It has never ever convinced anyone .
So I turned to Jaclyn Friedman , co-editor of Yes Means Yes : Visions of Female Sexual Power & A World Without Rape , for talking points , and she gave me a brilliant one :
Ever heard a rape charge against Tom Brady ?
David Ortiz ?
Lance Armstrong ?
Heck , for all the money and bad press Tiger Woods has earned , has anyone ever accused him of rape ?
The truth is , there are hundreds of filthy rich , incredibly famous men , and only a small handful of them have been accused of rape .
If inventing a rape accusation was a great way to get rich , it would be a lot more popular .
Statistically , she ’s on to something .
More than 20 women came forward as mistresses of Tiger Woods , and none accused him of rape .
But Jaclyn–someone with purple - and - gold froth beginning to pool at the corners of their mouth may interject–maybe all these women just were n’t smart enough to realize they could get money and fame from a false rape accusation !
Jaclyn has an answer for that , too :
Actually , that hardly ever works .
Much more often , women who are brave enough to publicly accuse rich and famous men of rape get vilified in the press , have their personal lives exposed and mocked by fans and are disbelieved by police and the courts .
In fact , a study by USA Today in the wake of the Kobe Bryant rape trial found that athletes charged with rape were far less likely to be convicted or even agree to a plea deal than non-athletes .
But Jaclyn … Kobe ’s rich and famous .
He can get laid anytime .
Why would he need to rape anyone ?
The answer is that rapists do n’t rape because they ’re hard up for sex .
They rape because they like raping .
It ’s ugly , but it ’s true .
Even if you ’re rich and famous .
So if you ’re watching the Celtics - Lakers with friends tonight and , like me , you look at Kobe ’s slick moves and think only , “ Man , I would n’t want that guy raping me , ” go with the impulse and ask , “ Um , is n’t Kobe a rapist ? ”
And then–after you get the expected responses–quick , quote Jaclyn Friedman .

All those people who brand Rand Paul a racist and use this clip to prove it are n’t worthy of serious consideration .
It is either ignorance of libertarian philosophy or partisan hackery to claim so .
It is n’t racism to claim that the government has no right to intervene in private businesses to stop discrimination .
As Ezra Klein explains though , it is relevant :
Paul ’s defense of himself is that his take on the Civil Rights
Act has nothing to do with race and so he is not a racist .
But by the same token , the fact that Paul ’s view on the Civil Rights
Act is so dominated by his libertarian ideology that he cannot even admit race and segregation into the calculus is exactly why this is relevant to Paul ’s candidacy , why it ’s an issue and why it ’s among the best evidence we have in understanding how he ’ll vote on legislation that comes before him .
If this is n’t about race , then it is about all questions relating to federal regulation of private enterprise .
As a senator , Paul will be faced with that question frequently .
And his views on it are clearly very , very far from the mainstream .
These libertarian views do reflect accurately an ideology whose language is gaining prominence in the GOP in the form of the Tea Party movement .
This movement in its different incarnations has been around for some time , and emerged as a populist right - wing backlash to John F. Kennedy , to Bill Clinton , and now to Barack Obama .
In each instance , the movement died as soon as it gained a toehold on power as it had no real agreed - upon agenda other than opposition to “ liberalism=socialism=communism . ”
Andrew Sullivan puts his finger on an important aspect of this :
[ T ]he tea -party movement [ is ] un-conservative .
It is dealing with the world as it would like it to be , not as it is .
It has an almost adolescent ideal it cannot compromise .
I think that makes the movement , in its more serious incarnation ( like Paul ) , a useful addition to the public debate , especially in reminding the GOP of some core principles it threw away under Bush and Cheney …
Its bright , fixed glare also helps us illuminate what we believe in – merely by revealing what we no longer believe in .
I agree with Connor Friedsdorf and Andrew Sullivan and Daniel Larison that Rand Paul ’s nomination is a good thing .
Even if he wins the Senate seat , I see this as a good thing .
To have his voice , his ideological clarity , as 1 of 100 would improve the Senate .
The fact that his extremism could lead him to side with the Democrats on some issues ( if he was able to resist the partisan pressures in Washington , which is a big if ) and that his extremism could simultaneously help discredit and marginalize the GOP are both bonuses .
Even without these , I would see his election as a net positive as it would give some measure of power to those people whose inchoate anger has helped form the Tea Party movement and force its members to make hard decisions about what they actually want .
Rand Paul is the rare right - wing politician who does n’t just bad - mouth government but wants to get rid of the Federal Reserve , who opposes the government encroachment represented by the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 as well as the PATRIOT Act and the Affordable Care Act , who opposes Social Security and Medicare as well as any new additions from Obama .
He would never campaign in favor of Medicare while calling Obamacare socialism — he would deride them both as such .
This is why I see Rand Paul as a clarifying figure who can help move our national debate forward — if he remains honest .

The arrests were announced in a news release issued by the office of the United States attorney for New Jersey , Paul J. Fishman , along with the F.B.I. , the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness and the New York Police Department .
The arrests were first reported early Sunday in The Star - Ledger of Newark .
The suspects , both United States citizens , physically conditioned themselves , engaged in paintball and tactical training , saved thousands of dollars for their trip , and acquired military gear and apparel , according to the complaint .
They talked about what they said was their obligation to wage violent jihad , and at times expressed a willingness to commit acts of violence in the United States , the complaint said .

Last Nov. 29 , for example , the complaint said that Mr. Alessa told Mr. Almonte and the undercover officer : “ They only fear you when you have a gun and when you  when you start killing them , and when you  when you take their head , and you go like this , and you behead it on camera . ”
He added : “ We ’ll start doing killing here , if I ca n’t do it over there . ”
Mr. Alessa used the Arabic words for gun and killing , according to the complaint .
The next day , said the complaint , he told the officer : “ I leave this time , God willing , I never come back .
I ’ll never see this crap hole .
Only way I would come back here is if I was in the land of jihad and the leader ordered me to come back here and do something here .
Ah , I love that . ”
The complaint said that more recently , on April 25 , Mr. Almonte said there would soon be United States troops in Somalia  which he called a good development because it would not be as gratifying to kill only Africans .
A law enforcement official said the undercover officer who made the secret recordings was in his 20s and was a five - year police veteran of Egyptian descent .
Denver Zoo is celebrating the birth of four endangered Amur tiger cubs born May 31 in a private maternity den .
The cubs cannot be seen by visitors yet and are being monitored by keepers via a closed - circuit camera .
Zoo veterniarians gave the cubs a clean bill of health at a recent exam .
The quadruplet cubs are the first to be born at Denver Zoo since 2003 .
An announcement will be made when the cubs are big enough to be seen in their zoo habitat .
The four unnamed cubs , two male and two female , were born to mother , Koshka ( Koosh - kuh ) , and father , Waldemere ( Wald - uh - meer ) .
Waldemere was born at Denver Zoo in 2003 , but Koshka was born at the Beardsley Zoo in Bridgeport , Connecticut in 2005 and came to Denver in late 2008 .
The two were paired under recommendation of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums ( AZA ) Species Survival Plan ( SSP ) which ensures healthy populations and genetic diversity among zoo animals .
Fortunately , the couple has proved to be an excellent match .
Amur Tigers are seasonal breeders and in North America generally breed January through June .
After a gestation period of approximately three months , two to four cubs are born in a sheltered den .
They are nursed by their mother , who rarely leaves them .
At about two weeks old their eyes open and their first teeth begin to erupt .
Amur tigers are classified as critically endangered , with an estimated population of less than 400 individuals remaining in the wild .
These animals were once called Siberian tigers because they were found throughout Siberia .
They are now almost completely confined to the Far East portion of Asia along the Amur River and because of this they are now commonly called Amur tigers .
In addition to habitat loss , the biggest threats to these tigers comes from poaching , both for their fur and their other body parts which are used in traditional Chinese medicine .
Amur tigers are the largest member of the cat family .
They can grow to nearly four - feet - tall and more than seven - feet - long .
Koshka is smaller than Waldemere , weighing in at more than 280 pounds during her wellness exam , while Waldemere weighs an estimated 360 pounds .
Amur tigers also have longer hair and more white on their coats than other tigers .
If you sorted an NSMutableArray with a comparison method that randomly returns either higher or lower , would the result be an even , random distribution ?
Spoiler : no it wo n't but the actual distribution is interesting nonetheless .
I 'll show you what would happen if you did sort this way ( and also show you how to correctly randomize an array if you did want an even distribution ) .
Sorting an array
You can sort an NSMutableArray by any logic you want using a comparison method ( implemented on the contained objects ) and invoking sortUsingSelector : on the array .
What would happen if you sorted an array of numbers using the following category method which returned a random result ?
@implementation NSNumber ( RandomComparison ) - ( NSComparisonResult ) randomCompare : ( id ) other { // randomly return either ascending or descending return ( random ( ) % 2 ) ?
NSOrderedAscending : NSOrderedDescending ; } @end
Naively , you might think that the result would be an even , random distribution .
Distribution from a random sort
For an array 20 elements long , sorted using a random comparison , the following is a chart of percentages where the 1st element in the array ended after 1 million runs :
The percentage of times that the original 1st element ended in each position of the final array .
In a proper random distribution , you 'd expect the first element to be equally likely to end up in any position .
In fact a correct result here should be 5.0 % +/- 0.1 % for every column .
The actual result reflects traits of NSMutableArray 's internal sorting ( which I 'm presuming uses a sort similar to the CFQSortArray from CoreFoundation .
The biggest feature of the distribution is a fuction of how quicksort works .
Between 7 and 40 elements ( which this array is ) , NSMutableArray 's sort chooses a single pivot which is most likely to be in the middle of the array .
Elements on either half are sorted with respect to each other before sorting with the whole .
This pivot selection causes the huge difference between the distribution in the top and bottom half since elements compared with other elements on their own side of the pivot more often , they are more likely to remain on that half of the pivot .
Quicksort subdivides the array but for subdivided blocks smaller than 7 elements , the NSMutableArray 's sort algorithm uses a bubble sort instead of quicksort .
Elements 1 to 5 at the far left of the distribution show what happens in this bubble sort case : a bulge in the center of the 1 to 5 range , skewed in the direction of the element 's original position ( i.e. the bulge is lopsided towards 1 ) .
Let 's look at what happens to element 11 :
The percentage of times that the original 11th element ended in each position of the final array .
This is not a simple mirror of the previous results but it again follows the quicksort pattern : results from a random sort are most likely to stay in the partition where they began , with minor perturbations on the fringes due to the bubble sort .
The correct way to randomize in - place
If you 're interested , the correct way to randomize in - place is :
@implementation NSMutableArray ( Randomization ) - ( void ) randomize { NSInteger count = [ self count ] ; for ( NSInteger i = 0 ; i < count - 1 ; i ++ ) { NSInteger swap = random ( ) % ( count - i ) + i ; [ self exchangeObjectAtIndex : swap withObjectAtIndex : i ] ; } } @end
A quick summary of what this does :
conceptually split the array into " used " elements ( in their final positions ) and " unused " elements ( initially , everything is " unused " ) randomly choose an element from the unused elements swap the chosen element with the first element in the unused range this first position in the unused range is now considered used ( i.e. the element is in its final position ) repeat steps 2 to 4 until all elements are in their final positions
This algorithm is the " Fisher–Yates shuffle " and dates to 1938 ( which is an indication of how obvious it is ) .
If you 're truly interested in a perfectly even , random distribution , you may want to use an approach that avoids biases due to modulo ( modulo will round down too often for non-binary divisible numbers ) .
You can see one approach for unbiased rounding in this post by Brent Royal - Gordon on StackOverflow .
Although if you 're really interested in an even distribution , you 'll probably want to use a Mersenne - Twister instead of the C random ( ) function .
The reality is that that code I showed is faster than the other options and easily good enough unless you have a strong mathematical need for accuracy ( in my tests on 1 million samples , it was evenly distributed to 2 significant figures in all cases ) .
Conclusion
A quick post this week .
I was really just goofing around with comparison methods and thought the results were interesting .
In retrospect , its obvious that the results from a sort with a random comparison would be a function of how the sort is performed but I was surprised that the two different kinds of sort ( bubble and quick ) both had a visible influence on the results .
Of course , there are proper ways to randomize arrays and they 're not very difficult — unless you 're really fussy about the quality of your random numbers .
With some 200 yards to go , Paul Petersen had the race won .
He could stride easily to the finish and win the Utah Valley Half - Marathon .
It was a cinch , a sure thing .
He had a safe lead over his closest rival .
All he had to do was pick up the trophy and take a bow .
Then he did something very strange :
He slowed to a jog .
Then he stopped running .
He waited for a competitor to catch up .
He waved him ahead and settled in behind him to take second place .
He handed the win to the guy behind him , Seth Pilkington .
" There was no way I wanted to be on the podium above him , " Petersen said of Pilkington .
" It would n't have been right . "
Sportsmanship and fair play are n't dead after all .
Almost no one witnessed the gesture except the two runners and race officials , and that 's the way Petersen prefers it .
He did n't even want to pose for a photo for this story ; he was embarrassed by the attention .
That 's not why he did what he did .
But who does this ?
Who gives away a win ?
The sports pages are filled with stories of athletes who not only will do anything for victory , including drugs , but they 'll rub their opponents ' faces in it and act badly along the way , too .
As Pilkington and Petersen ran in lockstep the last miles of the half - marathon , having left the rest of the field behind , Petersen turned to Pilkington and told him , " Nice job . "
" You , too , " Pilkington replied .
So much for trash talk .
Mile after mile they ran together until finally it was time to settle the competition .
With about a mile to go , Pilkington made a move and Petersen did n't cover it .
Pilkington gradually opened a 25 - meter lead and was pulling away .
" I was gapped , " says Petersen .
All Pilkington had to do now was navigate the course .
There was one final left turn and a short dash to the finish .
But the turn was n't marked clearly and the race official who was supposed to point runners in the right direction did n't show up at his post on time .
Pilkington ran straight instead of turning left .
Seeing this , Petersen was confused .
He knew there was supposed to be a turn somewhere in the area .
" I was about to miss it , too , " he says .
" I hesitated . "
He saw a volunteer running toward him , gesturing wildly .
" Is this the turn ! ? " Petersen shouted .
The race official said yes .
Petersen slowed down and immediately yelled Pilkington 's name to inform him of his error , but his rival , now some 40 meters away , did n't hear him .
Petersen , who by now had come to a complete stop , called Pilkington 's name again and this time Pilkington looked back .
Petersen allowed Pilkington to return and retake his lead , then jogged in behind him to the finish .
" In my mind , he had won the race , " says Petersen .
" He had broken me .
There was no way I was going to outkick him the last 100 meters .
He did the work to win and he deserved to win , especially since ( the failure to turn ) was n't his fault .
The course was n't marked . "
At the finish line , Pilkington thanked Petersen several times and expressed his appreciation for what he had done .
Later Pilkington would say , " That was a nice thing .
He did n't have to do that .
He could have kept running and not stopped me , and he would have won the race .
I appreciate what he did . "
Petersen and Pilkington had never met .
" I just knew him by reputation , " says Petersen .
Pilkington is a former Roy High School star and a five - time All - American at Weber State .
The Utah Half - Marathon was his first since being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in March .
He has had to adapt to the demands of running with the demands of his disease , with a radically new diet , insulin injections and twice - daily blood tests .
" Carbohydrates make the blood sugar levels go up , so it 's a pretty delicate situation since carbs are important to a runner , " he says .
" I have to figure out carefully what I can eat .
I 've really had to adapt . "
As for Petersen , he is a former Division III All - American from Calvin College in Michigan who moved to Utah in 2001 to complete graduate work in geography at Utah State .
After finishing his schooling , he and his wife decided to remain in Logan , and Petersen has become another force in Utah road races .
The Utah Valley race was not the first time he has seen a runner make a wrong turn .
During a 2007 road race in Logan , he was running a distant second when the leader made a wrong turn .
" He was too far away for me to get his attention , " recalls Petersen .
Petersen figured the leader would rejoin the course by making the turn elsewhere .
When he reached the finish , he was surprised to learn that he was the winner , by four minutes .
" It was an empty win , " says Petersen .
" I wished it could have been different .
What happened in the Utah Valley race was a second chance to make it right . "

For years , Anderson Cooper has been admirably investigating the cult of Scientology .
Scientology is determined to get back at AC for his lack of respect .
Their latest tactic : distributing an entire magazine about AC's " History of Lies . "
Let 's look !
TVNewser says that Scientologists were handing out this 95 - page issue of Freedom magazine in front of CNN's New York offices yesterday .
Cheeky !
And the content is online !
The charges against AC :
He only talked to " Anti-Scientology apostates , " who'd been kicked out for bad things — including sex !
Nobody even watches his stupid show any more ( because it sucks ) .
AC was a prima donna and kept putting ridiculous demands on Scientology , including once canceling and interview due to an " inner ear bug . "
Of gayness ?
Scientologists prove that they saw a Harper 's Index at least once .
Here is a picture of Anderson Cooper dressed up as a Joker ( which is what he is ) .
Anderson Cooper loves terrorists .
" Larry King was the only CNN host qualified to interview the Scientology leader . "
Haha .
CASE CLOSED .

South Africa is currently the eyes of the world .
Everybody is watching and waiting .
Last 2009 , South Africa was organized The Confederations Cup , which is regarded as a dress rehearsal for the 2010 FIFA World Cup , also will be hosted by South Africa – the first World Cup to be held in Africa .
Expectations are high as preparations , theme songs , stadium construction and planning for both tournaments have recently picked up pace .
With soccer fever sweeping through the country , you ’ll find here some recent scenes of South Africans enjoying football as both participants and fans .
Let me bring you to the real life of African people .

Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
|| |( Dagbladet ) : Den svarte økonomien i Norge kan være tre ganger større enn tidligere anslått .
Ingen har oversikt over hvor stor « skyggeøkonomien » i Norge er .
Dette er penger som er blitt tjent på kriminalitet , korrupsjon , svindel og skatteunndragelser .
Tre ganger større Tidligere har man anslått at den svarte økonomien kan være så stor som fem prosent av brutto nasjonalprodukt ( BNP ) .
Dette tilsvarer mer enn 115 milliarder kroner .
Nå kommer det fram at skyggeøkonomien i Norge kan være tre ganger større .
Professor Friedrich Schneider ved Johannes Kepler - universitetet i Linz i Østerrike har gjort en beregning for OECD som viser at den norske skyggeøkonomien tilsvarer 15 prosent av BNP .
Dagbladet har fått hele rapporten til Schneider og sendt den videre til leder for Skattekrim Øst , Jan-Egil Kristiansen .
OVER GJENNOMSNITTET :
Her ser man en graf over de 21 OECD - landene som professor Friedrich Schneider har undersøkt .

• Les hele rapporten her ! ( word -fil )
- Urovekkende - Dette er overraskende og oppsiktsvekkende .
Hvis dette er riktig så er skyggeøkonomien tre ganger så høy som tidligere anslått .
Det er grunn til uro , sier Kristiansen , som i fjor var med i regjeringens skatteunndragelsesutvalg .
Med en BNP på 2 401 milliarder kroner , utgjør dette da mer enn 360 milliarder kroner .
Dette plasserer Norge på 7 . plass blant de 21 OECD - landene .
- Det er oppsiktsvekkende at de skandinaviske landene kommer over gjennomsnittet i oversikten , sier Kristiansen .
Mens Norge har en svart økonomi på 15,4 prosent , har USA en svart økonomi på 7,8 prosent .
Vil senke skattenivået Schneider sier til Dagbladet at dette kan ha sammenheng med de høye skattene og avgiftene .
Dermed er gevinsten for å unndra penger større .
- For å redusere skyggeøkonomien må man deregulere , senke skattenivået og skape initiativer til å jobbe mer i den offisielle økonomien , sier Schneider til Dagbladet .

Rapporten til Schneider viser også at den svarte økonomien øker under nedgangstider .
Mafiaøkonomien - Den ulovelige økonomien , kalt « skyggeøkonomien » eller « mafiaøkonomien » er av enkelte anslått til hele 15 - 20 prosent av verdensøkonomien , sier Kristiansen .
Dette tilsvarer økonomien til Tyskland , Japan og Kina til sammen .
- I Sverige og andre land har man lenge forsket på dette .
I Norge mangler vi helt oversikten og de fleste anslagene spriker mye , sier lederen for Skattekrim Øst .
- Mangler ressurser Kristiansen mener politiet nå må ta tak i de større og mer alvorlige sakene .
- Flere politidistrikt mangler i dag ressurser for å håndtere alvorlig økonomisk kriminalitet og Økokrim tar alt for få saker , sier Kristiansen ,
OVERRASKET : - Dette er overraskende og oppsiktsvekkende .
Hvis dette er riktig så er skyggeøkonomien tre ganger så høy som tidligere anslått , sier direktør i skattekrimenheten i Skatt sør , Jan Egil Kristiansen .

Jo mer penger man unndrar , jo mindre sjanse er det for å bli tatt .
Slik kan det hvert fall virke når man spør Kristiansen .
For en vanlig lønnsmottaker og pensjonist er muligheten for svindel små og risikoen for å bli tatt stor .
For de som bedriver avansert økonomisk kriminalitet er muligheten mange og risikoen for å bli tatt betydelig mindre .
- For å si det enkelt :
Jo større overtredelsen er jo mindre sjanse er det for at man ikke blir tatt , sier Kristiansen .
360 MILLIARDER KRONER : Med en BNP på 2 401 milliarder kroner , utgjør dette da mer enn 360 milliarder kroner .
Dette plasserer Norge på 7 . plass blant de 21 OECD - landene .

Iran ’s educational authorities will send 1,000 religious clerics into schools in Tehran to tamp down Western influence and political opposition , newspapers reported on Sunday .
The newspapers quoted the deputy director of Tehran ’s education department , Mohammad Boniadi , as saying that the clerics would start work at schools in the capital in September to make students “ aware of opposition plots . ”
Mr. Boniadi did not say what grade levels would be affected , but a similar plan was put into place in elementary , middle and high schools immediately after the 1979 revolution .
At that time , thousands of “ morality teachers ” were sent to schools to promote the government ideology .
The latest move appeared to be part of a wider social and cultural crackdown on the country ’s youth .
It is one of several measures the government has taken to expand its influence at schools since last summer when , after a disputed presidential election that the opposition claims was stolen , the Islamic government faced some of the worse protests in three decades .
Engineering and construction giant Bechtel Corp. is expected to disclose Wednesday that it will partner with nuclear vendor Babcock & Wilcox Co. to bring a small , commercial reactor design to market .
Closely held Bechtel declined to reveal its investment in the venture other than to say it is " substantial " and affirms its optimism about prospects for new plant designs that could make nuclear power affordable to smaller utilities and get new plants into operation faster .

When the cameras appeared above the rooftops in the Birmingham suburbs , some people realised they were mostly automatic number plate reading ( ANPR ) cameras , used to track drivers ' movements .
Protesters sprayed the camera posts with messages such as " 1984 Big Brother " and " You are now entering a police state . "
Those suspicious enough to ask what the cameras were for were given the impression they were part of a Home Office initiative to tackle vehicle crime on the Stratford Road corridor , an arterial route into the city .
For the vast majority of people on the bustling streets of Washwood Heath and Sparkbrook , two of the city 's predominantly Muslim areas , the cameras were inconspicuous , melting into pavements filled with fruit stalls and fabric shops .
But an investigation by the Guardian has established that the surveillance cameras are the first of a kind in the UK .
While they may be used for ordinary crime fighting , they were put up to monitor extremists that the police and MI5 know to be living among the city 's Muslim population .
The cameras appeared at 81 sites without consultation , after being requested by West Midlands police counterterrorism unit more than two years ago .
They include around 150 ANPR cameras , 40 of which have been classified as " covert " , and are thought to be concealed in walls and trees by the side of the road .
Birmingham city centre is covered by just 50 ANPR cameras .
Washwood Heath and Sparkbrook have also been given an additional 60 standard CCTV cameras .
A total £ 3 m to pay for the initiative , codenamed Project Champion , was channelled from the Terrorism and Allied Matters ( Tam ) fund , administered by the Association of Chief Police Officers .
The criteria for Tam funds say a police force must prove that a project will " deter or prevent terrorism or help to prosecute those responsible " .
Tam money has previously been released to pay for ANPR camera projects across England and Wales .
But police sources have confirmed that all other ANPR projects to receive the funds monitor " iconic sites " – potential terrorism targets – rather than communities considered to be at risk of extremism .
The cameras form " rings of steel " that ensure no one can enter or leave Washwood Heath or Sparkbrook in a vehicle without being tracked .
Documents reveal that a smaller number of cameras installed in neighbouring wards , such as Kings Heath and Moseley , are designed to cover " rat runs " into Washwood Heath and Sparkbrook .
When the system goes live in the coming weeks , every car journey in the area will be monitored , with data transferred to a database known as BOF2 , located in a building in Stechford .
Details of journeys will be stored for two years at the national ANPR data centre in Hendon , north London .
Project Champion has been developed behind closed doors for more than two years .
It can be traced back to its formal adoption at a meeting of West Midlands police authority in February 2008 , after a subsection of the Local Government Act was invoked to exclude members of the public from discussions .
By then , senior officers at West Midlands police had already been in discussion with national terrorism chiefs about the programme .
The public face of the scheme became the Safer Birmingham Partnership ( SBP ) , a body that bridges the police and the local authority .
It was not until more than a year later , in April 2009 , that some of the councillors in wards where the cameras would appear were briefed at a meeting at police headquarters .
All eight councillors who have cameras in their ward complain they were given insufficient , if any , information .
Councillors present said they were given the impression that the initiative was aimed at combating drug - dealing , antisocial behaviour and crime , and that their areas had been chosen because they had high crime rates .
Terrorism , they say , was mentioned only as an aside , as part of a range of crimes the scheme could address .
One Respect councillor , Mohammed Ishtiaq , said they had been " 100 % misled " about the cameras , and were not told they would appear on side streets .
Tanveer Choudhry , a Liberal Democrat councillor for the Springfield ward , said he received " misleading information " from a council employee .
" We were not told where the cameras would go – the areas – or what they would be used for , " he said .
He added : " I have had a lot of people who are very concerned .
The community feels like it is being victimised .
The message is , if you live in a predominantly Muslim area , you 're a suspected terrorist . "
Other councillors said they only became aware of the scheme when contract workers started digging up the pavement .
They said the cameras threatened the trust between the Muslim community and police .
Briefing documents given to councillors made only fleeting references to counterterrorism , and in parts sought to play down its importance .
The only reference in one four - page document comes in a single paragraph , which states that an added advantage of the cameras is that they will " provide support and reassurance to communities considered to be vulnerable to violent extremism " .
Another document has a sub- heading : " Has this got anything to do with preventing acts of terrorism ? "
It states in response : " This is not the focus of the operation .
The cameras will be used to tackle all types of crime . "
Inspector Kevin Borg , the liaison officer for SBP who briefed locals about the project , said it was regretted that not all councillors were informed , but maintained that some were told last year the cameras would be used for a " whole range " of crime prevention , including counterterrorism .
" It was badged as Home Office money , " he said .
" Terrorism and allied matters was not mentioned at that stage .
I just do n't think it was a detail that needed to be discussed at that stage . "
He said he and the director of the SBP , Jackie Russell , who is in overall charge of the scheme , only discovered themselves that the cameras were installed as part of a counterterrorism initiative less than two months ago .
Russell said that in hindsight there should have been consultation with the public , but denied she had been deliberately misled by the police about the funding arrangement .
" It was n't hidden from me , it was n't something I asked about .
For me it was just Home Office money … I know what I was part of and I was in no way designing to deceive people . "
She and Borg said that while the counterterrorism funding may be a concern to some , most people in Washwood Heath and Sparkbrook would welcome the fact the cameras could also alleviate crime and antisocial behaviour .
Colin Holder , who runs CCTV and ANPR for West Midlands police , said : " I 've always known where the funding has come from .
As far as I am aware , there was no intention to hide that from anyone . "

Solutions !
The general climate of thought online , and in society right now , appears to have shifted from one of denial that anything is wrong , to a general acceptance that almost everything is wrong , endless squabbling over what exactly is wrong … coupled with a helplessness and void of ideas as to what should be done about it .
I call it The Michael Moore Syndrome .
I love watching Michael Moore ’s films , they are often very good at showing things that are wrong .
My trouble always comes with the solution portion of the message he delivers in both film and print .
It is invariably some sort of ‘ Well if we ’d all just vote Democrat then everything would be okay . ’
No … no it wo n’t .
No … no it is n’t .
A comment I get a lot of the time on my writing is “ Well , fine !
So what ?!
What do you propose we DO about it ? ”
And I agree , I often suffer from Michael Moore Syndrome , and spend too much time complaining about what should n’t be done , and not enough time focusing on what should .
So that ’s what I ’d like to do today .
I ’d like you to join in the discussion in the comments section .
I ’d like us to put aside our endless squabbling about the way things should n’t be , and toss around some positive , possible , actual … solutions .
Idealistic ?
Absolutely .
What exactly is wrong with ideals and the pursuit of them ?
That , should be our constant and only goal as a society .
Finding and identifying problems , and then working to solve them .
It ’s this ‘ well that ’s the way things are ’ attitude that is cancerous .
We spend so much time bickering over the classification and identification of details of the problem , and so little time solving anything as they all get much much worse .
SOLUTION THE FIRST :
We need a new , modern , political ideology .
Right now , members on all sides of the ‘ spectrum ’ are screaming and pointing fingers at the other side , but the reality is , they are all wrong and their outdated philosophies are crumbling .
Does Communism work !?
No .
It ’s too oppressive , gives too much power to the state , and strips the individual of vital freedoms .
Just ask China , North Korea and the former U.S.S.R .
It does n’t work .
Does Capitalism work !?
No .
It puts the pursuit of personal wealth above anything and anyone else .
It allows corporations and wealthy interests to control and dictate as they please , with disastrous results .
Humanity , morality , civility , are all cast aside under the pretense of ‘ well , we ’re just making money . ’
Just making money … is n’t a good enough excuse for pure , unadulterated evil .
Just ask our friends , the good ol ’ US of A .
It does n’t work .
Does Socialism work !?
No .
It tries to mash the two extremes together and you end up with citizens overly taxed , corruption , waste and an unsustainable economic model .
Just ask Greece , the UK and the EU .
It does n’t work .
All of these criticisms are valid .
So … do we keep sliding around on the same spectrum hoping for different results or do we realize that there are limitless possibilities outside of the spectrum !
How about that ?
Forget left , forget right , forget the middle .
Let ’s put an entire generation to work , inventing a new spectrum .
This can only be accomplished with an acknowledgement that the existing one is broken , which at this rate , seems to be an unavoidable certainty .
My first solution is broad , but highly necessary .
We need to get talking about fresh , innovative , models of governance and living .
Maybe these talks could occur on the subway and bus instead of staring at the floor and pretending to read the same advertisements over and over again .
Maybe they could happen in schools , actually engaging students in real problem solving .
In the lunchrooms where you work .
At all ?
SOLUTION THE SECOND :
The role of the politician , the lawmaker , the ruling class , has to change .
Democratic elections are only democratic when the choices on the ballot represent the best interests of the people .
Let ’s not kid ourselves , that time is long gone , if it was ever there to begin with .
The modern politician is a pacifist , a distractor , a performer , not a leader .
Democrat or Republican .
Conservative or Liberal .
Labour or Tory . ( See Solution The First ) .
We do n’t need our leaders running in a non stop popularity contest .
This is n’t a beauty pageant .
We also do n’t need the other end of the spectrum , a dictatorial iron fist of fascism that does n’t care what the people think and does as it pleases .
We need a group of the most intelligent , qualified individuals assessing our issues , and proposing and implementing intelligent solutions .
We need to apply scientific principles to our governance .
We need scientific leaders .
They might be awkward .
They might be silly looking .
They might not have such nice smiles and well delivered zingers .
They might also actually dedicate themselves to the constant improvement of society , instead of ‘ building an image ’ .
A staggering majority of the worlds ’ most intelligent human beings are currently using their knowledge and understanding working on designing ways of making money .
Solving problems for the marketplace .
Unleash these minds on tackling poverty , oppression , homelessness , ending wars , raising standards of living .
Rather than developing algorithms for squeezing currency out of people , how about they follow their natural , intuitive , scientific inclinations … identifying problems , and solving them .
Ask anyone working in science what they could accomplish if not held back by the constraints of currency and politics .
Then watch their eyes light up .
Look at what just one of these minds can envision and design – Imagine all of them , working together , with all of us , supporting them , benefitting from the non -stop progress .
We would n’t have time to bicker about race , religion , or American Idol .
There ’d be too many positive things to accomplish .
SOLUTION THE THIRD :
The individual must refuse to participate in the oppression and systematic destruction of their fellow man .
“ I ’m just doing my job ” is n’t a valid excuse any more than “ I ’m just making money ” is .
It ’s a weak , cop-out , and a refusal to think for yourself , burying your morals and conscience .
You cease to be a human the second you knowingly and willingly partake in this kind of behavior .
Comedian Patrice O’Neal expresses this brilliantly in his recent guest spot on Infowars.com .
Rather than preach the same boring , tired , conspiracy theories we ’ve all heard a million times , Patrice instead tackles an issue we can all do something about , every day … no small powerful group of people has any power , without the average person willing to blindly carry out their orders .
“ If we go down , we did it , not them …
Because of so many nobodies , willing to destroy another man . ”
We ca n’t continue to tolerate indifferent and callous behavior .
In my short lifetime I have seen such a drastic shift in the amount of nonsense people will not only put up with , but engage in .
There ’s a very good reason that zombie movies are so popular right now .
The conditioning has reached such a point , that the initial response to telling someone that you have been wronged , is for them to not only disbelieve you , and downplay your grief , but to suggest that it is your fault and you brought it on yourself .
The individual has the ability to make choices .
To assess and examine individual circumstances .
The individual ceases to be an individual , the second they suppress or deny that ability .
( I could probably keep this going forever , but it ’s just a blog , so I ’m going to cut it short and allow you to weigh in with your own solutions in the comments .
Let ’s get innovative and try to come up with some new and unique ideas ! )

Recently , I was talking to my parents .
They ’re wanting to go see Italy , but they ’re also not wanting to make a long trans -Atlantic flight .
Like I told them , they ’ll be inside the plane , not outside , so it wo n’t be bad .
Just ask the unnamed 20 - year - old stowaway who rode on an Emirates flight from Vienna , Austria to London , England by hanging onto the plane ’s landing gear .
Oh yeah , did I also mention he was blind ?
Yeah , there ’s that .
When the plane landed at London ’s Heathrow Airport , workers were stunned when a guy was found clinging tenaciously like a lost kitty to the airplane ’s landing gear .
He survived a 75o - mile trip on the outside of a plane , and the only reason he did make it ( hypothermia aside ) was because of dumb luck : the empty plane had to fly lower than normal to avoid some bad storms .
If the plane had flew at a normal altitude , this guy would be a mansicle .

The scientists first equipped a beach buggy with non visual aids
US Scientists and the National Federation of the Blind are developing a car for the blind and will present a prototype next year .
The vehicle will be fitted with technology that allows a blind person to drive independently , the NFB and Virginia Tech University said .
Non-visual aids include sensors indicating turns in the road via vibrating gloves .
Puffs of compressed air on the face will alert the driver to obstacles .
Other aids to be fitted include a vibrating vest to give feedback on speed and a steering wheel with audio cues and spoken commands indicating the car 's direction .
Exploration
Last year Virginia
Tech turned a beach buggy into an experimental vehicle for blind drivers .
They used sensor lasers and cameras to act as the eyes of the buggy .
We 're moving away from the theory that blindness ends the capacity of human beings to make contributions to society Marc Maurer , NFB president
The model to be presented next year will be a modified Ford Escape sport utility vehicle , the NFB announced .
" We 're exploring areas that have previously been regarded as unexplorable , " said NFB president Marc Maurer .
He added that projects like this car was changing people 's perception of the blind .
" We 're moving away " from the theory that blindness ends the capacity of human beings to make contributions to society " .
Mr Maurer said he started talking about a car for blind drivers ten years ago .
" Some people thought I was crazy , " he said .
The prototype is expected be be publicly tested by a blind driver on the Daytona race track in Florida next January .
Former prime minister Tony Blair has been named as the 2010 winner of US award the Liberty Medal for his “ commitment to conflict resolution ” , his office said Thursday .
The National Constitution Center , which awards the medal , praised Blair for his efforts as prime minister from 1997 to 2007 in Northern Ireland and Kosovo , and for continuing his work as a Middle East envoy since leaving office .

The ex-premier takes his place alongside a host of well - known figures who have previously won the prize , including former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and ex-UN secretary general Kofi Annan .
“ The National Constitution Center announced today that Tony Blair will receive the 2010 Liberty Medal in recognition of his steadfast commitment to conflict resolution , ” said a statement on the website of Blair ’s office .
The former premier said he would give the 70,000 - pound prize money to two of his charities .
“ I am deeply indebted to the National Constitution Center for adding my name to such a distinguished list of recipients , ” said Blair .
Former US president Bill Clinton , who is chair of the center , will award Blair the medal at a ceremony on September 13 at the center in Philadelphia .

“ It was a privilege to work with my friend Tony Blair to help end 30 years of sectarian violence and broker a lasting peace in Northern Ireland , ” said Clinton .
He added the pair also worked together “ to stop the killing in and mass exodus from Kosovo , and to develop policies that would improve living conditions for people in both our countries . ”
But Blair remains a hugely divisive figure in his homeland , and the announcement of the award was met with scepticism from British commentators .

“ Blair ’s peace efforts in the Middle East presumably do n’t encompass his support for the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 , ” said the Guardian .
The Liberty Medal is awarded to people in recognition of their work for bringing about peace and was founded in 1988 to commemorate 200 years of the United States constitution .

Goldman Sachs has agreed to pay $ 550 million to settle the SEC 's civil fraud lawsuit against it .
The SEC is touting the sum as the “ largest - ever penalty paid by a Wall Street firm , ” but how much does the settlement actually hurt Goldman ?
We looked a up few numbers to put things into perspective :
It ’s about eight times what the head honcho has taken home in a year .
In 2007 , Goldman did the deal at the center of the SEC 's suit , CEO Lloyd Blankfein took home $ 68 million in salary and bonus .
It ’s just a touch less than a Goldman charitable donation .
In November 2009 , after criticism of big bonuses at Goldman , the firm pledged $ 500 million to help small business owners .
It 's less then a tenth of the gain Goldman 's stock had today .
Goldman ’s stock took a hit when the SEC announced its lawsuit in April , but since word of the settlement first started circulating today , it ’s added back $ 7.9 billion dollars to its market cap .
It ’s about two weeks ’ worth of profit .
Goldman reported ( PDF ) earning $ 3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2010 .
That ’s about $ 250 million in profit per week .
It ’s a sum that Goldman could pay immediately ( and probably hundreds of times over ) .
The company ’s average global core excess liquidity — the average worth of assets it could readily convert into cash — was $ 162 billion for the first quarter of 2010 .
It ’s a fair amount more than what Goldman made on the deal the SEC sued over .
Goldman reportedly made $ 15 million in fees from the CDO deal that landed Goldman in hot water .
But keep in mind : Goldman did 25 of these so - called Abacus deals in all , and created many more CDOs without the Abacus label .
Of the $ 550 million , the U.S. Treasury will get $ 300 million , and investors who lost out on this Abacus deal will get $ 250 million .
Meanwhile , Goldman has neither admitted nor denied the SEC ’s fraud allegations , although Goldman did acknowledge that its marketing deals “ contained incomplete information . "
Harvey Pitt , former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , told me the SEC ’s extraction of this acknowledgement from Goldman was itself “ highly unusual . ”
He called the settlement " a major victory for the SEC . ”
Here ’s the statement from Goldman :
In particular , it was a mistake for the Goldman marketing materials to state that the reference portfolio was ‘ selected by ’ ACA Management LLC without disclosing the role of Paulson & Co. Inc. in the portfolio selection process and that Paulson ’s economic interests were adverse to CDO investors .
Goldman regrets that the marketing materials did not contain that disclosure .
The terms of the settlement still need to be approved by a federal judge .
The SEC 's lawsuit against Goldman employee Fabrice Tourre will continue .
As we ’ve pointed out , other major banks did deals similar to Goldman ’s , and it remains to be seen whether the disclosures in their marketing documents will be sufficient .
More on that , I ’m sure , to come .

Homeland Security Mission Creep : The Drug War
In recent columns , I ’ve been discussing the way that the national security state , given an almighty big hammer in the name of “ fighting terrorism , ” is finding nails all over the place .
Suppressing the anti-globalization movement , fighting the Drug War , and fighting “ intellectual property crime ” all fall under the post - 9/11 security state ’s expansive reading of its counter - terror mission .
Specifically , I ’ve recently been examining the work of retired USAF Colonel Jennifer Hesterman , a national security scholar whose body of research covers the very broad area where counter - terrorism meets all those other missions .
Her monograph “ Transnational Crime and the Criminal - Terrorist Nexus ” ( Maxwell AFB , Alabama : Air University Press , 2005 ) devotes considerable space to the international drug trade as a support for international terrorism .
She notes : “ The once - clear lines between the international drug trade , terrorism , and organized crime are now blurring , crossing , and mutating as never before . ”
Laundered money from narco - trafficking is a source of funds for terrorists .
Col .
Hesterman gets the causality pretty much backward on all this .
The black market for drugs is a lucrative source of money because , and only because , drugs are illegal .
Repeat after me : the narco - traffickers are the world ’s biggest supporters of the drug war — just as Al Capone was Prohibition ’s number one fan .
You can bet that one of the biggest sources of campaign funding for any hardline Drug Warrior politician is laundered drug money .
The drug trade is a source of funds for terrorism because of black market prices .
If you could buy marijuana , coca , opium and their derivatives in any store for a nickel on the dollar of their current price , that international black market money would dry up overnight .
The primary effect of drug prohibition is to turn the country over to organized crime gangs fighting to control the illegal drug trade , just as Prohibition did ninety years ago .
What ’s more , drug prohibtion has had the effect of turning police forces into just another criminal gang fighting to control the black market money .
As Willie Nelson says , he gets his best weed from his cop friends .
All kidding aside , the domestic Drug War machine is one of the most powerful criminal gangs in the United States — an Evil Empire built on civil asset forfeiture , no - knock raids on non-violent offenders , coerced testimony from jailhouse snitches , warrants obtained by perjury , planted evidence , entrapment , and all the rest of it .
Police forces have been militarized and the Fourth , Fifth and Sixth Amendments turned into toilet paper .
Internationally , the biggest narco - trafficking operation of them all is the one involved in funding the U.S. government ’s Black Ops around the world .
Drug money does , indeed , fund terrorism .
Gangsters like the CIA and Ollie North depend on it for funds to support terrorists from the Khmer Rouge and the Contras to the Kossovar Liberation Army ( as Gary Webb demonstrated pretty effectively in regard to the Contras in particular ) .
So while lower and mid-level policy analysts ( including , with all due respect , Col. Hesterman ) may want to win the Drug War , and useful idiots like Bill Bennett may spout its propaganda , the Big Dawgs at the top most decidedly do n’t want it ever to come to a victorious conclusion .
The big drug cartels , the international terrorist movements , and the American national security state — like the three superpowers in “ 1984 ” — prop each other up .
Orwell used the image of three sheafs of corn leaning against each other .
And that ’s precisely why the drug trade will never be stamped out .
The drug cartels are n’t the enemy of the state , any more than the neighboring farmers were the enemies of the pigs at Animal Farm .
The drug cartels and the state prop each other up .
The enemy is you .
Especially since the recession hit , the media 's been referring to trades like construction as " traditionally male fields . "
So what happens when you 're the woman on the job site ?
Advertisement
In the past couple of years , the narrative of the he-cession has run thus : sectors like manufacturing and construction are losing jobs , screwing over a lot of working - class men who may not have college educations .
Even Levi Johnston fits into this trend — writes Jessica Grose , " Like many working - class men , Levi lost his macho job during the recession . "
But to women like Sharon Darling , a male - dominated job is n't necessarily " macho . "
Advertisement
Interviewed in the Times , Darling decided to become an electrician " because I loved the math theory that you have to use : math , physics , science , everything .
This is the best trade as far as using your brain goes . "
Of working on all - male construction sites , she says , " The first day was scary .
Everybody is looking at you because you 're the only girl . "
And while she 's gotten more comfortable , she still deals with prejudice :
When you 're on a big job , you 've got carpenters and roofers and plumbers .
There can be a thousand men .
And you know the stereotypes men have :
They think I should be home having babies , or doing hair or nails , girly stuff .
Now that construction and other male - dominated fields are struggling , it 's possible that women like Darling will have an even harder time .
Those who see the recession as taking jobs away from men may be even more hostile to women trying to enter their trade .
This is a potential unintended consequence of " mancession " rhetoric — it devalues the experiences of women in what are seen as " macho " fields .
This is just another reason we should remember that the recession affects everyone — and that you do n't have to be a dude to put on a hard hat .

Where Few Women Go : A Building Site [ NYT ]
Levi Johnston And The Problems Of The Working - Class Man [ Slate ]
In the middle of June , Oracle released the NetBeans IDE 6.9 update providing new features for the IDE .
At the time of the release , Oracle did not immediately respond to questions from InternetNews.com about the future of NetBeans .
Many in the Java community have since speculated about whether NetBeans should be folded into Eclipse .
Mike Milinkovich , executive director of the Eclipse Foundation , went so far as to tell InternetNews.com that in his view having NetBeans and Eclipse competing with each other in offering free IDEs for Java developers is not helping Java any longer .
As it turns out , Oracle intends on continuing to support both Eclipse and NetBeans .
" Both products are being actively developed and are both part of Oracle 's Developer Tools strategy , " an Oracle spokesperson told InternetNews.com .
For Eclipse , one of the key Oracle technologies is the Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse which is a free set of plug-ins for Eclipse IDE users .
The spokesperson explained that the Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse is specifically aimed at supporting developers building applications on the Oracle stack .
The Oracle stack includes products such as Oracle Database , Oracle Coherence , and Oracle WebLogic Server .
Since the launch of the original iPhone , Apple has made efforts to hide some of the actual tech specs of the device from consumers .
Apple has never advertised or even published the processor speed or amount of RAM found in the iPhone .
Arguably , Apple is trying to shield customers from these technical distractions and instead trying to focus on overall functionality .
More technically inclined customers , however , still love to know what they have to work with .
The original iPhone and iPhone 3G contained 128MB of RAM , while the iPhone 3GS was boosted to 256MB of RAM .
Similarly , the iPad contains 256MB of RAM .
This discrepancy offers a technical explanation why Apple is not supporting iOS 4 features such as multi-tasking on the original and 3G iPhone -- there simply is n't enough RAM .
We have since heard that the upcoming iPhone 4's RAM has again been upgraded .
This will bring it to a total of 512MB of RAM , twice as much as the 3GS and iPad .
This number actually contradicts tear down photos of a prototype iPhone 4 that was leaked to the internet .
An analysis of that prototype device showed it only carried 256MB of RAM .
The 512MB figure , however , does agree with a Digitimes report from May 17th that confirmed a 960x640 screen resolution , thinner display , and indeed 512 MB of RAM .
We had heard that Apple confirmed this 512MB figure during one of the WWDC sessions last week , and have now verified this .
The session it was revealed in is now available ( Session 147 , Advanced Performance Optimization on iPhone OS , pt 2 ) for registered Apple developers .
The added RAM should help overall performance and multi-tasking on the new iPhone 4 .
It could also explain why the iMovie App that Apple introduced at WWDC will only run on the iPhone 4 .
Apple has said iMovie will only run on the iPhone 4 and not the 3GS or even the iPad .
It seems conceivable that it actually makes use of the extra RAM offered by the iPhone 4 .
Between 1953 and 1978 , she had only four one - woman shows .
Instead she began to lecture at American universities , including Columbia and Yale , talking publicly for the first time about her family background and the motivations behind her work .
" For me , " Louise Bourgeois declared , " sculpture is the body .
My body is my sculpture . "
But her surrealistic works were far removed from the ideal proportions of classical sculpture .
Indeed , they seemed calculated to provoke distaste , and an almost uncomfortable degree of emotional involvement on the part of the viewer .

In addition to hating Americans for their bicameral legislature , would n’t this kind of thing really get your juices flowing ?

The last part is the best . )
This post is not a critique of Paul Krugman 's critique of Scott Sumner ( though that 's what got me thinking along these lines ) .
It 's a critique of all of us , especially all of who use New Keynesian models ( which includes me ) .
Framing matters .
Tinkerbell is real and all - pervasive .
She flies in New Keynesian models all the time .
A . In the IS curve in old Keynesian models , a fall in the real rate of interest causes an increase in demand .
B . In the IS curve in New Keynesian models , a fall in the real rate of interest causes an increase in current demand , relative to planned future demand .
C. In the IS curve in New Keynesian models , a fall in the real rate of interest causes a decrease in planned future demand , relative to current demand .
A and B sound very similar .
It 's just that B adds an extra variable ( planned future demand ) that can shift the IS curve .
An increase in planned future demand will shift the IS curve to the right .
That sounds quite plausible from an Old Keynesian perspective anyway .
If planned future demand increases , expected future incomes should increase too , and so people will want to consume more today , and firms will want to invest more today .
So B makes the New Keynesian IS curve sound very similar to the Old Keynesian IS curve .
It is n't .
They are very different .
C sounds totally different from B .
But it 's not .
C and B are logically equivalent .
They are just different ways of describing the same Euler equation that underlies the New Keynesian IS curve .
C is a way of describing the New Keynesian IS curve that forces you to realise that it is very different from the Old Keynesian IS curve .
Suppose the central bank cuts the real interest rate one morning .
What happens ?
B leads you to think that current demand will increase .
C leads you to think that planned future demand will decrease .
It 's all in the framing .
Framing matters .
And do n't think it does n't matter in the real world economy too .
Take the simplest possible New Keynesian model .
Consumption is the only source of demand ( ignore investment , government , and net exports ) .
So income = output = desired consumption in equilibrium .
The consumption - Euler equation determines the ratio of current desired consumption to planned future desired consumption as a negative function of the real rate of interest .
The central bank sets the real rate of interest .
Suppose that , due to past monetary mismanagement , the economy is currently in recession , and is expected to be in recession next period as well .
What should the central bank do ?
In an Old Keynesian model , the answer is simple .
Cut the real interest rate , so consumption demand increases , and the economy moves down along the IS curve till it gets to " full employment " ( or whatever the central banker thinks is full employment , the natural rate , the NAIRU , or whatever ) .
In a New Keynesian model , the answer is not simple .
In fact , there is n't a well - defined answer to this question .
A cut in the real interest rate might cause an increased level of consumption today , and no change in planned future consumption .
That will help the economy escape the recession .
But it might also cause a cut in planned future consumption , with no change in consumption today .
That will not help the economy escape the recession .
It does n't help to assume the cut in the real interest rate is expected to be permanent .
A permanent 1 % cut in the interest rate might just cause people to decrease planned future consumption by ( say ) 2 % every year from the year before , so that planned consumption asymptotically approaches zero .
That will simply cause people to expect the economy to slide progressively deeper into recession .
There is only one time - path of real interest rates that is compatible with a 100 % full employment time - path in a new Keynesian model .
But that exact same time - path of real interest rates is also compatible with a time - path where output is only 90 % of full employment , or 80 % , or 70 % , or any time - path of output whatsoever , as long as the ratios between one year 's output and the next year 's output are the same as in the 100 % path .
How do New Keynesian macroeconomists avoid the problems posed by this question ?
They avoid asking the question .
They simply assume that at some time in the future the economy will be at full employment , where output is determined by the supply - side , and that people 's currently planned future consumption for that date equals full employment output .
With current plans for future consumption pinned down exogenously at some future time , they can solve the model backwards to find the path of real interest rates that will keep the economy at full employment up till that time .
What would an Old Keynesian have said , if he had heard of such a model back in the 1950's , 60's , or even early 70's ?
" You are assuming ( future ) full employment ! " is what he would have said : exactly the same accusation ( except for the added word " future " ) that demolished many a classical economist 's model in the Keynesian heyday .
My imaginary Old Keynesian critic would be right to make this accusation .
At least the Old Keynesians , and the Classical economists , had a mechanism whereby price flexibility , and the real balance effects - M/P rising and the LM moving right along the IS curve - might get the economy to full employment .
New Keynesians have no such mechanism .
They just assume people expect future full employment , with no justification whatsoever for that assumption .
How can we possibly assume that people 's 2010 plans for consumption in 2020 ( or whenever ) are based on their knowledge that the economy will be at full employment in 2020 ?
When the model itself has no mechanism for ensuring that the economy will tend towards full employment , even with a good central banker ?
What would it take to get to full employment in a New Keynesian model ?
A good central banker , setting the right real interest rate .
Plus Tinkerbell .
Tinkerbell makes sure that when the central banker cuts the real interest rate , people do n't cut their planned future consumption ; instead they increase their planned current consumption .
Tinkerbell tells each of us that the cut in the real interest rate will cause everyone else to increase their planned current consumption , so that our current income will increase , so that we will be able to afford to consume more now , without having to cut planned future consumption .
If Tinkerbell were mischievous , she would instead tell each of us that the cut in interest rates would cause everyone else to keep their current consumption constant , and reduce their planned future consumption , so our future income will fall .
The fall in our expected future income , plus the cut in the real interest rate , means that we will choose to do exactly what a mischievous Tinkerbell tells us that everyone else will do .
In other words , monetary policy will work if Tinkerbell tells us it will work , and we believe her ; and wo n't work if Tinkerbell tells us it wo n't work , and we believe her .
And this has nothing to do with nominal interest rates being at the zero lower bound , because I have assumed that the central bank can cut real interest rates .
Monetary policy , in a New Keynesian model is always a Tinkerbell effect .
It all depends on the framing .
Does the cut in the real interest rate increase current demand ( relative of course to planned future demand ) ?
Or does the cut in the real interest rate decrease planned future demand ( relative of course to current demand ) ?
Tinkerbell just knows how to frame it the right way to get the desired result .
Fiscal policy is also a Tinkerbell effect in New Keynesian models .
D. In the IS curve of an Old Keynesian model , a temporary increase in government spending causes an increase in demand , for a given real rate of interest .
E . In the IS curve of a New Keynesian model , a temporary increase in government spending causes an increase in current demand relative to planned future demand , for a given real rate of interest .
F . In the IS curve of a New Keynesian model , a temporary increase in government spending causes a decrease in planned future demand relative to current demand , for a given real interest rate .
E and F are logically equivalent , but framed differently .
There 's presumably no need for me to repeat the rest of the argument .
( Tinkerbell and framing aside , this reveals another critique of our thinking about monetary policy as setting interest rates .
Why did we ever think that cutting real interest rates would increase demand permanently , as Old Keynesian models suggest ?
Cutting real interest rates merely shifts demand towards the present , and away from the future .
That wo n't work if both present and future demand are too low .
Maybe monetary policy is about the supply and demand for money ? )
The State Opposition Leader Eric Ripper says Western Australians are set to be hit with steep increases in water prices for the third year in a row .
Mr Ripper says the government 's budget estimate papers show water prices are set to rise by more than eight per cent next year .
He says the hike will mean water prices will have increased by more than 40 per cent , or $ 160 a year for the average household in three years .
" Of course in a dry climate there is pressure on water prices and I think extravagant users of water should pay the price , but water is also a basic utility for every family and there should be protection for that basic amount of water that everyone needs to use , " he said .

Moscow , Russia ( CNN ) --
Hazardous conditions inside Russia 's largest coal mine forced officials to suspend efforts Sunday to rescue dozens of workers trapped inside after a pair of explosions , the country 's Ministry for Emergency Situations said .
The explosions killed 12 people and wounded 41 others , the country 's Prosecutor General 's Office said .
An additional 64 miners were trapped underground , as well as 19 rescuers who went to retrieve them .
Rescue operations were suspended Sunday because of limited visibility , the ministry said .
Three hundred and fifty nine people were working in the mine , near the western Siberian town of Mezhdurechensk , when a gas explosion occurred around 8:55 p.m. Saturday local time ( 12:55 p.m. ET ) .
More than 50 rescue workers descended into the mine to recover the victims when a second gas explosion occurred about four - and - a - half hours later -- at 1:25 a.m. Sunday ( 5:25 p.m. Saturday ET ) , officials said .
As a result , 19 rescue workers remained trapped in the mine .
Earlier Sunday , local officials blamed the accident on a partial rock collapse inside the mine .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev pledged federal aid in responding to the disaster .
Mezhdurechensk is more than 2,300 miles east of Moscow .
" By all accounts , the situation is hard , very hard at the Raspadskaya mine .
I would say , it is tragic , " said Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
" The worst thing is that we can't send additional rescue forces to the mine in the absence of air ventilation .
But we can't sit back and hope the situation will improve on its own .
We must make maximum effort and do all we can to save the people . "
You want to start doing art and design work on your computer , but what are the tools you need ?
We got professional Hollywood concept artists to tell us - and their answers wo n't drain your wallet too much .

Art by Craig Shoji
Concept artists are the people who spend months or even years designing the look and feel of a movie , television show , or videogame before it ever starts being filmed .
They are visual scriptwriters , telling a story in images so that special effects designers and prop makers have something to work from in order to make stories come alive .
And concept artists are also that most miraculous of creatures : People who get paid to make art .
Advertisement
So what does a concept artist need in order to build an alien city , or design the robots in a Transformers movie ?
We asked the artists .
Art by Ryan Church
1. Wacom tablet
Though concept designers use all kinds of computers and software , they all seem to agree on one thing : the Wacom tablet is the industry standard .
Advertisement
Warren Manser , who worked on Serenity , Speed Racer , and the upcoming Transformers 3 , says he still uses a really old Wacom that he 's taken everywhere :
I 've seen people use antiquated equipment and get great results based on talent and hard work .
Less than a year ago , my old G5 was still my back up computer .
I even have a really old Wacom tablet that I use in a pinch , once to a newbie 's amazement : " What kind of tablet is that dude ?
How old is that ? "
It has traveled across the country on location and is held together with one screw , but it still works .
Display size is the one area where I find it hard to compromise .
I have to see as much of the image as possible while I work , so I run two monitors .
Advertisement
But Dawn Brown , who worked on Transformers and The Last Airbender , says it 's important to remember that technique matters more than tools :
Most of us work on Macs with Wacom tablets .
I work with a Cintiq . . . [ but ] the end result of a concept artist 's job is an illustration that clearly communicates an idea . . . what separates a concept artist from a pixel monkey is a strong imagination , a creative way of clearly developing and communicating ideas .
Advertisement
Daphne Yap , who worked on Avatar and Alice in Wonderland , says Wacoms are the digital artist 's version of paper :
I 'm old fashioned , I still use pencil , paper , and its digital cousin Cintiq .
As long as you can convey an idea in some manner , I reckon you 're alright .

A medium Wacom Intuos tablet sells for $ 349 .
Or you can go high - end with a Wacom Cintiq , which range in price from $ 999 to $ 1999 .

2. Pencil and paper
Yap calls the Wacom the " digital cousin " of pencil and paper , but she and almost every concept artist we talked to said there is nothing more important for the artist than pen and paper .
Manser says :
Some people , including myself , actually sometimes draw with paper and pencil .
Barbaric , I know , but a solid art foundation makes for original digital art that is not propped up by software alone .
Advertisement
Craig Shoji , who is working on the upcoming movies Thor and Men in Black III , says :
To visualize an idea all you need is a pen( cil ) and paper .
Hell , maybe even soy sauce and napkin ( like David Choe does ) .
You can train yourself to generate , and work out some great ideas with just a few key tools .
When I 'm not on a computer I carry a ballpoint pen , a small sketch pad and a light and medium value marker with me .
Advertisement
And Wayne Barlowe ( Harry Potter , Hellboy , and the upcoming Hobbit movie ) is emphatic on this point :
The cheapest toolset imaginable is a pad and pencil .
Which I use all the time .
I am very retro in my methodology , relying on carbon or lead pencils , ballpoints and ( gasp ) actual paper .
Oh , and do n't forget the erasers !
Sometimes , I import my drawings into Painter on my Mac and work up color treatments .
But to me , nailing a good design without color is preferable .

3. Photoshop and other drawing programs
You do n't need anything more fancy than Photoshop to get started with concept art .
That is the one piece of software that everyone seems to agree on .
Advertisement
David Meng ( Chronicles of Narnia , District 9 ) says the only thing more important than pen and paper is Photoshop :
I do n't like to think that any tool kit is needed for concept art beyond a pencil and a pad of paper , but you are definitely at a disadvantage if you do n't use some form of digital imaging software .
If everyone else is doing full color digital work ( and they are ) , then black and white sketches can be like bringing a sword to a gun fight .
At that point , programs such as Photoshop or Painter are the kind of things needed to produce color work fast enough to meet the demands of modern filmmaking .
Advertisement
Manser adds , " Photoshop is the one necessary program for digital concept art .
A second hand computer will run it pretty well to get you started . "
Miles Teves ( Iron Man , the upcoming Pirates of the Carribean ) says , " Photoshop is just the most basic tool , many use Painter as well . "
And Shoji confirms , " From a film production standpoint , Photoshop is a must .
It 's one of the fastest tools to use in visualizing an idea as well as be able to change that idea on the fly . . .
If you 're a creature or character guy then I 'd recommend ZBrush for digital modeling . "

Adobe Photoshop ranges in price from $ 99 ( for Elements ) to $ 999 ( for CS5 Extended ) .
Corel Painter 11 is currently $ 279 .
Pixologic Z - Brush 3.5 is $ 595

4. 3D software ( this is where it gets expensive )
Manser thinks 3D will eventually become the standard in concept art , but for now " is still comparatively slow for generating multiple concepts quickly . "
Shoji agrees and says :
It 's also really helpful to learn a 3D package for modeling .
If you 're going to design a room , for example , it 's nice to quickly block in the layout to get your perspective , camera lens , and eye level established .
And from there you can paint over it .
Advertisement
Sketchup is good for that sort of thing .
Teves ticks off a few commonly - used software tools :
Maya , Lightwave , Rhino , Sketchup , and Z - Brush seem to be the staples .
Though in my opinion all of these tools rob the artist of his or her ' mark ' or personal style , the powers that be have become spoiled by them , and always prefer the glossy and photo - realistic look of an image created in one of these mediums , regardless of the quality or originality of the design itself , over an excellent design rendered in a more traditional medium .

Google Sketchup is free
Autodesk Maya is $ 3,500
NewTek Lightwave is $ 895
Rhino programs range in price from $ 99 ( for Penguin ) to $ 995 ( full Rhino ) , and there are good student discounts .

5 . An education
James Clyne , who has worked on movies from JJ Abrams ' Star Trek to Minority Report , says getting an education is the most important tool you can have :
I can't emphasize enough the importance of knowing the foundations of design , ie .
composition , lighting , color theory , and industrial design basics .
All you need to get started is a pencil and paper and an open imagination .
Anyone can purchase a Wacom tablet and start scribbling , but what 's important is the knowledge behind the brush .
Just knowing technique will get you in trouble .
Advertisement
If you 're using software , Shoji thinks taking classes on it is crucial :
If you 're planning on learning any software , I suggest enrolling in a school or getting some sort of student credentials .
The discounted prices for students are MUCH lower than for professionals and extremely affordable ( 99 $ vs. 999 $ )
Or you can spend time in the computer lab and just work on the school license .
Advertisement
There are many free and low - cost courses available online .
Sites like ConceptArt.org often feature free tutorials and how - tos from well - known designers , and Gnomon Workshop offers low - cost , online classes on art technique and software tools , taught by working concept artists .
The bottom line :
An art toolbox can cost as little as $ 20 for paper and pencils .
But your typical toolbox will probably run you about $ 500 for a tablet , copy of Photoshop , and a few online classes .

With additional reporting by Charlie Jane Anders .
But we ’re talking about voodoo economics here , so perhaps it ’s not surprising that belief in the magical powers of tax cuts is a zombie doctrine : no matter how many times you kill it with facts , it just keeps coming back .
And despite repeated failure in practice , it is , more than ever , the official view of the G.O.P .
Why should this scare you ?
On paper , solving America ’s long - run fiscal problems is eminently doable : stronger cost control for Medicare plus a moderate rise in taxes would get us most of the way there .
And the perception that the deficit is manageable has helped keep U.S. borrowing costs low .
But if politicians who insist that the way to reduce deficits is to cut taxes , not raise them , start winning elections again , how much faith can anyone have that we ’ll do what needs to be done ?
Yes , we can have a fiscal crisis .
But if we do , it wo n’t be because we ’ve spent too much trying to create jobs and help the unemployed .
It will be because investors have looked at our politics and concluded , with justification , that we ’ve turned into a banana republic .
Of course , flirting with crisis is arguably part of the plan .
There has always been a sense in which voodoo economics was a cover story for the real doctrine , which was “ starve the beast ” : slash revenue with tax cuts , then demand spending cuts to close the resulting budget gap .
The point is that starve the beast basically amounts to deliberately creating a fiscal crisis , in the belief that the crisis can be used to push through unpopular policies , like dismantling Social Security .
Anyway , we really should thank Senators Kyl and McConnell for their sudden outbursts of candor .
They ’ve now made it clear , in case anyone had doubts , that their previous posturing on the deficit was entirely hypocritical .
If they really do have the kind of electoral win they ’re expecting , they wo n’t try to reduce the deficit  they ’ll try to make it explode by demanding even more budget - busting tax cuts .
How To Spend Money
Jared , 25 June 2010
Economists believe there is an omnipresent hand that regulates the market place .
They ’ve probably made some sort of graph to support this — economists freakin’ love graphs .
There are people who want to buy things and other people who want to sell things and it more or less averages out .
What this means for you is that the value of any commodity is determined by everybody .
Sounds fair .
You ’re not everybody though .
You ’re reading personal development articles on the internet .
You ’re an outlier and knowing this can be highly beneficial for knowing where to invest your money for maximum returns on your health , profession , and relationships .
For all you economists out there here ’s what ’s up :
When I ’m indecisive about spending money I ask myself “ what value would I place on this item ? ”
The answer usually lets me know if I should part with the green .
I ’m a vegan who loves to cook ( ladies ) and does a fair bit of exercise , so health and good nutrition are things I value highly .
When I ’m doing my weekly food shop I ’m not looking at the prices .
I ’m getting what I need to eat well , and to enjoy cooking and eating the meals I make .
I do n’t care what the numbers on the receipt are .
Those numbers were put there by everybody else .
That ’s the value they placed on them .
And they ’re all a bunch of fatties who do n’t care what they put in their bodies .
Predictably I end up spending more than most people in my situation , but if I was to pay a figure that I felt accurately represented the value I was getting it ’d be magnitudes higher .
In my mind I ’m getting a really sweet deal .
I use this type of reasoning a lot .
If there ’s some drumming gear that needs upgrading I ’ll find the hardware I want then ask for the price .
If an opportunity to try something new comes up I ’ll say yes and just cop the damage .
These are areas where my internal value of things far exceeds the external value society has placed on them .
Back in high school I went to the local fair with a few friends .
Everyone was complaining how overpriced everything was and that all the rides were a rip off .
I even joined in and was very vocal about not wanting to go .
Looking back now though I can remember thinking that I was actually OK with $ 20 roller coaster rides and $ 50 junk filled show bags .
The half broken flickering lights , the screams from the big drop , and the sugary smells in the cool night breeze all had a very escapist movie like quality to them .
I was paying for an experience and the value I place on that is basically limitless .
A story where I get fleeced
Having this attitude can lead to certain pitfalls though .
One of the people who came to the fair was a girl I ’d just started seeing .
I decided I ’d do the “ guy thing ” and win the biggest fuck - off huge stuffed animal I could find and surprise her with it .
I managed to sneak away from the group and found an alley lined with all sorts of carnival games .
Throwing balls at bottles , shooting bullets at ducks — that sort of thing .
Now if you ’ve read any of our quick skills articles you ’ll know I have a bit of a penchant for geeky skill type activities .
To say I was over - confident would be an under - statement .
I eventually found what I was after : a game where you stood a few feet from a hoop that you throw balls through .
Too easy , I thought …
The guy running the show saw me staring and had me figured in an instant .
A young - ish looking guy wandering all alone , eyeing off giant stuffed teddy bears — yep , his donkey - jawed carny daughter was finally getting that dental surgery she needed .
I ’m not exactly sure what happened next .
I remember at some point I ’d sunk about 8 baskets and was thinking “ Kobe does n’t look this good . ”
But I still did n’t have the prize .
I thought I understood how the game worked .
Pay money , shoot hoops , win prize .
Turns out it was closer to pay money , shoot hoops , hypnotize chump with carny wise - talking and make him believe he has misunderstood the rules , pay more money , shoot more hoops , and repeat until he has no money left and give him the teddy out of pity .
I got fleeced .
I ’m not going to say how much .
It made the roller coaster rides and show bags look like pocket change though .
I guess in an odd way being able to experience all that did make it worthwhile .
Seeing a carny conman in action and getting a funny story negates the monetary expense for me .
I must be the ideal mark !
Finding your value system
Calibrating your own values does n’t mean you will end up spending more money .
Unlike some writers on this blog I ’m not financially well off .
It ’s a two way street : often the value I place on things is lower than how society values them .
20 % off that extra pair of jeans I do n’t really need is still way too much .
Sure , I ’d be up for a new pair of duds , but the actual value I ’d be getting is very small .
And just because you place a high value on something does n’t automatically mean you have to spend more money .
It allows you to honestly evaluate what ’s important to you without worrying about what something costs .
When I buy new drumming gear I ’m after a sound or a feel .
That does n’t always mean I have to buy the best .
It means I ’ll happily pay $ 20 or $ 2000 because the value for me is the same in either scenario .
A fun way to look at this is to imagine you ’ve got your own personal marketing team .
When you start viewing things with your own price tag the sales become ridiculous !
Everything that ’s really important to you is permanently on sale , and all those 2 for 1 deals are giant warning signs that read “ Valueless crap for sale . ”
It ’s like backwards day everyday !
By aligning your spending habits with the value you place on things you end up using your money in ways that are of most benefit to you .
When I invest money in food , high end drumming gear , or a cheesy local fair I ’m getting maximum returns on my health , my profession , and my relationships .
Buying healthy food makes me feel good about myself and helps keep me in shape ; buying new drumming gear increases my motivation to play which results in better playing more musical opportunities ; and spending the night at the local fair gave me an experience with friends and loved ones .
Break away from the price tags other people place on things .
Spend your money in areas that are of most value to you and you ’ll get the most value in return .
In part 1 I went over the basics of tmux and how to utilize its basic features .
In this portion I ’m going to dive a bit more into customizing tmux to make it easier and prettier to work with .
I ’ll also give some examples on how to utilize the client / server model .
Since this part is less of a tutorial and more of a tips / reference I decided a table of contents based layout would be a bit easier to use :
Note :
If you have any tips , tricks or pre-made configurations you want to contribute to this post please do so in the comments and I ’ll append them to this post .

You can type the commands into a live tmux session or place them in ~/.tmux.conf file which is automatically loaded when tmux is started .

Modify tmux bindings
By default tmux has a decent default layout for hotkeys however there are a few keys that either made my fingers contort into ways they should n’t have or keys I simply always forgot .
Luckily tmux offers a very simple syntax to rebind any key .
Rebinding the Action Key
Here is how you can rebind the Ctrl - b prefix to be something a bit easier to type .
I personally use Ctrl - a similar to screen :
set - option -g prefix C-a
Note : The “ - g ” switch stands for global so the binding will affect every window .
Alternatively the set -option command accepts arguments to specify the session and target of that particular binding if you like .
Now every subsequent command will be prefixed with Ctrl - a instead of Ctrl-b .
Binding a key for “ last - window ”
One of my favorite screen hotkeys is the last window hotkey which allows you to quickly switch between the current window and last window that was active .
By default tmux does n’t have a binding for this however it can easily be achieved by using the following :
bind - key C-a last - window
What this does is binds Ctrl - a to switch between the last active window .
To use this binding you would hit Ctrl - a twice ( since the prefix is set to Ctrl - a and the binding Ctrl-a ) .
Rebinding the pane splitting bindings
One of the most powerful features of tmux is the ability to natively split your windows into several panes .
Unfortunately the default bindings to achieve this are simply unintuitive .
As a result I ’ve rebound the splitting commands to something I could remember :
unbind % # Remove default binding since we ’re replacing
bind | split - window -h
bind – split - window -v
At first this may look odd but for me it ’s easier to remember that “ | ” splits the screen vertically while “ - “ splits the screen horizontally .
To achieve the below window structure you would type the following sequence :
Ctrl-a |
Ctrl-a –
Ctrl-a –
The first Ctrl - a |command splits the current window in half .
The active window is the pane on the right so the subsequent Ctrl - a – splits that window into two vertically .
Hitting Ctrl - a – once more now splits that active window into two more by splitting it vertically .
Note : Depending on the active layout you ’re using the behavior of how the windows split may be different .
Modify tmux look & style
The default colors and style of tmux is n’t awful however it ’s somewhat bland for my liking .
I personally only have modified tmux slightly however it allows you to do quite a bit .
In this section I ’ll go over some of tmux ’s style features .
Modifying tab color & looks
By default the tab colors are pretty bland and it makes it difficult to distinguish the active window from the other windows .
Here is the default tmux tabs vs. the modified ones ( snippet below ) :
As you can see the latter version is much more clear and uses some variable expansions tmux provides ( hostname , etc ) .
You can achieve this output with the following :
# Set status bar
set -g status - bg black
set -g status - fg white
set -g status - left ‘# [ fg=green ] # H ’
The first two commands set the background to black and the text to white .
The third command is where the magic happens : the status - left command tells tmux to display the following text to the left of the terminal .
The [ fg=green ]
#H portion tells tmux to display the hostname of localhost and make it green .
The # H portion is part of tmux variable expansion – please refer to the man pages for more information on other ones you can use .
That alone does n’t account for highlighting the active window .
If you want to do that use the following snippet :
# Highlight active window
set - window - option -g window - status - current - bg red
The set - window - option -g window - status - current - bg red command tells tmux to change the background of the current active window to red .
The set - window - option command has several other options you can pass to it to achieve similar affects .
Adding information to your session
Sometimes it might be useful to add some information from your local machine to the tmux screen .
Earlier we played with the status - left command which sets the left portion of the status bar .
Let ’s use the status - right command to add some information to the right side :
As you can see I ’ve added the amount of users logged in and the current load average for my computer .
This was achieved with the following snippet :
set -g status - right ‘# [ fg=yellow ] #( uptime | cut -d “ , ” -f 2 - ) ’
Similar to before the # [ fg=yellow ] portion tells tmux to make the font yellow .
The #( uptime | cut -d “ , ” -f 2 - ) portion tells tmux to run that cmd and output it on the right of the status bar .
Note :
If you ’re not familiar with shell scripting this command is very simple .
It runs the uptime command and then passes it to the cut command which splits it at the commas ( , ) .
The -f 2 - portion says to print out everything from the second comma onward .
Note **:
By default the status bar is redrawn every 15 seconds however you can modify this by setting the status - interval command .
Misc tips & tricks
Using shell scripting to setup your tmux enviroment
Tmux allows you to easily run commands for your different sessions through the command line without having to ever login to the session .
This also allows us to make a simple bootstrap script which will setup your tmux environment and log you into it .
Here is an example script I personally use :
#!/bin/sh tmux new - session -d -s hawkhost tmux new - window -t hawkhost : 1 -n ' Server1 ' ' ssh root@10.x.x.x ' tmux new - window -t hawkhost : 2 -n ' Server2 ' ' ssh root@10.x.x.x ' tmux new - window -t hawkhost : 3 -n ' Server3 ' ' ssh root@10.x.x.x ' tmux new - window -t hawkhost : 4 -n ' Server4 ' ' ssh root@10.x.x.x ' tmux new - window -t hawkhost : 5 -n ' Server5 ' ' ssh root@10.x.x.x ' tmux select - window -t hawkhost : 1 tmux - 2 attach - session -t hawkhost
The command new - session -d -s hawkhost creates a new tmux session , detaches it ( so it does n’t open in your current terminal ) and names it hawkhost in this case .
The following set of new - window commands create five new windows and executes the command at the end .
The arguments are broken down as follows : -t hawkhost : 1 tells tmux to “ target ” the session hawkhost and the window with the id of 1 .
The -n ‘ Server1 ’ ‘ ssh root@10.x.x.x ’ portion tells tmux to name the window Server1 and execute the ssh root@10.x.x.x command in it .
The last two commands are pretty straight forward .
The select - window -t hawkhost : 1 command tells tmux that you want the active window the session to be hawkhost and window 1 .
The - 2 attach - session -t hawkhost tells tmux you want to attach the terminal with 256 colors and attach to the session hawkhost .
Note :
This is the command that brings the tmux session to the foreground .
If you recall earlier when the script created the session we specified the -d switch which prevents it from loading in your terminal .
Notify you when a window has activity
This quick snippet will have tmux notify you in the status area when a window has activity :
# Set window notifications
setw -g monitor - activity on
set -g visual - activity on
As you can see in the first image it lets me know that there was activity in window 0 ( in this case sleep 10 && echo “ narwhal ” and switching the window ) .
Automatic window rename
You can have tmux rename the window to the command that is currently running .
This is useful when you load up something such as irssi and the window is labeled accordingly :
A nutrient that 's common to all living things can make hibernating marmots hungry -- a breakthrough that could help scientists understand human obesity and eating disorders , according to a new study by a Colorado State University biologist .
The study appears in the current issue of the Journal of Experimental Biology .
Professor Greg Florant discovered he could slowly release a molecule called AICAR into yellow - bellied marmots that activates a neurological pathway driving food intake and stimulates appetite .
The pathway , which shuts down during hibernation , relies on an important balance between two energy molecules -- ATP and AMP .
The lower the ratio between the two cellular molecules , the lower the energy in the cell and the more the appetite is stimulated .
Without this artificial stimulation , awake , hibernating marmots do not eat -- even when researchers place food in front of them .
" The experimental group started to feed because they thought they had this energy deficit , " Florant said .
" Then when the pumps dispensing the molecule finally stopped , the animals went right back into hibernation .
That suggests to us that the animals are still sensing energy levels within cells during the hibernation period . "
Tissue samples taken from marmots in Florant 's lab allow researchers to identify biochemical processes and genes that are active during hibernation -- as opposed to genes that are active when they 're feeding or engaging in other behaviors .
The American Physiological Society has called hibernators such as marmots , bears , woodchucks , hedgehogs and lemurs " medical marvels " because they can turn off their appetites and slow their breathing to a point that would be lethal to other animals .
Marmots typically hibernate for as many as six or seven months .
" You ca n't eat if you 're asleep , " Florant said .
" We 've discovered that perhaps nutrients within the brain , such as fatty acids , can alter the food intake pathway , which normally shuts down when marmots hibernate .
The perceived drop in energy nutrients ( i.e. low ATP ) makes the animals think they 've got an energy deficit and want to eat . "
Florant said he 'll conduct additional research this summer to determine whether the reverse is true :
Can he stop the animals from eating when they 're not hibernating ?
His team will also identify neurons in the particular areas of the hypothalamus that are involved in food intake in animals .
The hypothalamus is one of the master regulator areas of the brain and controls such activities as food intake , sex and temperature regulation .
" We know which neurons are driving this process , " he said .
" We 're just trying to identify them within the marmot and distinguish what 's different about the neurons in a marmot compared to a rat or other animal that does not go into hibernation . "
Canada ’s latest proposed DMCA Copyright Bill finally became available last night , and was brought to my attention while recording the latest episode of DyscultureD with Anthony Marco and Mike Vardy .
Because digital rights is such a hard sell to those who do n’t immediately grasp it , let me show how C - 32 would make me a criminal , three times over .
Then you can decide for yourself if what I ’m about to describe falls within reasonable use or not .
I. Suspect did willfully disrespect the region - locking of commercial DVDs .
It ’s true .
In the summer of 2008 I purchased two DVDs about a cat that blogs .
They were region - locked for Japan and I got them to play here in Canada using illegal hardware that I got from a shady vendor known in hacker circles as “ Wal - Mart “ .
Even worse , I ripped and uploaded the intros from both DVDs for the purposes of scholarly review .
II .
Suspect did willfully see what was not meant to be seen .
Yup , I downloaded and watched an excellent ( if unfinished ) documentary on hackers .
And it was awesome .
It was funded by Kevin Spacey ’s TriggerStreet Productions but shelved before release .
The only other way I could have seen it was if I worked in the editing room on the film itself .
Under Bill C - 32 my ISP could report me to the MPAA , where presumably I ’d be extradited to serve ten years of hard labour as a production assistant on TMZ .
III .
Suspect did willfully circumvent DRM to escape vendor lock - in .
Since Apple does n’t make their popular fart app store / music player available for Linux proper , the only way I could get my hundreds of dollars of legally purchased iTunes tracks to play on my computer was to strip out the DRM .
Actually they still wo n’t play because I can’t find a suitable decoder for Apple ’s “ Advanced Audio Coding “ , but a lock is a lock and I broke it .
So there you have it , three counts of future - crime in direct violation of Bill C - 32 .
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury , what ’s your verdict ?
There was a time when Blackwater owner Erik Prince planned to grow his fledgling private contracting company into a family empire .
But that was a long time ago .
Today , the controversial contracting powerhouse that now goes by the name Xe , is up for sale .
In a few short years , Prince managed to turn a start - up firing range facility aimed at special forces and law enforcement , into a billion dollar empire that the U.S. State Department insisted it needed in order to perform its mission in Iraq , providing security personnel to protect diplomats and others who were spearheading reconstruction efforts .
But the company had an uncanny ability to draw negative headlines , particularly after a deadly shooting in Baghdad 's Nisoor Square in September 2007 in which Blackwater contractors opened fired in a traffic circle , leaving more than a dozen civilians dead .
The Blackwater guards insisted they were coming under fire when they unleashed a barrage of bullets in the crowded traffic circle but the Iraqi government believed otherwise , and eventually kicked the company out of the country altogether .
Last year , Prince changed the company 's name to Xe and announced that he was stepping down from day - to - day operations amid a slew of investigations from multiple government agencies .
He fired Blackwater President Gary Jackson and brought in a new CEO who set out to clean house and set the company on a new course .
The company 's statement confirming that it's on the block reflects that desire to convince potential buyer 's that it 's changed .
" Xe 's new management team has made significant changes and improvements to the company over the last 15 months , which have enabled the company to better serve the U.S. government and other customers , and will deliver additional value to a purchaser . "
This is n't the first time Prince has pursued the idea of selling his company .
In early 2008 , just months after the Nisoor Square shooting , Blackwater began negotiations with the equity firm Cerebus Capital Management , but those negotiations fell through after news of the talks were leaked to the media .
This past February , Prince sold off his aviation division for $ 200 million .
The 40 - year - old entrepreneur has made no secret of his frustrations with the U.S. government , which is incidentally , his best paying client .
He insists that his men do good work , and that many of them have n't often gotten the respect they deserve .

Anger after Australian Jew films video of her family singing ' I Will Survive ' on a trip to Auschwitz
An Australian woman has posted a video of her family singing and dancing along to the Gloria Gaynor hit ' I Will Survive ' while on a trip to the Auschwitz death camp in Poland .
Jane Korman , who is Jewish , posted the video of her 89 - year - old father Adolk - who survived the Holocaust - and her three children dancing to the hit inside the infamous extermination centre where as many as 1.1 million people were killed during World War Two .
At one point , her father is seen wearing a t - shirt which ' I will survive ' written across its front .
Insensitive : Jane Korman posted footage of her family singing and dancing to Gloria Gaynor 's ' I Will Survive ' outside Auschwitz
Mrs Korman has defended herself against claims of tastelessness and said the recording was ' a celebration of life and survival ' .
She said : ' I wanted to make artwork that creates a fresh interpretation of historical memory . '
The video , posted on YouTube , showed the Korman family dancing in front of the Auschwitz sign ' Arbeit Macht Frei ' - Work Sets Your Free - a Polish synagogue , the German concentration camp at Dachau , the Czech concentration camp at Theresienstadt and a memorial in Lodz , Poland , to victims of the Nazi ghetto .
But the recording has sparked anger among many of those who survived the horrors of the camp and neo -Nazi groups have posted it on their websites .
Footage : Mrs Korman said her video was a ' fresh affirmation of historical memory '
Anger :
The footage also includes shots of the family dancing outside Terestenstadt Concentration Camp in the Czech Republic
Kamil Cwiok , 86 , was just a child when he and his family were rounded up by the Nazis .
Most of his family died in the gas chambers at Auschwitz .
He said : ' I do n't see how this video is a mark of respect for the millions who did n't survive , nor for those who did .
' It seems to trivialise the horrors that were committed there . '
Mrs Korman added : ' It might be disrespectful , but he ( her father ) is saying " we 're dancing , we should be dancing , we 're celebrating our survival and the generations after me " - the generation he created .
' We are affirming our existence . '
The video also shows the family dancing at Dachau concentration camp , a Polish synagogue and a memorial in Lodz
The family are wearing white t- shirts with I will survive written on the front
The video , which was displayed in an Australia art gallery , was also picked up by neo -Nazi websites .
One comment said : ' Look , the Jews are still dancing in every corner .
We are n't through with them ; we will finish them in the next Holocaust . '
Mrs Korman said her mother - who also survived the gas chambers - had refused to travel to Poland where the death camp is based because it held ' too many bad memories ' .
What product can you buy that is expensive , works with your PC , does things that could be critical to your health , but the salesman can't tell you how to use it ?
A lot of medical products , that 's what .
I found this out during a long and painful experience with Obstructive Sleep Apnea .
I can't breathe at night -- it 's not being fat , although I am , it 's that for some reason the muscle tone in my neck sucks .
So as soon as I drop off to sleep , my throat closes up and I stop breathing .
As my blood oxygen levels drop , adrenalin kicks in , I wake up a little bit , my throat opens up , and then I immediately pass out again .
Most people have some form of obstruction when sleeping .
However when it reaches over 120 times per hour , you 're basically waking up twice a minute .
That means no REM , tossing and turning all night , your adrenalin and stress hormones are in high gear , your heart rate is surging all night long , your blood pressure is out of whack -- as you can imagine , not a good thing .
If left untreated , OSA at that level can lead to heart attack and stroke .
Early in life .
So I went to the doc and told him my problem .
Told him I needed a CPAP .
( Continuous Positive Airway Pressure -- a device that does not breathe for you , but keeps your airway open so that you can breathe )
My wife and I have been observing the symptoms for years , we 're done the research , and now it is time for action .
He said I needed to go to a pulmonary specialists first -- a guy who specializes in lungs and hearts .
Why ?
Because it had to do with breathing .
Could I have just went to the pulmonary guy first ?
No , they wo n't take you without a referral .
I go to the pulmonary guy .
Tell him I have this problem , have had it for years , it 's gotten bad enough that I am unable to get enough sleep at night and my health is going down the toilet .
I need a CPAP .
Pronto .
Do I get a CPAP ?
Nope .
I get a " sleep study "
Sleep studies cost $ 2000 and they are very important to make sure that you really have the problem that you say you do .
Or at least that 's what they told me .
They measure your breathing , pulse , movements , and blood oxygen through the night .
They also can fit you for a mask to use with your CPAP and show you how to use one .
You'd think sticking a mask on your face would be fairly simple to learn , but it 's good to have support .
I show up , tell them my problem , and say " So , once you measure this , do you start fitting me for a mask ? "
Nope .
We send you back to the pulmonary guy .
We just take measurements .
Another guy comes in during the day and reviews the data .
Then we send the data to your pulmonary guy and he makes a decision .
Gee , I thought I had already made the decision .
Did the sleep study .
Went back to the pulmonary guy .
Can I get my CPAP now ?
Nope .
He tells me yes , it looks like you have Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( which was very much a " no shit ? " kind of moment for me )
Now you must have a CPAP .
Yay !
Cool !
Got one here ?
It 's been 4 weeks since I started this and I 'm feeling the worst I ever have in my entire life .
I will go to another hundred tests and doctors , just please give me a CPAP so I can breathe tonight .
Nope .
Dude , you got to go back for another sleep study .
We just make the diagnosis here , the sleep study guys are responsible for fitting and making sure it 's working okay .
They make sure the diagnosis is correct .
Maybe it was my imagination , but somewhere far away I could hear cash registers ringing .
Back to the sleep study , where another $ 2 K later I have a temporary mask and my first real night 's sleep in months or years .
But no CPAP .
Where 's the CPAP ?
Hell , you got to go to the medical supply place for that .
We do n't sell CPAPs .
What do you think we are , a home medical device provider ?
Off I trot to the medical supply place .
By this point I 'm starting to get a little concerned .
Even though I am currently under insurance , for most of my life I have been self - pay .
And I need this CPAP thing .
It 's not like a new hat .
It 's not even like a car , or a house .
I need this CPAP thing like I need air .
So what happens if I have no insurance and the one I have breaks ?
What if the power goes out ?
What if it stops working well ?
What if my condition changes ?
It 's not like I can play pin - the - tail - on - the - billing - chain every time something needs tweaking .
After all , this is my breathing we 're talking about .
I am very fond of breathing .
So I call the doc and make sure that it's an APAP -- Automatic Positive Airway Pressure device .
Through my research I found out that the automatic ones will adjust themselves during the night .
That means less fooling around with doctors .
At the medical supply place , I finally get an APAP .
But it was programmed to be a CPAP .
The doc wrote the prescription for an automatic machine , but that it would be set on a fixed setting .
So the automatic machine was set to run in non-automatic mode .
Why ?
As best as I can tell , for safety .
We can't have folks running these machines just any way they want .
If it needs adjusting , I was told , just call us up , bring in the chip , and we 'll turn it up or down a notch or two .
But how will you know if what you are doing is correct ?
How will I know when to bring it in ?
Hey if you start having a lot of problems , let us know and we can reschedule a sleep study .
Find out what 's going on .
!@#$ %$@#
I have reached the end of my patience .
The medical system is a system between providers -- doctors , test takers , diagnosticians , pharmacies , and such -- and payers -- insurance companies and government programs and such .
Nowhere in that equation was the patient , although everybody was supposed to be in it for him .
Nobody had any malice , everybody was acting as carefully and precisely as they could and they all had my best interests at heart .
But somewhere along the way I stopped being helped and started being herded .
That 's not happening .
So I go home and find a pulse oximeter -- a little device that measures my pulse and heart rate over night and then reports to me what is happening .
It 's not a $ 2000 sleep study , but if my oxygen is fine and my heart rate is n't spiking ?
For all I care things are working fine .
I have decided to go off the doc treadmill and start taking control of this thing .
The pulse oximeter shows up .
Cool little gadget , a PulseOx 7500 Wrist Oximeter , plugs right into a USB port , and after some screwing around I got it to work .
But the program to access the data is proprietary .
The data is proprietary .
Hell , the USB drivers are proprietary .
The company that makes the device does n't support the software and the guys who made the software are long gone ( both of these thing probably happened for liability reasons ) .
So could I have the spec ?
I 'll write my own program to pull the data ?
Nope .
The spec does not exist on the net .
Aside from using the software they provide to read and display the data , I have no options .
Can I correlate it into larger groups ?
Perform my own statistical analysis ?
Export to a standard format ?
Nope , nope , nope ,
Ok , how about re-programming the CPAP to go into full auto mode ?
After hours of googling , I can't find a way to do that either .
For a machine with a data card , a processor , and all these smarts it does n't seem to want to talk to other machines .
I even found out that my machine was monitoring my breathing habits during the night -- it could tell me of obstructions .
Between that and the PulseOx I had a pretty damned good set of instrumentation , but the machine could n't tell me what it knew .
That was for the doctors .
Not the user .
" If you have any problems or would like us to look at the data , just bring in the card and we 'll take a look " the nurse helpfully told me on the phone .
So I started calling people who sold CPAPs on the net .
Spoke to one guy last week .
If I bought a new machine , paid for it with my own money , do I get the technical guide along with the user 's guide ?
Maybe a link to a SDK somewhere ?
" I can't tell you how to configure your machine or how to get data from it , " the guy told me , " the FDA strictly forbids me from telling you the details of how to operate the machine except as a user "
How about not setting the machine , but just getting the diagnostic information it contains ?
Nope .
I can be a user , but I can't be an informed user .
If I want information , I must go to the magic people who charge me ( or somebody else ) money .
After all , what would silly old me know about reading such complex information ?
It would do nothing but confuse me .
Now I 'm not shooting up morphine -- I 'm basically using a machine that maintains pressure in my throat while I sleep .
Best I can tell , there is nothing addictive or harmful about this situation -- especially compared with strangling myself while I sleep each night .
But the machine vendors have a deal with the docs and the techs and the specialists and the rest of the system where everything is a walled garden and I 'm not invited in .
I 'm just the owner , the user , the human being .
If this situation existed anywhere else where we paid tens of thousands of dollars , people would be outraged .
But it 's all hidden here , except for those who are stuck on their own .
Worse , the system is rigged so that open and shared information is harmful to those who provide it , so the incentives are all for controlling more and more information and charging for access ( usually in the name of safety or risk or whatever ) .
And so it will simply get more complex and difficult to access .
Meanwhile I 've got a cool machine that could help me understand my condition , and I can't do anything but plug it up and turn it on .
" I could tell you how to program it , " the salesman said last week , " but then I 'd have to shoot you "
He laughed .
There are songs that make me want to shoot myself and then there are songs that make me want to stick bullet casings in my ears .
18 K gold 9 mm bullet casing earphones , that is .

There was no golden generation after all .
But let us be generous , for once , and say without irony that a bunch of gifted footballers finally disappeared into a Free State sunset last night .
Although their deeds in the shirt of the national team may never have matched their promise , what they accomplished in the colours of some of the world 's biggest clubs certainly validated their authenticity as individuals .
If they failed to bring home the expected trophies from international tournaments , at least they gave us plenty to talk about .
The truth is that they had been slipping away , one by one , for some time before the end came last night .
The first of the core members to take his leave was Paul Scholes , whose disillusionment led him to retire from international football after the 2004 European Championships .
Next went Michael Owen , his England career ended by an inability to persuade Fabio Capello that his full effectiveness had been restored after a series of debilitating injuries .
The third was David Beckham , who had regained the coach 's trust but whose Indian summer was ruined by an achilles tendon injury in March .
Then Rio Ferdinand was abruptly excluded from participation in the 2010 World Cup by a twisted knee in a training session eight days before England 's opening match .
Now , following yesterday 's defeat by Germany , the chances are that we have also seen the last of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard at a major international competition .
Both can look forward to years of useful life at club level but their lease on an England shirt has expired and whoever picks up the threads left by Capello will need to be thinking in terms of a fresh start .
Gerrard and Owen are 30 , Lampard and Ferdinand 32 , Beckham and Scholes ( whom Capello , at his wits ' end , tried to recall ) 35 .
They made their senior international debuts between 1995 and 2000 and share an aggregate of 421 caps , which would have been many more but for injuries , a long suspension and Scholes 's self - imposed exile .
In football terms they are now senior citizens .
Advances in kinesiology and other fitness sciences mean they will be with us for a while yet but no longer as the standard bearers for a perhaps unwisely expectant nation .
Together they symbolised England 's hopes of turning the Premier League 's astonishing global popularity into a second World Cup trophy in the FA 's cabinet .
At the start of their journey they were young , gifted and – with the exception of the admirably stubborn Scholes – hugely marketable , but now it can be seen that their pinnacle probably came that sunny late afternoon in Shizuoka , when they faced Brazil in the quarter - finals of the 2002 tournament in front of 47,436 spectators whose replica shirts were divided equally between the white of the European side and the yellow of the South Americans .
The vast majority of those fans were Japanese , and the ones who had elected to support England were , almost to a man , woman and child , wearing the names of Owen or Beckham inscribed on their backs .
Those old enough to remember the Beatles ' impact on Japan , almost 40 years earlier , identified a similar popular culture phenomenon .
Owen gave England the lead and in that moment they seemed fully the equals of the best side in the world .
Had Beckham or Scholes succeeded in preventing the move from which Rivaldo scored the equaliser or had Ronaldinho 's audacious free - kick not been allowed to dip under David Seaman 's crossbar , history might have been very different .
After that defeat the climate changed .
Anticipation was no longer untainted by apprehension .
At home the excitement grew greater every time they set off for a World Cup but underneath it was a feeling that disappointment would not be far away .
The fans believed , and did not believe .
They were prepared to give unconditional support while reserving the right to castigate those who failed to fulfiltheir dreams , even though most of them knew , deep down , that those dreams were no longer realistic .
Their apprehension was shared and after their first two matches in South Africa even Capello was speaking of the " fear " of the tournament exhibited by these highly experienced players .
The immoderate affluence of the leading Premier League players began to turn the leaders of the golden generation into easy targets and at the 2006 World Cup they allowed themselves and their entourage to become a laughing stock .
A sense of entitlement finally overwhelmed what had once been a bunch of ordinary lads , essentially no different from , and no less talented than , those assembled by Alf Ramsey in 1966 .
It distorted their behaviour off the pitch and led them to believe that success on it was no more than they " deserved " – the most popular word in their lexicon when , after losing a penalty shoot - out to Portugal , they were lamenting the premature departure from their luxury headquarters in the hills of the Black Forest as though the talent and superior motivation of lower - ranked teams were some sort of offence against nature .
So the era that began on a hot June night in France 12 years ago with a flash of lightning – Owen 's scamper through the Argentinian defence – and a roll of thunder – Beckham 's red card – is finally over .
Now we can see how that defeat in Saint - Etienne defined the generation : a moment of deserved exhilaration closely followed by the confrontation with catastrophe .
And when the end came , it was a real coup de grâce , appropriately flavoured with controversy and delivered by merciless opponents .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - British - born author Christopher Hitchens on Wednesday cut short a book tour to undergo chemotherapy , which several media outlets reported was because the heavy smoker has been diagnosed with cancer .
“ I have been advised by my physician that I must undergo a course of chemotherapy on my esophagus .
This advice seems persuasive to me .
I regret having had to cancel so many engagements at such short notice , ” Hitchens , 61 , said in a statement released through his publishers Twelve .
A representative for the publisher offered no details beyond the statement .
Hitchens , known to be a heavy smoker , launched a book tour last month to promote his memoir “ Hitch 22 ” which tackles subjects ranging from the Middle East and Zimbabwe to his friendships with prominent writers including Salman Rushdie and Martin Amis .
As a journalist , critic and war correspondent , Hitchens has carved out a reputation for barbed repartee , scathing critiques of public figures and a fierce intelligence .
In his 2008 book “ God Is Not Great ” , Hitchens put himself on a collision course with major religions with his trenchant atheist views .
Hitchens was born in Britain , lives in Washington D.C. , and retained his British citizenship when he also became an American citizen in 2007 .

A teenage flight attendant who told police she had been raped by a married pilot on an overnight stopover has no memory of the alleged sexual assault , a court has been told .
She says she needed counselling for a year after the encounter and had not returned to her job .
The man , who has interim name suppression , was fired from Air Nelson in June last year for serious misconduct , including sexual harassment .
He lost a case of unjustified dismissal and has appealed to the Employment Court .
The allegations stem from May 20 , 2008 , when the pilot , another pilot and the air hostess had to stay overnight in a Napier hotel after bad weather halted their flight .
Giving evidence in Auckland yesterday , the woman said she had not worked as an air hostess since the incident .
She now worked in the aviation industry in another role .
" This situation I find difficult to come to terms with and upsetting when processing or seeing other flight attendants and former colleagues . "
On route to the hotel the two pilots bought four bottles of red wine and half - a- dozen beer .
All three later changed into bathrobes and met in a pilot 's room to drink the alcohol .
The woman complained to police the next day that one pilot had raped her .
He was not charged by police .
" I was initially hesitant to go to police because I was concerned that no - one would believe me because I had no memory of four hours or so and because alcohol had been involved . "
She eventually decided to lay a complaint as she thought something " very wrong " had happened .
The pilot 's lawyer , John Haigh , QC , suggested the sex had been consensualbut the woman later regretted it and made up her memory loss as an excuse .
She denied this .
The trial is continuing .

Chalk up another one on the list of random things the Westboro Baptist Church hates : Flags .
In honor of Flag Day , the WBC issued a ( probably unintentionally ) hilarious press release -- which came a day late , because evidently it takes a little while to write a song about how " They 'll face the wrath of God for sure / Cuz they worshipped a filthy flag . "
Here 's a choice excerpt from the press release ( rendered in the original in a super - boldface font ) :
Your impotent blood - soaked feces - stained semen - slathered fag flag is an idol .
Do n't turn up your nose ; that 's your conduct that put it in that condition .
Lad Liberty is a mean hypocritical whore , who only lets in fags and drug - thugs nowadays .

Shocked ?
Do n't be .
After all , the WBC has turned phrases like " God Hates Fags " into mantras , made a habit of protesting at the funerals of soldiers killed in combat , and seems to exist solely for the purpose of generating publicity for itself ( we know , we 're playing right into its hands ) .
What 's funny , though , is how directionless God 's hate seems to be , at least according to the WBC .
A short list of things God allegedly hates :
1. Nebraska 2 . Lady Gaga 3 . Israel 4 . Gerald Ford 5 . Sweden
And , of course , flags .
Here 's part of the WBC 's anti-Flag Day song :
You 're a filthy flag ; you 're a red , bloody flag
And the perverts they love you to wave
You 're the emblem of the fags they love
The home of the warped and depraved
Note the adorable rhyme scheme .
Really , the WBC hates so much stuff it's hard to take the organization seriously - - it 's more a parody of a hate group than an actual hate group .
If it were n't for the multiple allegations that Fred Phelps seriously abuses his children -- who , along with his grandchildren , make up basically the entirety of the WBC -- you could almost take it as a joke .
A really creepy joke .
Tony Perkins ' opposition to Elena Kagan 's confirmation as Supreme Court justice revolves mostly around gay rights , including her unknown position on gay marriage .
Perkins , who heads the Washington - based Family Research Council , testified Friday before senators considering Kagan 's nomination .
He called her nomination alarming to gay marriage foes .
“ It should alarm those who live in the 45 states that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman , and the tens of millions of Americans who affirm biblical moral teaching , ” Perkins testified .
U.S. Solicitor General Kagan , 50 , is being considered to replace retiring Justice Paul Stevens .
Perkins is also opposed to ending “ Do n't Ask , Don't Tell , ” the 1993 law that bans gay troops from revealing their sexuality .
In May , the FRC released a report urging lawmakers to keep the ban in place , warning that “ homosexual misconduct ” in the military will increase without the policy .
“ It 's a question of whether we will force soldiers to bond with homosexuals in the showers and the barracks , knowing that doing so will result in sexual bullying , male rape and forcible sodomy , ” retired Col.
Richard Black said during a call with reporters announcing the report .
During Kagan 's 2009 confirmation as solicitor general , Perkins raised similar concerns about her support for gay marriage
“ Ms. Kagan 's extreme rhetoric makes it highly likely that she also favors same - sex marriage , both as a matter of policy and as a supposed federal constitutional right , ” Perkins warned in a letter to senators .
But Kagan 's own testimony offers little support for marriage equality .
In a written follow - up to her Senate confirmation hearing , Senator John Cornyn , a Texas Republican , asked Kagan her views on gay marriage .
“ There is no federal constitutional right to same - sex marriage , ” she responded .
And during her third day of testimony this week , the Supreme Court nominee chose to sidestep the issue .
In an exchange with Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley , a Republican who supports a constitutional ban on gay marriage , Kagan was asked whether she believes states have the right to define marriage – because “ it 's coming down the road , ” he said , referring to three gay marriage cases wending their way to the high court .
“ Do you agree that the court 's decision in Baker v. Nelson , holding that federal courts lack jurisdiction to hear challenges to state marriage laws was correct ? ”
Grassley asked .
“ My best understanding is that that decision has some precedential weight , but not the weight of a ' normal ' decision , ” Kagan answered .
The high court refused the hear Baker v. Nelson in 1972 because it lacked a “ substantial federal question . ”
Grassley had hoped to hear that Kagan considers the issue settled .
While Kagan can be said to be progressive – she stridently opposes “ Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ” – on the face she offers little support for gay marriage .
Yet on Friday , Perkins railed against Kagan 's nomination on the issue .
“ Her own statements make obvious that Elena Kagan would strike down any marital statute – including the federal Defense of Marriage Act – which defines marriage as being between one man and one woman . ”
“ We do not need a justice on the Supreme Court who sees it as her life mission to write the homosexual version of Roe v.
Wade by striking down one - man , one - woman marriage across America , ” Perkins said .
“ I urge the Senate to reject her nomination , ” he added .

Mark Wolverton , A Life in Twilight : The Final Years of J. Robert Oppenheimer
( New York : Saint Martins Press ) reviewed by Colin Hughes
Over the last decade , at least nine books have appeared with the name ‘ J. Robert Oppenheimer ’ in the title , and no doubt the trend will continue .
Some are biographies , covering Oppenheimer ’s life as family man , as physicist , as ‘ father of the atomic bomb ’ , as victim of a witch hunt during the McCarthy era , and as Director of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton .
Amongst them a clear winner emerged : Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin ’s American Prometheus : the Triumph and tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer , 25 years in the making and with the paperback version weighing in at 1lb 14oz .
Marvellously researched and beautifully written , it likely will remain the definitive biography .
Abraham Pais , who , with the help of Robert P. Crease , wrote J. Robert Oppenheimer : A Life , was a theoretical physicist who was Oppenheimer ’s friend and colleague at the Princeton Institute .
One of his aims was to write of ‘ his major role as teacher of quantum field theory [… ] as well as his own scientific contributions , many of them brilliant . ’
In this Pais succeeded , especially in respect to the many physics publications Oppenheimer produced during his pre-Los Alamos period at Caltech and Berkeley .
As a biography ( note the title ) , however , it falls far short of the mark with Oppenheimer ’s early life described in a cursory way .
On specific aspects of Oppenheimer ’s life : Sylvan S. Schweber at the beginning of the decade published In the Shadow of the Bomb : Oppenheimer , Bethe , and the Moral Responsibility of the Scientist , and , more recently , Einstein and Oppenheimer : the meaning of Genius - both comparative studies of the contrasting personalities of two complex people , and therefore rather limited in the light they shine on Oppenheimer .
Now comes Mark Wolverton ’s A Life in Twilight : The Final Years of J. Robert Oppenheimer , which although confined to Oppenheimer ’s last years , covers this period in greater detail than other works and throws an interesting light on his slow and painful return to the public stage .
All these books agree on one thing : Oppenheimer was an enigma .
His complexity was such that he is variously seen as mystical and pragmatic , brilliant and naïve , transparent and opaque , a great leader and a maker of enemies , a security risk and a patriot .
I had intended to write a review essay drawing on all the books mentioned above , but the task proved to be beyond me : the more I read , the more , well , enigmatic Oppenheimer became .
It seemed impossible to do justice to his whole life and works .
I was , though , attracted to Wolverton ’s A Life in Twilight .
Wolverton had the advantage of being able to draw on Bird and Sherwin ’s excellent biography and so knew which gaps to fill .
Taking a fresh look at Oppenheimer ’s life after the removal of his security clearance by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1954 , Wolverton takes us beyond the mistaken image of Oppenheimer as a broken , guilt - ridden man and sees ‘ an example of grace , courage , and basic human dignity in the face of injustice , contempt , and exile . ’
Wolverton writes with an engaging journalistic ease .
Many of the chapters are prefaced by a facsimile of a short FBI document , tellingly revealing the paranoia of J. Edgar Hoover , the agents who kept Oppenheimer under surveillance until his dying day , and of members of the general public .
In early 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed scientific director of the Los Alamos Laboratory , charged with the development of an atomic bomb .
Some thought it a strange choice .
Although Oppenheimer was a brilliant scientist and a leading light in quantum mechanics , he had scant experience of administration .
Now he had to build from scratch a massive organisation of scientists and engineers .
The doubts soon faded .
Thanks to Oppenheimer ’s leadership two types of atomic weapons were developed in a little over two years .
A uranium bomb , Little Boy , exploded over Hiroshima on August 6 1945 ; a plutonium bomb , Fat Man , was dropped on Nagasaki 3 days later .
On August 10 a Japanese conditional surrender reached Washington .
Oppenheimer became headline news .
On August 8 the New York Times quoted a colleague as saying “ Oppie is smart …he is the smartest of the lot in everything ” .
Oppenheimer received the United States Medal for Merit for “ his great scientific experience and ability , his inexhaustible energy , his initiative and resourcefulness , his unswerving devotion to duty . ”
These words were soon to ring dismayingly hollow .
Oppenheimer returned briefly to academic life in California .
When the Atomic Energy Commission was created in late 1946 he accepted a part - time appointment to its General Advisory Committee and soon became its chairman .
Almost simultaneously he was approached by Lewis Strauss , acting as a trustee of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton , to see if he would become the Institute ’s director .
After some delay , which greatly annoyed Strauss , Oppenheimer moved to Princeton in July 1947 .
Strauss was a self - made millionaire and ardent opponent of the New Deal .
During the war he served as a special assistant to the Navy Secretary .
With his far - flung connections he carved out a powerful position in Washington .
And he soon came to despise Oppenheimer .
Inconsistencies in Oppenheimer ’s security record , predating his arrival at Los Alamos , followed him into new appointments .
The AEC , under the McMahon Act , was obliged to carry out strict reviews of all staff .
Oppenheimer ’s thick files were pored over but it was decided after long deliberation that there was nothing new and he was given top clearance .
Oppenheimer emerged from the war a famous man but now problems were accumulating too .
The GAC , for example , favored distribution of isotopes to Europe , and Oppenheimer made a presentation on these lines to the AEC .
Most AEC commissioners favored the measure too , but Strauss vehemently disagreed .
Strauss testified that the export of isotopes might be of military value to recipients .
Oppenheimer dismissed this argument ‘ with a swift rapier thrust ’ , but this , and similar displays of arrogance , ensured that he made very powerful enemies , perhaps unnecessarily .
In September 1949 , the Soviet exploded their atomic bomb .
Strauss instantly called for a crash programme to develop a hydrogen bomb .
Oppenheimer and all other members of the GAC – the most informed and experienced atomic scientists in America – agreed that weapons of mass destruction could not be discussed in a military vacuum ; moral considerations were as relevant as technical ones .
They also argued that that accelerating production of fissionable material for small tactical atomic weapons , combined with a build up of conventional forces , would be a better deterrent against the Soviets .
Early in 1951 Strauss told the AEC chairman that Oppenheimer was sabotaging the hydrogen bomb project and ‘ something must be done . ’
Strauss had been told by J. Edgar Hoover that Klaus Fuchs , a scientist in the British Scientific Mission who had joined Los Alamos in 1944 , had confessed to espionage .
Although Oppenheimer had had no hand in his appointment both Strauss and Hoover believed this nasty revelation demanded renewed scrutiny of Oppenheimer ’s left - wing past .
Oppenheimer believed that matters of nuclear strategy should be publicly debated , Strauss strongly disagreed .
In January 1953 , Strauss was appointed atomic adviser to the incoming president Eisenhower and in July he was elevated to chairman of the AEC .
Strauss obtained White House approval to conduct an administrative review of Oppenheimer ’s security clearance .
Oppenheimer would be offered a choice .
He could quietly leave or he could appeal the suspension of his clearance before a panel to be appointed by Strauss .
When Strauss put this to Oppenheimer he refused to resign .
The AEC ’s inquiry “ in the matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer ” ( the Gray Board ) began on April 12 , 1954 and sittings continued for three weeks , and it is here that the ‘ Twilight Years ’ of Wolverton ’s book kicks in .
The proceedings , which were later published , are long and complicated and it is not possible to go into detail here .
Wolverton summarises the manner of the inquisition :
For three weeks …every detail of Oppenheimer ’s life , both public and personal would be subjected to the most painful scrutiny .
Oppenheimer himself would spend hours in a witness chair grilled as ruthlessly as a murder suspect , despite the insistence of the hearing ’s chairman that process was “ an inquiry , and not in the nature of a trial ” .
The chairman was right .
In a trial Oppenheimer would have been allowed to examine and question the evidence and witnesses against him .
Instead , during the hearings , “ Oppenheimer and his attorneys were deprived of vital documents freely available to the other side , denied the names of hostile witnesses , and forced to refute anonymous and hearsay evidence .
In the name of national security , the internationally renowned and respected Oppenheimer was deprived of the basic rights enjoyed by the lowliest criminal in open court .
According to one witness , former AEC director David Lilienthal , “ There had n’t been a proceeding like this since the Spanish Inquisition . ”
Two members of the Board voted against clearing Oppenheimer , one voted in favour .
When the report went to the AEC commissioners the majority decided against Oppenheimer .
Oppenheimer would never again serve the United States in any official capacity .
One solace for Oppenheimer was that the Institute for Advanced Studies kept him as director .
It provided a refuge where he could feel secure , and was still free to do science .
Still , his life after the hearing was one of ups and downs .
He had been invited by the physics department of the University of Washington to deliver physics lectures .
Those plans were cancelled by the university president on the grounds that the visit ‘ would not be in the best interest of the university . ’
An uproar followed both within the university and the wider scientific community .
But the protests petered out largely because Oppenheimer refused to be drawn into it .
The Oregon State Board of Higher Education sponsored lectures by Oppenheimer .
They were enthusiastically received throughout the state ; at Oregon State University the talks had to be moved from the home economics auditorium to the university ’s coliseum .
The audiences were captivated .
There was strong , orchestrated opposition however when he was invited to serve as guest lecturer at Harvard – a prestigious appointment – but the Board of Overseers held firm and the series of lectures went ahead and were well received .
And then , Wolverton writes , ‘a 187 - pound metal sphere came hurtling out of the steppes of Kazakhstan to change everything . ’
Everyone knew that the United States would launch the first satellite , and believed it until the Soviet Union launched Sputnik into space on October 4 1957 .
It was a nasty shock to American self - confidence .
“ It is time to ask ourselves whether preoccupation with our ‘ scientific secrets ’ instead of science itself has not resulted in impairing the real sources of our strength and loss of supremacy we once could claim , ” declared The Washington Post .
“ We have driven out of our laboratories a great many pre-eminent men of science ; J Robert Oppenheimer and Edward U. Condon among them . ”
The point was driven home when at the beginning of November the Soviets launched a much bigger craft with a dog on board .
Calls for action from newspapers was one thing , criticism from a former Air Force assistant secretary of that same administration was another .
He told reporters that the White House should consider bringing Oppenheimer back into the fold .
Imperturbable as ever Oppenheimer played it cool .
Strauss continued to oppose him but in mid-1958 Strauss retired from the AEC and his successor had the files re-examined .
He realised that what supporters of Oppenheimer had claimed was true .
But the AEC could not act on its own initiative ; Oppenheimer would have to request a new hearing .
Oppenheimer , however , had no wish to go through that wringer again .
Strauss himself was in trouble ; he had made many enemies and in a manner of the downfall he had engineered for Oppenheimer , he was about to face a public and humiliating reckoning .
John F. Kennedy became the thirty - fifth president of the United States on January 20 , 1961 .
Although there were now many Oppenheimer supporters in high places .
A small gesture was made by inviting Oppenheimer to one of the distinguished guests at a White House gala state dinner and reception for American Nobel Prize winners .
It was sure sign that in Washington he was no longer persona non grata .
Oppenheimer was nominated for the prestigious Enrico Fermi Award presented annually to an individual who had made noteworthy contributions to nuclear physics or otherwise benefited humankind through the development and promotion of atomic science and technology .
Recipients had to be formally nominated by the GAC and the White House quietly told the CAC that the award would meet with no resistance .
The GAC unanimously nominated Oppenheimer .
The award was to be presented by Kennedy on December 2 .
On November 22 Kennedy was assassinated .
President Lyndon Johnson announced that he would be giving Oppenheimer the award on December 2 as planned .
Standing next to the tall LBJ Oppenheimer appeared to look frail , small and humble .
Oppenheimer concluded his short speech by saying “ I think it is just possible , Mr President , that it has taken some charity and some courage for you to make this award today .
That would seem to be a good augury for all our futures . ”
J. Robert Oppenheimer died on February 18 , 1967 .
Porsche's 918 hybrid is an impressive machine that promises superlative performance and a price to match – $ 630,000 .
If it 's built , that is .
Should the car see production , it will cost a cool € 500,000 and just edge out the € 460,000 Carrera GT as the most expensive Porsche ever , Automotive News Europe reports , citing " two people with direct knowledge of the plan . "
Officially , the über - cool supercar car we first saw at the Geneva Motor Show is nothing more than a tantalizing concept .
But Wolfgang Duerheimer , Porsche ’s development chief , said in April that the company would make a decision on producing the car if 1,000 potential customers show an interest in buying one .
So how many hand - raisers have stepped forward ?
More than enough .
Those same two unnamed sources , who spoke to ANE on the down low because the info is confidential , say more than 2,000 people have made " non-binding expressions of interest " in the 918 .
And why would n't they ?
The car promises exceptional performance – along with stellar fuel economy and emissions .
( And too our eye , stunning good looks . )
We say " promises " because these figures are from Porsche and , so far as we know , have n't been independently verified .
But the mid-engined roadster features a 500 - horsepower V8 based upon the 3.4 - liter mill found in the Porsche RS Spyder race cars .
There 's also an electric motor at the front axle and another at the rear ; together they put down 218 horsepower .
The drivetrain can be run in one of four modes .
" Eco " relies entirely on electricity , and the lithium - ion battery ( no size given ) is good for 16 miles .
" Hybrid " uses both gasoline and electric power in varying combinations as conditions warrant .
" Sport " tips the hybrid equation toward serious driving , with most of the power going to the rear wheels .
" Race " throws all efficiency to the wind for all - out performance , with the electric motors providing a " push to pass " feature similar to the kinetic energy recovery systems we saw in Formula 1 .
Porsche says the 918 will do zero to 100 km / hr in less than 3.2 seconds and hit a top speed of 198 mph .
It also claims the car will circle the Nurburgring – the benchmark of performance – in less than 7:30 .
And it 's supposedly good for claimed fuel consumption of 3 liters per 100 kilometers , which works out to 78.4 mpg , and CO2 emissions of just 70 grams per kilometer .
It is n't clear how Porsche arrived at those figures , which are surely experienced only when using the lightest touch on the accelerator and maximum assist from electricity .
Officially , there 's still no word on when , or if Porsche will build the 918 and what it might cost should it see production .
And why , exactly , would Porsche build a hybrid that no more than several hundred people might build ?
( Porsche built fewer than 1,500 Carrera GT supercars . )
Image comes to mind .
Frank Biller , an analyst at Landesbank Baden - Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart , where Porsche is based , told ANE the 918 Spyder cold bolster Porsche 's eco-cred and lure customers to a brand that builds “ Europe 's worst gas guzzlers . ”
Porsche is owned by Volkswagen , which also owns Lamborghini and Bentley , two other brands not exactly known for fuel economy and low emissions .
You also could see some of that technology trickle down to cars mere mortals could afford .

… may be writing about what it is like to be a scientist .
I just finished listening to Alex & Me : How a Scientist and a Parrot Uncovered a Hidden World of Animal Intelligence as a book on tape .
A 10 - year - old girl might hear the story about Irene Pepperberg ’s 30 years with Alex , an African Grey parrot , and think “ I wonder if it would be nice to do important research with a remarkably intelligent and friendly bird . ”
A 20 - year - old woman hearing the story might be more inclined to ask “ Would I like to be divorced , childless , working seven days / week , 12 hours / day , and starting my first ‘ real job ’ at age 40 ? ” or “ Would I like to be in my 50s without a secure income , eating tofu and keeping the winter thermostat at 57 ? ”
Pepperberg is one of the world ’s more successful scientists .
Because scientists and philosophers are so chauvinistic about humans , there was a lot of received wisdom in Academia about what animals could and could not do .
Pepperberg laboriously demonstrated that Alex the parrot was capable of some fairly sophisticated thought and language .
Most of her findings , however , would n’t have been news to a preliterate tribesman living with parrots 4000 years ago .
Pepperberg chronicles her career scrounging for jobs , begging for money ( most often refused ) , and working with colleagues who are unintelligent , dogmatic , petty , and spiteful ( except at the MIT Media Lab , which was the Promised Land for her until they ran out of money ) .
Pepperberg endures the hardships of graduate school in chemistry and the peripatetic life of a young would - be academic .
Right about the age when a New York City employee or Boston bus driver would be contemplating retirement , she finally gets a tenure - track job at the University of Arizona , only to discover that she dislikes her colleagues .
When a grant is denied or a lab runs out of money , Pepperberg is reduced to penury , apparently having no savings .
Her total lifetime earnings are probably less than what a top radiologist would earn in two years .
Perhaps Barack Obama read this book before he recommended science as a career for people other than himself and his family .

Adventuring With A Sub -Optimal Party
Recent events in the Dungeon ’s Master home game have resulted in a sub-optimal adventuring party make - up .
What do I mean by sub-optimal ?
One of the four roles is missing .
In our case we are blindly adventuring without the benefit of a leader to keep us healed and buffed up .
The subject of playing in an unbalanced party is one we have covered before .
However , over the next few weeks we will take a deeper look at what it means to adventure when one of the four roles is missing .
Today our focus is on the absence of the leader .
Some might say that a party without a leader is doomed to a quick death .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
While this type of a party has some serious drawbacks , it ’s nothing that ca n’t be overcome .
What does the Leader offer the party ?
The leader is a buffer and a healer .
Leaders allow healing surges to be expended , with extra healing added in for good measure .
This is accomplished through the leaders healing word ( or equivalent ) .
While some leaders have other powers that allow PCs to expend healing surges if other conditions are met , it is the Healing Word power that defines the leader role as it is a class feature that all leaders share .
What happens after two healing words are expended during combat ?
Within two rounds , if the NPCs are intelligent and focusing their attacks , PCs start dropping .
Without healing support PCs realize their dependence on the party leader as they start making death saves .
How does a party of adventurer ’s survive without a leader ?
Tactical movement and self - healing .
Tactical Movement
4e D&D is a game that emphasis tactical movement .
The addition of forced movement through push , pull and slide is a clear indication of this .
If a party is going to survive without the leader ’s support , mastering the art of tactical movement is a necessity .
Standing still and trading blows with the enemy simply wo n’t do .
During most combat encounters two things happen immediately : 1 ) melee combatants from both sides meet within the first two rounds , and 2 ) ranged combatants hang back firing death into the fray .
The position of combatants usually remains static until it comes time to eliminate the artillery and controllers .
With a leader to provide support through healing this tactic can work , though it ’s far from optimal .
Adventuring without a leader requires that the party use every opportunity that they have to move , constantly keeping their opponents off balance .
Combine this with effective use of a controller ’s abilities ensures that PCs take as little damage as possible .
Powers that allow movement before or after an attack should be at the top of your list , allowing PCs to stay out of melee .
Self - Healing
I ’ve spoken before about Creating A Character That Ca n’t Be Killed , so I wo n’t rehash that argument or build here .
However , if you are adventuring without a leader then you need multiple ways to ensure that you can heal your PC .
Several skill powers that are based on Endurance provide this benefit .
Our article , Brave Warrior Heal Thyself lists items that allow a PC to expend a healing surge .
Among my favourites are the Diamond Cincture and the Ring of Invigoration .
Consumables such as a Woundpatch are a great way to get extra healing out of your surges .
Do n’t overlook the importance of the Toughness and Durable feats .
Every hit point is going to matter and so will every healing surge .
Finally , do n’t forget about your Second Wind .
Too many players I ’ve met are more concerned with dealing out an extra round of damage .
Effective use of your Second Wind can keep your PC in the fight .
In fact , some players running leaders wo n’t offer additional healing until you ’ve expended your Second Wind , as we ’ve previously discussed in I ’m Your Cleric , Not Your Bitch .
Party Make -up
When the leader is absent from the party the best substitute is a highly mobile striker .
The extra damage output that the striker provides compensates for the lack of healing simply because enemies are dying faster .
Because strikers are normally fairly squishy you will want to ensure that all strikers have the ability to get out of sticky situations .
A strong defender , one who is able to take a lot of punishment is also a necessity .
This should be a PC who does n’t mind taking the hits and can ensure that enemies stay close .
In other words a very sticky defender is required .
Controllers should load up on powers that allow them to subject enemies to forced movement and daze .
Do n’t overlook the first level power of Sleep .
Combined with the right implements it can be a game changer .
What experiences have you had in adventuring without one of the four roles ?
Was it a hindrance to the party ?
Do you find the leader is an essential part of your dungeon delving experience ?

Most current notebook nowadays allow user to set hard disk interface either AHCI ( advance ) or IDE ( legacy ) .
There are several reason why we should use AHCI instead of IDE .
One of AHCI advantage is NCQ ( Hot swappable seem not so relevan to notebook aight ) .
The Advanced Host Controller Interface ( AHCI ) is a hardware mechanism that allows software to communicate with Serial ATA ( SATA ) devices such as host bus adapters which are designed to offer features not offered by Parallel ATA ( PATA ) controllers besides higher speeds , such as hot - plugging and native command queuing .
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHCI
AHCI stands for Advanced Host Controller Interface .
One of the main reasons for switching to AHCI - mode is to take advantage of the NCQ - Feature of your SATA harddrive .
NCQ ( Native Command Queuing ) allows ATA drives to accept more than one command at a time and dynamically reorder the commands for maximum efficiency .
NCQ , when used in conjunction with a hard drive that supports NCQ , can increase storage performance on random workloads .

Native Command Queuing
Native Command Queuing ( NCQ ) is a technology designed to increase performance of SATA hard disks under certain situations by allowing the individual hard disk to internally optimize the order in which received read and write commands are executed .
This can reduce the amount of unnecessary going back - and - forth on the drive ’s heads , resulting in increased performance ( and slightly decreased wear of the drive ) for workloads where multiple simultaneous read / write requests are outstanding , most often occurring in server - type applications .
However , the current technology actually slows down HD access in certain applications , like games and sequential reads & writes , because of the added latency induced by NCQ logic .

AHCI is fully supported in Microsoft Windows Vista and the Linux operating system from kernel 2.6.19 .
Older operating systems like Windows XP require drivers written by the host bus adapter vendor in order to support AHCI .
Windows XP requires the installation of a vendor - specific driver even if AHCI is present on the host bus adapter because Windows XP was released before Serial ATA was invented .
So , how to enable AHCI if you already install Windows Vista using IDE interface .
Solution …
1. Exit all Windows - based programs .
2 . Click Start , type regedit in the Start Search box , and then press ENTER .
3 . If you receive the User Account Control dialog box , click Continue .
4 . Locate and then click the following registry subkey : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Msahci
5 . In the right pane , right - click Start in the Name column , and then click Modify .
6 . In the Value data box , type 0 , and then click OK .
7 . On the File menu , click Exit to close Registry Editor
Reboot your notebook , enter bios ( F2 , del etc ) , change your hard disk interface to AHCI .

With Chuck season 3 now part of the archives , we decided to take the pulse of the fandom and see where we stand now compared to when we surveyed fans a few weeks before season 3 premiered .
General Overview
2574 people took the survey , compared to 1507 in November 2009 .
This reflects that Chuck was on more people ’s minds , having just concluded its third season .
However , it is a slightly smaller percentage – 1 % vs. 1.7 % – of the average number visitors to ChuckTV.net during season 3 , which was about 250,000 / mo .
Of those 2574 people , 63.9 % were male and 36.1 % were female , virtually identical to the demographic makeup of November ’s respondents .
This correlates with NBC ’s analysis the Chuck skews more male than female .
The age breakdown is also very similar , although the 18 - 24 group saw some growth this time around .
For the 2.0 version of the survey , 35.5 % of respondents are 18 - 24 ( compared to 31 % in November ) , 17.2 % are 25 - 30 , and 13.9 % are under 18 .
That means 66.6 % of survey respondents are age 30 or under .
The rest of the breakdown is as follows : 9 % are 31 - 35 ; 7.8 % are 36.40 ; 6.7 % are 41 - 45 ; 5 % are 51 - 60 ; 3.8 % are 46 - 50 ; and .06 % are 61 - 70 .
No one over 71 responded to the survey .
We again note that because this is an online survey , on a fansite , the odds of reaching older viewers is much lower than reaching younger .
Not every person answered every question , but the bulk of respondents did complete the survey .
In the case of Question 5 , respondents only saw that question if they answered â€ œYesâ€ on Question 4 .
Each question was restricted to one answer per respondent .
Note : screencaps will not be posted this time .
We quickly hit the limit of respondents allowed on our free PollDaddy account , so within the first 24 hours we changed to a paid account with SurveyMonkey .
Although the percentage breakdowns between the two were very similar , we wanted to be sure to include ALL responses , so we manually combined the results and calculated new percentages .
Scans of our math , showing our work , may be posted later , but in the interest of time , are not currently available .
Question 1 : Which element of Chuck is the main reason you watch ?
Debates raged during season 3 , and before , about which element of Chuck was most important to fans .
Question 1 of our survey forces fans to choose only one element as the main reason they watch the show .
Last November this question was easily won by the Chuck / Sarah relationship with 41 % of respondents naming that the most important element to them .
Not this time .
Questioning fans post - season 3 revealed that 36.6 % see Team Bartowski as the most important element , closely followed by the Chuck / Sarah relationship with 35.8 % of the vote .
Meanwhile , The Comedy garnered just 11 % and The Hero ’s Journey fell to 8.5 % .
Both of these categories had 15 % of the vote last time .
Least important with a single vote ?
Ellie and Awesome .
Question 2 : Rank the various elements of Chuck by MOST favorite to LEAST favorite .
The tough questions continued as we forced fans to rank the elements .
This time we were able to restrict answers so only one could be ranked at 10 ( MOST favorite ) , one at 9 , etc .
We saw some surprises in light of the answers to Question 1 , but even more interesting is the difference in ranking compared to November .
39 % of respondents ranked the Chuck / Sarah relationship as their favorite , giving it a 10 on the scale .
Compare that to only 35.8 % saying it ’s the main reason they watch .
Meanwhile , 4 % said that it was their least favorite part of the show .
In second place was Team Bartowski with 35 % of fans marking it their favorite element and 2 % saying it was their least favorite .
By contrast , in November 54 % said the Chuck / Sarah relationship was their favorite part of the show and 37 % gave the honor to Team Bartowski .
With the software forcing people to choose , we do seem to get a clearer picture of which elements are most important , correlating with the results from Question 1 , although flip - flopped .
The Comedy ( 13.8 % ) and The Hero ’s Journey ( 11 % ) were third and fourth runners up for most favorite element in the show .
Ranked lowest on the scale were Ellie and Awesome with 42.6 % giving their relationship a 1 on the scale and The Buy More with 25 % saying it was their least favorite element .
Question 3 : Rank these season 3 developments in order of MOST favorite to LEAST favorite .
A new question for this survey asked fans which developments in season 3 worked for them .
Surprising no one , Chuck and Sarah officially becoming a couple ran away with the category as 59.6 % of respondents ranked it most favorite .
Coming in a distant second , Morgan finding out Chuck ’s secret garnered 13.8 % of the top vote .
Tied for third place with 11 % of the vote each were Chuck becoming a full - fledged spy and Orion leading Chuck to the vault full of intel .
Least favorite developments were Orion ’s death , with 38.7 % of respondents giving that development a 1 , and the Buy More exploding which earned 22 % of the least favorite votes .
Question 4 : Do you feel strongly enough about any element of Chuck to STOP watching if the storyline does n’t go the way you want ?
Initially created to examine the early response to rumored storylines before season 3 premiered , in light of some polarizing moments over the last couple of months , we were pleased with our foresight in including this question .
The results have changed a little since November : 86.5 % answered no this time , compared to 82 % then .
Which means only 13.5 % answered yes , compared to 18 % then .
A result of the means justfying the end ?
Question 5 : If you answered yes to question 4 , which element ?
Only those respondents who answered yes to Question 4 saw this query .
Of those 13.5 % , 72.4 % noted the Chuck / Sarah relationship as the element that would cause them to quit watching the show if it doesnâ€™t go the way they want .
That ’s a significant drop compared to the 86 % who cited that element in November .
9 % said they ’d stop watching over Team Bartowski , and 5.3 % cited The Comedy as the element they feel most strongly about .
Both of those elements saw percentage increases over November .
Question 6 : How do you feel about spoilers ?
Although we post some spoilers here at ChuckTV.net , we know not all fans want to have information ahead of time .
This season we received a few emails from fans wondering why people wanted spoilers at all , and Zachary Levi posited the same question at WonderCon .
At the same time , there are those who are constantly asking if anyone has information about this storyline or that plot point .
So how do Chuck fans feel about spoilers ?
49.9 % say the love spoilers and 31 % say that while they do n’t seek them out , they do read them .
That ’s a whopping 80.9 % of Chuck fans who are into being spoiled .
Not everyone likes them , though .
16.5 % said they hate spoilers while 2.3 % said they do n’t trust them .
Conclusion
What can we learn from these numbers ?
Online Chuck fandom , at least , skews young and male .
This season Team Bartowski rose in importance to equal the Chuck / Sarah relationship .
Although we wonder how the results would have differed had we surveyed fans at mid-season , we suspect that this balance of what ’s deemed important has to do with how the season ended .
Chuck fans are slightly less ready to throw in the towel if a specific storyline does n’t go the way they wish , but there is a little more concern about the status of Team Bartowski and The Comedy than there was previously .
This survey was conducted by ChuckTV.net and measured opinions of fans who visit our site .
It was not endorsed , sponsored , or affiliated with NBC , College Hill , Wonderland Sound and Vision , or anyone associated with Chuck .
The head of BP is facing more criticism , this time for taking time off from the oil spill recovery effort in the Gulf of Mexico to attend a yacht race in England on Saturday .
Tony Hayward was watching his 16 - metre yacht Bob compete in the annual J.P. Morgan Asset Management Round the Island Race around the Isle of Wight , one of the world 's largest races .
The yacht finished fourth in its group .
It was not clear whether Hayward actually took part in the race or attended as a spectator .
U.S. President Barack Obama 's chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel told ABC's
This Week in an interview that this was just another in a " long line of PR gaffes . "
He also mocked Hayward , who had previously said he wished the crisis would end because he wanted his " life back . "
" He 's got his life back , as he would say , " Emanuel said , referring to his yachting venture .
In an interview with Fox News , Alabama Republican Senator Richard Shelby referred to Hayward 's decision to attend the yacht race as " the height of arrogance . "
" I 'm glad Mr. Hayward is on a yacht , because he certainly has n't been helping us , " said Robert Craft , the mayor of Gulf Shores , Ala .
" Man , that ai n't right .
None of us can even go out fishing , and he's at the yacht races , " said Bobby Pitre , 33 , who runs a tattoo shop in Larose , La . " I wish we could get a day off from the oil , too . "
Hayward 's attendance at the yachting race was a hot topic on social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook , with many voicing their anger .
But some were also upset that Obama and Vice - President Joe Biden enjoyed a round of golf on Saturday , something they 've done on other weekends since the spill .
But a spokesperson for BP defended Hayward , saying it's his first break since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and setting off the undersea gusher .
" He 's spending a few hours with his family at a weekend , " Robert Wine said Saturday .
" I 'm sure that everyone would understand that . "
Hayward had already angered many in the U.S. when he was quoted in the Times of London as suggesting that Americans were particularly likely to file bogus claims for compensation from the spill .
There was some confusion on Friday as to whether Hayward remained in charge of the company 's response to the spill .
Company chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg told Sky News in an interview that Hayward 's remarks upset people and suggested he was handing over the spill response to the company 's managing director .
But the company later clarified that Hayward continues to lead the response to the oil spill .
If you do n’t know Reddit , you have been missing out on one of the best websites online .
Something of a Digg clone , Reddit has vital communities around nearly every topic you can imagine .
If you love something niche , you have friends at Reddit .
Though the website is big , and was bought up by Conde Nast , it has never received much respect in the technology world ; it was always smaller and later than its predecessor , Digg .
If you looked up Reddit ’s traffic numbers on any of the popular services for such things , you might write Reddit off as a tadpole you can ignore .
According to Compete , Alexa , and Quantcast , Reddit just is n’t very big .
According to Reddit , Reddit is big .
Well , at least according to their Google Analytics data .
Reddit has posted their information in wide ranging company blog entry on just how many people love the site .
Take a look :
Impressive stuff , right ?
This is what Reddit had to say on the numbers :
More than 8,000,000 unique visitors in the last 30 days and 400,000,000 pageviews .
This is a typical month for us .
In fact , our numbers would have been even higher if not for some site issues at the end of June .
However , if you were to check with the big three , Compete , Alexa , and Quantcast , you would get a very different , and odd picture .
Just look at this :
Now , just how much trust are you going to put into those services now ?
I thought as much .
The reason that this discrepancy matters is that advertisers trust these 3rd party numbers as impartial , and thus a fair indicator of how much they can and will pay for ad space .
Reddit , in a move to get more respect , is looking to set the record straight .
The bottom line is this : 3rd party analytics services that work on guesstimates are useful for broad comparison only , not hard figures .
Reddit just proved it yet again .

- Howard HallCollege students who hit campus after 2000 have empathy levels that are 40 % lower than those who came before them , according to a stunning new meta- analysis presented to at the annual meeting of the Association for Psychological Science by University of Michigan researchers .
It includes data from over 14,000 students .
Although we argue inthat modern child - rearing practices are putting empathy at risk , this is the largest study presented so far to quantify the decline .
Previous research done by psychologist Jean Twenge had measured what she labeled a " narcissism epidemic , " with more students showing selfish qualities and with increases in traits that can lead to a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder .
That is a condition in which people are so self - involved that other people are no more than objects to reflect their glory .
But I was less than convinced by that data because some of the measures of narcissism -- statements likemight reflect a lifetime spent in classrooms aimed at raising self - esteem rather than a true increase in self - centeredness .
The survey on empathy used in this study -- which you can take for yourself : HERE however , is another matter .
While it so obviously measures empathy that you could easily game it to make yourself look kinder and nicer , the fact that today 's college students do n't even feel compelled to do that suggests that the study is measuring something real .
If young people do n't even care about seeming uncaring , something is seriously wrong .
Another survey in the research found that people also think that others around them are less compassionate .
Why might today 's students be less empathetic than their elders ?
One of the culprits we identify inis the way that they spent most of their time early in life .
Today 's kids play outdoors much less , and they spend far less time in unstructured activity with others than prior generations .
Without unstructured free time with playmates , children simply do n't get to know each other very well .
And you can't learn to connect and care if you do n't practice these things .
Free play declined by at least a third between 1981 and 2003 , right when the kids who hit college in 2000 and later were growing up .
Worse , much of the time that used to be spent playing outdoors is now spent in front of screens .
Television , obviously cannot teach empathy .
Even nonviolent kids ' TV , research finds , is filled with indirect aggression and linked to increased real - world bullying .
Though social media is an improvement on passive TV viewing and can sometimes aid real friendships , it is still less rich than face to face interaction .
This is especially important for the youngest children whose brains are absorbing social information that will shape the way they connect for the rest of their lives .
Another factor is theand its pernicious notion that Today 's kids grew up with parents who were taught by therapists and self help groups attended by millions that caring too much for other people or having your happiness tied to theirs wasand that people should be able to be happy on their own , needing no one .
In reality , we need each other to be both mentally and physically healthy .
Solitary confinement , in fact , is one of the most stressful experiences someone can undergo : this would n't be true if most people were happy without social contact .
Normal people kept in complete isolation can become psychotic in as little as a few days .
Further , unless you have been loved well from infancy , loving others is difficult -- children who are resilient to early trauma are those who find others to care for them to make up for abusive or neglectful caregivers .
If the only love they get is from a therapist or teacher who tells them to love themselves before trying to make other connections , they are extremely unlikely to recover .
Perhaps an even larger factor is the merging of the left ' sindividualism with the right 's glorification of brutal competition and unfettered markets .
You wind up with a society that teaches kids thatand that helping others is for suckers .
A country where the mystical new ageis that the rich deserve their wealth and got it by being positive and good -- while the poor , too , get what 's coming to them because they did n't try hard enough .
At the same time , deregulation and reduced taxes on the wealthy from Reagan onwards produced massive growth in economic inequality , which is probably also a critical part of empathy 's decline .
Empathy requires an ability to understand others -- it 's easiest to do this when you spend time them regularly and know how to read them .
Economic inequality , however , by radically separating the rich from the poor and shrinking the middle class , literally physically isolates us from each other and provides few opportunities for connection or understanding .
If you spend your time in limos and gated communities and first class , you are n't likely ever to meet poor people who are n't there to serve you ; outside that context , you wo n't know how to relate to them .
And then , if you know nothing about someone 's real situation , it 's easy to caricature it as being defined by bad choices and laziness , rather than understand the constraints and limits the economy itself imposes .
Seeing yourself doing so well and others doing poorly tends to bolster ideas thatsimply because guilt otherwise becomes uncomfortable , even unbearable .
In reality , self esteem does n't come from thinking positive or telling yourself that you are special or worthy , though telling kids they are rotten and selfish can surely destroy it .
And , sadly , you can be optimistic all you like in an economy with 20 % unemployment and still not get a job through no fault of your own .
So what can be done about what President Obama as a candidate presciently labeled the The key thing is to recognize the value of relationships and the fact that we are not independent but interdependent .
We all need each other .
We 're actually both happier and healthier if we 're kind .
Countries with high economic inequality tend to have high crime , high corruption , low levels of trust , high infant mortality and lowered life expectancy -- as well as difficulty growing their economies .
In contrast , those with lower inequality have higher happiness , greater health , lower crime , better growth and longer life .
And so , if , say , health care for all or better unemployment benefits or higher quality schools means that those lucky enough to have well - paying jobs have to pay higher taxes , well , is that really so terrible ?
If we continue to believe that it is , if we continue to split intothe empathy decline will undoubtedly continue and we will face a meaner , nastier world in which ideas about humans being selfish and competitive rather than caring become a self fulfilling prophecy by crushing the tendency toward kindness with which we are all born .

Upcoming : Secession Week Blogging 2010 !
There are 203 sovereign states worldwide , 797 short of the 1,000 we would like to see bloom .
And revolution does n’t add up–replacing one government with another keeps us at 203 .
Which brings us to that holy beast of liberty , July 4th 1776 .
Last year we inaugurated Secession Week , our attempt to reframe American independence as an act of secession , not revolution .
( Because on that day , there was one more country than on the previous day , right ? )
Well , here we come again !
Starting on June 28th , Let a Thousand Nations Bloom will commemorate this glorious Secesh with a blogging marathon .
Each day of that week we will elaborate on different secession - related themes .
We ’ll also post any links and related articles , and we ’re hoping to have some guest authors along the way .
We ’re using new themes this year to keep the event fresh and original :
We also invite you to post on your blog , spread the word , or , heck , email us your own scintillating philippic .
Link to us , tweet us , facebook us , suggest potential contributors , pick sides like fanatics , and argue like philosophers – It ’s all good !
You may also be interested in last year ’s event , which had these themes :
Be objective .
That ’s the credo my newsroom presented to me , the young cub , four decades ago .
But it did not require much time for me to realize that objectivity was merely an ideal , a sales pitch that proclaimed “ we are professional and unbiased ; thus believe us . ”
As the Grey Lady claims , it does its job “ without fear or favor ” : no bias affects the content of stories – or the selection of the stories themselves .
Well , as we see now , that ’s bullshit .
Journalism is entirely a subjective enterprise .
Editors assign stories .
Reporters select sources .
Reporters select the questions for the sources .
Reporters decide on the structure of the story : Does one point of view make the lede , or does the other ?
Editors edit the stories .
Changes in structure are made , altering the reporter ’s judgment .
Journalism is judgment , and that involves heavy doses of subjectivity .
Yet I and hundreds of journalism professors continue to stride about our classrooms explaining and demanding objectivity from our students ( who are living online quite subjectively and for the most part not doing it very well ) .
Well , that total obeisance to objectivity ought to end .
We must ask :
Do journalism faculty have a limited view of what journalism is — or how it has mutated in the age of the Internet ?
Yes , I ’ll explain to my students what objective journalism is and how it ’s done .
They need to understand basic fact - finding and neutral presentation .
Employers in any arena of the communication industry demand that capability .
I ca n’t speak for my colleagues , but I ’ll be emphasizing anew to my undergrads other words as well – judgment , balance , fairness , subjectivity and clearly labeled ethical advocacy .
It is now necessary to do so in contexts beyond traditional journalism education .
In 2005 , when Dr. Samuel R. Smith ( aka S&R ’s Dr. Slammy ) was a colleague at my university , he wrote a proposal for a master ’s degree in interpretive journalism .
I pooh - poohed the idea .
Since then , he ’s written extensively at S&R about the need for such training ( see his four - part series beginning here ) .
Now , events of the past half decade suggest it ’s time to trot it out to the test track .
In the past five years , the population of classically trained journalists — primarily those in America ’s daily print newsrooms — has declined from about 53,000 to slightly more than 30,000 .
That ’s my best estimate , working from a variety of sources .
More are tossed onto the streets daily — layoffs , buyouts , and others seeing the light at last and quitting , many for advocacy jobs such as PR and lobbying .
Who or what has replaced them and the product they formerly produced ?
Opinion .
Advocacy .
First , in the legacy news organizations themselves .
Watching CNN , MSNBC or Fox is instructive .
Facts or factoids are cloaked with opinion .
It is less obvious in legacy print dailies , but when a news story in a major metro goes several grafs without a source , then opinion , advocacy or analysis is being presented .
Dr. Smith , in his S&R examination of the historical legacy of objectivity , wrote :
At this point , it ’s hard to see how our official news industry is going to recover the principles and practices that produced so much landmark reporting in the past .
That is , if we ’re going to see a new golden age of reporting , it ’s unlikely to be constructed on the foundations of past successes .
If this is in fact the case , it ’s time we started looking toward the dynamics that are most likely to inform productive journalism in the future , and the sooner the better .
Online , the situation is much worse .
Angry or overly irritated people with little or no training in argumentation offer incredible ( meaning “ not to be believed ” ) analysis — and it ’s re-tweeted and Facebooked as The Truth .
( That well - meaning people , products of the American educational system , do n’t recognize crap when they see it is another issue …)
The sources of information available to most people have increased by several orders of magnitude , primarily through the Internet .
Thousands of news aggregators .
Hundreds of millions of bloggers .
The occasional experiment , funded by foundations or donations , of investigative journalism sites .
Is there any argument that most of these sources are not subjective ?
Most are laced with a point of view , sometimes clearly and compellingly articulated , but more often not .
Advocacy runs rampant in communication these days , especially online .
Frankly , advocacy is too kind a description for much of what we read online .
Invective based on sheer obstinacy , or an inability to recognize the validity of an argument , or that an individual has the right to make an argument with which one disagrees — are principal threadfuckers on blogs .
Even mainstream media have remade themselves into vehicles of advocacy — although they ’d argue that their reporting is now fulfilling the needed function of analysis and interpretation because raw news rippling through the Internet needs someone bright to explain to us heathens what it means .
Back in the day , we ’d place “ analysis ” or “ commentary ” tags on stories like that .
But do you see many of those these days ?
Unprincipled advocacy , too , runs rampant on the Internet — and in other forms of media as well .
CNN , CNBC , MSNBC and Fox News have their own issues with unbridled advocacy .
The networks ?
Well , they ’re just too timid to be unprincipled .
And my definition of “ unprincipled advocacy ” ?
At the insipid end of the scale , consider wording from a variety of commercials : “ It ’s 25 percent less ! ” Than what ?
An unprincipled advocate leaves out information that a fair - minded person needs to consider the veracity of the claim .
Advocacy from someone untrained in the crafting of arguments leaves his or audience in the same bind .
There ’s outright deceit and bribery :
Think modern K Street lobbyist .
Unprincipled advocacy also involves hysteria and bloviating sans substance .
Too much opinion I read both off and online reflects received but untested wisdom accepted blindly by the recipient .
It is difficult , if not impossible , to reason people out of positions they did not reason themselves into .
Dr. Smith ’s argument is persuasive .
A new generation of professionals specifically trained in interpretative skills is sorely needed because cacophony rules discourse .
And he ’s not talking about conducting a lightweight “ write whatever you want ” master ’s degree .
Inspect his proposed curriculum in interpretive journalism .
In the Internet jungle , trained information sheriffs are needed .
Writes Dr. Smith :
The truth is that while reporting might become less “ objective , ” there ’s no reason at all why more “ subjective ” approaches can’t do a good job serving our culture ’s need for dependable information and analysis .
A blogger who has studied the principles of newsgathering , who has taken the time to understand how to vet the claims of scientific and social research , and who has cultivated a clearly stated code of ethics is bound to be of greater value to his or her readers than one who has n’t .
Separating the wheat from the chaff is a product of education in critical thinking .
In his screed about PowerPoint and its erosive influence on critical thinking , Edward Tufte spells out the core goals for education : “ explanation , reasoning , finding things out , questioning , content , evidence , credible authority not patronizing authoritarianism . ”
Much of what Dr. Smith proposes for a course of study in interpretive journalism reflects these goals .
Whether old newsroom hacks like myself like it or not , we are no longer effective gatekeepers because the Internet opened far more gates than we could control .
The information pendulum has swung to advocacy , and it ’s stuck there .
Worse , it has produced a culture in which online readers will avoid a fact they do n’t like for an opinion they agree with — even if the opinion is backed by no facts .
Now , my university should n’t worry : I ’m not going to teach my undergraduates they can write any damn thing they want and expect to get decent grades .
My freshmen and sophomores will get a steady diet of how to construct a clear , coherent , factually correct sentence .
Then a factually sound , neutral news story .
But my juniors and seniors ?
I ’ll be borrowing from Dr. Smith ’s ideas .
I still believe in what Tufte calls “ universal standards of evidence quality . ”
They provided the structure for decades of damned good journalism ( before the corporate business model demolished itself ) .
But the need is growing for a cadre of professionals specifically trained to interpret , advocate and opine .
My former colleagues , still rooted in the newsroom , will argue , “ Hey !
That ’s us ! ”
If that ’s so , why are n’t they doing a better job of it ?
And those millions of bloggers who think they ’re doing it well ?
Think again .
Most are hacks .
Much of Dr. Smith ’s proposed curriculum ( my interpretation of his intent here , not his ) is aimed at individuals who wish to be subjective advocates and want specific skills and ethical approaches with which to work .
Dr. Smith ’s curriculum is not specifically aimed at current or former newsroom inhabitants as a form of “ re-education . ”
Nope .
It ’s useful attitudes , aptitudes , skills and historical perspective that will allow folks who are not trained journalists to make credible , and therefore more influential , arguments .

Tiny houses have never truly gone out of style .
From the very early days of home building , when the construction was done by hand and usually by the people who would be occupying the home , small homes have been built out of necessity .
But today many people continue the trend for the sake of simplicity or the environment .
Living in a minuscule home definitely encourages you to rid your life of all types of clutter and get back to what is really important .
These truly tiny homes – some modern , some classic – exemplify the best of space - saving architecture .
Dorm rooms are how most of us are introduced to small - space living .
This French design is jump - starting that experience for one lucky kid .
The cottage - like structure , built in a back yard , was intended for a teenager who is getting older and growing closer to the day when he will live away from his family .
The tiny home features four levels with smart space - saving features at every turn .
With a lounge , a washroom , a work area and a bedroom , no space is wasted and the teenage occupant can have his own personal , private living area .
Is everything really bigger in Texas ?
Not according to the people behind Tiny Texas Houses .
They believe that there are enough building materials in landfills currently to provide for most , if not all , of the next generation of housing needs .
They build tiny homes from salvaged materials and ship them to customers complete with salvaged fixtures , low - voltage wiring and waste water reclamation systems .
The small houses only go up to 12 ′ X 28′ , so moving into one will require some de-cluttering for the average person .
Some U.S. cities have taken to the small housing lifestyle in a big way .
Seattle , a city known for its sky - high rental prices , recently changed zoning laws to allow small cottages to be built on the same properties as larger , conventional houses .
Denver has a similar plan .
Building a cottage can give homeowners a way to keep family nearby , provide affordable housing in a crowded urban area , and add some regular rental income to their bank accounts – it ’s a win all around .
There are many creative ways for dealing with overcrowded areas , and the Single Hauz concept incorporates two of them : build in otherwise inaccessible places , and build up rather than out .
The design , from Polish firm Front Architects , is rather like a billboard that you can live in .
The tiny home is held aloft by a central pole , allowing it to rise high above the surrounding landscape .
The home is clearly meant for a single person , not a family , and due to its unique orientation it would allow a higher degree of privacy than just about any other home design .
For some people , small - space living is about simplifying all parts of life , including personal relationships .
The Hermit ’s Cabin from Swedish company Arvesund embraces that concept .
The cabin is only big enough for one person and a small handful of furnishings .
It can be placed just about anywhere – from a backyard to a secluded woodlands retreat – and offers the ultimate in simplicity and shutting the rest of the world out .
Adding a guest room to your house can be a lengthy and expensive proposition .
This egg - shaped dwelling from DMVA is a simple ( albeit slightly eccentric ) way to add additional space to an existing house .
It can also be a stand - alone mini-home with the addition of a bathroom and kitchen , though it would almost certainly make the neighbors scratch their heads in confusion to see you lock yourself inside a giant plastic egg every evening .

This marvelous cube is a French design meant to be used as a vacation getaway accommodation .
Believe it or not , the tiny box sleeps a grand total of four people and includes everything you need on your vacation … other than breathing room , of course .
Each cube comes with a skylight dome in the top meant to be used for stargazing .
The Carre D’Etoiles can be rented currently in many locations throughout France , but this design seems perfect for using as a tiny home in some secluded location .
Tiny house living is n’t always about living alone .
The Rolling Huts designed by OSKA Architects are meant to be grouped together in a “ herd ” or community .
They are made of simple , natural materials : cork , plywood , steel .
The emphasis in the design is on nature and making the smallest impact possible .
Large wheels lift the huts up off of the ground , while a spacious exterior deck actually takes up more than half of each hut ’s entire footprint .
Inside , occupants are left with 200 square feet of living space .
Finding space to build anything in the densely populated city of Tokyo , Japan is nearly impossible .
But architect Takafumi Matsunaga managed to do just that .
He found an alley between two existing houses that was no more than 10 feet wide – and built a house on the unlikely site .
The extremely narrow abode is almost tiny enough for occupants to lie down on the floor and touch both walls at once .
The interior is very impressive , managing to look airy and spacious even though it is an absolutely miniature space .
This incredibly small house is only three feet wide at its narrowest point , and was widely believed to be the smallest house in London .
Located near the Marble Arch , the home was actually built to block alleyway access to St. George ’s graveyard , where grave robbers were becoming a nuisance .
The house is now a part of the Tyburn Convent building .
Developer Summary :
Moonbase Alpha is a NASA - funded multiplayer game scenario with 20 minutes of play set on a hypothetical lunar outpost in 3 - D immersive setting .
This is a proof of concept to show NASA content – lunar architecture in this case – and a cutting edge game engine could be combined to produce a fun game and inspire interest in STEM education
What We Think :
NASA and The Army Game Studio partner up with Virtual Heroes , a division of Applied Research Associates to develop an engrossing , really nice looking lunar sim on the Unreal 3 Engine leveraged by Valve ’s Steam network features to include leaderboards and stats and then give it away for free .
If your computer can handle it , we say , Christmas came early .
When The Meteor Hits the Fan …
Moonbase Alpha drops you off at a solar powered research outpost near the moon ’s south pole just as a meteorite slams into the surface nearby causing all kinds of havoc on the power and oxygen supply lines .
You have twenty - five minutes to assess , repair and restore a variety of damaged components before oxygen supplies to your fellow astronauts trapped inside the base are depleted and all is lost .
Multiplayer Moonbase Madness
In the setup stage , you can choose to join a game , or create your own 1 - 2 , 3 - 4 or 5 - 6 player scenario .
We were only able to test the two player mode , but presumably a higher number of participants introduces more damaged components to be managed and repairs orchestrated within the timelock .
Do n’t Get All Hero On Me
I boldly attempted this alone at first , taking four 25 minutes sessions to finally complete the mission successfully .
I quickly realized that having a friend with whom to coordinate the many tasks that need to be completed would have made this a lot simpler , though solid coordination and time management would still be required – two people chasing after the same objectives like five - year - olds all running after the ball in a soccer game would certainly lead to a failure state .
It ’s All In the Details
Moonbase alpha is daunting on the first go – as would be expected with a real moon walk , the pace is dreafully slow , an effect exacerbated by the fact that you have a lot of stuff to sort out and repair in very little time .
What I loved about the sim was the attention to detail – there are no shortcuts from reality as the developers are deliberately paying attention to detail ; for example when you have to replace a terminally damaged coupler , you first have to use a wrench to remove power lines from either side of it , all of which is eating up precious time .
Then you have to put down the wrench .
Then you have to pick up the old coupler and move it , and then pick up the new coupler and put it in place .
Then connect each power line to either side of the coupler and then pick up the damned wrench again so you can secure the hoses on both sides .
This may sound death - defyingly boring , but in fact it just makes the gameplay more strategic as you learn how to optimize and prioritze tasks in order to get the system pumping oxygen at an efficient enough rate so as not to suffocate the expectant astronauts counting on you inside the lunar base .
When repairing things with your trusty welding tool , you have the opportunity to shave off some time by playing a very simple form of minigame that involves tracing solder points – a game that in itself has a timer .
It seems simple enough at first , but with two clocks ticking and the amount of tracing you have to do increasing in both number and complexity , it can be a real buzzkill to trip up .
The sound design is solid , with a pseudo orchestral , ambient score that plays counterpoint to the increasing tension built up by the seemingly implausible number of articles to attend to .
But there is a solution , and you just have to play through a few times to find it , and once it is grasped , the game ’s shortcoming reveals itself : it is just too short .
I suppose it is a testament to the game ’s success when its achilles heel is leaving the player wanting more .
Of course , this is more than made up for by the fact that it is absolutely free .
Moonbase Alpha was sufficiently immersive as to make me daydream about actually being on the moon and how effectively I might be able to keep my friends alive .
It strongly recalled Sam Rockwell in the indie film Moon going slowly insane from ennui only to discover [ spoiler spoiler ] and how I might begin to deteriorate in a similar fashion .
All told , it was a worthwhile trip and , if you indeed have the horsepower , one I recommend you check out .

NCAR scientists and technicians will launch weather balloons at VORTEX2 with their Mobile GPS Advanced Upper - Air Sounding System .
Shown here are ( left to right ) William Brown , Jennifer Standridge , and Tim Lim testing a balloon launch .
If the conditions are just right , any thunderstorm can spawn a tornado in a relative blink of an eye .
A new project that kicks off this weekend aims to capture the mechanics of a storm giving birth to these destructive , swirling storms .
It 's the largest - ever study of tornadoes .
More than 100 researchers involved with the VORTEX2 ( Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment 2 ) project will deploy a flotilla of instruments across the Great Plains over the course of the study , which runs from May 1 to June 15 .
The aim of the study is to chase down tornadoes and surround them with an unprecedented fleet of mobile radars and other cutting - edge tools in order to examine in detail how tornadoes form and the patterns of damage they cause .
" Tornadoes rank among the most destructive weather events on Earth , and it 's imperative that we learn more about how they develop and why some are so powerful and long - lived , " said David Dowell , principal investigator on the project and a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) in Boulder , Colo .
" We 're hoping to improve the lead time and accuracy for tornado warnings .
If we can understand these forces better , that could ultimately save lives . "
Last spring during the first phase of VORTEX2 , researchers made key observations of a tornado in southeast Wyoming that was rated EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita tornado damage scale that goes from 0 ( minor damage ) to 5 ( a storm that will completely destroy a house ) .
They also collected data on several powerful nontornadic storms .
Such information will help researchers distinguish between thunderstorms that produce tornadoes and those that do not .
The longer study period this year ( about two weeks ) should increase the odds of tracking down tornadoes .
The first VORTEX project , conducted in 1994 and 1995 , gathered critical data on supercells , the severe and long - lived thunderstorms that give birth to the most destructive and deadly tornadoes .
VORTEX findings are credited with improving National Weather Service tornado warnings .
Building on that progress , VORTEX2 researchers are using an armada of enhanced mobile radars and other new weather - sensing tools to gather far more detail on the crucial zone within supercells where tornadoes develop .
Rapidly changing contrasts in wind and temperature in this zone , which is only a few miles across , can spawn a tornado within minutes .
However , this happens in only a small fraction of supercell storms , and standard observing networks and radars often fail to capture the atmospheric conditions that lead to a tornado .
To capitalize on the unusual mass of mobile instruments , researchers will also look for opportunities to collect data on other major weather events in the region .
A team of VORTEX2 scientists last year , for example , made unusually detailed observations of squall lines , which can produce damaging hail and lightning , and sometimes tornadoes as well .
" We have a vast collection of tools that can give us unique insights into the atmosphere , " said George Bryan , an NCAR scientist and VORTEX2 principal investigator .
" So we try to get the most out of them that we can . "
The study area spans more than 900 miles ( 1,448 kilometers ) , stretching from West Texas to southwestern Minnesota .
" VORTEX2 is fully nomadic with no home base , " said lead scientist Josh Wurman of the Center for Severe Weather Research ( CSWR ) in Boulder , Colo .
Scientists will roam from state to state in the U.S. Plains following severe weather outbreaks .
" When we get wind of a tornado , " Wurman said , " we spring into action . "
The $ 11.9 million VORTEX2 program is funded primarily by the National Science Foundation , which sponsors NCAR , and by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
Yesterday , we told you about American Apparel 's practice of making hires and promotions based largely on " full body " employee photos .
We now have internal documents and photos detailing the policy — plus , former employees vent on life in AA 's fashion dungeon .
The Employee Photo Guide
Need more details on AA 's practice of vetting job candidates based on photos ?
A former AA manager sent us this nifty how - to guide , posted on the company 's intranet :
Click image to expand
And here 's a " Fair example of how you should shoot photos to the 'work@aa.net ' computer . "
In case you were unclear .
" The New Standard " at American Apparel
One recently departed employee sent us the first four pages of the contract that new AA employees are asked to sign .
It 's more of an indoctrination sheet , with a glowing history of AA and Dov Charney , guidelines for how employees are to apply makeup , cover up piercings and tattoos , and — most importantly — these instructions for how to remain " on brand " in " The New Standard " :
Click image to expand
The Employees Speak
We received quite a few emails from current and former AA employees relating their own experiences with AA 's hiring and firing policies .
Many said that the company 's practice of photographing all job applicants has been going for years .
A sample :
American Apparel is full of it when they tell you that staff photos or " class photos " as they call them , are infrequent .
When I was managing we had to send photos into our store consultant ( a high school dropout ) weekly ...
Not only did they police our clothes but our eyebrows , makeup , nails and hair color .
They also openly mocked employees by posting photos of them online .
Our store consultant also on several occasions told girls to lose weight or told them they were " too top heavy for crop tops " ... They routinely denied applications based on looks or shoes .
One former AA employee decided to try to get her friend a job there as well , and submitted the friend 's photo :
The response from one of Dov 's favored models , who is also a hiring manager , was incredibly rude .
Her response concerning my friend was as follows .
" Her hair is bad , and I think that I can see a nose piercing .
Also , she 's not wearing our best styles .
She will not be considered . "
[ And after the employee asked the manager to reconsider ] : " It 's not a matter of change , its a matter of taste .
We are looking for fashion leaders , not fashion laggers . "
Another former AA manager says that she received the following instructions as to what kind of black girls she should try to hire during the company 's open calls :
" none of the trashy kind that come in , we do n't want that .
we 're not trying to sell our clothes to them .
try to find some of these classy black girls , with nice hair , you know ? " i will remember that forever , especially the " nice hair " part .
he was instructing another manager and i on who to look for during an upcoming open call , and i sat there dumbfounded , listening to him speak while the other manager made " uh huh , got it " sounds on her end of the phone .
the other manager on the call with me later became a district manager , and at one point instructed me to tell two of my employees ( both of whom happened to be black females ) to stop straightening their hair .
i refused to do this , but wondered if the mentality behind her request was related to what dov had said .

CANNABIS CULTURE – An Ontario man was visited at his home by RCMP officers from Canada ’s Integrated National Security Enforcement Teams ( INSETs ) after making a phone call to Canadian Justice Minister Rob Nicholson to voice his concern over the extradition of marijuana activist Marc Emery .
Cst. Andrew Schneppenheim and another officer showed up at the door of 22 - year - old Steve Shakeshaft , a Stoney Creek ( Hamilton ) , Ontario resident , on June 7 , two weeks after he made a telephone call to a number he found online that turned out to be Nicholson ’s home number .
The officers showed up at Shakeshaft ’s house at about 1 pm , and were greeted at the door by his father .
“ My father came to tell me there were a couple RCMP officers at the door , ” Shakeshaft told Cannabis Culture .
“ They said it was concerning phone calls made to the home of the Minister of Justice Rob Nicholson from my phone .
My father still was n’t sure what they were talking about until they mentioned it was related to Marc Emery , at which point he understood that they were here to speak to me . ”
Shakeshaft said the officers were not in uniform , but presented a card with RCMP and INSETs information on it .
“ They told me that the ministers house has been receiving hundreds if not thousands of calls from Vancouver to Halifax and everywhere in between , and apparently some of them were threatening , ” he said .
“ I told them I had nothing to do with any threats , as the only communication I ever had with the minister was the one time he answered my call , asked my name , then claimed I had the wrong number .
They agreed that I had not made any threats or taken part in any illegal activity , told me I was pointed at because of the sheer number of calls I had made , and ‘ warned ’ me that any phone calls made , now that I had been asked to stop , could be considered harassment . ”
Shakeshaft had called Nicholson to voice his support for ‘ Prince of Pot ’ Marc Emery , the cannabis activist and former publisher of Cannabis Culture who was recently extradited to the United States by the Justice Minister to face charges for selling marijuana seeds on the Internet .
[ Click here to find out how to HELP MARC EMERY ]
“ It seems these guys are traveling around talking to ‘ persons of interest ’ and basically trying to intimidate people while supposedly trying to find those who were placing ‘ threatening calls ’ , ” Shakeshaft said .
Supporters of Marc Emery have been ( quite literally ) under attack in recent weeks by police after stepping up the campaign to Free Marc by holding MP office occupations .
Three activists have been arrested , and campaign organizer Jacob Hunter was assaulted by a police officer while attempting to gain entrance to Nicholson ’s Niagara Falls constituency office .
Further inflaming the anger of activists , Marc Emery was put in solitary confinement in a US prison for recording a podcast intended for supporters , and has been there for two weeks .
RCMP spokesperson Sgt. Julie Gagnon told Cannabis Culture the department refuses to comment on activities of INSETs .
“ I would not confirm or deny whether INSETs is checking on anything because INSETs is our Integrated National Security unit , ” Gagnon said .
“ If it concerns someone ’s security , we would not confirm or deny . ”
According to the RCMP ’s website :
The RCMP has refocused its National Security Investigations Sections ( NSIS ) to become Integrated National Security Enforcement Teams ( INSETs ) in major centres throughout the country .
The purpose for this is to increase the capacity for the collection , sharing and analysis of intelligence among partners with respect to individuals and entities that are a threat to national security and ; create an enhanced investigative capacity to bring such individuals and entities to justice ; and enhance partner agencies collective ability to combat national security threats and meet all specific mandate responsibilities , consistent with the laws of Canada and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
INSETs is the department who takes care of incidents of so - called ‘ Canadian terrorism ’ , including the recent embarrassing screw - up over an Ontario man who bought a bunch of fertilizer and was under suspicion of being a terrorist bomber .
He tuned out to be a gardener .
Shakeshaft said the visit came weeks after he made his original call .
The officers were polite , but took his information .
“ I told them I had n’t made a single call to his home for at least two weeks and had no plans on any in the future , ” he said .
“ They advised me to direct my opinions into the appropriate channels , which of course I have been doing , and took my name , date of birth , and address into their ‘ report ’ and told me I would n’t be charged . ”
The visit to Shakeshaft ’s residence is the latest in a series of government actions against perceived dissenters in the Free Marc campaign and others groups .
In May , five activists involved with planning upcoming G20 protests were visited at home or work by CSIS agents in Toronto .
Now , even though I wrote a book on former child stars , I do n't pretend to know the whole story .
I do n't know what happened to Coleman 's millions .
I do n't know why a joint autobiography written with his parents discussed the night his mother gave birth to him , even though she evidently did n't — he was adopted .
But I know this : Coleman , who died today at age 42 , could n't lose it all if he never had it all .
When he was just 22 months old , it was learned a knotted - up ureter tube had blocked off , and essentially killed his kidneys .
Until the age of 4 , he relieved himself through two holes that doctors cut into his stomach .
For a time , he was equipped with a pouch that the preschool - aged Coleman could manipulate to make it look as though he was peeing just like all the other boys .
When he was 5 , he underwent kidney - transplant surgery .
So , no , Coleman never had it all .
Even when you thought he had it all — when he was the biggest child - star of the late 1970s - early 1980s , when he was the kid who saved the then - struggling NBC , when he was earning as much as $ 3 million a year from Diff 'rent Strokes and his far - flung enterprises — he did n't .
In fact , he only appeared to have it all precisely because he never had it all .
Following the kidney transplant , Coleman was put on a steroid regimen to guard against organ rejection .
The treatment had two side effects :
One , it stunted his growth ; two , it made him the Hollywood ideal — the performer who can play younger , much younger .
That Coleman could sell a punchline made him a talent .
The fact that , as a 10 - year - old , he could sell a punchline looking like a cherubic 8 - year - old made him a phenomenon .
Hollywood has probably never taken more advantage of a disadvantage .
Diff 'rent Strokes curse ?
Child - star curse ?
Coleman was n't one for self - pity or excuses , and he did n't do curses .
" I just happen to be one who has survived , who has survived being chewed upon , " he once told me .
Coleman 's determination was double - edged : Because he perservered , he spent more years as a former child star — as the ultimate former child star — than he did as a child star .
He spent more years living down Arnold Jackson than he spent living it up as him .
One thing Coleman never seemed to spend time on , however , was trying to get back what he once had .
Sure , he 'd appear on your TV show or do your movie if the money was there , but he never seemed desperate , as former child stars can be , for a return to the spotlight .
For a return to the good old days .
Maybe he knew he they were never that good to begin with .

Image caption CCTV captured the men entering the Graff store
Two men dressed in smart suits study the window display of one of London 's foremost jewellery shops .
Wearing disguising make - up , the men walked calmly into Graff jewellery after security guards allowed them through .
But these men were not about to buy .
They were about to carry out the largest jewellery heist in UK history .
Within seconds they had drawn handguns and forced terrified staff to lie on the ground , threatening to shoot anyone who moved .
CCTV footage captured the drama as shop - worker Petra Ehnar was ordered at gunpoint to open a display case .
The robbers grabbed jewels , stuffing them into a bag .
As insurance , Ms Ehnar was forced out of the store at gunpoint .
She later described the robbery as " the most terrifying experience a person can be put through " .
" I was thinking I am going to be shot , killed , " she said .
As far as I was concerned he was n't brought up that way Clinton Mogg Snr , Father of Clinton " Jamal " Mogg High - profile heists
As they escaped one of the robbers shot at a security guard who had ran after them thinking Ms Ehnar was being kidnapped .
Shoppers took cover as the men jumped in a stolen blue BMW car and sped off .
A short distance away it hit a taxi .
But the car sped off before stopping again when more shots were fired at passer - by Robert French who had given chase after seeing the collision .
The bag containing the jewels was handed to a waiting motor cyclist , as the men jumped into a waiting silver Mercedes .
Meanwhile a van and a truck were used to hold up traffic .
Within two minutes on 6 August last year , Aman Kassaye , 25 , and 27 - year - old Craig Calderwood escaped with 43 different rings , bracelets , necklaces and watches with a retail value of more than £ 40 m .
No -one was injured and it seemed an elaborate plan had prevailed .
But it was not long before police began making arrests .
Two days before the raid , the court was told Kassaye hired an unsuspecting professional make - up artist to make him and Craig Calderwood look older to disguise their appearance .
Later that day , they were seen on CCTV gazing into a window of Graff .
The make - up artist , Jessica Goodall , contacted police when she saw the CCTV pictures on TV .
DNA was later found on make - up equipment and she picked them out at an ID parade .
Image caption A pair of white diamond earrings that were stolen in the raid
In the subsequent trial at Woolwich Crown Court , Graff security guard Eitan Azulay , who was shot at , said he became suspicious because he thought one man was wearing make - up .
He radioed his colleague saying " something stinks here " , moments before the guns were pulled .
Police recovered the BMW getaway car and , crucially , a mobile phone , purchased the day before the robbery , was found inside along with a sawn - off shotgun .
Then they began tracing suspects through phone records .
Mr Calderwood was arrested at Soho's Freedom Bar , which he frequented , after people there became suspicious when he changed his appearance .
In a letter found in his prison cell and read out in court by prosecutor Philip Bennetts , he admitted his involvement in the robbery .
" I 'm truly sorry for the crime I committed , " it read .
But he said he wrote the letter while he was depressed and in evidence he said his involvement in the raid was under duress for fear of his life .
The jury could not reach a verdict on Mr Calderwood .
Kassaye only admitted he had a " resemblance " to one of the gunmen .
In his defence , Courtenay Griffiths QC , claimed the raid had been an inside job .
But there was no evidence for this and a string of witnesses dismissed it .
Kassaye was found guilty of robbery , kidnap and possession of a firearm .
The court was told the " high - stakes " heist was a " professional , organised crime " executed with military precision and well - funded .
But Kassaye , of Battersea Park Road , London - a small - time drug dealer - and his conspirators were foot soldiers , not the brains behind it .
Ian Bourne QC , defending Calderwood , said : " Those at the top , and those who are in control of what is going on ... are seldom seen and are never caught . "
Maybe we 've got to the stage where big pieces of jewellery can only be sold privately Robert Read , Jewellery expert
Clinton " Jamal " Mogg , from Bournemouth , Dorset , was a conspirator in the robbery .
The 42 - year - old 's father , Clinton Mogg Senior , told BBC News of his " shock " at his son 's involvement .
" As far as I was concerned he was n't brought up that way so there 's no need , as far as I know , to go the short way about getting anything . "
But what of the jewellery taken ?
None of it has been traced and a £ 1 m reward from Graff 's insurers remains for its recovery .
Robert Read , a jewellery and art expert at insurance underwriters Hiscox , said the chances of finding it are " small " .
" Never say never , but the likelihood is the main items have been cut and each week that goes by the jewellery is spreading out into the underworld before it 's reintroduced to the open market , " he said .
" Big diamonds can be recut , repolished and there 's no way you can trace that . "
Mr Read said this was one of the largest ever heists in Europe .
" It does seem now the big jewellers , not just in the UK but in Europe , are being targeted , " he added .
" The dilemma for the jeweller is he's in the business of selling .
" Maybe we 've got to the stage where big pieces of jewellery can only be sold privately . "
Two other men were found guilty of conspiracy to rob .
They were Solomon Beyene , 25 , of Lilestone Street , London ; and Thomas Thomas , 45 , of Durham Road , East Finchley , London .
Courtney Lawrence , 31 , of Ladbroke Grove , London , and David Joseph , 23 , of Flaxman Road , London , were both cleared of the same charge .

Tank crews have provided a significant number of casualties
One of the major military surprises of the fighting in Lebanon has been the apparent vulnerability of Israeli armour to Hezbollah anti-tank rockets .
No detailed figures are available and it is clear that many more tanks may have been hit than actually destroyed .
But a significant proportion of Israeli casualties have been among tank crews .
Hezbollah has also used its anti-armour weapons to bring down buildings around sheltering Israeli troops , again causing multiple casualties .
Hezbollah has fielded some of the most modern Russian - made anti-tank weapons , which the Israelis insist have come via the Syrians .
Wire - guided
The potency of infantry anti-armour weapons is nothing new for the Israelis .
One journalist reported seeing the sophisticated Kornet
In 1973 , after Egyptian forces crossed the Suez Canal , Israel tank units learned the hard way about what Russian - made missiles could do .
The Egyptians put across the canal large numbers of soldiers armed with wire - guided Sagger missiles .
As long as the operator kept the target tank in his sights , signals sent along the unreeling wire would guide the missile to its target .
As counter - attacking Israeli tanks raced towards the canal , they were met by barrages of these missiles .
You can be sure Israeli Defence Forces planners ... will be studying these engagements in detail
Commanders spoke of vehicles emerging from the fighting festooned with wires from the missiles , and many tanks were destroyed .
Since then a complex design battle has been underway between the tank and the infantry anti-armour weapon .
For the foot - soldier the key is penetration but also weight :
What can easily be carried into battle ?
Tandem charge
For the tank , too , there are weight considerations as more and more armour places heavier strains on engines and running gear and also potentially limits the areas in which a tank can operate .
In Lebanon Israel has come up against some of Russia 's most modern anti-tank weapons .
Crew protection was a key element in the Merkava tank 's design
The AT - 13 Metis or Saxhorn is a modern tube - launched successor to the Sagger .
Its tandem - shaped warhead can punch through armour of up to 46 cm ( 18 inches ) thick .
The tandem warhead is designed to counter reactive armour as used on many Israeli vehicles .
Reactive armour is essentially made up of explosive pads or bricks on the outside of the tank which explode outwards when hit by an incoming missile .
This disrupts the effect of the missile warhead , which needs to impact upon the surface of the tank to achieve its penetrative effect .
A twin or tandem charge is designed to get around this .
The first warhead triggers the reactive armour and the second penetrates the tank .
Hezbollah is also reported to have used the RPG - 29 ; a shoulder - fired weapon , again with a tandem charge .
Infantry carriers
And a journalist from the London - based Daily Telegraph newspaper reports also seeing abandoned Kornet missiles in Lebanon .
The Kornet was first shown by the Russians in 1994 and represents state - of - the - art technology .
It has either an optical or a thermal sight - effectively " riding " a laser beam to its target .
It again has a tandem warhead .
It has a range of up to 5 km ( three miles ) and is said to be able to penetrate armour up to 1,200 mm thick .
Hezbollah has fielded some of the most modern weaponry
The Kornet has been exported by the Russians to only a few countries , including Syria .
And all the evidence suggests that the Syrians have passed them on to Hezbollah .
Israel is so concerned that it has despatched a team of officials to Moscow to show the Russians the evidence of what they say can only be Syrian weapons transfers .
In the longer term , the experiences of 1973 played an important part in shaping the philosophy behind Israel 's Merkava battle tank .
The Merkava or Chariot is among the most modern in the world , but its unique feature is the extent to which crew protection figured in its design .
Quite apart from carrying highly sophisticated armour , it is almost unique in having the engine in the front , affording additional protection to its crew .
The need for well - armoured infantry carriers that can keep pace with the tanks has led Israel to convert a large number of older tanks to carry troops .
The Achzarit is a good example .
It is based on the Russian T54 /T55 tank which Israel captured in large numbers during the 1973 war .
Its turret and main gun have been removed and various other changes made to allow it to accommodate a crew of three along with seven infantrymen .
New armour
But all of these enhancements have not proved sufficiently effective against the most modern anti-tank systems operated by determined fighters on the ground .
You can be sure Israeli Defence Forces planners and indeed military observers from around the world will be studying these engagements in detail .
Part of the answer may be to adopt new kinds of armour .
But , as ever , part of the answer will be tactical - changes to the way tanks are employed and the way they operate in concert with other elements of ground - power , like infantry and artillery .
